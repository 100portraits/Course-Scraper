       " 'objectives obtaining knowledge of state of the art of literature on party system change obtaining the ability to critically evaluate empirical research obtaining the ability to conduct research improve writing skills contents modern representative democracies are party democracies. some would go as far as schattschneider (1942) who argued that “political parties created modern democracy and modern democracy is unthinkable save in terms of parties”. yet there are good reasons to think that contemporary party democracy is facing a crisis. over the past two decades parties with governing potential have lost support to populist or extremist parties of the left and right or to protest parties without an ideological profile such as pirate parties or beppe grillo’s movement. we have seen these developments in almost all established democracies except for a country like the us where the electoral system prevents the rise of new parties but where a radical opposition movement organised itself within one of the mainstream parties. other empirically observable indicators of the crisis of electoral democracy are decreasing turnout and low levels of trust in political parties. on top of this we are witnessing an economic crisis which makes is highly unlikely that the mainstream parties will be able to restore citizens’ confidence in their problem solving capacities. for a long time party democracy worked well because in the words of peter mair (2007) it provided the synthesis between popular democracy and constitutional democracy. yet centre parties are facing some fundamental challenges. the first challenge is that their capacity to influence policies have been reduced by the rise of supranational organisations and by the constraints of an increasingly globalised economy. secondly\\\\xa0 processes of individualisation and emancipation of voters have made electorates increasingly volatile and parties more uncertain. third media fragmentation makes communication with voters increasingly difficult. as a consequence of all these developments we may be witnessing a growing gap in modern party democracy between highly responsive outsider parties on the one hand and increasingly unresponsive and responsible parties of government on the other as argued by mair. he suggested that if parties are failing and if modern democracy cannot exist without parties we may soon see the end of democracy as we know it. others are more optimistic. in this seminar we will discuss recent theoretical contributions and empirical studies dealing with various aspects of the functioning of electoral democracy. registration during the registration period: monday 6 october 08:30 and friday 10 october 13:00. you can find this course either by title or by code 7324a126i teaching method student presentations and group discussion contact hours course weekteaching methodhours/weekremarks1 - 8werkcollege4these contact hours are approximate and do not include hours for assignments hours for reading etc. extra classes may be planned in january. please see the course manual (syllabus) on blackboard for more details. time please see  select “add timetable” than “add course timetable” and search for either the course title or the course catalogue number. study materials t.b.a. min/max participants max. 25 students. assessment and testing for students of the master political science: each week: short position\\\\xa0 papers of 500 to 800 words (determines 20% of the grade). final assignment:\\\\xa0 paper for students of the research maser social sciences: each week: short position\\\\xa0 papers of 500 to 800 words (determines 20% of the grade). final assignment:\\\\xa0 research paper including empirical analyses remarks the seminar is open to students of the research master social sciences as well as the master political science. political science students are allowed to write their papers in dutch.',\n",

       " 'objectives within this course a number of fundamental methodological challenges scholars have to deal with in cross-national survey research are discussed including cross-country measurement equivalence influential cases collinearity and adequately executing and interpreting cross-level interactions. by the end of this course students should be able to understand these challenges as well as rigorously test a number of assumptions underlying cross-national survey research. additionally students should be able to communicate the results of these procedures in an academic setting. thereby this course contributes to students’ mastery of relevant research methods and techniques their ability to translate research problems into relevant research designs to adopt a clear position in academic discussions on methodological challenges in cross-national survey research to use relevant computer software and to present their social science research findings– as formulated in the exit qualifications of the rmss. contents within the past decades a large number of cross-national surveys have become available that provide a great resource for scholars interested in cross-national comparisons. these comparisons can advance theory testing in multiple ways by revealing interesting differences between countries political social and media systems and cultures but also by uncovering aspects of a country that would be difficult to detect based on national data exclusively. however cross-national survey research also entails methodological challenges that should be addressed. assumptions underlying cross-national survey research are frequently not rigorously tested and potentially invalidate research findings. for instance do we measure the same latent concepts within all countries? how robust are the research findings? this course provides a broad overview of the methodological challenges scholars have to deal with when conducting cross-national survey research. in particular within this field of research multilevel modeling is often used to test hypotheses on the individual and the country level. due to the relatively small number of countries included in the available international datasets higher-level slope estimates within multilevel modeling (and the substantial conclusions drawn from these estimates) can become unreliable as a result of one or more influential cases (i.e. countries). in addition country characteristics are often strongly correlated which can result in collinearity within multilevel models. this course trains students to critically reflect on the problem of influential cases and collinearity within multilevel modelling to detect these problems and discusses ways to deal with them. further the concept of measurement equivalence across countries is discussed. meaningful comparisons of means or relationships between latent concepts within and across countries require equivalent measurements of these concepts. in this course we look at possible sources of nonequivalence and discuss ways to prevent these. in addition students learn to empirically test for measurement equivalence using mgcfa and learn how to deal with inequivalent measurement models. finally multiplicative interaction models are frequently used within quantitative social science as the relationship between political or social inputs and outcomes is frequently theorized to vary depending on the institutional or cultural context. one of the advantages of multilevel modelling is the possibility to include cross-level interactions to test these kinds of hypotheses. in this course we discuss commonly made mistakes in executing and interpreting cross-level interactions in multilevel modeling. students are trained to translate research problems including cross-level interactions in appropriate research designs and conduct and interpret these appropriately. registration \"students of the english taught masters programmes of

measurement equivalence collinearity cross-level interactions). every lecture is followed by two hours of practice on the assignment under supervision. this course includes five assignments. for the final assignment students choose a scientific study within the academic social sciences literature that includes multilevel modelling and a cross-level interaction (and in which not all tests are already performed). students have to retrieve the relevant dataset themselves and replicate all relevant presented models. subsequently they conduct on this specific study the four tests discussed within the course (i.e. related to influential cases measurement equivalence collinearity cross-level interaction). within a short note students describe the study they choose (content and methods used) and report the results of the performed tests and its implications (format: see: van der meer ea 2009). next to the final assignment four intermediate assignments have to be handed in. each intermediate assignment includes one test on a prescribed study within the social sciences academic literature (see below). after a replication of the model of the relevant study one additional test (e.g. collinearity) is conducted and reported in a short note (format: see: van der meer ea 2009). each assignment should be written individually although discussion and collaboration between students is actively stimulated. the final assignment is written individually and every student has to choose a different study. intermediate assignments should be approximately 4 to 7 pages in length. the final assignment can no longer than 20 pages including all tables and references. time please check the course schedules on  for updated information. assessment and testing your grade will be based on the quality of the five assignments. the four intermediate assignments each count for 10% of the final grade the final assignment counts for the remaining 60% of the final grade. to pass the course the final grade needs to be a 6 or higher. a final grade is only given to students who meet the participation demand. to make the course seminar meetings a success the active participation of students is necessary. students are required to take part in at least 4 of the 5 meetings. foreseeable delays and absence should be motivated and discussed with the lecturer at least 48 hours beforehand. taking part in a meeting implies timely presence good preparation (i.e. reading and evaluating all the literature before class except for the first lecture) and active participation in group discussions. deadline is deadline. assignments that are handed in late will not be graded. the assignments test students’ ability (1) to reflect critically on fundamental challenges scholars have to deal with in cross-national survey research (2) conduct additional tests on the assumptions underlying cross-national survey research (3) communicate the outcomes of these procedures in an academic way. students are allowed to collaborate working on the intermediate assignments but should ultimately defend and write their own solutions individually. the final assignment is individual. every

hammond book dealing with a wealth of neuronal micro circuits that fulfill specific jobs in the brain. the third two weeks you will write 10 more chapters to the hammond book that deal with a new exciting field in neuroscience: optogenetics. the last two weeks are used to discuss the relation between astrocytes and neurons. in detail: week 1-2: intense lectures recapitulating the basic properties of neurons as treated in hammond chapter 1-12 and 2 chapters from hille (receptors channels membrane potentials and neuronal firing). this part is accompanied by a computer practical course that illustrates all the various properties and aspects (neurons in action). this part is evaluated by a written examination week 3-4: lectures by students discussing the other chapters of hammond (13-20) which integrate the knowledge of weeks 1-2 into the functioning of a large variety of neuronal micro circuits that perform a wealth of specific taks in the brain. the lectures you give and the discussion you initiate will be used to evaluate this part of the course. week 5-6: you will write 10 more chapters for the hammond book that deal with optogenetics as part of a collective trial to cover all aspects of this new field. this part is finish by a symposium where all groups present their results. you are evaluated based on your chapter and your presentation. week 7-8 these two weeks are used to evaluate the role of glia in the brain. there are about 10 times more glia cells than neurons in the adult brain and it becomes more and more clear that these cells have much more advanced

it will show you how to interpret the most important literature in this field and how to connect it to your topic of interest; it provides you tools how to collect your data; it will help you to detect a proper method to address your research question(s); and it will show you how to structure and present your research results in a scientifically responsible manner. finally this seminar also provides you with the opportunity to link your master thesis with work you have already done or are currently doing. for instance you might do some work for a voluntary organization; you might have a job at a firm that engages in political activity; you might have some experience in dealing with non-state actors as a member of a political organization; or you have done an internship at an international ngo or igo. this seminar provides you the opportunity to link these experiences to your master thesis. this could help you in your future endeavors. in short this seminar provides you all the options to choose an issue that you find particularly interesting and offers you the tools to study it in a scientifically responsible and appealing manner. recommended prior knowledge the kind of knowledge you are expected to have depends on your specific research interests. if you are not acquainted with the current literature on a specific issue you aim to explore you might be advised to read some additional articles to catch up. registration through sis. registration period:june 16 (08:30) to june 30 (13:00) you can find this course by looking for code 7324a232z (without the y). contact hours course weekteaching methodhours/weekremarks1 - 20werkcollege3these contact hours are approximate and do not include hours for assignments hours for reading etc. extra classes may be planned. please see the course manual (syllabus) on blackboard for more details. time please see  select “add timetable” than “add course timetable” and search for either the course title or the course catalogue number. min/max participants max. 10 students. assessment and testing seminar participation and thesis. please see the thesis manual at:  the final deadline for handing in your thesis is friday 30 january 2015.',\n",

but it was not just the social that would change. at stake was the very definition of life itself. as gibbons and novas have summarized: \"what was significant about this project from the perspective of the social sciences was that the potential to know remake and to create new life forms brought into question long established ideas about what counts as natural\" (2008:3). in other words genetic research would challenge the boundary of nature and culture in a way that would have profound effects on society and social life the very subjects of social scientific research including medical anthropology. at the time it seemed anthropology was waiting for such a concept to help frame research situated at the interstices of science and nature. in the 20 intervening years since the concept was introduced a plethora of studies have taken it up and applied it to examine and theorize the way genetic research has transformed the way humans think about life nature and culture. others have realized the usefulness of the term for framing research beyond the field of genetics examining the way other sciences including biological medical and public health have also contributed to the remaking of culture and society through a wide range of theories about what it means to be human and tools and techniques to facilitate the remaking of identity and sociality. registration \"students of the research master social sciences\\\\xa0can register for this course in sis-uva from 2 december 8:30 to 16 december 2014 13:00. for more information on how to register for courses in sis see  search for your programme go to a-z and click on sis.\" contact hours course weekteaching methodhours/week6 - 17werkcollege36 time for an updated schedule please visit our online time schedules at www.rooster.uva.nl study materials assigned readings will consist of published articles available through the university library key chapters from the collected readings volumes and several book-length ethnographies. where possible hard copies will be made available for students to copy. as it is to be expected that the group will be quite small the litature can be adapted a bit to meet the desires of the students. the litature list of the previous course (2012-13) consisted of: latour bruno (1979) laboratory life. princeton university press.rabinow paul (1999) french dna. chicago. university of chicago press. lock margaret (2001) twice dead: organ transplants and the reinvention of dealth. berkeley: university of california press.petryna adriana (2006) life exposed: biological citizens after chernobyl. princton university press. dumit joseph (2012) drugs for life: how pharmaceutical companies define our health. durham: duke.livingston julie (2012) improvising medicine: an african oncology ward in an emerging cancer epidemic. durham: duke. assessment and testing active participation in classroom discussions including presentations (30%)short assignments (20%)5000 word paper focusing on theoretical concepts relevant to students research. final papers will be due at the conclusion of the course. \"according to the teaching and examination regulations (see\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z click rules and regulations) a student is eligible to a re-sit an exam/paper only if s/he participated in the first examination round. only in case of extenuating circumstances (serious illness or death of a family member sickness) in the period close to the examination (until 10 days before) and provided that the course coordinator was informed beforehand and a written statement of the extenuating circumstances was provided the student is eligible to participate in the second round without having participated in the first round.\" \"after a fail grade in the first round the highest grade awarded in the second round is a 6.0. a student with a pass grade in the first round may opt for a retake/rewrite but for rewritten papers/assignments the highest grade awarded in the second round is one grade point higher than the original one. for further guidelines and specifications regarding re-sits see the rules & guidelines of the examination board at\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z click rules and regulations.\" remarks \"the provisions of the regulations governing fraud and plagiarism for uva students apply in full. access this regulation at\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z and click on plagiarism and fraud - general.\" the course will use blackboard extensively as a channel of communication. in general students are advised to check blackboard on a regular basis for any changes and/or additional references or any other course related matter. blackboard can be entered through the following link:',\n",

what did the student actually learn in terms of knowledge and skills? how did the student perform? the internship report should contain 1500 to 2000 words. it is a separate document from the internship thesis. the deadlines for the thesis as described below also apply to the internship report. please always follow the procedure as described on the internship website. contents the thesis is written within a thesis seminar. the seminar consists of a number of introductory sessions in which the nature of a bachelor thesis is discussed and the various fields within the field of finance are briefly introduced as well as a number of meetings in smaller groups in which students present their progress to fellow students under guidance of a supervisor. as the thesis progresses students will meet their supervisor in individual meetings to come to a final version. registration \"please register in sis for the course bachelors thesis and thesis seminar finance and organization. after successfully completing the internship this registration will be changed to the correct course catalogue number. please go to  teaching method there is no defence of the thesis; the process is finished with handing in the final version. the final version will be made available at uva scripties online. time please go to uva timetable assessment and testing \"the final version of the thesis must be submitted no later than 29 june 2015. if any changes subsequently need to be made then the new version must be handed in no later than 15 july 2015. for information please go to the step-by-step-guide for submitting your bachelors thesis;if the thesis is not submitted before the deadline a nap-result (non-attendance attempt counted) will be registered and the student will be permitted to submit the thesis before 15 july 2015. however students should be aware that if they have missed the first deadline this will have consequences for the final grade of their thesis;if not all conditions of the thesis seminar and the thesis are met then this component must be repeated in its entirety in the next academic year.\" for theses written in semester 1 of the academic year 2014-2015 students have to hand in the thesis by 2 february 2015 at the latest. the supervisor will grade the thesis as it is submitted on that date. if the thesis is not at a passing level meaning it is assigned a grade below 6 the student gets one chance to hand in a revised version (based on the comments of the supervisor). the final date for handing in the revised version is 20 february 2015. remarks \"the bachelors internship thesis can only be written during the thesis seminar and the start and end date are the same. it is not possible to write an internship thesis separate from the seminar and there is no separate internship supervision.\" for more general information on internships please go here. \"more information on the bachelors thesis can be found here.\"',\n",
       " 'objectives at the end of this course students will be able to formulate research questions and to devise experimental ways for answering these in the field of emotions and affective processes (scientific thinking). the emphasis in this advanced course is on the preparation for actually setting up and performing research. contents emotions pervade every aspect of human functioning. empirical evidence shows that emotions modulate processing in such diverse fields as perception attention memory reasoning language and consciousness. all attempts at analysis suggest that the constituent processes are not themselves full emotions but can better be called affective processes. the emphasis in the course lies on those basic affective processes that are shared by all members of the human species. although social constructions undoubtedly form an important part of full emotions they receive little attention in the course. the model by ledoux (1996) provides a useful framework for theorizing about basic affective processes and for applying brain & cognition models to the field of emotions. the emphasis in the course is more on how an affective process is performed than where it is localised in the brain (i.e. more a process than a systems approach). ledoux’ book ‘the emotional brain’ is supplemented by more recent publications that cover many of the different (e.g. evolutionary neural experimental and connectionist) approaches to affective processes. teaching method the format of the course is a weekly workgroup with written tests on the literature to be studied for that meeting and papers read by the participants. the participants also have to prepare discussion points about the literature and make one take-home assignment. each participant is expected to be present and active in every meeting. time www.rooster.uva.nl study materials ledoux j. e.

for example work by michael jensen an economist from harvard business school laid the foundation for stock options to be used as executive compensation tools in the 1980s and 90s. the limited success of stock options to align the interests of shareholders and executives has raised questions of whether effective incentive systems can be designed for bureaucratic agents. whilst lawyers and economists examined governance problems in bureaucracies at the policy level sociologists began to look at implementation by examining how bureaucratic agents met or attempted to meet organizational goals. this led to an exciting body of work that uncovered the extent to which motivation and learning was the result of informal social ties as opposed to hierarchical control. likewise michael lipsky’s seminal work on the ‘street-level bureaucratic’ professionals tasked with implementing organizational objectives demonstrated how individual discretion played an important part in whether and how organizational rules were enforced. work of this nature began to seriously question the implementation capacity exercised in organizations through hierarchical control. alongside emerging analytical criticisms of bureaucracies a second ‘industrial revolution’ was taking place that began to undermine the most important feature of bureaucratic organization namely hierarchical control. underpinning this second ‘revolution’ was the globalization of markets and advances in technology and communications resulting in what ulrich beck referred to as the ‘risk society’. modern economic organization was producing new risks and introducing levels of volatility that could not be controlled through hierarchical organization. the terminus of our journey examines how new forms of organization have responded to the problems created by contemporary political and economic life which bureaucracies were ill-designed to address. programme per week week 1: introduction and context setting week 2: the rise of bureaucracy and bounded rationality week 3: organizational learning and principal-agent governance week 4: implementing principal-agent models and informal organization week 5: flexibility and discretion and challenges to hierarchy week 6: bureaucratic failure and beyond hierarchy? new forms of organization and governance week 7: problems beyond hierarchy and wrap-up contact hours course weekteaching methodhours/week1 - 7hoorcollege4 1 - 7werkgroep6 study materials the reading list can be accessed via blackboard. material that cannot be accessed online will be available for photocopy at the pple office. assessment and testing the course will be examined with two class presentations and feed-back (30%) in-class writing assignments (10%) two short essays (30%) and a final essay examination (30%).',\n",

while the other group criticises the initiative. regardless of the assigned position each group should build its argumentation based on an analysis of the case provided as well as self-collected material such as codes of conduct information about management systems and structures reporting and newspaper articles. the goal is to ‘win’ the debate by getting most of the votes of the rest of the class. students write a position paper in which the main argument in favour of or against the initiative is laid out and apply the insights from the academic articles as support (max. 4 pages). the groups themselves are responsible for making sure that all members give input to the group views and the debate. all students should prepare the case even if they are not part of one of the groups having the debate in the specific week. teaching method 7 lectures of 3.5 hours per week time please go to  study materials course materials include theoretical and empirical articles from academic journals (5 per lecture) lecture slides and course cases (5 in total). course materials are made available via blackboard at  and can be accessed free of charge. as part of the assignments students are supposed to search for additional literature on sustainability and company and industry information. a number of additional resources (further readings magazine articles websites names of books and documentaries) are provided but are not required in preparation for the classes or for the exam. assessment and testing the final grade consists of: an individual written examination (60%): the questions will be a combination of explanations of key terms open questions and essays;

       " 'objectives this course introduces participants to cutting edge academic research on key aspects of political representation. the focus lies on empirical work on the relationship between the public and its representatives (broadly defined) with most readings drawn from the political science and political sociology literature. students will get acquainted with various research designs and approaches to studying the elite-mass link in advanced democracies. the final paper will require students to formulate a relevant research question within the broad theme of the course and undertake original empirical research of their own. contents liberal democracy derives a large part of its appeal from the promise that citizen preferences determine the content and direction of policy making. in other regimes the political elite might also adopt policies that are consistent with majority opinion but democratic government guarantees policy responsiveness to public preferences through the use of competitive elections. john may for instance defines democracy as the `necessary correspondence between acts of governance and the wishes with respect to those acts of the persons who are affected?. this course takes that definition as the starting point to study the link between the public and its representatives. the course consists of three broad sections. the first few weeks are devoted to important debates on the conceptualization and measurement of the mass-elite relationship. one line of scholarship analyzes representation as the ideological match between citizens and representatives (`congruence?) while another is more preoccuptied with the influence of citzens and elites on each other (`responsiveness?). the second part of the course consists of the role of institutions in forging the link between the public and policy. we focus on electoral institutions and regime types political parties and multilevel polities such as the european union. the final third of the course zooms in on the question of political inequality. are some groups in society better represented in the political arena than others? we critically examine accounts of unequal representation based on income education ethnicity and gender and touch upon important debates on issues of descriptive representation and unequal political participation. recommended prior knowledge this course has a strong focus on quantitative studies of political representation. it is therefore recommended that students have basic knowledge of quantitative methods. registration \"students of the research master social sciences\\\\xa0can register for this course in sis-uva 2 december 8:30 to 16 december 2014 13:00. for more information on how to register for courses in sis see  search for your programme go to a-z and click on sis.\" teaching method the course will be taught as an extended seminar through a combination of short lectures student presentations and class discussion. time please have a look at our time schedules at  study materials the literature for this course will consist of academic articles and book chapters which will be made available through blackboard a course reader and/or email. assessment and testing \"students are expected to undertake original research on a topic within the broad theme of the course. this will result in a final paper of 5000 words that has the format of a journal article. students will present their findings in a conference format at the end of the course. there will also be an assessment of peer review where students review each other?s final paper. the final grade consists of the final paper (70%) peer review (25%) and conference presentation (15%).\" \"according to the teaching and examination regulations (see\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z click rules and regulations) a student is eligible to a re-sit an exam/paper only if s/he participated in the first examination round. only in case of extenuating circumstances (serious illness or death of a family member sickness) in the period close to the examination (until 10 days before) and provided that the course coordinator was informed beforehand and a written statement of the extenuating circumstances was provided the student is eligible to participate in the second round without having participated in the first round.\" \"after a fail grade in the first round the highest grade awarded in the second round is a 6.0. a student with a pass grade in the first round may opt for a retake/rewrite but for rewritten papers/assignments the highest grade awarded in the second round is one grade point higher than the original one. for further guidelines and specifications regarding re-sits see the rules & guidelines of the examination board at\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z click rules and regulations.\" remarks \"the provisions of the regulations governing fraud and plagiarism for uva students apply in full. access this regulation at\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z and click on plagiarism and fraud - general.\" the course will use blackboard extensively as a channel of communication. in general students are advised to check blackboard on a regular basis for any changes and/or additional references or any other course related matter. blackboard can be entered through the following link:',\n",
       " 'objectives obtaining knowledge of state of the art of literature on party system changeobtaining the ability to critically evaluate empirical researchobtaining the ability to conduct researchimprove writing skills contents modern representative democracies are party democracies. some would go as far as schattschneider (1942) who argued that “political parties created modern democracy and modern democracy is unthinkable save in terms of parties”. yet there are good reasons to think that contemporary party democracy is facing a crisis. over the past two decades parties with governing potential have lost support to populist or extremist parties of the left and right or to protest parties without an ideological profile such as pirate parties or beppe grillo’s movement. we have seen these developments in almost all established democracies except for a country like the us where the electoral system prevents the rise of new parties but where a radical opposition movement organised itself within one of the mainstream parties. other empirically observable indicators of the crisis of electoral democracy are decreasing turnout and low levels of trust in political parties. on top of this we are witnessing an economic crisis which makes is highly unlikely that the mainstream parties will be able to restore citizens’ confidence in their problem solving capacities. for a long time party democracy worked well because in the words of peter mair (2007) it provided the synthesis between popular democracy and constitutional democracy. yet centre parties are facing some fundamental challenges. the first challenge is that their capacity to influence policies have been reduced by the rise of supranational organisations and by the constraints of an increasingly globalised economy. secondly\\\\xa0 processes of individualisation and emancipation of voters have made electorates increasingly volatile and parties more uncertain. third media fragmentation makes communication with voters increasingly difficult. as a consequence of all these developments we may be witnessing a growing gap in modern party democracy between highly responsive outsider parties on the one hand and increasingly unresponsive and responsible parties of government on the other as argued by mair. he suggested that if parties are failing and if modern democracy cannot exist without parties we may soon see the end of democracy as we know it. others are more optimistic. in this seminar we will discuss recent theoretical contributions and empirical studies dealing with various aspects of the functioning of electoral democracy. registration \"students of the research master social sciences\\\\xa0can register for this course in sis-uva from 13 october

how are collective gains produced and allocated? who wins and who loses? how do societal demands get processed into the decision-making process? does the decision-making process meet procedural standards of democratic decision-making? do the decisions produced meet substantive standards of justice? the course is organized in two parts. the first part focuses on institutional questions and political issues of power and democracy. in particular it focuses on questions of institutional design and institutional evolution in the european union on the way that institutional design conditions political contestation in europe and on how the eu context provokes new understandings of the normative criteria by which the quality of the political process (democracy) and its output (justice) are to be assessed. among others this part thus draws on contemporary insights from decision-making analysis institutionalist theories constitutionalist thinking and international political theory. \"the second part of the course focuses on the processes and outputs of eu governance.\\\\xa0 students will be introduced to major current theoretical approaches to eu governance whose competing assumptions and claims will be confronted with the findings of recent empirical research. key issues to be addressed include: the drivers and dynamics of innovations in eu governance; whether or not modes of governance are converging across historically distinct policy fields; the relationship between hierarchical and non-hierarchical forms of governance; the changing significance of the community method of eu decision-making; the influence of eu governance on national policy-making; the participation of non-state and subnational actors; and the implications of recent transformations in governance for the eu’s democratic legitimacy.\" registration \"students of the research master social sciences\\\\xa0can register for this course in sis-uva 2 december 8:30 to 16 december 2014 13:00. for more information on how to register for courses in sis see  search for your programme go to a-z and click on sis.\" teaching method weekly three-hour class meetings weekly active participation presentation and discussion. class attendance is mandatory. contact hours course weekteaching methodhours/week6 - 22werkcollege36 time please check the course schedules on  for updated information. study materials a selection of recent articles and papers on relevant topics. all will be made available electronically. study materials will include original texts by key authors as well as research articles that reflect the cutting edge of the debate on eu governance and institutions. the reading list will be announced before the start of the course. assessment and testing assessment is based on three components: six reading response memos (c. 2 pages each) => 30% of final grade.class participation (presence contributions quality of contributions) => 10% of final grade.final paper (between 4000 and 5000 words excluding bibliography) => 60 % of final grade. \"according to the teaching and examination regulations (see\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z click rules and regulations) a student is eligible to a re-sit an exam/paper only if s/he participated in the first examination round. only in case of extenuating circumstances (serious illness or death of a family member sickness) in the period close to the examination (until 10 days before) and provided that the course coordinator was informed beforehand and a written statement of the extenuating circumstances was provided the student is eligible to participate in the second round without having participated in the first round.\" \"after a fail grade in the first round the highest grade awarded in the second round is a 6.0. a student with a pass grade in the first round may opt for a retake/rewrite but for rewritten papers/assignments the highest grade awarded in the second round is one grade point higher than the original one. for further guidelines and specifications regarding re-sits see the rules & guidelines of the examination board at\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z click rules and regulations.\" remarks \"the provisions of the regulations governing fraud and plagiarism for uva students apply in full. access this regulation at\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z and click on plagiarism and fraud - general.\" the course will use blackboard extensively as a channel of communication. in general students are advised to check blackboard on a regular basis for any changes and/or additional references or any other course related matter. blackboard can be entered through the following link:',\n",

       " 'contents the course addresses some of the key cultural and political transformations taking place in europe today by focussing on the various ways in which new identities and imaginations of belonging are framed in europe’s cities both in specific urban spaces themselves as well as in the work of visual artists writers and urban thinkers and activists. cities are the sites within which europe’s current challenges are most apparent – whether it is those linked to the integration of new migrant and mobile populations or the articulation of new cultural social and economic identities on the part of ‘old’ europeans. yet the role of cities and indeed specific city-spaces (like cafes and literary salons) has been key throughout european modernity: these were after all the key sites where european and national identities were imagined and crafted where revolutions were plotted – the various intellectual networks that brought together writers and dreamers at the turn of the last century are just one such example. at the same time however many european cities provided a key refuge for a transnational intellectual diaspora including both colonial and post-colonial elites as well as more recently those exiled from behind the iron curtain. this course builds on an interdisciplinary humanities based approach to the city and urban identities allowing students to explore the making and imagining of urban european and transnational identities through time from the 19th century to the present. cities and city spaces are thus used as a focal point and ‘laboratory’ to explore the ways in which europe but also non- european places have been imagined in the work of artists writers architects and political leaders and thinkers. key attention is paid in particular to the role of migration and mobility in making and re-making the european space past and present looking both at material and ideational flows the movement of both people as well as literary artistic and political imaginations. the course will thus first present students with cutting-edge interdisciplinary theory that will help them to break open more traditional notions of european and ‘area studies’ encouraging to begin thinking of questions of identity and belonging ‘beyond borders’ both disciplinary as well as national. we will thus encourage students to approach european and transnational identities in an imaginative way without constraining the object of their research to traditional sites and topics such as heritage landscapes or institutional actors. although the course will focus on a number of european cities as ‘nodes’ of identity making and re-making we will give particular attention to the very city where we are located amsterdam that we will use once again as a laboratory for reflecting on the role of the urban and urban spaces in the shaping of identities. beyond traditional lectures then the course will be very strongly based in urban field visits to a number of cultural sites and spaces with amsterdam literally becoming our classroom for thinking about identities borders and mobilities. we will use our existing network of established contacts with cultural institutions in the city to \\\\xa0this purpose working in collaborative fashion with places as diverse as de waag society the eye the national maritime museum and amsterdam harbour the tropenmuseum as well as a variety of art spaces and galleries. student \\\\xa0research/assessment: course participants will be required to elaborate a research proposal and research paper but will also be asked to conceive of alternative ways of presenting their research results including visual essays posters and web-blogs. the aim will be to make their production dialogue directly with the city and city cultural institutions – we would thus like to publish student projects on an artes honours course web-blog but also in collaboration with external literary or cultural reviews (such as for example de gids).',\n",

       " 'objectives insight in the aims methods and results of the field of cognitive and computational musicology (a.k.a. systematic musicology). contents in the last two decades an important shift has occurred in music research that is from music as an art (or art object) to music as a process in which the performer the listener and music as sound play a central role. this transformation is most notable in the field of systematic musicology which developed from “a mere extension of musicology” into a “complete reorientation of the discipline to fundamental questions which are non-historical in nature encompassing research into the nature and properties of music as an acoustical psychological and cognitive phenomenon” (duckles & pasler 2001; honing 2006). these recent strands of music research will be interpreted in the context of the “cognitive revolution” in the humanities and the sciences. next to an overview of the methods and techniques that became central to the contemporary musicologist’s toolkit current developments will be discussed that explore what cognitive musicology can say about music as an art or art object. quantitative research in music has traditionally been restricted to two rather isolated subdomains: music cognition often performed in psychology departments and computational musicology and music information retrieval (mir) often performed in computer science departments. mainstream musicology has had surprisingly little contact with either of these subdomains but in fact they have much to say to one another. one great challenge in intercommunication however is the great difference in terminology and techniques used. this course seeks to teach humanities-based students the terminology they need to read literature in music cognition computational musicology and mir with confidence how to use some of the fundamental techniques from these fields and how their own scholarly interests might be relevant to researchers in the field. \"the formal structure of the course involves three blocks: 1) music cognition 2) mir and computational musicology and 3) individual projects. during blocks 1 and 2 the weekly course activities will include reading \\\\xa0and responding to papers and book chapters about a given theme conducting literature reviews to find papers that relate both to a given theme and the students own scholarly interests and practical sessions that will introduce students to the most important software packages for music cognition computational musicology and mir. the final portions of block 1 and 2 will be freer in structure including a number of guest lectures and a case study on an open experiment from the university of amsterdam’s music cognition group.\" block 3 (only for extension to 18 ec) will be dedicated entirely to individual projects. students will devise their own potential experiments relating to the course themes and choose one to carry to completion. they will present their ideas and preliminary findings in a short oral presentation to the group and make a final written report at the close of the final block. woven through all three blocks will be an introduction to the basics of statistical analysis using the r software package. early in the course the focus will be on understanding the statistics most often presented in quantitative research in music. later in the course the focus will be more practical to enable students to undertake analyses of their own experiments. teaching method lecture/seminar. time 2x 2 hours per week. before the start of the semester please consult the schedule for the time and place of the courses:  study materials n.b. provisional. clarke e. & n. cook (2004). empirical musicology: aims methods prospects. oxford university press.deutsch d.

       " 'contents human communication through natural language is one of the most perplexing phenomena around: the fact that almost every person we meet is able to communicate linguistically with no apparent effort makes it seem easy. however once we begin to describe scientifically the processes underlying learning and using language - and in particular once we assume an engineering perspective and try to reproduce human linguistic behavior these innocent looking facts about virtually effortless language use become almost miraculous and today we are still a far cry away from creating artificial systems that can truly use language anywhere near the way humans can. after literally thousands of years of philosophical inquiry and an exponential growth in technology how is it possible that we still do not seem to have completely understood what comes to us so naturally? this course sets out to shed some light on the \"miracles\" of ordinary language use and provides an approachable introduction to some of the central issues in the psychology of language focusing on language understanding. we will look at some of the central tasks involved in comprehending linguistic utterances: from recognizing the units of speech to detecting structure to inferring communicative intentions based on the vastly underspecified signal that is actually transmitted. the course will comprise two parts: the first part provides a general introduction to some of the most central ideas in psycholinguistic research and will provide students with a conceptual foundation for the scientific study of language as a cognitive phenomenon. in the second part students will form small groups and select a narrowly defined topic in one of the subfields in the psychology of language. within their area of choice each group will work together on the development of a detailed problem statement and an overview of the current state-of-the-art of its solution. the results of their research will be shared with the other participants in the form of a mini-conference to be held at the end of the course. teaching method work group 3 hours per week. students are expected to read the relevant literature for each session and to prepare themselves for discussion of the texts. attendance is thus required. study materials harley t. 2007. the psychology of language: from data to theory (3rd edition). new york: psychology press. the course syllabus and additional materials will be made available on blackboard cost to be announced. assessment and testing midterm exam covering the contents of part 1 (30%) literature review (30%)mini-conference presentation (40%) remarks *** the course will pressupose some basic knowledge about linguistic description as covered in any introduction to linguistics *** (recommendation for self-study: adrian akmajian richard a. demers robert m harnish. 2010. linguistics: an introduction to language and communication. cambridge ma: mit press.)',\n",

role of the private sector and reflect on the role of science and scientists as agents of societal change. contents poverty still affects large sections of the world population today persisting in the face of overall improvements of the human condition. the uneven accumulation and distribution of wealth and prosperity has resurfaced as a major issue in international development studies. explanations for its causes and processes lie in complex economic political social and cultural situations which vary across countries regions and localities. strategies to tackle poverty and inequality issues centre around three main areas: (1) promoting opportunities through economic growth (2) increasing possibilities for empowerment and social inclusion by improving collective actions responsive to the needs of the poor in social political and civil society institutions and (3) enhancing human security and resilience by reducing vulnerability of groups of poor people and increasing their resilience to shocks including conflict related shocks and stress and long-term risks including climate change. the course introduces students to the principal theoretical and conceptual debates in international development studies in a historic perspective. it applies these concepts to the study of approaches to the political economy since the 1950s. the course reviews key actors such as states and international organizations such as the world bank and imf private actors such as multinational corporations and small scale enterprises national and social movements that have contested power at a range of scales from the local to the global through a range of means (culturally politically militarily). the main questions raised in this course concern current views on the dimensions and causes of poverty focusing on how households deal with poverty and develop strategies for their well-being in the context of development processes how institutions contribute to or counteract poverty and how more effective national and international strategies can be developed. there is recognition of multiple scale-levels at which poverty and development processes take place and of the plurality of institutions involved. the main actors considered in the course are: households governments at different levels (including the supra-national) private sector actors and their networks and a variety of civil society organizations (ingos ngos cbos political parties). the course consists of four main sections. the first section introduces four central theoretical paradigms i.e. current mainstream development thinking post-development and resistance globalization and up scaling development and inclusive development/human development. it discusses the origin and approaches in these paradigms and discusses how central concepts of poverty governance and development are perceived in these approaches. the next three thematic sections each focus on a core set of debates. the first thematic section includes debates in the field of economic growth and sustainable development. the second thematic section focuses on governance and politics in development and the final section discusses debates related to cultural diversity resilience and social inclusion. registration students who have been selected for the master international development studies will be registered for this course by the study advisor. please do note that the course is not open to non-ids students. teaching method the course consists of 20-24 sessions two per week. the lectures are distributed over 4 blocks. the first block consists of four lectures and four working groups (8 sessions). the lectures introduce the four central theoretical paradigms and the four working groups discuss the literature of the sessions and classic readings in international development studies. the three subsequent blocks consist of three lectures and a working group each. the sessions consist of a

problems and gaps in the research literature;be able to read understand and evaluate state-of-the-art research articles; be able to write a systematic review of the literature on a specific subfield. contents the course focuses on institutions inequalities and life courses. this is a broad and heterogeneous field which will be divided into two subfields in this course: (a) social stratification and inequality and (b) life courses and familes. within the field of social stratification and inequality we discuss the causes and consequences of inequality with a special focus on class education gender and ethnicity. much attention will also be paid to the role of education the family of origin and social capital as factors that increase or reproduce inequality. within the fields of life courses and families the focus will be on the relationship between family formation and women’s economic position the effects of family structure and divorce on social inequality and intergenerational relations and solidarity. for both fields we also use a comparative perspective in the sense that patterns will be compared across societies and over time. in doing so we explicitly examine how institutions (which vary across societies and over time) affect inequalities and life courses. examples of such questions are how and why the strength of family solidarity varies across societies and why the influence of parents on children’s education is higher in some educational systems than in others. registration \"students of the research master social sciences\\\\xa0can register for this

in order to achieve greater success - aid organizations should adopt a more political mode of operation. the course will primarily focus on institutional assistance which entails the channeling of funds expertise organizational support and technology towards reforming public administration in low- and middle-income countries.\" to give you an idea of part one: \"some authors look at the political interests behind the historical distribution of aid by donor countries. other literature aims to show how the reform requirements pegged to foreign assistance perpetuate the unequal power relations between donor and recipient societies. the rising political clout of china as a foreign donor is also a popular topic of study. development programs that work on empowering communities at the local level are part of a context of power relations and are being studied as such. another branch of research investigates political assistance i.e. the resources deployed overseas with the intention of strengthening democracy and the rule of law. the case of donor support being used by recipient country elites for private (political) gain is a further line of investigation. often the latter also reflects on the internal political incentives of development aid as an industry.\" the following debate is the focal point of part two: \"since the late 2000s a stream of aid policy research has argued that in order to become more effective development organizations must adopt a more political way of working across all areas of intervention. related studies emphasize the neopatrimonial logic of politics in aid-receiving countries and explore how aid may help steer the outcomes of this logic in a pro-developmental direction. in response a number of donor agencies introduced political economy analysis toolkits to guide programming and operations. however the impact of these toolkits is considered ambiguous and the desirability of a more political approach to aid in general remains contested. there is also an opinion that development policy research that prioritizes the neopatrimonial sidelines the more fundamental social struggles in targeted societies. meanwhile some authors understand development aid as a self-perpetuating discourse that primarily benefits those who work within its bureaucracy. they see the above policy discussion as a manifestation thereof.\" recommended prior knowledge although a brief introduction on international development aid will be provided prior knowledge of the topic is highly desirable. so is prior knowledge on the political economy of development in contemporary low- and middle-income countries. exchange students are expected to have followed an introductory course on political economy. registration via sis-uva. bekijk de academische kalender op onze website ( voor de inschrijfperiodes. exchange students are contacted by the exchange coordinator regarding enrollment. teaching method ba seminar time  the above link will take you to the timetable website of the uva. for this course select the following values: faculty: faculteit der maatschappij- en gedragswetenschappeninstitute: sociale wetenschappen (csw/gsss) study materials articles and book chapters min/max participants maximum 25 students remarks students are expected to spend 20 hours a week (including meetings) on this course.',\n",

       " 'objectives the aim is to obtain insights in the current methods on how to empirically characterise industries. to reach this goal we integrate empirical methods economic theory and broad evidence about markets. through a combination of these methodologies you will be able to provide robust empirical work on industries that is tailored to the nature and quality of data available. thus you will be provided with a toolbox of empirical techniques currently available and apply these techniques to real data; your gained insights can be readily applied to real-world situations such as simple competition policy cases. the ultimate objective is to help you develop a way of thinking about empirical analysis which will help to design your own original answers to the specific problems you face given the data you have. the obtained knowledge and integrated approach of the course will also help you to clarify the assumptions that underlie pieces of empirical work evaluate these assumptions in the light of industry knowledge and will ultimately serve as a basis for more advanced empirical work in industrial economics and other areas of applied micro-economics. contents we discuss methods for identifying the type and intensity of competition in a particular industry. that is we ask whether we can tell from market outcomes whether firms pose genuine competitive constrains on each other or instead possess significant market power. in other words we discuss methods to determine whether we can use data to discriminate between collusive outcomes competing firms acting as oligopolies or outcomes which sufficiently approximate perfect competition. to do so industrial organisation economists have developed specific methodologies that use observed data on cost drivers prices and quantities in order to infer the nature of competition in the market. an empirical model which nests a number of possible theoretical models can be used to discriminate between these potential competitive environments given a suitable identification strategy. indeed whenever we want to distinguish between different models of competition some feature in the data must allow us to tell them apart. this is what we call the identification strategy. once identified the competition in a market we address how the market structure and changes therein affect the market price. this is of course in the interest of both firms competing in that market and of governmental watch dogs that regulate markets. registration please go to  teaching method weekly: one two-hour lecture and one two-hour seminar. time please go to  study materials the main material is based on the lecture slides and scientific articles available on blackboard at  optional: quantitative techniques for competition and antitrust analysis by davis and garces (2010) c. €80. assessment and testing the data assignments serve the purpose of training you in handling raw data and identifying the type of competition in a market applying both theory and the empirical toolkit provided to you through the lectures. the final grade will be calculated as follows: two group data assignments (40%); one individual data assignment (35%);final written examination (25%). in the case of a resit the results obtained for these partial examinations will be disregarded. during a resit the full course material will be tested. please go to  and ',\n",

       " 'objectives this research project aims at supporting students who wish to write their masters’ thesis on eu enlargement neighbourhood and foreign relations more generally. the focus of the project is on the transforming institutional political and socioeconomic boundaries of the european union in a multipolar world. it seeks to foster critical qualitative examinations of the kind of order that is produced through such transformations and of the relation between internal and external orderings in the context of european integration. we will discuss the main challenges arising in this respect from current european affairs the theoretical approaches designed to address them and the main findings of the academic literature. these insights will be used to support students in chosing a topic for their own research that they can relate to the state of the art in the field and which makes a contribution to existing scholarship. the course will further provide students with guidance in crafting their research question and argument choosing an appropriate research design and methodology. upon completion of the research project participants will: be able to mobilise various theoretical tools in the study of eu enlargement neighbourhood and foreign relations more generally;be capable of a critical well-informed analysis of eu internal and external ordering in a multipolar world;have developed a personal research project in relation to the topic examined in class including precise research questions and methodologies a well-defined conceptual and empirical framework;have advanced their research writing and analytical skills to the level required for ma students. contents \"students of european integration have long expected that it would contribute to the development of a peaceful regional and international order sustained by the unions commitment to liberal values. current eu affairs are conducive to the development of a more nuanced analysis. internally european integration has in recent years come increasingly under scrutiny on the basis of its perceived socio-economic effects on established and new member states as well as candidate countries. while european integration has been premised on the superseding of national borders it now seems that new political and socioeconomic boundaries are coming into effect as a result of eu developments. externally the fallout from the 2011 arab uprisings has shed an unfavourable light on the eus engagement with regimes that do not abide by the values it claims to uphold in the context of the unions neighbourhood policy and beyond. eu policies in the field of assistance (humanitarian financial technical) economic cooperation migration law-enforcement cooperation among others have all come under serious and systematic criticism for their divisive and exclusionary effects.\" one interrogation that emerges in this regard is whether the eu has indeed a single set of strategies when addressing enlargement neighbourhood and foreign relations more generally or whether each \"area\" (of freedom security and justice schengen) \"zone\" (the eurozone) and \"space\" that it consists of has developed its own. examining europe in a multipolar world involves asking how the eu fares in such an order in the transatlantic context with regard to brazil china russia and other countries but also whether the union itself has not evolved into a multipolar entity. from a conceptual point of this these observations raise the issue of how ongoing debates on \"normative power europe\" \"external governance\" or \"fuzzy borders\" fare in the contemporary period and of the theoretical toolset that provides the best analytical leverage. this year the research project will therefore address the question of eu enlargement neighbourhood and foreign relations through the lenses of boundaries and orders. it will bring together students interested in the patterns of inclusion and exclusion related to european integration the interplay between internal and external processes associated with the european union and the transformation of centre-periphery relations on the european continent and beyond. we will explore the different conceptual possibilities available to think about boundaries in relation to and beyond the traditional geopolitical notion of borders and how processesses of bordering are contiguous to processes of identification and ordering. we will draw on literature from international relations eu studies international political sociology international political economy and other disciplines. \"on an indicative basis thesis topics researched in previous years include: the eus policy towards the arctic region;

traditionally their methodological and theoretical fields have emerged from literary studies. however the more recent and exciting fields of ecology and media the emphasis here being on cinema allow core concepts from ecocriticism and eco-philosophy to fully engage a range of cinematic objects from hollywood blockbusters and european films to ‘third cinema’ whether this be fiction or documentary. for instance james lovelock’s ‘gaia hypothesis’ can be a theoretical interlocutor to a rash of blockbuster films from\\\\xa0the day the earth stood still\\\\xa0(2008) to\\\\xa0avatar\\\\xa0(2009) which incidentally is a film open to interdisciplinary encounters with environmental justice. \\\\xa0gender theory is never far from acts of ‘reading’ the environment as an aesthetic ‘medium’. so often the ‘earth’ and the eco-system as gendered as a ‘she’ and ‘her’ predicament of violation constitute much pro-filmic narrative.there is also an opportunity for students who wish to explore ‘third cinema’ to research relevant ecological issues from the ‘slow violence’ of pollution to cinematic representations of deforestation biomedical piracy and the phenomenon of ‘climate refugees’. equally well students will have opportunities to research the canon of european ecological cinema most notably in the work of lars van trier through which the cutting edge concepts of ‘dark ecology’ (morton 2007; 2010) are gathering scholarly popularity.the topic of ecology and cinema is suitable for any ma researcher who wants to find out more about environmental issues in cinema or wishes to study cinema as a medium which necessarily deploys a range of ‘environments’ and ‘ecologies’ within its project of storytelling as an emotionally and politically engaging act. films beyond the theatre - instructor: eef masson (159410196y)although films shown in entertainment theatres have long been the primary focus of academic film history and theory writing they constitute only part of the much wider repertoire that audiences of past decades have been confronted with. film spectatorship also took shape in homes classrooms museums or town halls where family films educational films and information or propaganda films were projected for audiences of varying compositions. while such films have been used as sources by scholars in other fields for quite while (in social history for instance) profound interest among film historians is relatively recent. in this seminar students will study a sample of historiographic and methodological texts so as to be able to map the shifts in perspective within this emerging field over the past few decades. in addition they will practice their interpretive skills on a chosen corpus of ‘non-theatricals’. as a rule information on the purposes which these films served the circumstances in which they were presented or the practices they were part of is hard to get by; however practitioners these days tend to agree that it is also crucial to their interpretation – especially from a retrospective point of view. students will therefore be asked to locate sources that can help further their understanding of their chosen sample of films use them in the course of analysis and in the process reflect on the ways in which both filmic and non-filmic sources can help ‘frame’ such a historical corpus. registration for information:  choose: a-z;

instead film will be presented as actively contributing to our understanding of ethics. emphasizing film’s predisposition towards the everydayness of the relations between values and norms this course develops an alternative to media ethics delimited to codes of professional conduct. consequently this course will focus not so much on questions of appropriate conduct of film professionals but rather on the cinematic projections of moral habits in which characters may or may not feel themselves at home. language-centred film analysis: from film language to the language of films and back - instructor: dr. a.tseronis (159410206y):course objectivesat the end of the seminar students will:- gain an overview of the positions and debates over the relationship between film studies and language studies;- have tools for the study of concrete phenomena where the interaction of the verbal mode with the visual (and the audio) contribute to the filmic meaning;- become familiar with multimodal analysis and rhetorical criticism for the analysis of films. contentsfilm scholars have originally turned to linguistics in an attempt to find answers to the questions about the signification of moving images but not in an attempt to study how images combine with language. while film has been extensively studied as a visual medium little attention has been paid to the verbal aspects of it. yet the non-verbal aspects of film are never totally separate from the verbal which is always present be it in the form of written intertitles spoken dialogue voice-over or as written material in the shot. at the same time sense-making processes similar to those at play when understanding linguistic utterances can be shown to play a role also in understanding and interpreting the filmic text. in this seminar we pay close attention to both the content and the style of spoken and written language in films and we study the way in which the verbal mode interacts with the visual and the audio modes to create filmic meaning. in addition we discuss the explanatory potential of concepts and phenomena originally studied within linguistics for the analysis of film. to do this we take an interdisciplinary perspective to film theory and film analysis drawing from semiotics cognitive theory linguistics pragmatics and discourse analysis. registration for information:  choose: a-z;

       " 'objectives the course “financial accounting” is an introduction to financial accounting from an international perspective. financial accounting deals with reporting the operating results financial position and cash flows of a company to stockholders creditors investors tax authorities and other decision-makers. even though this essential function of financial reporting is often missed due to the fact that companies’ numbers tend to be considered a jungle in which it is difficult to assess how well a company is doing. this course will deal with this misconception by emphasising the information which is relevant in making investment and credit decisions. no prior knowledge of financial accounting is required. a user perspective will be adopted rather than a preparer one because most master students will become users of financial statements rather than preparers. however in order to become users students must also understand how the financial statements are prepared. therefore the students’ attention the core objectives of the course are to provide the students with an understanding of: the information contained in the financial statements and the effects of economic events on them;the process of accumulating identifying measuring and recording financial information;the framework for making business decisions using financial statements information;the economic environment in which financial reporting choices are made what the options are how these data are used for various types of decisions and ethical dilemmas;the importance of financial statement analysis from the point of view of different stakeholders. the course pays particular attention to the financial statements of companies in different national contexts with examples drawn from these varying contexts. this means students are exposed to different financial statement formats and regulatory requirements but the course will mainly focus on international rules of accounting (ifrs). at the end of the course students will be able to: understand the “language” of business its uses and limitations;interpret and understand the impact economic events have on the balance sheet income statement and statement of cash flows;understand and describe the measurement theories used in financial accounting;recognise how financial statements communicate economic events to third parties (i.e. owners investors creditors) and the impact this information has on these users. contents the course will focus on the use of accounting as a tool for decision-making and problem-solving through the use of analytical creative and critical thinking. the course will emphasise the understanding of how financial statements are created and how accounting decisions affect these statements. the objective is not to memorise accounting rules and perform “bookkeeping”. rather the course will teach students financial accounting processes as a basis for development of financial statements analysis. the course will also emphasise the problems associated with accounting flexibility and subjectivity while evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies and estimates. since there is a limited time schedule students will only learn the basic principles of financial accounting. the lectures will follow the following themes: introduction to financial accounting;the accounting model;accounting principles;financial statement preparation and presentation;financial statement analysis. teaching method the course consists of 7 lectures of 3.5 hours per week. in the first 3 sessions we will cover the basics of double-entry bookkeeping the nature of business transactions the operating cycle the accounting equation accrual accounting and the preparation of financial statements. then some of the main accounting issues companies have to deal with will be covered in more detail. in the last sessions we will study how your knowledge can be used to perform financial statement analysis and ethical issues related to accounting will be discussed. the course will consist of a mixture of lectures problem solving and case discussion. in each of the core areas of financial accounting addressed real-word company examples will be used to illustrate how issues have been dealt with. time please go to  study materials the syllabus of the course is based on the following textbook: harrison w.t. & horngren c.

       " 'objectives this research project aims at supporting students who wish to write their masters’ thesis on topics relating to geopolitics borders and spatial politics more generally. the focus of the project is on questions relating to geopolitics borders and how we understand and use space in both the past and the present. it seeks to foster critical qualitative examinations of the construction of spatial orders the role of borders in both a statist and wider context the role of spatial constructions on our knowledge of the world and how spatial politics relates to conflict. we will discuss the main challenges arising in this respect from current trends in geopolitical ordering border configurations and spatial constructions along with the theoretical approaches designed to address them and the main findings of the academic literature. these insights will be used to support students in choosing a topic for their own research that they can relate to the state of the art in the field and which makes a contribution to existing scholarship. the course will further provide students with guidance in crafting their research question and argument choosing an appropriate research design and methodology. upon completion of the research project participants will: be able to mobilise various theoretical tools in the study of geopolitics borders and spatial politics more generally;be capable of a critical well-informed analysis of geopolitical ordering bordering and spatial practices in the past and present;have developed a personal research project in relation to the topic examined in class including precise research questions and methodologies a well-defined conceptual and empirical framework;have advanced their research writing and analytical skills to the level required for ma students. contents traditionally geopolitics has been conceived as a direct relationship between human organisation that is political and social organisation and physical geography. spatial configurations then are representative of power structures of the past and present. in more recent times scholars working in ir and political geography have sought to question some of the geographical assumptions based on what has been termed a ‘territorial trap’ based in many instances on the power/knowledge nexus and the traditional statist approach to international politics. one of the key sites of geopolitical and spatial conflict as well as a major player in the construction of geopolitical configurations are ‘borders’. the study of borders is of central importance to any study of the role of space in international relations and political geography. this is because borders are where we can see the role of space most clearly in the political world. the study of borders remains of central importance to the study of spatial politics even in an age when some claim borders are losing their importance as markers of separation and exclusivity. there continue to be disagreements about why we should study borders and how we should study borders between scholars within and between disciplines. furthermore borders relate in intimate ways to the state territory and conflict. how do we understand borders today? where are they to be found? are the changing in form and function? in this research project we will be focusing on the more traditional geopolitical work of halford mackinder and friedrich ratzel and more recent critical work by henri lefebvre doreen massey john agnew gearóid ó tuathail derek gregory robert david sack stuart elden jennifer hyndman alison mountz liam o’dowd deborah cowen merje kuus william walters chris rumford louise amoore and eyal weizman amongst many others. recommended prior knowledge basic knowledge about the design of empirical research as well as standards of academic writing is expected. understanding at an ma level of theories of political geography and international relations as well as general background in political science and/or political sociology is an asset. required prior knowledge if you have not taken any course on international relation and/or political geography it will be difficult for you to get access to this course (see below under remarks). registration by submitting the registration form before tuesday 2 december 2014 (midnight). the form will be sent to your student email account after the thesis market on tuesday 25 november 2014. teaching method the research project is divided in two parts: reading seminars and writing seminars: in the reading seminar part the research project will focus on discussing the academic literature dealing with the relations between geopolitical configurations power relations history colonial relations boundaries borders and orders in a supposedly globalising world focusing in particular on the changing nature of borders and boundaries the practices of bordering and spatial ordering. this will provide students with the necessary factual and theoretical background to work on their thesis. while discussing this background students are expected to proceed towards identifying the specific topic puzzle research question methodology and research design of their thesis through collective discussion and individual meetings with the course convener.the second part of the research project will be devoted to the writing process. we will focus on what makes a good thesis its component parts how to form an argument and ground it in the existing literature and theories. we will also meet to discuss draft chapters in seminar meetings which will take the form of short presentations of progress constructive feedback and discussion. participants will have one-on-one meetings with the course convener on a regular basis to receive tailored feedback and discuss the particulars of their individual thesis work. contact hours course weekteaching methodhours/weekremarks1 - 20werkcollege3these contact hours are approximate and do not include hours for assignments hours for reading etc. extra classes may be planned. please see the course manual (syllabus) on blackboard for more details. time please see  select “add timetable” than “add course timetable” and search for either the course title or the course catalogue number. study materials there is no textbook for this course. reading materials will include academic articles and chapters as well as other texts. all materials will be made available to students through blackboard/dropbox in due course. besides issue-specific factual and theoretical readings the project will draw on a combination of chapters from the following volumes in order to support work on research design methodology and methods: \"becker h.s.

       " 'objectives this course introduces students to a problem of burning actuality: the  continuing increase of very vulnerable employees who must live and work  without any security or predictability of income (“the precariat”). the  course focuses on sociological anthropological and historical work on  precarious workers across the globe and tries to discover differences  and similarities between on the one hand advanced capitalist countries  (western europe north america) and parts of the the global south. the  final paper will require students to formulate a relevant research  question within the broad theme of the course and undertake original  research of their own. contents on 29 february 2004 italy witnessed the dedication of a new saint by  the chainworkers of milan an anarcho-syndicalist collective seeking to  subvert commercial advertising: san precario the patron of the casual  temporary freelance and intermittent workers. san precario was  initially envisaged as a man but has in the meantime evolved into a  rather androgynous being. he or she can appear anywhere and everywhere:  on streets and squares but also in mcdonald’s outlets supermarkets or  bookstores. the arrival of san precario draws attention to irregular  jobs. essential to all forms of precarious  employment relations is that they are temporary i.e. they involve jobs  which last a day a week or at most a few months. other terms also used  for this type of employment are “atypical” “non-standard” or  “contingent”. all these notions are not exactly defined. nevertheless it  is reasonably clear what kinds of jobs are included: temporary work via  temping agencies; on-call work; work with zero-hour contracts; seasonal  labor; casual labor; day labor recruited informally in the open air;  intermittent labor; independent contracting; freelance work;  internships; and many so-called self-employed workers. the present course attempts to place this  social trend in a global context and in a broader historical timeframe.  three variants of precarious labour will be explored: 1) in europe and  north america before the arrival of welfare-state arrangements; 2) in  contemporary advanced capitalism; and 3) in the contemporary global  south. during the course we will also discuss the thesis defended by  some social scientists that the precariat is a new social class which  differs in significant ways from the traditional working class.  attention will also be given to struggles and organizational forms of  precarious workers and their presumed affinity with radical religious  and nationalist movements. registration students of the research master social sciences register themselves in sis from 2 december 2014 8:00 until 16 december 2014 13:00. contact hours course weekteaching methodhours/week6 -

studying this controversy may enable us to better understand the tensions within in a world of globalizing states voluntarily pooling their sovereignty in the creation of global arrangements in order to deal with the abovementioned global collective action problems. at the same time taking stock of the main developments in some of those problem areas may enable us to compare and assess the cogency and usefulness of particular theories of global justice under factual constraints of international politics. the course will focus on two such problem areas: poverty alleviation and coping with climate change. the course is in three parts. the first part analyses the notion of global justice in an examination of the contrast with domestic (nation-based) justice and then goes on to study a range of internationalist and cosmopolitan theories of global justice. the second part of the course presents (1) an overview of the millennium development goals including the assessments and evaluations expected in 2015 the final year of the goals and (2) a study of the main efforts to set up international cooperation addressing climate change from the kyoto treaty to the recent climate mitigation deal between china and the united states. in both of these areas we confront the concrete developments with the normative theories discussed in the first part of the course. the third part of the course is initially devoted to the design of a research proposal before carrying out the proposal in the thesis. students are free to articulate a predominantly theoretical or a more policy-oriented perspective in choosing to discuss particular issues in the areas of poverty alleviation and/or coping with climate change. recommended prior knowledge some knowledge of political theory is certainly desirable. but not essential provided that the student is willing to engage with political theory’s methods and styles of normative argumentation about international poilitics. registration by submitting the registration form before tuesday 2 december 2014 (midnight). the form will be sent to your student email account after the thesis market on tuesday 25 november 2014. teaching method research project format: group work in seminar form in the first and second parts of the course (see content) with occasional individual work in preparation of the ma thesis proposal; individual work in submission and implementation of the thesis proposal with occasional group progress reporting sessions in the third part of the course. contact hours course weekteaching methodhours/weekremarks1 - 20werkcollege3these contact hours are approximate and do not include hours for assignments hours for reading etc. extra classes may be planned. please see the course manual (syllabus) on blackboard for more details. time please see  select “add timetable” than “add course timetable” and search for either the course title or the course catalogue number. study materials to be announced in the course outline min/max participants max 10 students. assessment and testing seminar participation and thesis. please see the thesis manual at:  the final deadline for handing in your thesis is friday 26 june 2015.',\n",

       " 'objectives \"getting acquainted with epictetus stoic philosophy with the way in which he deals with his predecessors and with the way in which later generations dealt with his writings\" contents epictetus (ca. 50 – ca. 125 a.d.) is one of the three main representatives of the so-called new stoa. he had a school of stoic philosophy in nicopolis (northwest greece). he did not compose any works himself. among his pupils was arrian who took notes of his lectures four books of which have come down to us. the best-known work of epictetus however is the encheiridion (handbook or manual) in which arrian gives a brief overview of epictetus’ philosophy.in the extant lectures epictetus is mainly concerned with ethics. his message is expressed\\\\xa0 succinctly in chapter 8 of the encheiridion: “do not seek to have events happen as you wish but wish them to happen as they do happen and all will be well with you.” time and again epictetus states that it is deeds not words that count. the theory of stoic philosophy is not an end in itself but it should be the guide for everyday life. in many places epictetus quotes or refers to works of others both philosophers and non-philosophers. among the latter homer takes up a prominent position. epictetus uses passages from the poets both in a positive and in a negative sense. often he gives a specific twist to a quotation adapting it to his own argument.the influence of epictetus in later times almost exclusively depends on the encheiridion. this work has been the subject of a bulky commentary by the sixth-century neoplatonist philosopher simplicius. the work also strongly appealed to the christians as appears from the fact that no less than three christian adaptations of the encheiridion have come down to us. one of these adaptations in its turn has been the subject of a commentary by an anonymous author. later reception of epictetus includes matteo ricci’s book of twenty-five sayings composed in chinese (early 17th century) and the works of teilhard de chardin (first world war). the rational emotive therapy by albert ellis is ultimately based on epictetus. in this course you will get an introduction to stoic philosophy. a number of texts of epictetus both from the lectures and the encheiridion will be studied in detail. special attention will be paid to epictetus’ method of handling quotations. the study of the reception of epictetus will be started with the lecture of the first two books of the meditations by the emperor marcus aurelius. next comes simplicius’ commentary. then the attention will shift to the christian world. after an introduction on the monastic life which was the context in which the adaptations originated the three adaptations themselves will be studied as well as the commentary on one of these. to end we will deal with some chapters in the history of the later reception of epictetus ending with tom wolfe’s magnificent novel a man in full (1998). registration this course is being offered at the vu. students with a vunetid can register from july 15 until september 8 on  . the webapplication for registration is valid for uva courses only. teaching method seminar study materials to be announced assessment and testing oral presentation; written exam remarks target group:master students of classics attending the courses is obligatory',\n",

what distinguishes creative persons and creative products? how are the processes that lead to creative results characterised? these questions have turned out to be very difficult to answer. at first when asked to define what creativity is people will respond by referring to artists like michelangelo and charlie chaplin scientists like darwin and einstein or entrepreneurs like coco chanel and steve jobs. however even though these persons may exemplify creativity it gives us little insight in what creativity is or why their products are called creative. indeed at the most we may hope to find out that they share some personality traits or that there are some similarities in their biographies or careers related to their creativity. in addition such comparisons may show how they went about in their daily practice or what exercises did enhance their creativity. moreover investigations have even yielded insights that creativity floursihes\\\\xa0 particularly within certain geographies or cities and that certain cultural or historical conditions foster creativity more than others. we will be discussing such insights critically in order to get a fuller grasp of those characteristics and conditions that facilitate creativity. but creativity is in the first place a matter of creations: works of art scientific discoveries technological inventions political innovations and the like. is it possible to find common properties of these? according to boden’s influential definition creative results are new surprising and valuable. however this does raise some questions: new for whom and in what respect? how can we determine the value of a certain creation? by reviewing and discussing artistic scientific and other creative products we will try to determine why these stand out in comparison to many other contributions in those fields. this will require us to analyse in more abstract terms the domains at stake in order to describe adequately the properties of those creations. doing so we may wonder whether we come across rules or algorithms that would allow computer programs to produce creative works or solutions – or can’t computers be creative? in short we will be investigating reviewing analyzing and discussing creativity from many perspectives making this course truly interdisciplinary. furthermore students must be prepared not only to engage in academic work but also go out and engage with works of art interview a creative person and so on. in doing so all participants will not only gain a better grasp of what creativity is but also how it can be recognized better. as a result each participant should also learn how creativity can be stimulated and enhanced in his own life. the course ‘what is creativity?’ is open to all honours students of the uva vu and auc. recommended prior knowledge none registration registration is possible for first and second year students participating in an honours programme via an online registration form which will be made available from june 5th at 10 am to june 10th 2014 at 5 pm on  placement will be at random. if there are still spots open after the 10th of june students will still be able to register. part of registration for the module is the writing of a motivation letter and participating in an introductory meeting. these meetings will take place around the 25th 26th and 27th of june. specific dates and additional information will follow soon. teaching method seminars and lectures with active student participation time for update information see  study materials literature will be provided via blackboard or has to be obtained by students themselves. students are required to visit a museum concert theatre in order to observe creative products and reflect upon these. costs for admission etc. have to be paid by the students themselves. min/max participants 25 max. assessment and testing reviews (2x; 30%); group presentation (15%); final essay (30%); poster presentation (15%); participation (10 %). remarks during this course we will investigate and discuss creativity in art science and elsewhere. as the course provides the students with conceptual and theoretical tools they will be invited to apply these tools to experiences outside class. students must therefore be prepared to e.g. visit an exhibition and performance of their own choice to interview an expert and to report about these in class or in written reviews.',\n",

it is about the organisation of social hierarchies; it signifies the field of studying truth claims; and it implies the study of agency. some studies focus on nation-states and organisations others on individual actors while others on social structures of which the previous two are inherently part of (such as global markets ngos or organised ideologies). all studies are interested in the intersection of different variables (gender sexuality race/ethnicity class age et cetera) to understand how power is divided in society and among societies which truth claims are generated which groups are included and excluded and how people respond as agentive actors. lecturers from different social scientific disciplines will provide case studies where (theoretically informed) methodology empirical research and analyses are explained step by step. recommended prior knowledge basic knowledge of gender and sexuality is recommended. the lecturer will recommend students without prior knowledge some additional key readings. registration \"students of the research master social sciences\\\\xa0can register for this course in sis-uva 2 december 8:30 to 16 december 2014 13:00. for more information on how to register for courses in sis see  search for your programme go to a-z and click on sis.\" teaching method students are expected to attend the thematic lectures to read all the literature and to actively participate in class discussion. participation is required in at least 9 of the 11 meetings. absentia needs to be communicated in advance. students are expected to prepare four short response papers (approx. 750 words) that critically review the required readings for a given week and discuss how the readings relate to each other.\\\\xa0 each student once holds a presentation during meetings in the first part of the course based on his/her literature response paper. the presentation may not be a summary of all required literature of that meeting but must be a critical reflection of the theme or a sub-theme of the topic. it is welcomed that the presentation is also based on other than the compulsory literature. the presentation should result in a (provocative) position which can be discussed. before the class discussion of the literature first of all a discussant will react to the presentation. at the end of the seminar a longer paper (approx. 6000 words including references) is due. students are then expected to write a brief paper that is more of a research proposal paper on a topical issue where they follow the same stages of a) the formulation of a research question b) clarification of which data will be looked-for and c) which methodology is therefore needed. contact hours course weekteaching methodhours/week6 - 22werkcollege3 time for an updated schedule please have a look at our online time schedules:  study materials articles book chapters etc. will be uploaded on blackboard. assessment and testing four literature reviews 40%presentation 20%final paper 40% \"according to the teaching and examination regulations (see\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z click rules and regulations) a student is eligible to a re-sit an exam/paper only if s/he participated in the first examination round. only in case of extenuating circumstances (serious illness or death of a family member sickness) in the period close to the examination (until 10 days before) and provided that the course coordinator was informed beforehand and a written statement of the extenuating circumstances was provided the student is eligible to participate in the second round without having participated in the first round.\" \"after a fail grade in the first round the highest grade awarded in the second round is a 6.0. a student with a pass grade in the first round may opt for a retake/rewrite but for rewritten papers/assignments the highest grade awarded in the second round is one grade point higher than the original one. for further guidelines and specifications regarding re-sits see the rules & guidelines of the examination board at\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z click rules and regulations.\" remarks \"the provisions of the regulations governing fraud and plagiarism for uva students apply in full. access this regulation at\\\\xa0 search your programme go to a-z and click on plagiarism and fraud - general.\" the course will use blackboard extensively as a channel of communication. in general students are advised to check blackboard on a regular basis for any changes and/or additional references or any other course related matter. blackboard can be entered through the following link:',\n",

how can that be realized? mobility energy and food are in this respect the core issues. the supply and distribution of food to and within our metropolises is a logistical tour de force and depends on the type and intensity of usage of space in and around the city as well as on the combination of multiple types of land uses within limited spaces. in the field of urban farming organic markets regional food supply and healthy food a lot of initiatives already exists; not only in the netherlands but just also in metropolises like london and new york. content of the course in this course questions like which role can urban farming play?

(communication skills) contents life is full of examples in which behavior of individuals seems not only motivated by self-interest i.e. when solidarity towards other human being across geography and time is at stake. for instance self-interest cannot properly explain modes of intergenerational solidarity or support for african farmers by western citizens buying fair-trade produce. individuals are nonetheless often not motivated to be solidary (i.e. progressive taxes support for debt cancellation) and both economics and psychology often provide possible grounds for even doubting the value and existence of solidarity (market inefficiency reciprocity and self interest). the goal of this course is to provide insight into how individual preferences and societal preferences can be aligned by encouraging the individual towards acknowledging and incorporating the desirable societal and/or long-term goal. in doing so students will continuously evaluate the desirability of solidarity the limits to solidarity and the extent to which solidarity is in fact disguised self-interest. thus students are encouraged to think independently and critically about this challenge. teaching method to be announced time please consult  study materials to be announced assessment and testing to be announced please go to ',\n",

       " 'objectives students will develop a systematic understanding of the dynamic relationship between market interactions and patterns of governance across national and international levels of analysis. building on the second year course political economy they will considerably enhance their understanding of the conceptual case as to how and why the institutions of governance and dynamics of the market should be studied as an integrated whole and of the different approaches involved in so doing. this knowledge will be applied to the most important contemporary policy issues in the international domain from trade and finance to labour economic development and social justice. students will also develop their skills in terms of reading comprehension; scholarly research analysis and writing; and the oral presentation of research findings. contents how might we best understand a world that is changing with bewildering speed a world of financial crisis great recession global imbalances a collapsing eurozone environmental risk new trade and investment partnerships and threatening political developments? concentrating on the international level this course builds on the second year core module ‘political economy’ in the bsc programme and aims to demonstrate that a political economy approach is particularly helpful to our understanding of these phenomena and of what might be done. political economy starts from the premise that the political economic and social domains are integrated and that we must develop the intellectual tools with which to understand the dynamics of this integrated whole. in this sense political economy is inherently interdisciplinary as a field of study. the economy is viewed as much as a political creation as it is the result of the interaction of private firms and other agents in competition with each other. systems of governance and ‘political’ choices are shaped as much by the preferences and interactions of economic agents as by governments and international agreements. international political economy (ipe) recognises that social and economic structures and interactions are seldom precisely coterminous with national or local systems of formal government: that they have never fully respected the boundaries of rulers who fancied themselves in control. this is an acknowledgement that something ‘global’ is going on but it might not be what you think ‘it’ is! the course begins by refreshing students’ understanding of the classical origins of political economy as a field of study. the course will proceed to analyse critically the different (interdisciplinary) intellectual tools and approaches at our disposal to explore the field of ipe. this involves exploring the diversity of intellectual traditions through the (international) political economy literature as contrasted with the study of ‘traditional’ economic and political ‘sciences’. the aim is to demonstrate a systematic relationship between the dynamics of markets and shifting patterns/institutions of governance. the second part of the course turns to an empirical examination of the historical emergence of our modern global economy in relation to the various theoretical approaches explored in part one. this includes addressing debates about the period of industrialisation the economic collapse of the great depression and the ‘new beginning’ after world war 2. the third part of the course explores a range of contemporary policy issues and global developments in relation to the number of sessions available and the mix may change depending on the year and context. these issues typically include the problem of industrial production and world trade monetary issues financial markets economic (under-) development processes labour/migration energy/resources gender social justice and the environment among others. particularly with respect to the political economy of development the course will look at a range of these issues in regional context and will also consider the rise of the emerging markets (china other transition economies latin america and south/east asia) in the global political economy and system of governance. care will be taken to carry the theoretical material over into the empirical analysis and to devote sufficient attention to the current great recession/financial crisis and the debate about the reform of global governance institutions. recommended prior knowledge students should have had exposure to political economy and/or to basic concepts in policy studies and macroeconomics. this course is taught at the final year ba level. registration via sis-uva. bekijk de academische kalender op onze website ( voor de inschrijfperiodes. exchange students are contacted by the exchange coordinator regarding enrollment. studenten politicologie dienen de kernmodule: internationale betrekkingen te hebben afgerond om zich hiervoor te kunnen inschrijven. teaching method seminar course with student participation time  the above link will take you to the timetables website of the uva. for this course select the following values: faculty: faculteit der maatschappij- en gedragswetenschappeninstitute: sociale wetenschappen (csw/gsss) study materials integral use of one course text will be made and this should be purchased: o’brien robert and williams marc global political economy: evolution and dynamics fourth edition (london: palgrave macmillan 2014). in addition extensive use will be made of online journal resource via blackboard or the digital library. please refer to the annual course outline. cost within the guidelines min/max participants max. 25 assessment and testing course attendance and participation; mid-term written assignment; research essay including presentation; final exam refer to examination schedule and course outline remarks students are expected to spend a minimum of 20 hours a week (including course sessions) on this course. to receive a grade students must complete successfully and submit on time all elements of course assessment as specified in the course outline for the year in question. material submitted after specified deadlines is not eligible for a resit. you must also pass the final examination to receive a grade in the course.',\n",
