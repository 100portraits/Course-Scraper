You will be able to explain how Gestalt laws influence the way people view and interpret visual displays of data, how people extract information from graphs, and what limitations are of the human visual system. In particular, you will be familiar with the Cleveland-McGill hierarchy, misleading and distorting effects of commonly made visualisation errors, perceptually effective encoding of quantities and categories, Tufte’s design principles, and Gestalt laws. You will be able to leverage these insights to enhance and optimise graphical display of data for efficient communication. You will have learned to work with various visualisation tools are popular in the data science community. These include R/ggplot, Tableau, and Shiny. As storytelling with graphs and charts often requires the rearrangement and slicing and dicing of data tables, you will also have learned to work with various data manipulation techniques using R, Excel, and SQL.', 'Contents', 'This course provides an introduction to principles for clear and effective communication of data analytic insights using visualisations.

Intelligence organizations are supposed to protect the nation against strategic and surprise attacks. The prevention of surprise attacks regularly failed, and in sometimes spectacular ways, such as with the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the 9/11 attacks in 2001. We will analyze what intelligence organizations try and can achieve, and how American politicians respond to so-called intelligence failures. One type of response is to increase intelligence activities, and gather more information on individual Americans. Such activities lead to questions about the role and power of the state, and the right to privacy. The Bill of Rights, and notably the Fourth Amendment, plays an important role in the discussion about the right of American citizens to their freedom and the permissibility of the activities of intelligence organizations.', 'The focus of the course is on twentieth and twenty-first century events, when organizations like the FBI, CIA, and NSA came into existence and defined American intelligence activities. The role and activities of intelligence institutions is determined by the political context in which they function, and therefore the organization of the American political system will also be discussed. Notably, but not uniquely, President Trump has shown that the relationship between president and intelligence organizations determines the quality of both intelligence work and policy making. The course does not only deal with the American domestic debate on intelligence, but is also about American intelligence activities abroad, ranging from covert actions to change the political balance in other nations, to efforts to check the on-line and cell phone activities of individuals globally.', 'As part of the course, students will write two papers based on either an FBI or CIA report, to gain insight into the quality of intelligence reports, but also into the challenges to gain reliable research results.', '', 'Registration', 'Zie ‘Vakaanmelding’ in de A-Z lijst van de bachelor Geschiedenis op student.uva.nl.', 'Teaching method', 'Lectures - on average 2 contact hours per week.', 'Time', 'See the timetable of this course on rooster.uva.nl.', 'Check the timetable before going to class, in case of changes.', 'Study materials', 'Mark M.
