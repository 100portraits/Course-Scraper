“I don’t like it but that’s how it works”: Exploring Greek millennials’ perceptions of personalized advertising on Facebook and Instagram.,Kalliopi Tsatsarou,2021-06-30,['Anouk Mols'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the current digitalized era of social media, numerous companies choose to track and collect people’s data to display personalized advertising on social platforms based on consumers’ lifestyles and preferences. The usefulness of that practice lies in delivering consumers content that is relevant to their interests. Every day, a vast amount of consumers’ personal information (i.e. location, gender, and age) and browsing activity (i.e. websites visited, likes, and shares) are tracked to help companies promote their products and services successfully. Thus, personalized advertising and data tracking constitute forms of consumer surveillance. Of course, this practice directly affects consumers whose personal data is used by companies. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate Greek millennials’ perceptions of personalized advertising that they find on their Facebook and Instagram feeds. To obtain in-depth information of consumers’ knowledge, experiences, as well as feelings around personalized advertising and gain an explicit understanding of them, a qualitative method was used. In particular, 14 in-depth interviews were conducted with Greek millennials consumers. The transcripts were analyzed using the constructivist grounded theory approach and five overarching themes emerged from the findings.
All these themes highlighted that consumers experience personalized advertising on social media in three different ways. Pleasant reactions occur when advertisements are close to consumers’ interests and preferences because marketers offer them useful and helpful content. Also, consumers respond positively to personalized advertisements because of their awareness that media creators/developments get paid by advertising. Contrarily, consumer annoyance occurs due to repetitive and misaligned personalized advertising. Besides, fearful reactions are expected because of online risks like hacking, and misuse of personal data. Consumers experience targeted advertising apathetically because they are knowledgeable of the data tracking mechanisms that companies use. As a result, they have compromised with the way the advertising system operates. Interestingly, privacy concerns were only raised due to highly personalized advertisements (i.e. based on private conversations) and it was perceived as invasive in people’s personal lives. Consequently, people have adopted a protective online behavior towards their personal data. They were also motivated to manage their privacy in two ways; by deciding under which circumstances they will self-disclose and by adopting privacy-preserving practices such as deleting cookies, and private navigation.","['surveillance', 'data tracking', 'personalized advertising', 'social media', 'personal data', 'privacy', 'privacy-preserving practices']"
"Does CSR communication matter? Understanding the effectiveness of CSR motives, CSR message frame and CSR fit when communicating about corporate-NGO partnerships",Jasmin Schade,2021-06-30,['Dr. Yijing Wang'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","While societal power dynamics are subject to constant change, this also applies to the relationship between two of the key institutional actors within society - companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). With the increasing importance of CSR, corporations and NGOs have started to work together to achieve societal goals. As a result, corporate-NGO partnerships are gaining increasing importance as part of a company’s CSR effort. However, at the same time, it is becoming increasingly difficult for corporations to effectively communicate their CSR activities since consumers are skeptical about corporations’ involvement in CSR. Taking these two developments into account, this study aims to investigate the communication of corporate-NGO partnerships, by specifically focusing on which CSR communication tactics (CSR motive, CSR message frame, CSR fit) lead to more positive consumer outcomes. Since skepticism has been identified to play a key role in the outcomes of CSR communication tactics, this study also aims to shed light on the mediating role of situational CSR skepticism which can be understood as a direct reaction to corporate communication efforts. In addition, the mediating role of consumer trust as a potential antagonist of skepticism is examined. Grounded on attribution theory, the heuristic-systematic model, and the persuasion knowledge model, this study provides insights into underlying information processing mechanisms. Taken together, the following research questions are investigated: To what extend do CSR motives (firm-serving vs. public-serving), CSR message frame (expositive vs. narrative), and CSR fit (high vs. low) affect consumer attitudes and eWOM when communicating corporate-NGO partnerships? How do skepticism and consumer trust mediate the proposed relationships? To answer the research questions, a between-subjects factorial quasi experimental research design with eight experimental scenarios was deployed. Participant recruitment was conducted via Prolific, and the final sample encompassed 383 respondents. The results confirmed that consumer attitudes and eWOM can be influenced through expressed CSR motives. Expressed public-serving CSR motives resulted in more positive consumer attitudes and higher eWOM compared to firm-serving CSR motives. Situational CSR skepticism and consumer trust both mediated the affiliation between CSR motives and consumer outcomes. In addition, situational CSR skepticism and consumer trust seem to function as antagonists because expressed firm-serving motives increased situational CSR skepticism and decreased consumer trust. Since situational CSR skepticism is associated with persuasion knowledge, which is partly triggered by cognitive elaboration, expressed firmserving CSR motives seem to increase elaborative thoughts in the context of corporate-NGO partnerships. However, CSR message frame and CSR fit had no effect on consumer outcomes and, consequently, the relationship was also not mediated by either situational CSR skepticism or consumer trust. Overall, the results widen the scope of CSR communication research by focusing on corporate-NGO partnerships in particular. The findings call for further research on the effect NGOs’ involvement in a company’s CSR activity has on the outcomes of different CSR communication tactics, the underlying level of consumer’s cognitive elaboration when processing CSR messages, and the role of dispositional CSR skepticism.","['corporate-NGO partnership', 'CSR communication', 'consumer outcomes', 'situational CSR', 'skepticism', 'consumer trust']"
Creating Responsible Innovation in sub-Saharan Africa’s Digital Agricultural.  A Case Study Approach,Diana Fletcher,2021-06-30,['Dr. Payal Arora'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing conceptual debate on Responsible Innovation, and its application to the smallholder farmer context in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently the continent is facing stagnant growth within its agricultural sector. Advanced digital technologies such as smart farming and precision agriculture are being pushed as the fix-all solution to stimulating growth. However, little attention has been paid to its appropriateness or the potential socio-ethical impact such technology might bring to the sector and smallholder farming communities. Therefore, this study set out to answer the following research question: How do agricultural organisations create responsible innovation using digital media within the farming sector in sub-Saharan Africa? Based on a qualitative case study of the hybrid seed developer, East-West Seed, it was possible to identify the role of digital media within the organisation’s activities and how these digital tools could facilitate Responsible Innovation in the agricultural sector. The findings suggest that effective innovative solutions do not just have to come from novel technologies but from the novel application of existing technologies into new contexts. Simple ICT technologies such as radio and mobile phones were found to assist the organisation in overcoming longentrenched structural barriers such as poor infrastructure as well as lack of access to markets, capital, government support and knowledge, which currently plague the sub-Saharan African context. Radio’s broad reach and accessibility was found to be an inclusive medium for sharing knowledge and allowing farmers to learn from each other. Social media was identified as an effective tool for enabling the inclusion of youths and assisting the innovation process to respond challenges and reflect on future trajectories. Finally, the ability of mobile learning apps to tailor their content to specific contexts, as well as their combination of text and internet were found to be useful for suitably replacing in-person visits from technical officers. However, for agricultural organisations to fully drive innovations that are ethical, resilient, and sustainable, this study showed that a broader conception of inclusion along gender-based terms as well as a greater emphasis on anticipating potential impact is needed. This study can therefore serve as a next step in the theoretical and practical development of responsible within the agricultural sector.","['Agriculture', 'Digital Media', 'Responsible Innovation', 'Africa', 'Smallholder Farming']"
F1’s We Race As One: a man’s world through the female consumer,Julia Keyner,2021-06-30,['Dr. Marco Scalvini'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Formula One has for the majority of its existence always been a man's world, where the sport was made by, ruled by, and executed by men. In recent years, the desire for more female representation in the sport has become more prominent, with the ban of the grid girls being one of the most impactful decisions. It came to an all-time high through the initiative We Race As One in 2020. As F1 has previously stated not wanting to be involved in and affiliated with sociopolitical issues, it indicated the start of a new era in the sport. The topic of branding and Formula One is academically underdeveloped and has largely not  been researched greatly. Previous academic research regarding Formula One has not considered looking at the view of the minority of the fans and considered their lack of representation in the sport and the effect of this cause. This thesis, for the first time, sheds a light on how female consumers view the recent developments in Formula One. The main research question focuses on this problem by stating “What is the female consumer’s view of Formula One’s initiative “We Race As One”?”. This is answered by the two sub-questions “To what extent is F1 brand activism perceived as effective?” and the second sub-question is “How are F1 and We Race As One co-constructed through the view of female consumers?”. To research this, 10 female consumers from different countries were interviewed through semi-structured interviews, which were all transcribed, coded, and analyzed. The coding and analysis were done with reflexive thematic analysis and a deductive approach. The collected data showed the hesitancy of the female consumer in regard to We Race As One. Most participants doubt the sincerity of the initiative and view it as done under pressure. Nonetheless, the female consumer sees We Race As One as  progressive, as it allows a platform for women and minorities in the sport. While the want and desire for more females in the sport is greatly present, the hesitancy to see it come to reality remains and is instilled in the consumer. In terms of brand co-construction, the female consumer indicates not minding the masculine traits the sport offers and resists hegemonic masculinity at this point. Negativity experienced by the female consumer is mainly found online by other male consumers by diminishing the role of the female in the sport and community. The subjectivity and normativity built by the female consumer results in the construction of their own reality and discourse, allowing for agency and freedom in the masculine environment of Formula One.","['Brand co-construction', 'branding', 'hypermasculinity', 'subjectivity', 'Formula One']"
Exploring How Consumers Build a Preference for Financial Institution Brands Through the use of Bank Services. An analysis of consumer needs and identities,Patrick de Lange,2021-06-30,['Dr. Matthijs Leendertse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Financial institution brands are brands that everyone has undoubtable interreacted with. As a result, banks do not necessarily have the opportunity to target and select their desired clientele. Instead, they must tailor their services to every possible client. Therefore, this study will seek to explore and understand how consumers build a preference for financial institution brands to ultimately provide insight towards future marketing practices. This study also takes a self-categorization perspective to understand how bank clients ponder different financial services to ultimately build a preferred brand. It is also through the social self and private self that it was possible to study financial services and ultimately build a holistic approach to studying brand preference of financial institutions.
This study took a qualitative approach to understanding the building process of consumer brand preference. A non-probability snowball sampling method was taken to collect the sample. It was then through semi-structured in-depth interviews that 18- to 24-year-old Canadians were interviewed. By understanding the contributing factors of this building process will allow banks to better understand and target this customer segment. It was through theory driven themes that inferences were made from the acquired data. These themes were competency, autonomy, consumer benefits, convenience, corporate social responsibility and external validation.
The data has shown that the theme of external validation was the most prominent, the interviewees became members of their banks as a result of convenience and external influences, particularly their parents. Although this is a significant finding, customers have not necessarily built a strong preference, instead they build a very utilitarian relationship with their banks. External, social self, motives lead consumers to becoming members of a bank, whereas private self factors such as competency, autonomy and convenience contribute towards the long-term relationship building process. Contrary to what the theory has discussed, themes such as prestige and social status were rather uncommon, bank customers were mostly focused on what they personally need in terms of financial services.
It is therefore important for banks to target prospective clients at a very young age or through their parents, as it is rather unlikely that they will change financial institutions later on. Future marketing experts will have a better understanding of their target audience and financial institutions will be able to provide better services for their customers.","['Brand preference', 'financial institutions', 'financial services', 'extrinsic motivation', 'intrinsic motivation', 'social self', 'private self.']"
Made for Mobile. Exploring the effect of vertical video formats on online public television viewer experience,Derk Molijn,2021-06-30,"['Dr. Suzanna Opree', 'Dr. Petra Tenbült']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","A renewed orientation on vertical content is becoming more prevalent in both the academic and social domain. With vertical content recently experiencing widespread implementation in countless of contexts, questions are raised as to how mobile users respond to this format. Consequently, this research examined the effect of vertical video formats on the viewer experience and subsequent user satisfaction of individuals exposed to news content on a mobile phone. By doing so, a first step is taken in empirically assessing how vertical video content is perceived by individuals in a context of news consumption. Through theory on Public Service Media, vertical formats and viewer experience, this research sheds light on a media production domain that aims to strike a balances between public value and digital innovation. Arriving at the hypotheses, this research aimed to uncover the impact of different video formats on the self-reported perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use, flow state and user satisfaction of participants. A between-subject experiment was conducted with emphasis on a sample that matched the target audience of Dutch public broadcaster NPO. In total, three different video formats (horizontal format, vertical format, responsive vertical format) were developed and compared with each other. In each of the three conditions, participants were exposed to the same news item, albeit in a different format. The results show that a responsive vertical format, which is not only screen-filling but also accounts for a potential loss of information caused by cropping the original footage, results in an improved viewer experience in comparison to a horizontal format. It was found that the positive viewer experience induced by the responsive vertical video led to an increase in user satisfaction, which in its turn resulted in a continued intention to watch vertical video content. The empirical findings underwrite the potential of vertical content in successfully reaching audiences. When transforming existing horizontal content however, the success of a vertical adaptation is largely dependent on how the original footage was produced. Future research could develop on these findings by comparing horizontal video to vertical content that was originally shot and produced with vertical viewing in mind.","['Mobile content', 'Screen format', 'Vertical video', 'Public service media', 'Viewer experience']"
A Demand for Corporate Social Responsibility during COVID-19 Pandemic. The Case of Poland,Weronika Reiwer,2021-06-30,['Rashid Gabdulhakov'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis aims to describe how CSR adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic within the Polish market. This aim is pursued by taking a closer look at the demand side for CSR initiatives of Polish customers as well as by analyzing how companies communicate their CSR activities in times of crisis and which CSR initiatives they engaged in. The Polish case represents a fascinating and relevant CSR study as for the last 20+ the country has been trying to become more like other European countries in the sphere of sustainability and social initiatives and make up for the period of transformation from the state-controlled market. As such, the study of the Polish market has great relevance and can be duplicated on other former socialist states that also joined European Union. Mixed method research has been implemented in the study to address the research questions. The research of both the perception of CSR by the Polish citizens and companies’ communication strategies has been studied with the help of an online survey, interview, and the analysis of the 21 press releases. The part of the study that focuses on how companies communicated their CSR practices during the time of crisis is based on the case of the Polish company - LPP. LPP is a Polish clothing company that owns five brands – Reserved, Mohito, Sinsay, House, and Cropp. Since 2014 they have been included in the WIG20 index on the Polish stock market, which includes the 20 largest companies in the country. The results show that in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic, customers express the demand for CSR initiatives, and they expect the companies to engage in them. Furthermore, examining LPP’s press releases and interviewing the company’s representatives revealed the types of CSR initiatives the company engaged with during the COVID-19 pandemic. The interview also shed light on the communication channels and strategies used by the company. During the COVID-19 pandemic company mostly used online communication channels to share different CSR messages. The literature review highlighted gaps presented in studies, gaps that this thesis aimed to fill. The thesis delivered new knowledge and based on the findings it also gives direction for future research.","['Corporate Social Responsibility', 'COVID-19 Pandemic', 'Poland', 'CSR Communication', 'perception of CSR']"
THE DEVELOPMENT OF BRAND PREFERENCE. An investigation into how consumers develop preference for beer brands over time,Ruben Bronsink,2021-06-30,['Drs. Matthijs Leendertse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In today’s consumer market, consumers have to make more choices between different brands than in the past. For almost every product, there are multiple brands to choose from, often placed right next to each other on the shelf. Therefore, creating brand preference among consumers is essential for brands. Previous studies have focused on quantitatively showing which marketing concepts affect brand preference. However, these studies only focus on brand preference at a certain point in time. In addition, the focus on quantitatively establishing correlations between marketing concepts does not provide knowledge on how brand preference is developed. This study takes a qualitative approach to answer the following research question: How do consumers develop a preference for beer brands over time? The three main constructs that are used as the basis of the research are brand equity, self-congruity, and brand experience. These constructs have been quantitatively proven to influence brand preference and are therefore an excellent starting point to study how brand preference develops over time. Semi structured interviews with 11 beer consumers are used to gather data and a thematic analysis with theory driven themes is used to analyze the data. The results show that for brand preference the development over time indeed plays a crucial role. For beer brands, it is mainly developed through close contact with the brand and most importantly, repeated usage of the brand. This helps to create brand experiences while it simultaneously plays a role in developing brand equity. Marketing efforts also play a role in the development of brand preference, but for the participants it is not as important as previous studies suggest. The results show that for consumers, sensory experiences and positive brand associations are important. High self-congruity is not a reason for consumers to prefer a brand. However, low self-congruity, a complete mismatch between the self-concept and brand-user image is a reason for consumers to not prefer a brand. Lastly, the results show that the development of the three main constructs cannot be seen as separate processes, but together contribute to the development of brand preference, while also affecting each other.","['brands', 'brand preference', 'brand equity', 'self-congruity', 'brand experience.']"
‘(Dis)connecting’ - Interpersonal communication for young professionals during enforced home-based telework (HBTW). A qualitative study,Imke Greven,2021-06-30,['Anouk Mols'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Home-based teleworking (HBTW) has been intensively growing in the Netherlands, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, teleworkers have been primarily researched in comparison to face-to-face workers. However, this body of research leaves many gaps, such as the state of enforced remote work, different fields of occupation in this setting of enforced remote work and different age groups. The involuntary nature of HBTW in this research is key to understanding the experience of teleworking young professionals. The current thesis aims to explore how young professionals in the Netherlands experience HBTW, with a specific focus on interpersonal communication, relationships, and boundary work through the following research question: How do Dutch young professionals experience interpersonal communication in an enforced remote workplace? To answer the research question, 12 in-depth interviews were conducted with a variety of young knowledge workers, in the fields of marketing, accounting, consultancy and HR. This data was analyzed through a constructivist grounded theory approach and resulted into three selective codes. These three selective codes are: implications of formal virtuality, which entails the implications of formal virtual communication, but also the increased formality of communication in the workplace. The second selective code is relationships and social deprivation, which stress the importance of relationships, informal communication, trust and social facilitation for a positive work environment. Lastly increased boundary negotiations explain how the lines between professional and personal lines are being blurred, how young professionals are responding to this and the opportunity they see. The present study contributes to the growing body of literature on HBTW in various ways. Firstly, it expands the knowledge on how the digital natives of contemporary society experience implications of HBTW. Moreover, it fills in a gap in research on boundary work regarding the factor of non-voluntary adoption of remote work environments. Societal and managerial implications are suggested to insist future decisionmakers to invest in young professionals, the workforce of the future. These explorations pave the way for future research to expand on. Suggestions for future research entail more research on enforced remote work in other demographics, but also on ways in which the benefits of social facilitation could be fostered through virtual offices.","['HBTW', 'interpersonal communication', 'virtual teams', 'enforced remote work', 'boundary work']"
Value Creation in Online Bedroom Pop Scenes,Penelope Peta Frances Goemans,2021-06-30,['Dr. Erik Hitters'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Three artists were selcted as case studies for this examination of the creation of value in online ‘bedroom pop’ scenes.

Woozy, The Marias and Orion, it is possible to examine how fans interact with each other as well as the artists themselves. Bedroom pop is an internet based genre of music whose creators write, produce and distribute their music from the comfort of their own homes, aided by the development of high quality home production software and equipment. This study will use pervious research on scenes to examine how ‘bedroom pop’ differs from traditional music genres. Specifically, this will examine online scenes which are the primary space for scene creation rather than suplimentary to the space specific scene, as this is what is unique about bedroom pop. Instagram comments and captions were scraped from 57 total posts. A thematic analysis was conducted on the comments and captions in order to answer the research question; ‘How is value created in emerging online “bedroom pop” scenes?’. Findings showed a lack of interaction between fans and the artists, as well as bridging between fans, and an emphasis on social capital. Moreover, the artists used the space to create a narrative of authenticity in oder to utailise indie underground aethetics to connect to fans.","['bedroom pop', 'scene creation', 'value production', 'online scenes', 'Instagram']"
Post-pandemic tourism: old wine in new bottles? A study of the European tourism industry post Covid-19: a qualitative content analysis of news media narratives,Esmée Kevser,2021-06-30,['Dr. Radhika Mittal'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, the European tourism sector used to account for 50% of the world’s tourism arrivals on a yearly basis, making the continent the biggest producer of tourism in the world. Consequently, revenues produced by tourism and associated businesses, such as the food and drinks sector, contributed approximately 10% to Europe’s GDP. However, the tourism industry has been widely disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, causing a standstill in global travel as mobility restrictions were implemented in an attempt to contain the virus. As a result, the European tourism industry is suffering huge losses, leaving many jobs at risk. However, the future remains unclear. Since the abrupt halt to tourism, a substantial body of work has been published about the future directions of the tourism sector. This study will add to this existing debate by providing a news media analysis, aiming to examine what narratives are employed to construct the future of the European tourism industry in particular. This is an interesting study setting because the context of Europe – and the European Union in particular – serves as an example of globalization in the sense that it is an ecosystem with multiple shared interests (trade, security, economics). Because of this, lessons learned from the European context can be applied to the wider context of worldwide interconnectedness that characterizes 21st century globalization. Within the context of tourism, it has also been demonstrated that news media play a paramount role in influencing and directing public perception and in turn, policy and governance decisions. Therefore, news analysis can serve to better understand public opinion as well as the agenda of policymakers – the agents that ultimately define what future tourism practices will look like. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to find an answer to the following research question: “How do European online news outlets construct the future of the European tourism industry after the impact of Covid-19?”. In order to reach an answer, 44 news articles published by a variety of European sources were analysed by means of a qualitative content analysis. In the end, multiple narratives were found in the dataset, ranging from the construction of a more sustainable industry, to a return to the previous status-quo. In the construction of a more sustainable tourism industry, many tourism trends were identified. Additionally, changes in consumer behaviour as a result of the health emergency were illuminated. Additionally, another key finding centred around the realisation for tourism practices to diversify in order to be more resilient. However, the main finding of this study is that news media were underpinned by a sense of uncertainty throughout, as all narratives were constructed with a sense of caution. This was not completely unexpected since health emergencies like the Covid-19 pandemic are known to be characterized by heightened levels of uncertainty and fear.","['Tourism', 'Covid-19', 'European tourism', 'Tourism trends', 'News narratives', 'Pandemic']"
Domestic violence in Colombian film: Libia Gómez’s “Ella”. Exploring feminist film for social transformation through a case study methodology,Nicole Cruz Roa,2021-06-30,['Dr. Isabel Awad'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In line with a global landscape in which domestic violence is amongst the most prominent gender-based problematics in contemporaneity, this project is concerned with the mediatized discourses of domestic violence in Colombia. Specifically, it departs from the scarce treatment that Colombia’s film industry has given to this hardship, considering that cinema has proven beneficial to assist in alternative socio-cultural transformation processes (Cupples, 2015; Roncallo & Arias-Herrera, 2013). Against a national film industry in which men have directed most fiction productions about domestic violence, Libia Gómez’s film Ella (2015) arises as an exceptional case in which female authorship meets the public discussion of domestic violence against women. In this sense, this document aims to explore this film to account for the representational, personal, and industrial dynamics that may arise when female filmmakers represent domestic violence in Colombia. To address this issue, three sub-questions are posed. First, the study evaluated how domestic violence was represented in Ella. Second, it inquired the role Ella’s filmmakers assumed when producing a film about domestic violence. Third, the study investigated what opportunities and challenges these artists negotiated in agreement with their perceived roles. To accomplish this goal, the researcher conducted a case study through a multi-methodological approach. For this purpose, a character analysis methodology (Pérez Rufí, 2017) was combined with in-depth interviews with Ella’s director and four ex-students who participated in the film’s production. The findings underscored that domestic violence was represented in potentially transformative ways in Ella, since the film offered an alternative to blockbuster portrayals of household violence. Additionally, the research findings show how female filmmakers in Colombia deem that cinema is a compelling format to denounce domestic violence, learn from vulnerable individuals, and implement new industrial methodologies based on female subjectivities, care, and pedagogical approaches. Finally, the study also identified that female filmmakers encounter multiple gender-based disparities, financial obstacles, as well as emotional and physical challenges in their attempt to address domestic violence against women. Howbeit, these artists also saw the industry as a scenario for academic and personal growth, and the potential to increase the credibility of women as industrial workers and agents of socio-cultural transformation.","['Feminist cinema', 'domestic violence', 'Colombia', 'women filmmakers']"
Framing and biases in the press coverage of the crash of MH17 in Dutch and Russian state-owned news outlets.,Dionne van Wijnen,2021-06-30,['Dr. Olivier Nyirubugara'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The aim of this thesis was to analyze the framing practices used in state-owned media outlets during an international crisis. This was done by studying the crash of MH17 and the manner in which the Russian state-owned media outlet RT and the Dutch state-owned media outlet NOS framed the crash. In order to do this, a qualitative content analysis was chosen as method where 20 news articles from RT and 21 news articles from NOS were analyzed from the direct aftermath of the crash, which happened on July 17, 2014. A deductive approach was further taken to the coding of the articles, where the existing news frames identified by Semetko and Valkenburg (2000) were used: attribution of responsibility, human interest, conflict, and morality. From this analysis a clear overview of what framing practices were dominant in both RT and NOS was presented and what biases were present in the news coverage. The results revealed both similarities and differences in the way that RT and NOS framed the crash of MH17 that turned into an international crisis. Within the frame of attribution of responsibility there was a difference in the manner of the way that a certain blame was given to someone or not. For NOS there was a general narrative where no blame was assigned to anyone specific, as it was not clear who was responsible. For RT, however, blame was mostly put on the Ukrainian government. As for the human interest frame, there were similarities in the way that victims and relatives were mentioned for both the outlets, however this was not included too frequently. The frame conflict was quite present in the articles analyzed from RT, where anger and reproach were used often to signify that the fighting needed to be stopped or to criticize the mistreatment of the victim’s bodies. NOS also framed a few of the articles analyzed in a similar way, however the frame was less often present. Finally, the frame morality was not quite often used in the articles across both outlets, however there were a few instances where this frame was used to display a preferred behavior with regard to how to respond as a country after such a disaster. This was the case for both RT and NOS. From these results, biases were
quite present in the case of RT, where RT actively put Russia’s actions in a positive light. As for NOS, biases were present to a lesser extent, with NOS trying to establish a balanced coverage of the crisis. However, there were still some occasions where NOS was biased towards the national interests of The Netherlands.","['MH17', 'state-owned media', 'framing', 'media coverage', 'bias']"
Chinese Hip-hop and Youth Identity. An exploratory study of how Chinese youth construct cultual identity through Chinese hip-hop music,Yibing Wang,2021-06-30,['Dr. Arno van der Hoeven'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In recent years, hip-hop has become a prevalent cultural form in China due to the success of the hip-hop reality show- The Rap of China. Coming from underground to the mainstream stage, hip-hop is considered a counter-cultural movement and a morally corrupted art form by the public. Its sudden popularity and controversy have attracted the attention of academics and the Chinese public. Hip-hop music is characterized by direct expression and resistance, which raised concerns about its implications in Chinese society. Youth, as the driving force of the popularity of Chinese hip-hop, ought to be paid close attention to. In existing research, even though the implications of hip-hop have been explored from the production aspect, very few touched upon the consumption of hip-hop. Music consumption is a process for self-interpretation and identity-articulation. Therefore, it is to study how Chinese hip-hop music shapes youth's cultural identities. The research question guiding this study is: How do Chinese youth construct their cultural identity through Chinese hip-hop music? This research focuses on Chinese youth's consumption, perception, and reflection of hip-hop music. Given the characteristics of Chinese hip-hop, how it contributes to youth identity construction needs to be explored regarding their comprehension of social reality and the hip-hop scene in China.
From ten in-depth interviews with hip-hop fans and rappers, valuable insights into the impact of Chinese hip-hop music on youth identity were generated. Thematic analysis was used in the research to capture the complexity of the data and discover significant patterns. The research findings revealed several aspects of Chinese youth's cultural identity construction. First, they make evaluations of their own positions in society through their understanding of the social environment for hip-hop and its development. Second, localized features of hip-hop provoked and enhanced the identity construction in relation to specific places. Third, hip-hop provides social and emotional values to the audiences. Although the specific values that hip-hop can contribute differ from rappers to fans, both types of audiences build their identity on the internalization of their interpretation of the music. This study examined the audiences' perspectives and perceptions of hip-hop, offering researchers a three-dimensional understanding of youth culture in China.","['Chinese hip-hop', 'cultural identity', 'youth', 'subculture', 'localization']"
Did you feel that? A qualitative thematic analysis on emotional advertising for male and female personal care products,Natasha Mhishi,2021-06-30,['Niels Vink'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Emotional advertising refers to the use of emotional appeals that evoke either negative or positive feelings within the consumer. Emotional advertising has become increasingly popular due to the consumer demand for brands to fulfill the need of self-actualization. Advertising in general has changed due to the rise of the digital age. This paper will look at “How brands emotional advertising to market personal care products to male and females online?” Past research has only focused on the emotional response of male and females to emotional advertising but has not explored what in ads creates the emotional response and how the ads differ between both genders. The research focus on how emotional advertising is conducted in a digital space as most research on emotional advertising has not focused on the emotional advertising in the digital era. The research question is answered using the qualitative method of thematic analysis of YouTube videos from brand official channels. The products selected for this research is personal care products. A sample of 60 western based ads were selected, 30 female ads and 30 male ads. From the analysis it was derived that happiness appeal, empowerment appeal, warmth appeal and humor appeal are present in personal care ads. The ads for both genders contained happiness appeal, empowerment appeal, warmth appeal. The ads for men in addition to these three contained humor appeals. The elements used to evoke these emotions differed between male and feamale. The elements that are found in both ads for male and female include aesthetic and career to evoke happiness within women and men, confidence, insecurity and inspirational messages to evoke empowerment and companionship and family to evoke warmth. The rest of the elements found differ between male and females. The elements present in ads for women but not in men included selfcare to show warmth, positive features and fun activities to show happiness and definin g beauty to show empowerment. The elements present in ads for men but not for women included heartwarming scenarios to show warmth, sports to show happiness, determination and ideal man to show empowerment and then exaggeration, ludicrous scenarios and verbal jokes to show humor. The research shows that there is a strong emphasis on using confidence and visuals in emotional advertisement to convey a message.","['emotional advertising', 'gender and advertising', 'personal care products advertising', 'digital media', 'emotions and gender']"
How media literacy can improve the inclusion in society of people with a mild intellectual disability,Daria Oghabi,2021-06-30,['Prof. Dr. Jeroen Jansz'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the Netherlands, media are a part of almost every aspect of society and are becoming more ubiquitous. Using media can bring benefits to its users, but can also have negative effects. In order to profit from its positive aspects and avoid the negative consequences, it is essential to have the skills to use media properly. This is referred to as media literacy. Vulnerable people are often relatively less media literate and can therefore benefit less from the positive aspects that media can offer. One of the positive aspects that can come along with media use is social inclusion. However, little is known about the relationship between media and inclusion. Within this context, even less is known about the group of people with mild intellectual disabilities in particular. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to study how media literacy can improve the social inclusion of people with mild intellectual disabilities. This was researched using a mixed-method approach. First, expert interviews with five experts on the field of media literacy among people with mild intellectual disabilities and inclusion were conducted. Then, in order to assess the topic from multiple perspectives, a survey for people with mild intellectual disabilities and people in their social environment was developed. The former version was a simplified version of the latter. The surveys contained questions about the media environment and media literacy of people with mild intellectual disabilities. Furthermore, different possible negative aspects and challenges of media use and examples of the link between information provided during the expert interviews were empirically tested in these surveys. The literature review and expert interviews showed that media and social inclusion are linked in several ways: first of all, they enable more social (e.g. maintaining social contact through social media) and economic (e.g. looking for a job) capital. Additionally, media can be used to search for (additional) information on difficult topics, such as filling taxes. Also, applications like notepads, reminders and agendas can have useful applications in everyday life and make the life of mildly disabled people easier. Furthermore, they allow people with intellectual disabilities to be more independent from others. Lastly, they allow access to for example financial or governmental services, that increasingly take place online. However, the survey, in which these examples were empirically validated, indicated that both mildly disabled people and people in their environment view this differently: the majority indicated that media did not help in making difficult things easier and in arranging financial and governmental affairs. Being media literate means that people with mild intellectual disabilities have the skills to use media properly and therefore are able
4
to benefit from these benefits that enable participation in society. Because the survey for people with a person with a mild intellectual disability in their social environment had a smaller sample size than initially intended, the results are not generalizable to a larger population. Despite the small sample, the results are still meaningful: this study can be viewed as a pilot project. This means that future research is needed in order to get a more profound understanding of the link between media literacy and social inclusion of people with mild intellectual disabilities.","['Media literacy', 'social inclusion', 'intellectual disability', 'digital divide', 'digitalization']"
"“It's a great product, but maybe I'm not the target user”: Media strategy and identity perception of short video industry practitioners",Qingyan Gao,2021-06-30,['Qian Huang'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Nowadays, short video has become one of the most popular media forms, both in China and around the world, with more and more users, especially teenagers, using short videos to record and show themselves, socialize with others or gain knowledge. In addition to the video-based media form and relatively short media duration, the most prominent feature of short video applications is the platform-based design mechanism and algorithm-based recommendation content distribution mode. Short video applications have gained increasing success and popularity, but also aroused a lot of controversies and discussions, such as the addiction use and the echo chamber effect by algorithm recommendation mechanism, as well as criticisms of vulgar and exaggerated content, and controversies related to personal information collection and data privacy.
Douyin / TikTok is one of the most iconic companies and products in the short video industry. As an emerging and thriving technology company from China, it is now a global success, with nearly 100,000 employees around the world. The study focuses on the group of people who work in Douyin, when they are using their own company’s application, they are not only prosumers, but also the creators and designers of the mechanisms, cultures and rules of the product.
Through semi-structured in-depth interviews with 15 practitioners who have experience working in Douyin, and based on thematic analysis of the interviews, this study explores the media usage habits of short video practitioners, their perceptions of the mechanisms and controversies of the product and industry, as well as their own identity perceptions and negotiations. The study aims to provide more inside-industry voices on the study of short video from the practitioners' perspective.
The study results show that, overall, Douyin employees, as professional practitioners in the short video industry, are actually not heavy users of short video nor social media lovers, and they have clear motivations and high demands for information access and consumption. From terms of technical perspective and social value, they have a relatively positive evaluation of Douyin and the industry, admit some controversies, but believe that the problems are exaggerated, and many of the controversies are common industry issues, and closely related to users' personal habits and preferences, but they are generally pessimistic about data and privacy issues. When it comes to identity coordination and recognition in their work, they generally expressed a sense of powerlessness, and they put platform data-driven requirements as the first priority, but their personal preference and creativity have a very limited influence in their work.
In general, for professional practitioners of short video industry, there is a clear separation and gap between their work content and personal media habits, which affects their attitudes and cognition of platform mechanisms and controversies. Platformization, as an important feature of short video products, has a huge impact on both the production and consumption of content, has also become the reason for attribution in various controversies, while influencing professional practitioners' perception and evaluation of their work and identity from the inside.","['short video', 'Douyin', 'social media platform', 'knowledge labor', 'platformization']"
Doxa androcentric language and online feminism. Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis on how feminist Instagram users challenge taken-for-granted sexist and gendered language,Rosalie Meerbach,2021-06-30,['Dr. Radhika Mittal'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Language is taken for granted because it is so deeply ingrained in our lives. As a result, underlying
structures that our language entails are unconsciously reinforced by the use of it. Much of our
language contains sexist structures that focus on male dominance or gendered language that
excludes a group that does not identify themselves within the binary gender spectrum. One way to
raise awareness about this matter is feminist activism on Instagram. Online feminism comes in
different forms and there is a special branch that focuses on language and the inequality it produces.
This thesis therefore answers the research question: 'How do feminist Instagram users discursively
challenge the sexist and gendered power structures within language on Instagram?'. A Multimodal
Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) was conducted among 150 Instagram posts that contained a form
of challenging the sexist and gendered structures within language that often create power
discrepancies between men and women. MCDA consists of both a visual analysis of the content and a
discourse analysis of the content. Four main themes, each with two sub-themes, emerged from the
analysis. Frist, the feminist Instagram users challenged sexist and gendered language by exposing
gender inequality in the workspace. This emerged from posts regarding gendered job names and the
seeming progressiveness of companies as well as by exposing gender inequality on the work floor
itself. The second theme encountered revealing how masculine terms are used as generics. This
emerges from the posts in exposing words that contain ‘man’ but are nevertheless used as gender
neutral and revealing masculine appellations as inclusive for every gender. The third theme that
emerged from the analysis includes language that assigns labels that reinforce gender stereotypes.
The theme is constructed in the first place by posts that encounter masculine women and feminine
men and how not conforming to stereotypical gender norms is regarded deviant and in the second
place by feminine stereotyping and shaming the deviancies. The fourth and last theme includes
stereotypical expressions. This includes feminist posts that place the narrative on the victim as well
as masculine features as a symbol of dominance. The conclusion on this thesis points to feminist
Instagram users discursively challenging the sexist and gendered structures within language, by
exposing, criticizing and rephrasing taken-for-granted language structures and educating the
audience on alternatives that can be incorporated as substitutes.","['Androcentric language', 'sexist language', 'gendered language', 'power discrepancy', 'online', 'feminism', 'Instagram']"
The establishment and upholding of heteronormative masculinity within queer communities through self-presentation practices of Grindr users located in The Netherlands. A focus on textual and visual presentations in user-profiles,Hendrik Cruiming,2021-06-30,['Dr. Giulia Evolvi'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Within queer communities, online media have been found to provide an important space for identity practice and development. From early emergences of digital media, queer individuals have moved towards the digital realm to find what otherwise might not be presented to them in predominantly heteronormative societies. With this significant role of digital media in queer life, this research aims to understand how specifically an online dating platform, namely Grindr, plays a role in shaping or understanding of certain identity. With a focus on heteronormative masculinity, in which masculinity takes the top place in social hierarchy, heterosexuality is assumed to be the preferred sexual orientation and where gender non-conformity is resisted, this research aims to explore how this understanding of masculinity is found within self-presentations of users on the Grindr platform, specifically focused on the Dutch context. Through visual and textual content analysis, user-profiles were examined by making use of thematic analysis. It was found that heteronormative masculinity finds its way through differing levels of the self-presentation practices of users. Traditional masculine presentations of the body and overall behavior was most commonly presented and wished for in partners. Resistance of gender non-conformity was found to be less obviously presented, yet found its ways through more implicit manners of self-presentation. Similar statements can be made regarding the preference for heterosexuality, which was found to be interwoven with sexual practices common to the Grindr platform. In general, users arguably adapt their identity practices and self-presentations to the affordances they are presented with on the platform, while also taking into consideration the dominant norm that is presented throughout the online space, with possible aim to adapt to the presented masculine norm. However, an interesting countermovement was found, that signifies possible resistance of heteronormative masculine norms and aims to diversify the presence of identities on the Grindr platform through more inclusive understandings of others and presentations of the self. This might signify how users within the Dutch context aim to make their online space more fitting to their perceptions of queerness, in contrast to the dominant force of heteronormativity that still has its effect on the lives of queer individuals in this country.","['heteronormative masculinity', 'self-presentation', 'Grindr', 'queer', 'identity']"
"Are you inspired or desirous of others on social media? The influence of content characteristics with visual cues and masculinity traits towards social comparison, subjective well-being and intended posting behavior.",Bella Octavina,2021-06-30,['Dr. Lijie Zheng'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The use of social networking sites has enabled users to access the lives of others online. For long, the extensive use of social media was found to lead to negative subjective well-being, as comparing oneself with others have become easier with the existence of various social networking sites. Several aspects of social media have affected on an individual’s well-being, including as well, the contents users are exposed to. By using the stimulus-organism-response method, this study explores the effects of images with content characteristics such as single-person photo, group photo, object photo, portraits of family, career and money, on an individual’s social comparison and subjective well-being, leading to a possible behavioral response in intended posting behavior. To analyze the effects, a quantitative method approach was implemented using an experimental survey approach with the sample of Indonesian male Instagram users. Results showed that visual cues with a single-person photo have more effect on social comparison compared to the other visual cues and masculinity traits. Although a single-person photo is found to have more influence on social comparison, the group photos have a higher likelihood to be shared online. Whilst masculinity trait did not have much influence on social comparison, when it came to posting intention and posting frequency, masculinity traits of family and career seem to have more likeliness to be shared. Whereas traits portraying money had the least interest to be shared, even though contents that portray money is the most common image seen online. When taking into account the psychological state of the individual, those who engage in social comparison will likely have a lower satisfaction towards life. Furthermore, one’s satisfaction towards life does not influence posting frequency, only the affective aspect of the individual influences the intended posting frequency, meaning, the happier the individual the more often they would share certain content online. Thus, it can be concluded that specific types of content influences social comparison more than others, however, although not all content influences social comparison, some can be considered as an inspiration as participants find they would likely to post something similar.","['Social comparison', 'subjective well-being', 'Instagram', 'posting behavior', 'posting frequency.']"
Corporate ‘action that matters’: How Black Lives Matter activists perceive the role of corporations in the movement’s fight against racism in the Netherlands,Lina Sophie Sasse,2021-06-30,['Dr. Delia Dumitrica'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","While the BLM movement in the Netherlands (BLMnl) in 2020 catalysed the public debate on systemic racism in the country, less is known on the movement’s view of the role that the corporate sector plays in the movement’s cause. By means of 13 qualitative interviews, this study therefore set out to explore how Black BLM activists in the Netherlands perceive the role of corporations in the movement’s fight against racism, in an effort of gaining insight into the collective action frames of BLMnl. The thematic analysis of the interviews reveals that BLMnl activists view corporations as (1) contributing to systemic racism, (2) powerful, influential and resourceful entities, and (3) beneficiaries of the movement. This positions corporations as elite actors in the eyes of the movement and assigns them responsibility to actively respond to BLMnl, just like the political sector. Participants put a stronger emphasis on the role that corporations play to internally contribute to tangible and intangible changes than external expressions of solidarity which was how corporations were currently predominantly responding to BLMnl. The perception that corporations need to be publicly transparent with their internal actions was shared, as such a practice would ensure that corporations can be held accountable and racial equity norms can be procured. The patterned findings further point towards the movement’s shared collective action frames which are beginning to stir desired change within the Dutch corporate sector. Overall, the research shows that corporations are perceived as instrumental within the BLMnl movement, which brings corporate practice in further proximity with contemporary activism and social movements.","['Social movements', 'collective action frames', 'corporate activism', 'Black Lives Matter', 'activist perceptions']"
Positioning Arthouse in The Netherlands: Audience Perspectives on the Dutch Arthouse Landscape in times of Increasing Arthouse Commercialization and Digitalization,"Nguyen, Tessa",2021-06-29,['Koteman R.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The boundaries between arthouse and mainstream cinema are blurring. With the increasing developments of arthouse commercialization and digitalization, the position of arthouse has shifted from a niche product towards a more mainstream stance. This trend has been covered by prior studies, but little is known about how audiences perceive this development. This is also the case for prior research on arthouse digitalization. The fast-growing technological-age that we live in now, has resulted in interesting developments in the digitalization of arthouse. There has been a rise of arthouse video-on-demand services, of which some try to bring the social experience of the physical theatre to one’s home. These are new technical developments that might affect the sustainability of the arthouse theatre, but too little is known about this. Moreover, The Netherlands seems to be an interesting focus, since the number of arthouse theatre visits is growing more rapidly than its surrounding countries. Regarding The Netherlands, cross - over programming, Cineville and the notion of Dutch film festivals were the three central commercial aspects that were studied. Therefore, this research studies the perceptions of Dutch millennial arthouse fans on arthouse in The Netherlands, in times of increasing commercialization and digitalization of arthouse. By means of a qualitative approach, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 Dutch arthouse fans. The interviews took place in an online face-to-face setting through either Skype of Facetime and were recorded in audio and visuals. The transcriptions of the interview served as the generated data of which themes were established from. The findings suggest that arthouse fans acknowledge the developments of arthouse commercialization and digitalization and approve the results from these developments. They understand that these developments are needed for increasing the production and consolidation of arthouse. However, they seem to dislike the idea that arthouse commercialization results in lower artistic values in arthouse. The digitalization of arthouse is perceived as complementary to the arthouse theatre, which means that it is not seen as a threat. At last, even though arthouse slowly starts to become the new mainstream, the fans believe that the arts will always be preserved by the return of a new small-scaled type of arthouse.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Arthouse cinema', 'Arthouse commercialization', 'Arthouse digitalization', 'audience perspectives', 'niche audience', 'mass audience', 'blurring boundaries', 'arthouse fans']"
Connected Transoceanic Histories of Printed Cottons. The Metamorphosis from Kalamkari to Sits,Prajna Unikkumarath,2021-06-28,['Prof. dr. Ben Wubs'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis is set in the realm of textile history, and explores the connections between Golconda Kalamkari from the South-eastern coast of India and Sits/Chintz from Europe in order to establish the social and political connections that interplayed between them. It establishes that the Sits consumed in the Dutch Republic from the 17th century onwards is a descendant of the Indian Kalamkari. This thesis combines extensive archival research of preserved textile fragments and pre-existent but scattered academic literature in the fields of colonial studies, post-colonial studies, textile history, fashion design and even architecture to establish a comprehensive picture of Kalamkari’s transformation into Sits by the means of the Connected Histories framework. This thesis consists of four chapters that have been divided thematically to address each aspect of the research question with the aim of establishing the role of painted cotton textiles in the colonial trade, its domestic significance in India, its European reception, and the role of mercantilism and consumer preferences in its adoption into usage among nobility and later, common people alike in the Dutch Republic.
Ultimately, this thesis can be viewed as a comprehensive work that collates various fragmented aspects of colonial era textile history under one topical study, hence providing for various points of views of stakeholders who shaped the era of trade, social consumption and political rule from the mid-17th century to early 19th century.","['Kalamkari', 'Indian Cottons', 'Sits', 'Textile History', 'VOC', 'Connected Histories', 'Botanical Designs', 'Floral Design', 'Dutch Textiles', 'British Textiles']"
Hoe mediamakers betekenis geven aan etnische diversiteit in de Nederlandse media. Een analyse van kwalitatieve interviews met professionele mediamakers binnen het Nederlandse medialandschap,Iris Esman,2021-06-28,['dr. J. C. van Sterkenburg'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De media zijn spelers met een grote beïnvloedende rol in het debat over racisme, diversiteit en inclusie. Er is ruim onderzoek gedaan naar de rol van diversiteit in de media. De focus ligt hierbij vaak op de representatie van etnisch diversiteit en niet op de tenuitvoerlegging ervan op mediaredacties en binnen mediaproducties.
De bron van de beeldvorming ligt bij de mediamakers, maar opvallend genoeg is naar deze bron van betekenisgeving nog maar weinig onderzoek gedaan en zijn mediamakers zelf zelden bevraagd. Uit voorgaand onderzoek is gebleken dat het voor mediamakers moeilijk is om alert te zijn op de presentatie van etnische minderheden en daarom leidt het gebrek aan kennis over het belang van diversiteit ertoe dat mediamakers vaak onbewust teruggrijpen naar stereotype beelden. Omdat een hogere mate van diversiteit op mediaredacties en in mediaproducties bijdraagt aan een verhoogde kwaliteit van de mediaproducties, richt dit onderzoek zich op de mensen die verantwoordelijk zijn voor mediaproducties: de mediamakers. Dit onderzoek heeft als doel om inzicht te bieden in de manieren waarop mediamakers betekenis geven aan etnische diversiteit op zowel mediaredacties als in mediaproducties. Wegens de intersectie van etniciteit met gender komen genderrollen aan bod, wordt er besproken op welke manieren er genderdiversiteit binnen topposities van mediabedrijven bestaat en wat een gebrek aan diversiteit teweeg kan brengen en een eventuele oplossing voor deze kwestie. Ook komt de eigen etniciteit van mediamakers aan bod en wordt deze gekoppeld aan de vraagstelling van dit onderzoek. De onderzoeksvraag van waaruit dit onderzoek vertrekt is de vraag hoe mediamakers betekenis geven aan etnische diversiteit in de Nederlandse media. Daarnaast bekijken we intersecties met gender en vragen we over genderrollen in mediaproducties. Door het centraal stellen van de betekenis die mediamakers zelf geven aan diversiteit, vormt dit onderzoek een uitzondering op de bestaande recente onderzoeken binnen dit veld, geeft het nieuwe inzichten vanuit een ander perspectief en biedt het interessante aanknopingspunten voor vervolgonderzoek. Uit een thematische analyse van de kwalitatieve interviews met elf mediamakers uit de Nederlandse media, zowel on- als offline media, komen drie overkoepelende thema’s naar voren: 1) (te weinig) diversiteit op mediaredacties, 2) tijd is geld en 3) gebrek aan bewustwording leidt tot minder diversiteit. Binnen elk thema wordt door middel van quotes van respondenten ruimte gelaten voor duidelijke voorbeelden die het thema verklaren. Opvallend was dat etnische diversiteit en media als journalistiek genre vaak worden losgekoppeld van elkaar. Binnen het proces van media maken is er volgens een aantal respondenten te weinig diversiteit en wordt er ook te weinig gereflecteerd op het thema diversiteit, wat vaak veroorzaakt wordt door tijdsgebrek. Het belang van bewust en actief bezig zijn met het implementeren van diversiteit houdt daarnaast zowel direct als indirect verband met de kwaliteit van mediaproducties. (Zelf)reflectie en de bewustwording van mediamakers omtrent diversiteit is daarom van onschatbaar belang voor het maken van inclusieve en kwalitatief goede mediaproducties. Daarnaast helpt bewustwording voor een groter verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel onder mediamakers, waarbij fenomenen als (positieve of negatieve) discriminatie, racisme en onbewuste stereotypering de kop ingedrukt kunnen worden.","['media', 'diversiteit', 'etniciteit', 'kwalitatieve interviews', 'stereotypering', 'gender']"

The Complex Reality of British Multiculturalism: A Case Study of Indian Food,Samantha Throup,2021-06-28,['Gijsbert Oonk'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Indian food in the UK is surrounded by a paradox. On one hand it is praised by politicians and honoured in the form of awards ceremonies dedicated to finding the best curries. On the other hand it has long suffered derogatory treatment relating to its authenticity, quality and even décor of the restaurants. Food does not exist separately from social meaning, it has an unusually close relationship with identity and so when there is a tension in relation to food, there is something to be understood about the interplay of power and identities. Therefore, this relatively unexplored area of research provides an ideal case study into the workings of power and identity that make up modern Britain. By identifying and analysing themes and patterns using Critical Discourse Analysis, this research unpicks the paradox of the treatment and perception of Indian food in the UK. It traces it to the social, cultural and historical discourses embedded in British society, which in turn contributes to a better understanding of state of play when it comes to the sociocultural makeup of the UK.
It finds that Indian food has a firm position in British history, culture and politics, but that status is not as easily extended to the people who make up the Indian restaurant industry, with politicians stressing that they are in a process of integrating into British identity, despite the vast majority having lived and worked in the UK most of their lives and many all of their lives and despite political support for British multiculturalism. It highlights the power of representation when it comes to stereotypes and racially based assumptions, with British Bangladeshis and Pakistanis often only being represented in Parliament via debates on immigration, religion or ethnicity. In the media, it finds that even in the present day, colonial era stereotypes are still being reproduced through news articles and reader comments. Finally, it considers the much discussed topic of authenticity in relation to Indian food and, in published news articles as well as reader comments, finds that old cultural assumptions around purity and impurity are invoked to prove the value of one’s own cultural identity in comparison to others in the competitive multicultural reality that is modern Britain.
Overall, this research shows that the rosy British multiculturalism often touted by politicians is far from a reality. In fact, it is deeply affected by historical power relations and hierarchical assumptions about the value of different cultural identities. However, uncovering these dynamics leads to an improved self-awareness of the sources of some of these issues. In other words, they are not a ‘given’ of human life, rather they are the result of specific historical developments, the contingent trajectory of culture and power. Therefore, research such as this, which provides an increased awareness of the cultural and historical context of present day struggles, supports Britain to forge a more equal future.","['Multiculturalism', 'national identity', 'UK', 'Indian food', 'authenticity', 'colonialism', 'stereotypes', 'postcolonialism', 'gender.']"
"Ireland in Ruins. The representation of cultural property destruction during the Irish Revolution in Irish, Anglo-Irish, and English newspapers, 1916-1923",Pearly van Langeveld,2021-06-28,['Dr. Robbert-Jan Adriaansen'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The Irish Revolution (1916-1923) was one of the bloodiest and most violent conflicts in Irish history. Irish paramilitaries fought for an independent Ireland free from British rule. The Easter Rising (1916) lasted a week, in which the Irish Volunteers held out against the British military. During the War of Independence (1919-1921), the IRA fought the military, police and British paramilitary forces, resulting in the Anglo-Irish Treaty that granted Ireland Dominion status and established Northern Ireland’s own Parliament. The Civil War (1922-1923) concluded the Revolution, in which the Pro-Treaty and Anti-Treaty IRA fought each other. The Civil War ended in 1923 with a victory for the Pro-Treaty forces.
This study focusses on the representation of cultural property destruction and the actors involved in Irish, Anglo-Irish, and English newspapers during the Revolution, in which the representation in newspapers will be studied from a framework of nationalism and othering. During this period, many buildings that are considered to be cultural property were destroyed. The study approaches the subject by means of a qualitative content analysis of newspapers articles which allows for a comparison of the newspapers. The research conducted is based on three case studies: the destruction of historic buildings during the Easter Rising, the destruction of Big Houses during the War of Independence, and the destruction of (Catholic) premises during the Belfast Pogroms in 1920-1922. Throughout all these periods, there were censorship regulations in place which influenced the newspapers.
It is argued that during the Easter Rising and the War of Independence, the English and Anglo-Irish newspapers were irrationalising the destruction of buildings by the Irish, stating that the Irish paramilitaries were the enemy of Ireland and Britain, whereas the British troops were attempting to save the buildings or their contents, while also fighting the Irish forces. These newspapers negatively depicted these Irish paramilitaries as the ‘other’ to create a positive image of the self. However, during the pogroms the English and Anglo-Irish newspapers were rationalising the destruction, which was instigated by ‘their (national) community.’ The newspapers negatively depicted the Irish forces, whereas they were justifying the actions of their own troops. The Irish newspapers were doing the opposite. These newspapers were rationalising the destructions of the Easter Rising and Big House destruction, but depicting the Catholics in Belfast as the victims of British troops. Where they attempted to offer a moderate view of the destruction in the first two cases, they irrationalised the destruction of premises during the pogroms. In all cases, the newspapers attempted to present their own nation in a favourable way, by negatively depicting the opposing forces as ‘the other.’","['Irish Revolution', 'Destruction', 'Cultural Property', 'Othering', 'Nationalism', 'Newspapers', 'Representation', 'Censorship', 'Heritage']"
The Church Tax in Germany. Exploitation or Bad Advertisement.,Carolin Deinzer,2021-06-28,['Prof. Dick Douwes'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","2019 marked the year with the highest church tax revenues since its early beginnings in the 19th century. However, the amount of people leaving the church has risen as well, especially when it comes to young people entering the workforce and being confronted with the church tax for the first time. In the German society of today, the question of how timely the concept of the church tax is comes up again and again, resulting in debates about its abolishment being ever-present. But why does the church tax have such a bad reputation in society? This research question is answered through highlighting various layers of society. First, the overall acceptance of the church in 2020 is compared to the status quo in 1950, the year after its implementation of how the tax is understood today. Quantifiable data, such as statistics, is used to compare the membership, church attendance and church wedding figures, as well as the welfare institution usage. Second, within society the differences of opinion and attitudes
between general public and clergy are explored to understand how belonging to either side plays a role. For the purpose of this research, narrative interviews were conducted and analysed through Critical Discourse Analysis. Lastly, looking into the general public side specifically the information currently provided to the public through internet articles is examined. Through text analysis, the tone of the articles and the amount of background
information provided was evaluated. This research concludes that societal acceptance has decreased over time with only the welfare institutions run by the church advancing their reputation over time, but not the church nor the church tax themselves. The belonging to either clergy or general public informs about the source of education about the topic, the opinion formation process the person went through, as well as the probable vastness of the 
background knowledge. The information currently available to the public depends heavily on which source type is consulted with the private newspapers leaning more critical in tone and providing less background information, the Christian press differing depending on the denomination and only the governmental sources providing ample neutral material for a person to have enough background to form their own opinion. Therefore, the bad reputation of the church tax in the German society is influenced by the decreased contact of the individual with the church, caused by the lack of knowledge surrounding the topic, and fuelled by the negative press and the fact that clarification of the topic needs to be specifically sought out.","['Church Tax', 'Religion', 'Germany', 'Functionalism', 'Secularisation']"

The fusion of technology and creativity:  A qualitative study on the gender balance in the fashion trend forecasting industry,Lisa van Barneveld,2021-06-28,['Professor Ben Wubs'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Fashion trend forecasting is an essential part of the global fashion system. This study is an investigation into the gender balance in the fashion trend forecasting industry. The part provides an historical overview of the fashion trend forecasting industry and discusses the methodologies used by fashion trend forecasters. Moreover, it establishes that the fashion trend forecasting industry is female-dominated. The second part focuses on several technological advancements in the last four decades that influenced fashion trend forecasting. The latest development in the field is the gradual adoption of Artificial Intelligence systems, as the existence of large streams of fashion-related data impact the already labour-intensive and time-consuming practice of fashion trend forecasting. The novel data-led trend forecasting agencies are often led by anonymous parent companies, big data streams and tech competencies. AI is applicable in the industry mainly to observe emerging trends faster, to reduce overproduction and to meet consumer needs more precisely. On the other hand, the results also indicated perceptions of AI as unfitted for some qualities of fashion, such as garment tactility, intricate design details and emotional values. Therefore, a balance between minds and machines needs to be found. Fashion and technology have been historically gendered, as they are respectively seen as feminine and masculine industries. Combining these worlds in fashion trend forecasting can shine a light on how gender continues to dominate life at work. This study is grounded within a qualitative research paradigm. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature was conducted to provide a theoretical grounding to the study. This was followed by 13 semi-structured interviews to obtain primary data from fashion trend forecasting industry professionals. The research findings narrate the participants' experience in the field of fashion trend forecasting when it comes to doing research, technological advancements and the gender balance in their trend agencies. The findings of the study indicate that the fashion trend forecasting industry, under the influence of technological advancements, remains female-dominated. The various teams within trend agencies show a traditional division of labour along gender lines. Enhancing communication and collaboration between teams is key. Achieving a more gender-balanced workforce in trend agencies can lead to positive outcomes such as boosting financial performance and bringing more innovative ideas to the table. The findings and recommendations of this study will hopefully provide meaningful guidance in this regard, as well as contribute constructively to the current body of literature on fashion trend forecasting in the unexplored area of gender balance.","['fashion trend forecasting', 'trends', 'big data', 'artificial intelligence', 'gender balance', 'gender blindness.', 'glocal']"
Fuelling Transition: Assessing the private-public relationship of Royal Dutch Shell in the energy transition of the 21st century in the Netherlands,Lexy Remy,2021-06-28,['Prof. Dr. Hein Klemann'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research will explore the role of oil companies in the formulation of an energy transition policy discourse within the Netherlands in the twenty-first century. To adequately conduct this research, a theoretical framework shall be constructed from the studies of discourse and hegemony, the political economy, and socio-technical transitions, which will then be applied to the case study of Royal Dutch Shell’s political engagement. Upon comparing the main energy transition policy discourses of both the Dutch government and Shell three rather similar key points were found: the importance of cooperation of multiple actors within society to achieve the transition, the emphasis on the commercial viability of new and renewable energy projects, and a persisting future role of fossil fuel in the energy system and transition (especially for natural gas). Oil companies, and Shell specifically, have participated in the political arena through lobbying and private-public secondments, but also through direct participation in energy transition policy process. By placing the findings of the research in light of the theoretical framework the firm impression is given that the discourses communicated by both the government and Shell are linked and represent the vested interests of both actors in the energy transition process and future.",

Effect of Securitization on militarization and defence policies through the case study of the South China Sea Dispute,Maru Dauzon,2021-06-27,"['Prof. Adria Albareda Sanz', 'Dr. Koen Stapelbroek']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Securitization is considered as both a widely powerful explanatory theory on critical security studies and a widely contested framework. The small amount of research on the actual concrete consequences of this theory on security matters pushed for this study. This thesis aims at analysing the effect of successful securitization on the defence and militarization policies of a nation. To do so, the case study of the South China Sea dispute will be analysed through three different claimant countries. The study uses the covariational method of analysis to find the relationship between securitization and the defence policies. This method of analysis led us to choose 3 claimant countries which are Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia due to their respective differences in securitizing the South China Sea dispute while having the lowest differences in the control variables. The different level of securitization will be analysed through a speech analysis of local media articles which reflects the government’s position and speeches. The effect on the defence policies will be analysed through a triangulation of primary and secondary sources such as speeches, articles and official government policy papers. The speech analysis combined with the covariational analysis revealed the correlation between higher securitization and higher militarization policies accompanied by a higher defence budget as expected. This relationship seems to be accentuated or attenuated through the different regime types that a nation belongs to ranging from authoritarian to democratic. The findings enabled for a better comprehension of possible correlation between securitization and defence. This is a first step into knowing more about the effect of securitization in other policy areas.",
A geopolitical analysis of the 2014 European Union Maritime Security Strategy between classical realism and commercial liberalism,Giovanni Parente,2021-06-27,"['Dr. Asya Zhelyazkova', 'Prof. Adria Albareda Sanz']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Which theory of international relations (classical realism or commercial liberalism) best explains
the adoption of 2014 Maritime Security Strategy (MSS)? This research question drives the current
master’s thesis and explains the author’s interest in the maritime dimension of the European
Union’s (EU) foreign policy.
Overall, previous scholars have analysed maritime security from an international point of view
(Germond, 2015), from the humanitarian perspective of saving lives at sea (Riddervold, 2014), from
the Somali case study about piracy (Cordner, 2010) and from the analyses of its risks and threats
(Bueger, 2015a). The primary methodology for investigating a similar topic is interviewing
policymakers, military officers and civilians working for maritime non-governmental organisations
(Riddervold, 2018). However, this study involves analysing the official EU’s documents and
national military strategies published in the timeframe between the first European maritime
operation, 2008 Atalanta, and the adoption of the MSS in June 2014.
In order to carry out a similar study, the researcher has proposed a total of six propositions, derived
from the analyses of the two theories, and has applied the so-called “congruence analysis” to find
which empirical observations were more traceable, that is, more congruent with the theoretical
hypotheses. Classical realism expects that states want to maximise their security in the maritime
domain. On the other hand, commercial liberalism expects that the strategy was adopted for
economic motivations. In the end, the author has found evidence for the congruence between the
liberal propositions and the empirical observations so this theory was more suited in explaining the
adoption of the maritime strategy. Out of a total of ninety-six documents analyzed and one hundred
and forty-seven total codes found, the author could conclude that the ""Trade"" motivation was
identified more than any of the other five, for a total of 34 retrieved codes. This result has shown
that the main driving force, for the adoption of the maritime strategy, was the trade at sea.","['European Union Maritime Security Strategy', 'maritime security', 'European Union foreign policy', 'classical realism', 'commercial liberalism', 'congruence analysis.']"
Refugee employment in the Basque Country and Emilia-Romagna.,Harry Ball Lindsay,2021-06-27,"['Dr. Asya Pisarevskaya', 'Dr. Asya Zhelyazkova']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Over the past two decades, the topic surrounding the integration of refugees into host countries has experienced a significant escalation in focus, particularly with regard to labour-market integration. To further explore this issue of how hosting communities integrate refugees into the labour markets, the following thesis focuses on the Basque Country and Emilia-Romagna, two regions within Spain and Italy, respectively. These regions were chosen to add to the body of literature that deals with the gap between regional policy differences (the Basque Country and Emilia-Romagna) within their respective national-contexts (Spain and Italy) to further contribute to the study of refugee labour-market integration. Specifically, the objective of this thesis was to map out the major successes and challenges of the refugee labour-market integration policies in the respective regions by emphasising the factors that can either increase or hinder employability in their respective labour markets.
Through semi-structured qualitative interviews and by questioning a range of individuals which included refugees, NGO workers and policymakers from both these contexts, this study revealed, although to differing extents, that policies regarding the provision of language courses, recognition of skills, facilitating permission to work, and ensuring freedom of settlement to be the main areas within which the Basque Country and Emilia-Romagna might find common ground on policies which facilitate labour-market access for refugees. Obstacles regarding the processes of accessing residency permits represented a clear policy failure in both regions. Moreover, in the Basque Country, policies regarding the recognition of previous qualifications also proved disappointing in their outcomes, whereas discriminatory attitudes were more prevalent among the refugee participants in Emilia-Romagna, suggesting that policies regarding the equality of treatment within the workplace were less effective for the Italian region. Finally, establishing social contacts emerged as the most popular method for increasing a refugee’s chances of becoming employed.",

Purchasing Museum Merchandise Online: An Analysis of the Effects of E-commerce on Tourists’ Consumption Behaviours and Perception of Souvenirs in the Chinese Context,Dongqing Shen,2021-06-27,['Nicky van Es'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The Internet has changed the way people purchase tourist souvenirs. In China, buying museum merchandise online has become a new trend. Nowadays, tourists can purchase museum merchandise online before and after physically visiting sites, whereas previously they were only able to do so in the museum’s retail shop (i.e., offline). However, little is known about how such a change in consumption behaviour has influenced people’s perception of tourist souvenirs. What motivates people to purchase museum merchandise online rather than, or in addition to, buying it immediately after visiting sites? Do souvenirs purchased online and purchased offline have different meanings? The present study takes a semi-structured interview approach to address these and other questions. Ten young Chinese museum e-shop purchasers participated. The results show that people mainly purchase museum merchandise online, both before and after their embodied visit to the site. The study introduces two new concepts to describe online museum merchandise purchase behaviour: pre-travel purchase and post-travel purchase. Satisfying cultural needs was one of the primary motivations for the participants’ online museum merchandise purchases. Another motivation was the consequence of the long-lasting influence of the previous travel experience. The regret they felt from not having purchased souvenirs during their visit led them to buy online in the post-travel phase. Pleasant memories of their visit encouraged them to pay attention to product updates after returning home. Another finding was that people bought hardly any postcards online, but they always did so offline and regarded them as tourist souvenirs. They also tended to consider utilitarian and aesthetic values more when they bought museum merchandise online. The souvenir purchased in the post-travel phase does not entirely traverse the boundary between the sacred place and the profane place, which makes its evocative power weaker than that of the souvenir purchased at the destination itself. In addition, the pre-travel souvenir can be regarded as a catalyst of desire and a constant reminder to visit a location. Finally, according to the theory of the tourist gaze, museum merchandise can act as a symbolic medium; for example, photos elaborately designed by the supplier side construct purchasers’ impressions and imaginings of museums in distant locations.","['cultural products', 'e-commerce', 'museum merchandise', 'tourist souvenir museum']"

Markus Haverland', 'Prof. Adria Albareda Sanz']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"When COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, most countries turned inward. Countries have increasingly committed to global cooperation, with the European Union (EU) taking a leading role. However, analysts have doubted whether this commitment is sincere or if self-interest takes precedence over the common good. This question is central to the Great Debate of international relations: realism, liberalism and constructivism. This thesis analyses the EU global response to COVID-19, with a focus on EU policymaking around vaccines and the resources spend on aid and other support of individual member states. Using a congruence analysis approach, propositions from each of the theories are tested to the two within cases. The thesis argues that realism is, surprisingly, the most congruent with the evidence. However, liberalism provides valuable insights into preference formation, while constructivism provides best explanations of aid donors. The finding that realism is applicable indicates that the EU is indeed becoming more geopolitical in its external action, be it specifically in times of crisis.",
The effect of the GSP+ policy on poverty,Lisa Amend,2021-06-27,"['Prof.dr. Markus Haverland', 'Prof. Dr. Geske Dijkstra']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This study investigates the long-term impact of the special arrangement for sustainable
development and good governance, the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+). The
policy was implemented by the European Union (EU) in 2005 to encourage development and
decrease poverty in developing countries. Participating countries are granted non-reciprocal
preferential market access conditional on the ratification and implementation of twenty-seven
international conventions. The three main goals of the GSP+ arrangement are to promote good
governance, stimulate sustainable development and, ultimately, to reduce poverty. While
abundant literature has examined the effect of the GSP+ on good governance and sustainability,
existing literature does not examine its overall effect on poverty. This thesis fills this gap by
examining the impact of the GSP+ on poverty between 2005 and 2012.
Poverty is operationalized as extreme poverty and is measured by poverty headcount, poverty
gap, and, as a robustness test, infant mortality rate. Subject to the analysis are those countries
that entered the GSP+ arrangement in its initial launch in 2005 and consistently participated
until the end of the first period in 2012, leading to a sample of thirteen beneficiary countries.
Those countries are compared to similar counterparts, namely those low- and middle-income
countries of the standard generalised scheme of preferences (GSP). Based on fundamental
economic theory, it is hypothesized that the GSP+ arrangement decreased poverty. To test this
hypothesis, a differences-in-differences (DiD) analysis is conducted. This approach compares
the poverty alleviation pattern among the GSP+ beneficiary countries before and after
participating in the arrangement to patterns among control countries before and after the
program period. Covariates are included to adjust for factors that violate the parallel trend
assumption, which is a critical fundament of the DiD method.
The main empirical results demonstrate that the GSP+ arrangement did not have a significant
effect on reducing extreme poverty in its beneficiary countries in the period from 2005 to 2012.
This is of particular interest since the alleviation of poverty, especially in developing countries,
has been a complex and multifaceted task that policymakers have tried to achieve for years.
Targeting developing countries through PTAs, even if coupled with extra non-trade-related
provisions thus seems to provide an insufficient technique to reduce poverty. However, the
results show that complementary policies, especially those focussing on education, access to
credit, and political stability and absence of violence are necessary to reduce extreme poverty
in developing countries.",

Additionally, this framework helps describe mutual relationships between different actors. The study evaluates the local presence of foreign actors, a consequence of EU externalization of migration and border management, as a complex factor that, combined with selective institutional state response to irregular migration flows, uniquely shapes institutional logics of the civil sector, as well as their application.

Scaling down non-compliance?,Eleonora Kyriakou,2021-06-26,"['Dr. Asya Zhelyazkova', 'Dr. Markus Haverland']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The responsibility of complying with EU legislation lies with the member states. The range, however, of actors involved in the implementation process has widened, making compliance a dynamic interplay between state and non-state actors. The present thesis makes a first attempt to quantitatively analyze the impact of non-state actors on compliance with EU environmental directives, across the 27 EU member states. The thesis adopts a broader conceptualization of non-state actors in order to account for both organized and diffused societal interests and derives hypotheses from the three approaches to compliance (enforcement, management, and legitimacy) in an integrated manner. Subsequently, by taking into account a subset of 24 recently adopted environmental directives, the thesis also seeks to assess cross-national variation and shed light on existing patterns of environmental leaders and laggards. By relying on infringement data to account for member states’ levels of non-compliance and by employing a cross-classified multilevel method of analysis, the empirical findings reveal a rather surprising mismatch between societal actors’ expected role and their actual impact on member states’ compliance. The results show that environmental non-state actors are more constrained in their ability to impact policymaking and exert pressure on national governments to comply than what was previously assumed by case studies. This is particularly the case when considering organized societal interests and the role of NGOs in influencing policy outcomes. Furthermore, the findings indicate one factor that can positively influence compliance: citizens’ perceived importance of the environment and climate change. By consequence, citizens’ perceptions on the importance of specific policy issues can exert domestic pressure on member states’ compliance. Moreover, the analysis does not suggest a particular pattern with respect to country groupings or ‘worlds of compliance’ thus one cannot speak of either a Southern problem or an Eastern one. Southern and Central and Eastern European countries occupy space as both leaders and laggards. In sum, the findings have implications for both the compliance literature and the future of the broader EU environmental policy.",

The factors determining access to family using Lockwood’s theory of civic stratification have been analyzed. The analysis is based on desk research and semi-constructed interviews with workers in several Greek organizations.

The Economic Partnership Agreements negotiation processes in West Africa and Southern Africa,Carmen Paping,2021-06-25,"['Prof. Markus Haverland', 'Prof. Adria Albareda Sanz']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This paper aimed to evaluate which regional integration theory best explains the negotiation processes of West Africa and Southern Africa regarding the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the European Union (EU). The EPAs are trade agreements whereby regions gain preferential access to the European market while partially opening up their domestic markets. West Africa and Southern Africa approached the EPA negotiations significantly different, with West African countries mandating their regional institution called the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to negotiate with the EU on their behalf, while the Southern African countries negotiated with the EU directly on the governmental level.
The two theories applied in this study were liberal intergovernmentalism and neofunctionalism, which are the most prominent theories used to explain regional integration. The main argument by liberal intergovernmentalist is that member states and their national preferences dominate the regional integration process. In contrast, neofunctionalist argue that regional integration is dominated by elites and interest groups who shifted their loyalties to the regional level and that regional institutions established by member states can reach a certain level of autonomy. From these theories, three propositions were derived each, which were tested on the cases of the EPA negotiation processes of West Africa and Southern Africa.
Analysing the first set of propositions, the aim was to determine whether national interest groups or regional interest groups influenced the national preference formation of governments. In both regions, interest groups, such as export industries, farmers organisations and trade associations, were active nationally and regionally. However, the preferences of the West African and Southern African governments reflected the demands from the national interest groups to a larger extent than regional interest groups’ demands, as expected by liberal intergovernmentalist theory. The second set of propositions focused on the role of the regional institutions. ECOWAS had an active role in the West Africa EPA negotiations, and the ECOWAS Commission was able to influence the negotiations in its favour, as neofunctionalist theory predicts. On the contrary, Southern Africa’s regional institution, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), was relatively absent during the EPA negotiations. Therefore, the SADC Secretariat was unable to influence the outcome of the negotiations, in line with liberal intergovernmentalism. The third set of propositions examined the negotiation process on the regional level. Both in West Africa and Southern Africa, negotiations were dominated by asymmetric interdependence between countries and interstate bargaining. This process was expected by liberal intergovernmentalists.
To conclude, liberal intergovernmentalism has its limits, mainly when it comes to capturing African countries’ dependence on the EU. Still, the theory has the most explanatory relevance when analysing the EPA negotiation processes of West Africa and Southern Africa",
Wie is toch die elite? Een inhoudsanalyse van het begrip ‘elite’ en het omringende discours in Nederlandse kranten,Hadassa Slob,2021-06-25,['Dr. B.C.M. Kester'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In de 21ste eeuw is het begrip ‘elite’ een vast onderdeel gaan uitmaken van het politieke en publieke debat, mede onder invloed van het populisme. De term is echter geen eenduidig begrip: afhankelijk van de context kunnen er verschillende groepen mee aangeduid worden. De manier waarop media invulling geven begrippen en situaties heeft invloed op hoe burgers actualiteiten interpreteren en op hun meningsvorming. Dit is ook van toepassing op nieuws over elite(s). In hoeverre de aandacht voor elite(s) is toegenomen en hoe zij gerepresenteerd worden in Nederlandse kranten, staat centraal in dit thesisonderzoek. Op basis van eerder onderzoek wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen kwaliteitskranten en populaire kranten en mogelijke verschillen in hun aandacht voor en invulling van elite(s). Hiervoor is een mixed-method benadering gebruikt, waarbij een kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse worden gecombineerd.
Theorieën uit de 20e eeuw laten zien dat discussie over de macht van elites en de diverse soorten elites geen nieuw verschijnsel is, maar onderzoek naar elites heeft zich voor zover bekend niet eerder gericht op mediacommunicatie over elites. Uitgangspunt van de discourstheorie is dat betekenis voortdurend onderhandeld wordt in taal en communicatie; de ervaring van de werkelijkheid en taal oefenen een wederzijdse invloed uit. Berichtgeving van kranten maakt ook deel uit van deze wisselwerking.
2
Een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse van nieuwsartikelen gepubliceerd vanaf 2008 tot begin 2021 laat zien dat kwaliteitsmedia structureel meer aandacht besteden aan elites dan populaire media. Dit is deels te verklaren door het feit dat kwaliteitskranten ten opzichte van populaire kranten meer nieuws over politiek en economie publiceren, en juist politieke en economische elites de boventoon voeren in berichtgeving. Wat hier ook een rol in kan spelen, is dat kwaliteitsmedia over meer verschillende elites schrijven dan populaire media, dit blijkt uit de kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse.
Wanneer de elite een hoofdrol speelt in populaire krantenartikelen wordt zij voornamelijk neergezet als probleem of oorzaak van een probleem; in kwaliteitsmedia is deze relatie minder vanzelfsprekend. Thema’s die vaak terugkomen in de context van elites zijn die van de elite als tegenpartij, de elite als geïsoleerde groep, het populisme en machtsstrijd. Dat dit voornamelijk negatieve associaties zijn is deels te verklaren doordat negativiteit en conflict bijdragen aan de nieuwswaardigheid van berichten.
Een van de tegenstellingen die vaak terugkomt is het contrast volk tegenover elite. In kwaliteitsmedia blijkt deze tegenstelling op verschillende manieren invulling te krijgen. Dit maakt het in eerder onderzoek gehanteerde uitgangspunt van volk tegenover elite als indicator van populisme onhoudbaar: in sommige gevallen gaat dit op, in andere niet. Inzicht in de context is noodzakelijk om te kunnen bepalen of er sprake is van populistisch discours.
Op basis van de thematische analyse krijgt het populisme meer podium in populaire media dan in kwaliteitsmedia. Ook is de opgemerkte associatie van de politieke elite met negativiteit meer prominent in populaire kranten. Hoewel een kritische houding ten opzichte van elites belangrijk is, kan een eenzijdig negatieve berichtgeving over de politieke elite resulteren in wantrouwen en op deze manier de democratie onder druk zetten.","['inhoudsanalyse', 'media', 'kranten', 'discours', 'elite', 'anti-elitisme', 'populisme']"

communities capabilities, rights and cooperation. This analysis has demonstrated essential steps that
governments need to take in order to ensure recognition and basic community capabilities for
environmentally-just surroundings. This study has also shown that frames are crucial in understanding
governments articulation of goals and objectives but it has also become clear that these frames are
globalising and changing, along with public opinion. Therefore there is a need for more monitoring and
strategic management within the policy-making process in order to achieve environmental and climate
justice while at the same time expanding on the role of the state to satisfy their citizens fundamental

By analyzing the behavior and actions of China through the lens of two leadership models, this research concluded that China is not a legitimate leader in the climate change regime. The reason for this is that China is not a reliable instrumental or directional leader. As a result, China has not acquired consent from the developed countries in the negotiations. China does, however, assume another leadership role. The actor is a consistent ideational, instrumental, and structural leader in the group of developing countries. China provides positive incentives to these countries, unites their demands, and defends their interests. One of China’s aims is to grant flexibility and sovereignty to these weaker actors and empower them. This demonstrates that China is aiming to support the developing countries and acquire their consent. Therefore, the purpose of this leadership role is to realize win-win outcomes. However, it is also likely that China aims to gain influence and promote a positive image of itself. In the end, China remains a pivotal and decisive actor in the climate change regime.",
"Horen, zien en niet participeren: Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar de verschillende motivaties van de jongere en oudere stille meerderheid om niet te participeren in de journalistiek",Nadia Mentzel,2021-06-24,['Dr. M. Slot'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Steeds meer nieuwsorganisaties proberen het publiek te betrekken bij het journalistieke productieproces – dit wordt ook wel participatieve journalistiek genoemd. Burgerparticipatie bestond altijd al, maar technologie faciliteerde de mogelijkheid daartoe. Vanuit democratisch en economisch-strategisch oogpunt kan het als innovatief worden gezien. Hoewel steeds meer journalisten interactie zoeken met hun lezers, blijkt een groot deel van het publiek niet te participeren. De meeste mensen zijn nieuwsconsumenten, en ondanks de toegenomen participatiemogelijkheden gaat hun rol niet verder dan het lezen, kijken en beluisteren van nieuws. Een veelgehoorde verklaring voor achterblijvende participatie is de digitale generatiekloof tussen jongere en oudere nieuwsgebruikers, waarbij de oudere generatie innovaties later of nooit omarmt vanwege het hebben van minder technologische vaardigheden. Daarentegen blijken ook jongvolwassenen niet te participeren in de journalistiek en toont onderzoek een beperkte generatiekloof aan. De vaardigheid met technologie lijkt dan ook slechts voor een deel een verklaring te bieden voor niet-participatie. Daarom is in deze masterthesis de volgende vraag beantwoord: Wat zijn de verschillende motivaties van Nederlandse jongere en oudere nieuwsgebruikers om geen gebruik te maken van de participatieve instrumenten die Nederlandse online nieuwsplatformen aanbieden? Om deze vraag te beantwoorden zijn er zestien semi-gestructureerde diepte-interviews met jongere (<30 jaar) en oudere (>50 jaar) nieuwsconsumenten afgenomen. Uit een thematische analyse van de interviewtranscripties komt naar voren dat er veel overeenkomsten zijn tussen de jongere en oudere respondenten. Zij worden met name weerhouden door de, volgens hen, onveilige online omgeving. Beide generaties noemen hun gevoel van aversie tegen de online gemeenschap en controleverlies, zoals over hun privacy en professionele beeldvorming. Het valt op dat in de belangrijkste verschillende motiveringen de jongeren rekening houden met hun toekomstige rol in de maatschappij, terwijl de ouderen hun huidige positie in acht nemen. De levensfase waarin de nieuwsgebruikers verkeren, en niet technologie-vaardigheid, lijkt bepalend te zijn voor de belangrijkste verschillende motivaties om niet te participeren in de journalistiek. Het gebrek aan technologische vaardigheden lijkt niet belangrijk te zijn om de generatiekloof te begrijpen. De vraag is dan ook of het nog relevant is om ouderen en jongeren met elkaar te vergelijken op het gebied van hoe zij met technologie omgaan.","['Journalistiek', 'participatie', 'niet-gebruikers', 'motivaties', 'generaties']"
The changing nature of broadcasting: towards user-generated radio. An explorative study about roles and motivations within online independent stations’ produsers,Arianna Ballanti,2021-06-24,['Arno van der Hoeven'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Often defined as the 'forgotten’, ‘secondary’ and ‘invisible’ medium, radio has been significantly under-thoretised in media studies. Due to the emergence of innovative technologies and a new participatory culture, alternative models of radio are rising, while the boundaries between producers and consumers progressively blur. In particular , online independent stations present an enviable potential for growth. Such stations are web-based and independently run, meaning they are not affiliated with any media networks. They show a correspondence with earlier models of community and pirate radio , but are also
profoundly influenced by contemporary media trends such as platformisation and produsage. Because of these characteristics, this medium represents an intriguing subject of investigation. Due to the increased level of participation, it becomes relevant to analyse how
radio roles related to the production/distribution and consumption evolve in the context of the converged mediascape. At the same time, exploring motivations that guide people to actively interact with this medium provides interesting insights into its converged and multifaceted nature, highlighting its connections and differences with traditional models of radio, community and pirate stations, user-generated content and music streaming platforms.
Thus, this thesis aims to respond to the following research question: How can we understand roles and motivations within online independent radio? The research draws on data collected
via qualitative interviews with ten stakeholders within two Dutch online independent stations, Operator Radio and Radio Tempo Nao Para. Participants have been sampled on a purposive basis, in an attempt to provide a more diverse range of answers and better illustrate the operational structure of the stations. Transcripts of the interviews are examined by means of thematic analysis with the support of the software Atlas.TI. The analysis resulted in 8 categories and 8 subcategories describing roles and motivations within online independent radio. This thesis represents a valuable contribution to radio research, to theories about convergence, participatory culture, produsage and user-generated content, and, finally, to Uses & Gratifications research, as motivations are explored through a U&G
perspective. The study also represents a starting point for institutions in The Netherlands and all around the world to recognize the potential of online independent stations to shape local and global communities, as well as promote art and culture, and hence the need for policies to support their development.","['Radio', 'Community media', 'Convergence', 'Participation', 'Platformisation']"
“Give Sustainability a chance”: A digital ethnography of fashion YouTubers,Cheyu Hsu,2021-06-24,['Dr. Christian Simon Ritter'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The purpose of this research project is twofold. Firstly, this research aims to gain a better understanding of the interactions within a slow fashion community on YouTube and the ways fashion content creators engage with their audiences to expand the scale of their channels. Secondly, their approach to promote sustainable fashion brands through eWOM videos is studied to capture collaborations between influencers and fashion brands through marketing endorsement. To achieve the objective, a mix-method approach, including digital ethnography and computational network analysis, was applied. Based on 30 days of digital ethnography, the
online interactions between the slow fashion content creators and their audiences were studied. On the other hand, quantitative results were gained through the data retrieval based on the queries of ‘declutter wardrobe’, ‘ethical fashion', and for three interviewed YouTube accounts to comprehend the overall interaction and popularity of the slow fashion 
communities active on YouTube. Based on the results, slow fashion YouTubers are found to engage actively both with the audience and other YouTubers through post-video discussions. Moreover, they tend to create genuine and honest contents while managing social media channels to increase the number of subscribers. Networking with YouTubers dedicating to similar values is also essential to make cross-channel promotions possible and grow their followings. Furthermore, the identities of slow fashion YouTubers range widely from casual content creator to independent solo entrepreneur and entrepreneurs depending on multiple other businesses. Simultaneously, they engage in social activism against injustice and raise awareness for mental health to develop the persona in the online sphere. To promote sustainable fashion products, a series of research and selection are done priorly to generate sponsored eWOM aligning ethical and sustainable values. Such findings provide an academic understanding of the sustainable fashion community on social media. Through the parasocial interaction with the virtual community and the genuine content depictions, fashion influencers are able to promote slow fashion in the online sphere to gain the awareness of sustainable alternative of fashion. It also offers insight into marketing strategies for fashion industries to promote sustainable products. Future research into fashion influencers can focus more intensively on the perspectives of their audiences.","['sustainability', 'fashion influencer', 'YouTube', 'marketing endorsement', 'vlog']"
The Harry Potter fandom and the fall of J.K. Rowling: A dying community? A look at the impact of J.K. Rowling’s actions on the Harry Potter fan community on YouTube,Michelle van Leeuwen,2021-06-24,['William McCarthy'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The Harry Potter franchise is one of the most popular media franchises in the world, and has a dedicated fan following. Harry Potter fans have formed communities on many social media platforms, and an especially interesting one is the Harry Potter fan community on YouTube. However, in the last five years, controversial actions of Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling have affected the state of the fandom. In 2016, a black actress was cast to play Hermione Granger in the play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a choice J.K. Rowling endorsed on Twitter, and which received very mixed reactions. In 2016 the movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was also released, a prequel to the Harry Potter story and the first movie in a new series in the Harry Potter universe of which J.K. Rowling was the scriptwriter. Her writing for this movie was generally well received, but the sequel that was released in 2018, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was not. Comments J.K. Rowling made about the sexual relationship of characters Grindelwald and Dumbledore angered many fans, who thought it was unnecessary and ridiculous to share this information, and a form of queerbaiting. Lastly, in 2020, J.K. Rowling posted a series of tweets that were considered to be transphobic by many of her fans. The aim of this study is to uncover the consequences of her actions on the Harry Potter fan community on YouTube, and how the nature of YouTube as a social media platform is related to this. Fan communities on YouTube is a subject that has not been researched enough yet, so this study fills part of that gap. Additionally, this study demonstrates the effects that fan communities have on the personal lives of individuals. The results of this study show that the actions of J.K. Rowling have negatively affected the state of the Harry Potter fan communities on YouTube within a process that has taken place over several years. The consequences have been so severe, that there have been dedicated Harry Potter YouTubers who have chosen to leave the fandom. Also, the nature of Harry Potter YouTube fan communities has slightly changed as well, as fans have reacted in different ways to the controversies and the community has therefore become more divided. The study shows that there are three possible reactions: loyalty, acceptance and rejection. Additionally, the effects of the J.K. Rowling controversies are noticeable in the social awareness of the YouTube community, and in the self-reflection of the YouTubers.","['fandom', 'Harry Potter', 'J.K.

Digitalization in the luxury fashion industry. A case study on two major fashion houses and their branding strategies in a suddenly digital landscape,Christine Lieu,2021-06-24,['Dr. Mathias Boënne'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In this digital age, most industries are increasingly adopting new technologies, while others are considering social media as an essential part of their daily operations. Despite its conservative and elitist nature, the luxury fashion industry is no exception to the rule. In the past decade, the most important fashion houses were seen to implement digital means into their fashion shows, and use social media in a more creative manner to connect with their consumers. However, these practices were mostly seen as experimental; only up until the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, where the luxury fashion industry was faced with the need to digitalize all operations in order to stay afloat. Hence, this study aims to investigate how major fashion houses are shifting their existing branding strategies into fully digital activities, in response to the 2020 pandemic. Two case studies were chosen for their international influence in the industry: Louis Vuitton and Gucci. A thematic analysis was performed with data from March 2020 until this day, and consisted of 60 newspapers articles coming from important fashion publications – such as, the Business of Fashion and Vogue – as well as nine public interviews of Louis Vuitton and Gucci’s insiders found on YouTube. The aim of using two different sources is to triangulate the data between journalistic analysis and fashion insiders’ perspectives. Results of this study showed that despite being similar their image of luxury fashion benchmarks, Louis Vuitton and Gucci dealt with the Covid-19 issues in a different way. While Louis Vuitton engaged in immediate digital changes, resulting in commercial success in difficult times, it took more time for Gucci to rebound from the pandemic; as a matter of fact, Gucci rose to the top again when the brand started to successfully combine an efficient use of social media and digital shows with a return to a more traditional brand signature. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of luxury fashion branding in the context of (post-)Covid-19 challenges linked to the digitalization of the industry; between traditions, heritage and digital innovation.","['luxury fashion industry', 'Fashion Week', 'fashion branding', 'marketing communications', 'digitalization', 'social media']"
"“Oh my god, it moves!” A qualitative analysis of how millennials experience conversational agents of financial institutions.",Gunansh Singh,2021-06-24,['Prof. Matthijs Leendertse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the recent years, conversatinal agents have increasingly been gaining fame for providing assistance in multiple domains, one of which is customer support. With each passing day, more and more industries are implementing this technology to help with menial tasks, and save resources such as money and time. By the same token, financial institutions too have been quick to adopt this technology. While ample attention has been paid to the adoption of conversational agents, not much light has been thrown on its adaptation in these realms based on the needs of the consumer. By using the elements of social psychology and breaking online consumer experience into four elements of namely infromativeness, entertainment, sensory appeal, and social presece, this study applies the same to the perception of chatbots and answers the following question: how do millenials experience banking chatbots? To do so, ten in-depth interviews of millenials who had previously interacted with a banking chatbot were carried out and thematically analysed. The results of the study show that how informative and socially present a banking chatbot is, matters most to the consumers, while the entertaining and sensorially appealing elements do not take much pecedence in their experience of a bank’s chatbot. Just like their bank manager, as long as the chatbot helps with their issues, smiles at them, and keep their money safe, the millenials seem to be satisfied with the experience.","['Chatbots', 'Anthropomorphism', 'Conversational Agents', 'Online Consumer Experience', 'Banks.']"

Neuromarketing in Entertainment Media: To what extent does brand placement in the form of product placement and auditory support in film significantly influence brand affiliation?,Esmee van den Brink,2021-06-24,['Petra Tenbült'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The emergence of digital streaming services has facilitated the ubiquity of film as an entertainment medium. This development pushes brands to consider more innovative subliminal branding and marketing strategies to target consumers on subconsciously. Past studies have investigated different types of brand placement as subliminal advertising techniques used to target consumers in a non-commercial setting. This type of neuromarketing has been researched with respect to brand resonance, measuring brand or product memory. This paper, however, means to investigate the affective cognitive connections developed towards a brand following brand placement exposure. The current study looks at two types of brand placement as subliminal advertising techniques and its influence on brand affiliation. The formulated research question “to what extent does brand placement in the form of product placement and auditory support in film significantly influence brand affiliation?” was investigated using a two-by-three factorial between-subjects design. More specifically, product placement and auditory support were measured on two and three levels, respectively. A total of six experimental manipulations were developed, and respondents were exposed to one of the six conditions at random. Findings showed that the subtle product placement in combination with neutral auditory support influenced brand affiliation more strongly than the other conditions. However, when critically assessing the data, there showed to be slight nuances which implicated the study in drawing definitive conclusions based on the field research. Theoretical background provides support for the significance of product placement and auditory support as predictors of brand resonance as opposed to brand affiliation. The current study was able to conclude that subtle product placement in combination with neutral auditory support is significant in predicting brand affiliation. Despite this, theoretical implications surrounding the reliability of the current study are addressed and mitigated in the discussion. Due to the complexity of measuring the affective state brand affiliation, future research is recommended to implement a longitudinal design and make use of a control group.","['Neuromarketing', 'entertainment media', 'product placement', 'auditory support', 'brand affiliation']"
"Rabbit Food for Men. How Male Vegans From the United Kingdom Prune, Shape and Challenge Existing Gender Ideologies Through Plant-Based Food Consumption",Sally Cheng,2021-06-24,['Dr. Radhika Mittal'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The current fixation to conceptualise traditional and hegemonic masculinity using animal-derived foods has manifested into various gender related issues in contemporary society (Adams, 2015). For example, the expectation that men ought to consume meat to be masculine stems from historical findings regarding the symbolic value of these foods combined with societal expectations of gender-congruent food consumption (Cavazza et al., 2015). The connection between manliness and meat is strengthened by arguments from scholars illustrating its representational value for masculine domination, virility and physical strength (Gambert & Linné, 2018; Sobal, 2005). Despite the wide range of new possibilities to represent and interpret masculinities in contemporary society, the importance of meat and other animal-derived products as a synecdoche for manliness prevails.
Consequently, disparities arise regarding the perception of masculinity when men actively subvert and repudiate gender-congruent food consumption – choosing plant-based foods and veganism over animal-derived foods and omnivorism instead. This study investigates these negotiations for alternative and recontextualised concepts of masculinities using experiences from male vegans from the United Kingdom. Not only does this thesis unearth insights regarding how veganism facilitates alternative performances and evocations of manliness, but it also exemplifies how mediated narratives and platforms, such as Instagram, are essential tools to induce and elicit socio-cultural change. The main research question in this study is: How do male vegan Instagrammers from the United Kingdom challenge and attempt to normalise existing gender ideologies in their Instagram usage? Furthermore, the sub-question is: How do British male vegan Instagrammers interpret different masculinities?
Moreover, 11 in-depth interviews were conducted to acquire knowledge about the subversion of traditional masculinity via vegan foodways and how this was experienced and manifested by the respondents. The interviews accounted for approximately 14 hours of data. The data collection was subsequently analysed using grounded theory and thematic analysis, which provided four main themes: Development of Emotional Literacy, Amalgamation and Departmentalisation of Masculinities, Locus of Control and Ambivalence of Inclusion. As revealed in the findings, the participants used multiple tactics to normalise and challenge existing gender ideologies in their Instagram use. In sum, veganism aided the respondents in developing emotional literacy resulting in improved abilities to articulate their emotionality and empathy towards animals and other people.
Further, the fluidity of masculinity was emphasised in this study; one’s perception is imperative to the experience and conceptualisation of manliness. Consequently, these revelations are articulated on Instagram to create an inclusive community based on relatability and accessibility. Nonetheless, the respondents’ endeavours illustrated the propensity of performing traditional masculine behaviour when negotiating and eliciting these social changes, which can be concerning. In essence, this study encapsulated vegan men’s ability to convey manliness without the inclusion and consumption of animal-based foods using a sample study concerning 11 male vegan Instagrammers.","['Traditional masculinity', 'Hegemonic masculinity', 'Masculinities', 'Food consumption', 'Impression management', 'Gender', 'Veganism', 'Foodways']"
"“Girls Can Do Anything”, Can’t They? A Close Study Into the Representation of Female Teenage Identity Construction in Popular Global Teen Series Elite (2018-)",Elke Oude Weernink,2021-06-24,['Dr. M. Sommier'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","For today's so-called Netflix generation, teen series are a primary source for self-identification, finding role models and educating themselves on the various aspects of teenage life. However, teen series have traditionally been inundated with stereotypical representations of female adolescence. Now, with the growing importance and visibility of postfeminist movements, teen series are increasingly adapting to this societal quest for gender equality and female empowerment. With the ongoing concerns about both these postfeminist and stereotypical manifestations in mind, a critical stance towards one of today's most popular teenage series Elite is, at the very least, highly necessary.
This study answers the following question: How does the recent popular global coming-of-age teen series Elite (2018-) negotiate (non-)traditional representations of female teen identity construction? By drawing on theories of representation, gender, postfeminism, identity and Orientalism, all applied to traditional and non-traditional representations of female teenage identity in teen series, this study offers a comprehensive and in-depth examination of the contemporary teenage girl on screen. This study is conducted from a postfeminist perspective and by conducting a Multimodal Discourse Analysis. This method has proven to be appropriate and successful in exploring the compatible ways in which both text and images are used to shed light on the representation of female teenage identity construction.
The analysis of Elite showed that the overarching theme within the representation of female teenagers’ identity is that of postfeminist Girl Power, whereby the girl characters are portrayed as (sexually) empowered, confident, intelligent and independent women. This study highlighted the importance of space and context in determining the empowered or submissive position of female teenagers, both within the narrative and indirectly in society. The contexts of (1) home, (2) school, (3) nightlife, (4) socioeconomic status and (5) spaces of love and intimacy were found to influence not only how female teenage identity is constructed, but also how it is expressed. Yet, before celebrating this promising future for female teenage representation, one must not ignore or underestimate the stereotypes and postfeminist pitfalls that still exist in duality with this young female empowerment in teen TV. Especially in the areas of intersectionality and race, there is still much ground to be gained if we are to achieve an empowered representation of young womanhood, beyond the white, Western manifestation of freedom and agency, and extending towards the multiple social, economic and cultural layers of post-modern societies.","['Representation', 'Femininity', 'Teenage Identity', 'Sexuality', 'Teen series']"
Domo Ludens. Manifestations of Playful Design in Dutch Architecture,Vedar Cvetanovic,2021-06-23,['Dr. Teresa De La Hera'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Play can take place in numerous manners, and although due academic attention has been paid to play in relation to video games, certain manifestations of play remain underexplored. In this study the focus lies on playful architecture. The main goal is to explore the ways in which architecture becomes a material manifestation of playful design. The research seeks to approach the study of architecture and play through a lens of playful design by providing an answer to the following research question: How does Dutch architecture employ playful design elements in its buildings? The past and present bespoke playful character of Dutch buildings makes them ideal subjects for such analysis. A scrutinous thematic analysis of visual representations of 103 buildings derived from an extensive online architectural database of over 4,000 buildings in the Netherlands, ultimately led to the discovery of four main ways in which Dutch architecture employs playful elements. The notion of playfulness was operationalised by means of indicators that resulted from an scrutinous theoretical framework. Buildings’ observable traits such as colour, form, scale and material, but also those more latent such as vertigo inducing, biomimicry and reinterpreting the familiar, serve as pillars upholding the main themes. These themes amount to play via contrast, play via nudging, play via reference, and lastly, play via subversion. Play via contrast entails playful elements that exist in lieu of some form of disparity either within the building itself, or between it and its surroundings. This can be in terms of playful contrasts of colours, shapes and materials, but also by standing out in relation to its environment via any of those traits. Play via nudging covers those elements that architecture exhibits that are designed with the intention to trigger an effect of some sort in its ‘users’. This can be that it nudges its users pathing, that it is designed with the purpose of inducing vertigo, or that it is manipulable in itself, allowing individuals to interact with it on a material level. Play via reference overarches playful aspects relating to both biomimicry and imitation, where buildings (latently or manifestly) make reference to objects appearing in nature or society. An extension of this, is the phenomenon of architecture receiving colloquial nicknames that often directly relate to that which they are emulating (e.g. The swan in Rotterdam). Lastly, play via subversion covers aspects such as reinterpreting the familiar, and comparably, subverting social norms, stimulating people to rethink what is considered a home, an office or a bridge. This theme also comprises concrete phenomena such as undermining expectations via visual illusion and suspending disbelief through seemingly gravity-defying acts of physical suspension. Finally, a general conclusion is that in line with existing scholarly work, the concept of contrast is found to be central to the concept of playfulness, play manifests materially in the form of architecture in four key manners, though all of them ultimately depend on some form of contrast.","['Playful design', 'Playful architecture', 'Ludification', 'Creative industries', 'Thematic analysis']"
Explaining motivations of China’s emergency aid,Chris Ross,2021-06-22,"['Prof. Dr. Geske Dijkstra', 'Dr. Koen Stapelbroek']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"As reoccurring natural and man-made disasters continue to cost lives and inflict suffering, different forms of humanitarian aid and relief assistance remain a consistent necessity in the international community. With an increasing number of donors providing such relief, a question arises how emerging donors participate and contribute to humanitarian efforts. This thesis explores an aspect of this topic by utilizing the core international relations theories, realism, liberalism, and constructivism, to determine motivations behind China’s “emergency humanitarian aid”. Though each theory offers alternative explanations for China’s emergency aid behavior, a congruence analysis was used to determine the theory which best explains the motivations. The thesis analyzes 140 emergency response cases for 31 countries between 2000 and 2015. Among the competing theories, the findings suggest realism offers the most compelling explanation for China’s provision of emergency aid.","['China', 'congruence analysis', 'emergency aid', 'humanitarian', 'international relations']"
A social perspective on COVID-19: How the pandemic impacts experienced socioeconomic insecurity among people of migrant background in the Dutch Randstad,"Nobbe, T.",2021-06-21,"['Godfried Engbersen', 'Arjen Leerkes']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Based on multiple linear regression analyses of the Impact Corona dataset compiled by Kieskompas, in the Netherlands, the moderating effect of social capital on migrant background-related socioeconomic insecurity due to COVID-19 is measured. The context in which this occurs is explored, investigating the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Randstad metropole area in the Netherlands, consisting of the cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague. This study shows that migrant background increases experienced socioeconomic insecurity, and that differences can be found among the different groups. Social capital is capable of decreasing the experienced socioeconomic insecurity generally. Analysis of its moderating effect indicates that its protective qualities differ across migrant groups. For some, the social capital held within their group alleviates their experienced socioeconomic insecurity, and for others it does not.","['COVID-19', 'social capital', 'ethnic diversity', 'socioeconomic insecurity']"
"Art, Algorithms and the North Sea: Decolonizing and Reimagining Human Perceptions of the North Sea","Brussee, E.",2021-06-21,"['Jess Bier', 'Freek de Haan']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"As a contribution to the interdisciplinary movement to decolonize fields across the social sciences and humanities, this thesis investigates how creatives reimagine the relationships that exist between humans and non-humans of the North Sea, by using automated technologies. Humans, automated tech, and environments co-create alternative visions of the relations that people share with the North Sea, meaning that they are interrelated entities that build on each other’s work. This thesis combines Actor Network Theory (ANT) and Decolonial studies to study artworks and algorithms within sociological theory. ANT focuses on the connections between human and non-human entities and considers non-human agency within the forming of networks, whereas Decolonial studies help to identify disparities among living entities and envisage different intersections of science, art, technology, and ecology that are necessary to explore the multifaceted issue of viewing human to other-than-humans relations of the North Sea. Moreover, the topic aligns with other political and social affairs such as climate justice, which makes the investigation of alternative perceptions of our relation to the North Sea an important step towards decolonising the perception of ‘nature’. A document analysis of multi-media was conducted to analyse textual and audio material (podcasts) about artworks, as this method helps to systematically analyse the material into themes. Participant observation and semi-structured interviews allowed for a deeper understanding of the artist’s motivations and decision making processes that is significant for this thesis. Empirical data was collected from different cases, among which Taal voor de Toekomst is at the core of this thesis. This project experiments with an algorithm (AI Zee) to create an ecological language that can express relations between beings. Two smaller cases complement the primary case, as they show a different way to co-create with AI to either personify the North Sea or try to see the world from a more-than-human point of view.","['Human – Nonhuman', 'Algorithms', 'Decolonialism', 'Art', 'Embassy of the North Sea']"
Bringing the Migrant Community to the Governance Table - A qualitative case-study on governance of the taalmilieucoach-project in Bospolder-Tussendijken,"Drijfhout, Y.",2021-06-20,"['Wenda Doff', 'Gijs Custers']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The energy transition is one of the biggest and most urgent challenges the Netherlands is facing. In order to switch to renewable energy sources, a combination of public and private actors is involved to tackle the diversity of challenges related to this process. Besides technological alterations of energy infrastructures, transitions form a social challenge that lay bare, and possibly even strengthen, the present social inequalities inherent to urban environments. This thesis focusses on a local project revolving around taalmilieucoaches, that are migrant women who voluntarily participate in a sustainability intervention that is part of the energy transition in the neighbourhood Bospolder-Tussendijken. The goal of this research is to explore how governance actors cooperate in social challenges in the Dutch energy transition, and to find out how citizens with a migration background position themselves as civil society actors. The results indicate that the complexity of the energy transition creates a governance process in which private market actors and the decentralized government complicate participatory parternships, due to which civil society is not gaining the autonomy it is seeking. Simultaneously, the taalmilieucoaches gain autonomy due to their new position in the public sphere, which allows them to mediate between their ethnic community and the energy transition. This research therefore shows that their experience of ecological citizenship leads to a sense of responsibility and advocacy, that allows them to overcome the governmentality. Instead, the taalmilieucoaches strengthen the position of civil society vis-à-vis in the energy transition.","['energy transition', 'governance', 'ecological citizenship', 'environmental-friendly behavior', 'migrant networks']"

In that same year, COVID-19 took a hold of the world and influenced almost every aspect of normal life. The study’s primary aim was to examine whether the BLM breakthrough was somehow effectuated by the pandemic and its social consequences. Using semi-structured interviews, ten BLM allies were questioned about their involvement with the BLM movement over the past eight years. Respondents were aged between 20 and 30 years old, identified as white and attended at least one BLM protest in 2020. Their answers were coded and analyzed. The majority of respondents believed that their involvement was influenced by the pandemic, through the fact that they had more time to themselves. Furthermore, they chose to attend a protest, despite of the social distancing efforts, because they realized the importance of the BLM sentiment. In conclusion, the pandemic does seem to have contributed to the BLM breakthrough in 2020, supporting the main premise of this study.","['Black Lives Matter', 'COVID-19', 'interconnectedness', 'personal involvement']"

In 2020, numerous people in the Netherlands decided to share their thoughts about the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. The biggest part of these people supported the movement and the people posting about it, especially on personal Instagram accounts with few followers. Here, mostly likeminded people communicated with each other. However, on bigger, corporate accounts there was much more discussion and conflict around BLM in the comment section.

Anti-Islam discrimination: through the experiences of Muslim women in the Netherlands,"Gashi, G.",2021-06-20,"['Maja Hertoghs', 'Samira van Bohemen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This paper seeks to answer or document experiences on the question: how are multiple forms of gendered anti-Islam discrimination experienced by Muslim women with a refugee / migrant background in the Netherlands? For this study 14 Muslim women in the Netherlands were interviewed with a life / oral histories method, and it showed that Muslim women experience intersectional discrimination, which is a combination of religion, gender and ethnicity, but the main factor of influence being religion, as the Islam is inherently linked with specific ethnicities. The participants reported experiencing multiple forms of discrimination, such as exclusion, rejection, sexual harassment, intrusive questions and more. The described experiences seemed to be rooted in the stereotyping and stigmas of Muslim women by the media and right wing politicians. The experienced anti-Islam discrimination violates Muslim women in their freedom to dress, express their identity, and autonomy.","['intersectionality', 'Muslim women', 'gender', 'anti-Islam discrimination', 'Islamophobia']"
The experiences of bicultural people and what they teach us about the infrastructure of whiteness,"Jacobs, A.",2021-06-20,"['Willem Schinkel', 'Jess Bier']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This thesis explores the particular position of bicultural people in the Netherlands, who have a certain proximity and distance to whiteness. The focus will be placed on bicultural people that are half white. Their experiences can be placed in three central themes; questions of exclusion, passing and discrimination, which teach us something about the infrastructure of whiteness. The experiences of my respondents will be analyzed with the tools provided by theory about passing, whiteness, infrastructures, and everyday racism. Inspired by Patricia Hill Collins, I hope to have contributed to situated, partial knowledge.","['Whiteness', 'biculturality', 'passing', 'racism', 'ethnicity']"
‘Binding voor een kansrijke toekomst’ Een Participatory Action Research naar het versterken en verduurzamen van sociale en structurele binding met kansarme gezinnen in Bospolder-Tussendijken.,"Stoker, L.",2021-06-20,"['Thomas Swerts', 'Marieke van Houte']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Het realiseren van sociaal bereik van jeugdinterventies, of de bekendheid en vertrouwdheid van kansarme gezinnen met gezinsondersteuning en voorzieningen, blijkt in de praktijk een uitdaging. Gebrek aan maatwerk, inlevingsvermogen en vertrouwen zijn hier vaak debet aan. Team Toekomst (TT), één van de teams in het Veerkrachtig BoTu 2028 programma, tracht via cocreatie en inzet van linkwerkers een doeltreffende jeugdinterventie te realiseren. Zij streven om het sociaal bereik van hun interventie te optimaliseren door in te zetten op binding tussen hun linkwerkers en deelnemende gezinnen. In dit Participatory Action Research wordt, middels een samenwerking met participanten, onderzocht hoe binding optreedt en versterkt kan worden. Er wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen sociale en structurele binding, welke potentieel via een feedbackloop op elkaar in werken. De bevindingen tonen aan dat sociale binding, oftewel een vertrouwensband tussen linkwerker en deelnemers, door de persoonlijke werkwijze van de linkwerker snel ontstaat. De sociale binding lijkt cocreatie, oftewel een samenwerking tussen linkwerker en deelnemer in de interventie, te bevorderen waardoor structurele binding optreedt. Echter, structurele binding treedt niet altijd op: er spelen meer factoren mee in de ontwikkeling van structurele binding dan de feedbackloop omvat. Vraagstukken rond de opbouw van onafhankelijkheid en participatie in de interventie moeten daarom blijvend in acht genomen worden met oog op het verduurzamen van binding.","['Cocreatie', 'jeugdinterventies', 'sociaal bereik', 'sociale binding', 'structurele binding']"
Exploring Public Opinion Research of Social Movements: The Case of BLM,"Roldán Waals, G.",2021-06-20,"['Bonnie French', 'Willem Schinkel']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This thesis is an exploration aiming to bridge the dissonance between public opinion and the methods through which we explore the perceptions of people about social movements. It relies on the premise that we live in a world of multiple realities, and as such the generalisation of much social science research is only practical in certain contexts. It forefronts the researchers’ onto-epistemological standing as an integral part of doing research. Specifically, this thesis will investigate the case of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and explore how people’s perceptions of this are shifting to a less consistent understanding. Especially when considering the BLM as a catalyst of awareness or as an organisational entity. This research takes an inventive methods approach to its methodology that allows for the respondents to build the research rather than relying on the researcher to procure it. At the same time, personal experiences, thoughts, and biases of the researcher will also be acknowledged and used rather than subverted. This thesis aims to bridge the gap between social science – sociology – research around the way we, as sociologists, make contributions to the field and the world in which we live by also acknowledging the body of the researcher.","['Activism research', 'Black Lives Matter (BLM)', 'Public Opinion Research', 'Inventive method', 'Social movement research']"
Engaging decolonial pedagogies as praxis: Exploring the field of decolonial pedagogical practices in the Netherlands,"Tio, C.",2021-06-20,"['Maja Hertoghs', 'Samira van Bohemen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This explorative study is dedicated to tracing decolonial pedagogical practices around. Focusing on decolonial pedagogical practices situated in the Netherlands, this research maps what such practices are; where they respond to; what questions these practices raise and which dilemmas are brought to the fore by practitioners engaging with decolonial pedagogy. This research takes on a scavenger methodology (Halberstam, 1998), that centers around conversations with students and teachers either affiliated with the university or with art colleges, and with activist collectives. The aim is to think from and with the struggles when decolonial pedagogies are practiced and to situate them in an ‘ecology of decolonial practices’ (Stengers, 2016). This research brings forward the proposal to ‘stay with the trouble” (Haraway, 2016), as way of continuing collective practices of imagination and experimentation with decolonial pedagogy. As such, this study can be considered an empirical contribution to both decolonial proposals from theory and decolonial practices already on their way.","['decolonial pedagogy', 'decolonial praxis', 'Netherlands', '(re-)imagination', 'scavenger methodology']"
SCARRING OR HABITUATION?: THE EFFECT OF PAST UNEMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCES ON LIFE SATISFACTION AND FERTILITY.,"van Helden, M.",2021-06-20,"['Jennifer Holland', 'Daphne van Helden']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This research investigates two new subjects in the field of job insecurity, life satisfaction, and fertility plans: subjective job insecurity and the effect of past unemployment experiences on the relationship between job insecurity and fertility plans. The hypothesis that subjective job insecurity is important for wellbeing and fertility plans is researched. Next to this, I advance the research hypothesis that the impact of past unemployment has a habituating or scarring effect on this relationship. To offer evidence for these hypotheses, I apply techniques of mediation and moderation analysis to data from the fifth round of the European Social Survey (2010). My analysis and results suggested that subjective job security has only an effect on fertility plans when the value of subjective job security is very low. The second analysis, the mediation model, showed that life satisfaction is probably not a strong enough predictor for fertility to reach statistical significance, so it is unlikely that life satisfaction is the mechanism through which job security is associated with fertility intentions. Lastly, a habituation effect of past unemployment experiences is found for the lowest values of job security, namely no job security or currently unemployed.","['Fertility plans', 'Job insecurity', 'Life satisfaction', 'Mediation and moderation analysis', 'Past unemployment experiences']"

Due to this media coverage, the discussion of racism was prominent in the Netherlands on social media. This thesis is a qualitative content analysis for Facebook comments on articles reporting the Black Lives Matter-movement. This way, I researched how the comments fit in the existing theories of racism. These theories came from the works of Bonilla-Silva (2018), Wekker (2016), McIntosh (1989) and Essed and Hoving (2014). After researching 163 comments, I found two themes: ‘us vs them’, in which commenters drew a distinct line between the Dutch and non-Dutch, and ‘speaking out’ in which the user spoke out against the racism in the Netherlands. Additionally, I found separate themes which weren’t supported by the literature: accusations of racism, present innocence and (dis)credit to race. These themes are contemporary and/or specific for the Netherlands.","['social media', 'content analysis', 'Black Lives Matter', 'racism', 'the Netherlands']"

A future, that is not only an imagined or idealized future, but also a future very much materialized and normalized into existence. Next to applying a Critical Discourse Analysis of interviews, social-media posts, the website of M4H, and the Spatial Framework, I conducted a Narrative Walk, with which another outlook on M4H, from the street level up, came into light. It is an area substantiated in its promises for a future-proof future.

From craniology to cultural sensitivity: An explorative research on the experience of people of colour with Dutch mental healthcare,"Kooijman, M.",2021-06-20,"['Maja Hertoghs', 'Samira van Bohemen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"How inclusive is mental healthcare? Studies have raised questions on the adequacy of treatments for Black people and people of colour. Researching this in the Dutch context, this paper argues that while participants overall had good experiences, these were mostly achieved in spite of the current mental health system, rather than because of it. First, the history of psychology is examined, showing its racial origins. Then, conversations with ten clients of colour, using a narrative method, are analysed using concepts from Critical Race Theory. This research reveals several important factors in experiences with mental health in general, thresholds to mental healthcare and the care itself. Thresholds can be: being perceived as different, a high pressure to perform, being expected to do emotional labour and cultural values. Part of these experiences might be caused by therapy being (perceived as) a Western phenomenon. To lower these thresholds and provide people of colour with adequate mental healthcare, cultural sensitivity is needed. However, participants report a lack of cultural sensitivity in Dutch mental healthcare. To close the gap between White people and people of colour in Dutch mental healthcare, this paper recommends further research in the context of the Netherlands. Specifically, this can be achieved by examining current policies of mental healthcare institutions, and testing certain forms of cultural sensitivity in order to improve policies and trainings for therapists.","['cultural sensitivity', 'institutional racism', 'mental healthcare', 'psychology', 'therapy', 'White supremacy']"
"The EU's Obsession with Crisis: On the Politics of the ""Refugee Crisis""","Ike, N.",2021-06-20,"['Willem Schinkel', 'Bonnie French']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This thesis investigates the political implications of the declaration of the “refugee crisis”. By means of a Critical Discourse Analysis, this thesis aims to analyze how a specific articulation of the issue of migration – as crisis – makes certain forms of politics possible, while it renders others impossible. By focusing on three dimensions of the “refugee crisis”, it shows how EU migration politics are centered around an idea of immigration as a “crisis”. First, the EU strategically presents the “refugee crisis” as an external problem, which paves the way for its policy of externalization. Second, and following from the latter, the EU heavily invests in securitizing its external borders. Third, this thesis shows how the aforementioned “exclusionary” dimensions are always accompanied by an underlying capitalist interest, whereby migrants and refugees form a reserve army of cheap labor power (“inclusion”). As such, the working classes are structurally fragmented by borders, thereby averting international solidarity among workers. It concludes with the observation that “crisis” has become the durable norm.","['borders', 'crisis', 'EU migration politics', 'externalization', 'labor', 'migration management', '“refugee crisis”', 'securitization']"
The Museum of the Web. A quantitative study into the Cultural User Experience of Digital Storytelling practices in Virtual Museums,Josephine Timmers,2021-06-20,['dr. Trilce Navarrete Hernandez'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Not only the Covid-19 pandemic, but also developments in virtual tourism and climate change emphasize the importance of museums changing their business models. Developing virtual museum services is currently one of the most important of these changes, especially since remote cultural consumption has severely increased during the past year.
The development of virtual museums - interactive virtual spaces that provide information and exhibit cultural objects in digital format - has rapidly increased since the notion was first introduced in the 1960’s. Simultaneously, a visitor-centred approach emerged, giving rise to a shift from the modernist museum to the post-museum. Virtual museums fall in line with this approach, as they allow for new types of interaction with online visitors. Storytelling is an important practice that allows visitors to engage in their own story. The application of digital storytelling practices in virtual museums creates an opportunity to not only provide a solution for the current restrictions, but to change the museum business model accordingly with a changing society.
This study shows the importance of digital storytelling for virtual museums by conducting a user-centred research, focusing on Cultural User Experience. Cultural User Experience is measured for three virtual museum services of the British Museum, all practicing a different approach to Digital Storytelling. An in-between-subject showed the story is the most important, as no significant difference between digital storytelling and regular storytelling was found in any of the constructs. What the research did find, is that a service that incorporates digital storytelling practices brings about a stronger emotional response and is perceived higher in hedonic qualities than a service that is immersive but offers no explicit storytelling. The study also showed that the application of storytelling for the British Museum services was not enough, as the digital storytelling practices applied did not significantly differ from the regular storytelling practices in perceived user experience or future behaviour. In order for museums to change their business models, virtual museums need to become even more interactive, offering communities to engage and actively share their story.
The findings of this research prove the importance of digital storytelling for virtual museums, but show that in order for visitors to really connect with the virtual museum, museums need further develop their virtual services. This research provides insides the museum sector could use in the development in new services and sheds a new light on Cultural User Experience.","['Virtual Museum', 'Cultural User Experience', '(Digital) Storytelling', 'Visitor-Centred Approach', 'the British Museum']"
Creative Work From Home: an analysis of digital nomads’ creativity and motivation in relation to workspace environment,Kathryn Moy,2021-06-20,['dr. Ellen Loots'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Considering the increase of work-from-home across all sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aims to understand the impact of blurring together work and leisure domains as work-from-home becomes more common. Digital nomads serve as the units of analysis based on their ability to work ‘anytime, anywhere,’ encompassing the group of creatives who work primarily with a laptop and are not unfamiliar to remote working. Most studies investigating creativity in the context of workspace tend to focus on the physical attributes. At the same time, these studies agree that most creative workspaces tend to be more deterministic and contrive a specific approach to creativity than facilitate the creative process. Additional studies also aim to understand the motivational aspects that encourage creatives to pursue a precarious profession under evolving circumstances. To triangulate the relationship between workspace, motivation, and creativity, this predominantly quantitative analysis employed Amabile’s (1996) KEYS measuring creativity within the workspace, Taylor & Kaufman’s (2021) creative trait motivation scales (CTMs), and Chang et al.’s (2018) creativity indicator scale. The survey instrument designed for this study (n = 169) aimed to draw relations between the measurement scales. Findings indicate that workspace does not have a statistically significant influence on creativity and motivation. However, utilizing motivation as a multidimensional concept embodying intrinsic, extrinsic, and amotivational factors, yielded a single significant relationship between intrinsic motivation and creativity. These findings bolster previous studies inferring creatives to be more intrinsically motivated and provide suggestions on supporting remote workers in the foreseeable future of work. The data collected for this study alludes to a more extensive discussion that workspace is not enough to act as a catalyst for creative motivation. Rather than focus on what physical attributes the space has, this study finds that the four walls serve as a framework that enables individuals to modify their experiences. These fundamental needs lend themselves to Ryan & Deci’s (2000) self-determination theory (SDT), in which the workspace enables the individual needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competence. These attributes allow digital nomads to craft the environment depending on the stage of the creative process. Statistical findings coinciding with supplementary qualitative data from open answers and focus group interviews expresses a need for reframing work entirely that falls more in line with Latouche’s (2009) notion of degrowth. Degrowth calls for a more sustainable and inclusive creative workforce while embracing creativity born out of spontaneity, looking at the foreseeable economic opportunities in a post-pandemic world.","['motivation', 'organizational creativity', 'creative workspaces', 'work-from-home', 'digital nomads']"
Music festivals for and by the community. Values Created Through Music Festivals and the Challenges Organizers Face in the Rapidly Growing Industry.,Kerem Celikoglu,2021-06-20,['Prof. Dr. Hans Abbing'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The music festival industry represents the evolution of how communities share experiences to create cultural and artistic value. Furthermore, festivals have also become deeply embedded in the social and economic planning of urban life, often being employed by authorities to stimulate their local ecosystems. As new musical genres developed highly specialized music festivals catering to certain sub communities have emerged, each with differentiated products allowing individuals to participate with other like-minded people creating new ideas and aesthetical tastes. Music festivals have become a significant part of the music industry due to recent developments in the distribution of music. They function as the primary source of revenue for most musicians around the world but also stand as gatekeepers of the music industry through their power of influencing the taste of their audiences. The increased interest and benefits resulted in an exponential growth in the number of festivals, a trend some name festivalization. Festivalization in turn changed the dynamics of competition within the industry, empowering the position of some stakeholders while leaving others in a worse-off situation. Along with the huge growth of the industry came the inevitable consequence of commercialization, which by some companies was exploited to a great extent, creating inefficiencies in the festival ecosystem.
The theoretical framework of this thesis builds upon existing literature on how music festivals have become incubators of values also resulting in the festivalization and the commercialization of the music festival industry. In-depth interviews are conducted with organizers of music festivals differentiated in purpose, scale, location, and artistic focus.
The analysis led to a broad and varied view of the topics at hand. While most festival organizers view their festival to have a positive impact on the artistic and cultural life in their area, their approach in creating such impact differed. While not-for-profit festivals kept a clear objective towards providing the most artistically relevant programs, for-profit ones had to account for different factors such as growth or profit. Some consensus regarding the negative effects of festivalization could be found as most organizers agreed it caused aggressive competition resulting in astronomical artist fees, hurting the industry in general. Opposing views against commercialism was a common occurrence, as some criticized its impact on the artists ability to create, others mentioned how it stimulated underground scenes through creating wider attention around the industry.","['music festivals', 'values', 'festivalization', 'consumerism', 'commercialization.']"
"How do ArtTech startups enter the art market, and how do they position themselves?",Elena Kirpu,2021-06-20,['Prof. Dr. Filip Vermeylen'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study sheds light on a distinct segment of the art market that has exploded in popularity in recent years: ArtTech startups. There are no specific studies on them at the moment. If they are referenced at all, it is in articles about the entire area of startup research. The combination of two seemingly different areas - technology and art is of interest for this research and establishing a common utility for both participants and the art market as a whole. Furthermore, given the situation with the pandemic, these startups are of interest to traditional players (galleries, museums, auctions) for the introduction of special technologies and the development of organizations. As a result, such startups are frequently separated into those that sell their technology, organizations to larger corporations, and those who are attempting to establish themselves as a separate participant in the market. This study investigates the path of ArtTech startups before they enter the market and how do they position themselves after. 16 ArtTech startups were selected to research a recently formed phenomenon. The author conducted 5 in-depth interviews with founders of these startups to understand how the idea was invented, why the market needs it, and how startups manage to convey it to the art market participants. In addition to that, the desktop analysis of 16 startups’ websites was performed, which revealed their vision and mission as well as the ability to convey their ideas to the audience. As a result, it was found by the author of this thesis that the founders of ArtTech startups develop their innovative ideas based on their education and experience in both art and other industries. Identifying the key problems in a particular niche of the cultural sphere, ArtTech startups offer a ready-made solution for the participants of the art market. Their entry into the market is associated with the support of the surrounding network, and further positioning depends on the business strategies of the enterprise. Nonetheless, it was concluded that the phenomenon of ArtTech startups does not yet have a proper impact on the art market, having a point influence only in certain sectors.","['art market', 'ArtTech startups', 'technologies', 'investment', 'innovations', 'blockchain']"
"Inequity in the art market: The rationales for commercial art galleries to specialise
Towards inclusive curation in commercial art galleries",Willemijn Henriëtte van den Berg,2021-06-20,['Anne-Sophie Radermecker'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Female and foreign artists are underrepresented in various facets of the art world, even though the art market projects a liberal and progressive image. The gallerist is the gatekeeper for artistic talent to flourish and pursue a professional career. However, cultural diversity is often addressed in non-commercial intermediaries, whilst research on equity in the art market has been geared towards art fairs and the auction market. This qualitative study examines the role of commercial art gallerists in fostering cultural diversity in contemporary art. The data set comprises ten semi-structured interviews among art galleries and curated online art platforms in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Three themes are developed: (1) equity in the art market, (2) responsibility and appropriate measures, and (3) bias decision-making to overcome risk and uncertainty. The findings suggest that the artistic program and curation process of gallerists does not lead to cultural diversity. The selection of gallery artists is made based on the gallerists' taste and preferences to overcome the high uncertainties related to the quality of artworks and the investment into human capital with associated risks. This leads to specialisation and rational bias-decision making even though novelty is of great importance to gain a competitive advantage. The reflection of personal taste within the gallery program makes the curator vulnerable to critiques and observations that do not correspond with their self-perception. The gallerist becomes less reflective on their program and is unquestioning its potential contribution to inequality within the art market. There are no bad intentions; thus, practical solutions are provided to foster inclusive curation in commercial art galleries based on four types of attitudes towards cultural diversity.","['cultural diversity', 'entrepreneurial bias', 'racism', 'sexism', 'contemporary art.']"
The Box Office and the Long Tail: An Examination of the Effects of Streaming on the Distribution of Box Office Revenue,Tristan Drost,2021-06-20,['Dr. C.W. Handke'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication",The long tail theory suggests that the development of online distribution channels will increase the demand for niche products and shift the demand towards the tail of the sales distribution. Conversely the body of literature that has analysed the effects of online distribution channels on the film industry has shown that the opposite has happened here. In the film industry sales have become more concentrated on a small number of hits. The existing literature on the long tail theory in the film industry has put little focus towards the effects on the primary source of income in the film industry: the box office revenue. Moreover in recent years streaming has become an increasingly popular form of online distribution in the film industry. The literature regarding the effects of streaming is currently relatively limited. This research analyses the effects of streaming as an online channel on the distribution of box office revenue. The research uses box office data from all movies that were screened in cinemas in North America in the period from 1996 until 2019. A time series analysis is used to determine whether the distribution of revenue has become more concentrated after the introduction of streaming. For this research the launch of the streaming platform of Netflix in North America has been considered as the introduction of streaming. The results of this research show that the distribution of revenue has become more concentrated on the top films since the introduction of streaming. Furthermore the results show that the combined market share of the six major film distributors has not increased after the introduction of streaming and only one major distributors has been able to increase its market share in this period. Thus this research provides additional evidence that revenue in the film industry has become more concentrated and supports the claims from previous research that the long tail effect is not present in this particular industry.,"['long tail theory', 'streaming', 'box office', 'concentration of revenue', 'superstars']"
Making Sense of Signal Values and their Purposes among Craft Beer Consumers: The Case of the Netherlands,Gil Kormoss,2021-06-20,['Erwin Dekker'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","It has been well recognized in the literature that individuals are involved in consumption that signal particular symbolic values to others and themselves. Within the cultural consumption literature however, there has been on an ongoing debate concerning the purposes of signalling. While some argue that cultural consumption and tastes and are forms of status attainment in the display of social class, others have suggested that these social borders are fading, and consumption is more a means to construct an identity. This also referred to as the homology versus individualization debate.
The case examined in this thesis is that of craft beer, one of the more recent industries of the cultural industries. Highlight factors such as innovation, experimentation and creativity, it has become increasingly more popular in the Netherlands. In order to get a better understanding of this newly developed cultural industry, a quantitative analysis was conducted on the Dutch craft beer consumer from a socio-economic perspective. This was done by the development of an own typology of the craft beer drinker based upon their lifestyle signalling behaviour. Thereafter, the different signal values and purposes of symbolic craft beer consumption were considered in order to position the case of craft beer within the previously described homology and individualization debate. This study reveals that different types of craft beer consumers exist with different forms of signal values and purposes of symbolic craft beer consumption. These differences are however, not bound to social class, but are rather based upon individualistic factors as a means of identity construction.","['Craft Beer', 'Symbolic Consumption', 'Signalling', 'Homology', 'Individualization']"

To answer this question, we will be performing the first ever application of the Hedonic model to analyze the valuation of the NFT project Crypto Punks. Due to the novelty of the market, we developed a web scraper to recollect the necessary data and create the unique data set that comprises the different attributes of each Crypto Punk.

"Belgian Bande dessinée(s). Industry, policy, legitimacy",Carmen Garcia Audi,2021-06-20,['Carolina Dalla Qhiesa'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","the largest cultural industries in Europe. Therein lies a medium which can be a book and not a book. A medium with links and crossovers with multiple art forms and mediums: comics. Back in 1975, French sociologist Luc Boltanski academically baptised the Bande dessinnée as a separate cultural field. Since its advent and continuing into the present day, comics went through a quest for recognition of its cultural value which has found many setbacks in the way and still today does not enjoy full unanimity. In this thesis I explore the social process of legitimation with the help of the concepts of “field” and “art worlds”. I follow a biographical perspective by highlighting changes in the way from creation to further evolution, understanding what and who determines the transitory value associated with comics. The study follows an interdisciplinary approach mainly fed by cultural economics, economic sociology and political economy. By conducting a case study, the thesis makes sense of a scenery in which transition is shaped by local recognition, political economy aspects and, changing partnerships. I particularly focus on two main actors, the publishing industry and the state and unveil recognise their influence in the way the comics artistic expression evolved. Belgium serves as a double case study in the present qualitative study. The cradle of the European comics tradition has two major language groups (French and Dutchspeaking) with separate politics, policy and administrative determinants, historical traditions, artistic conventions, cultural practices, industry structures, commerce modes and, markets. Both sides display distinct legitimation paths and coinciding strategies. This variety provides for an array of answers to the two research questions, namely “How do the Belgian publishing industry and the state legitimise respectively the comics field?” and “What is the role of partnerships and networks in the legitimation processes?”. Big and independent publishers justify their strategies differently, towards the commerce and the art poles respectively, but hostility is somewhat fading. Today, we can assert that timid and scattered, the state actively intervenes and shapes the field, towards the art pole. The thesis ends with an evaluation of partnerships that have existed throughout history, as they can shed some light on the constraints, weaknesses and opportunities for promoting a field that despite everything remains contested.","['comics', 'publishing industry', 'legitimation', 'cultural field', 'political economy']"
Corporate Art Collections in the Changing Workplace Environment. A Qualitative Study of the relevance of Corporate Art Collections in the Netherlands within the Changing Workplace Environment,Dana Marianne van den Brink,2021-06-20,['Prof. dr. Filip Vermeylen'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis investigates the relevance of Corporate Art Collections (CACs) in the Netherlands within the changing Workplace Environment (WE). Throughout the past 14 months the world has been in the grip of global health crisis referred to as the COVID-19 pandemic. For the corporate world this has led to many people working from home (WFH) and offices are now empty. This also means that the works of art inhabit these buildings, are no longer seen. What is the purpose of these CACs when they are not physically experienced by employees? This qualitative research aims to create an understanding of the relevance of these CACs in light the developments within the WE of the last several years, and ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic might have amplified these. To investigate this topic, 11 interviews with were conducted with experts in the field. The recordings of the semi-structured interviews were transcribed manually. Thereafter, the transcriptions were coded, and a thematic analysis was performed to go from data to conceptual findings. The findings that emerged through the thematic analysis that contribute towards answering the research question are the development of a hybrid WE, the embedded nature of the value of the CAC, and the integration of the CAC into the WE. These findings pointed out that to stay relevant within the changing WE, the CAC must establish new ties to both the physical and virtual WE. Moreover, the findings suggested that CACs must take a critical stance regarding the ownership of artworks.","['Corporate Art Collection', 'Workplace Environment', 'COVID-19', 'Work-From-Home', 'Corporate Social Responsibility.']"
Bringing back Meanings to Words: Exploring the Effects of Transcriptions on the Perceived Value of Chinese Calligraphy,Yuqing Song,2021-06-20,['Dr. Anne-Sophie Radermecker'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","What would words be without meanings? This is the central question we are concerned with in this paper. Previous study has shown that physical attributes of Chinese calligraphy artworks, such as the size, material and writing style, all have an effect on the economic value of the artwork. But these all are the things on the outside, how about the meanings to the characters on a more implicit level? Focusing on the cultural heritage Chinese calligraphy, we examined the effect of the literal content of calligraphy artworks on the perceived value using a factorial survey experiment. The online survey generated over 400 responses, including both Chinese and international participants. We found that the literal content of Chinese calligraphy among other things, after all, has a significant effect on the perceived value of Chinese calligraphy, and therefore, should not be neglected despite the fact that transcriptions for the Chinese calligraphy artworks are rarely given by the auction houses.","['perceived value', 'Chinese calligraphy', 'aesthetic appreciation', 'information asymmetry', 'intangible cultural heritage', 'factorial survey experiment', 'Dong Qichang']"

De gelukkige docent? De invloed van werktevredenheid onder docenten op de relatie tussen de sociaaleconomische status en schoolprestaties in West-Europa.,"Jacobs, F.",2021-06-20,"['Sjaak Braster', 'Kevin Pijpers']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,In dit onderzoek wordt ingegaan op de vraag in welke mate werktevredenheid van docenten invloed heeft op de sociaaleconomische prestatiekloof en de schoolprestaties. In diverse onderzoeken is de sociaaleconomische prestatiekloof aangetoond. De modererende rol van werktevredenheid is hierin minder belicht. Door gebruik te maken van het Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 van het Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is het model getoetst met een multilevelanalyse in drie West-Europese landen met variabelen op individueel en schoolniveau. De resultaten laten zien dat naarmate de sociaaleconomische status (SES) van een leerling hoger is zijn prestaties significant beter zijn. Ook de gemiddelde SES van een school heeft een positief significant verband met de schoolprestaties van leerlingen. De modererende rol van werktevredenheid blijkt echter geen invloed te hebben op de relatie tussen SES en de schoolprestaties van leerlingen. De werktevredenheid maakt deel uit van een grotere set van schoolvariabelen die de schoolprestaties beïnvloeden en is op zichzelf geen variabele die een significant verschil maakt.,"['werktevredenheid', 'sociaaleconomische status', 'schoolprestaties', 'docenten', 'OECD']"
Why The Higher Educated Oppose the System,"Schouten, L.",2021-06-20,"['Gijs Custers', 'Thomas Swerts']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Lower educated citizens are generally the larger part of the voting electorate of Populist Radical Right Parties. However, Forum voor Democratie and JA21 have succeeded in attracting higher educated voters to their electorate. Little scientific research has been performed into the motives of higher educated citizens to vote for these parties. The focus of this inquiry will, therefore, be on understanding the considerations of higher educated citizens and how these have incentivised them to vote for Populist Radical Right Parties. 12 semi-structured interviews were held with higher educated voters. The results show that cultural factors and political distrust were most relevant in higher educated citizens’ considerations. Especially the latter seems to be important in relation to higher educated citizens’ degree of political knowledge and political sophistication. This entails that these citizens know how politics and political actors operate, which enables them to accurately assess and evaluate political occurrences. As a result, they observe misconduct in politics and politicians, which negatively impacts on their political trust. This incentivises them to vote for Populist Radical Right Parties as they believe that these parties can foster political change.","['Forum voor Democratie', 'Higher Educated Citizens', 'JA21', 'Motives', 'Populist Radical Right Parties']"

Uit veel onderzoek in Westerse landen is gebleken dat de Home Literacy Environment (HLE) en de Classroom Literacy Environment (CLE) van kinderen belangrijke voorspellers zijn voor leesvaardigheid (bijv. Baroody & Diamond, 2014; van Bergen, van Zuijen, Bishop & de Jong, 2016). Het is onduidelijk of dezelfde voorspellers van leesvaardigheid ook gelden voor kinderen in niet-Westerse landen. In deze masterthesis is onderzocht of en in welke mate de relatieve bijdrage van de HLE en de CLE aan de leesvaardigheid van 10-jarige kinderen verschilt tussen Westerse en niet-Westerse landen. Italië representeert in deze masterthesis een Westers land en Saoedi-Arabië representeert een niet-Westers land. Deze masterthesis is gebaseerd op de dataset van Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) uit 2016. Vanwege de geneste structuur in de data is door middel van een multilevel regressieanalyse gekeken naar het verband tussen de variabelen over alle klassen heen, rekening houdend met de afhankelijkheid tussen de leerlingen binnen deze klassen. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat de HLE relatief meer bijdraagt aan de leesvaardigheid van kinderen in het Westerse land Italië dan in het niet-Westerse land Saoedi-Arabië. Voor de CLE zijn er geen significante verbanden gevonden. In aanvullend onderzoek is het gewenst de operationalisering van de HLE en de CLE uitgebreider te benaderen. Voorbeeld kan zijn om te onderzoeken hoeveel kinderboeken kinderen thuis hebben en of de boeken in de klassenbibliotheek passen bij de leesinteresses van de kinderen.","['Classroom Literacy Environment', 'Home Literacy Environment', 'Leesvaardigheid', 'Niet-Westers', 'Westers']"

A viral pandemic versus a viral video: What the COVID-19 crisis taught us about civil activism,"Lambert, A.",2021-06-20,"['Marieke van Houte', 'Bonnie French']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The year 2020 marked an exceptional degree of Black Lives Matter activism. In that same year, COVID-19 took a hold of the world and influenced almost every aspect of normal life. The study’s primary aim was to examine whether the BLM breakthrough was somehow effectuated by the pandemic and its social consequences. Using semi-structured interviews, ten BLM allies were questioned about their involvement with the BLM movement over the past eight years. Respondents were aged between 20 and 30 years old, identified as white and attended at least one BLM protest in 2020. Their answers were coded and analyzed. The majority of respondents believed that their involvement was influenced by the pandemic, through the fact that they had more time to themselves. Furthermore, they chose to attend a protest, despite of the social distancing efforts, because they realized the importance of the BLM sentiment. In conclusion, the pandemic does seem to have contributed to the BLM breakthrough in 2020, supporting the main premise of this study.","['Black Lives Matter', 'COVID-19', 'interconnectedness', 'personal involvement']"
Onderzoek naar de rol van trainingsprogramma's in de relatie tussen subjectieve werkonzekerheid en sociaal vertrouwen.,"Jurgens, N.",2021-06-20,"['Ferry Koster', 'Sjaak Braster']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In deze scriptie is de relatie tussen subjectieve werkonzekerheid en sociaal vertrouwen onder 24564 respondenten uit 19 OECD-landen onderzocht. De verwachting was dat verminderd sociaal vertrouwen een gevolg is van subjectieve werkonzekerheid en dat statusangst deze relatie kon verklaren. Er is daarbij ook nagegaan of participatie in trainingsprogramma’s binnen het activerend arbeidsmarktbeleid de gevolgen van subjectieve werkonzekerheid verminderd. Om dit te onderzoeken is gebruik gemaakt van data op individueel niveau van het ESS (2016) en data op nationaal niveau van het OECD. Vanuit de resultaten en de succes en welzijnstheorie kan verondersteld worden dat individuen met subjectieve werkonzekerheid anderen minder vertrouwen, omdat zij door hun sociaaleconomische- en welzijnskenmerken minder beschermd zijn tegen de risico’s van misplaatst vertrouwen. Participatie in trainingsprogramma’s draagt bij aan de verbetering van de sociaaleconomische- en welzijnskenmerken, waardoor het negatieve effect van subjectieve werkonzekerheid op sociaal vertrouwen minder sterk is voor individuen uit landen met hogere niveaus van participatie in trainingsprogramma’s.","['sociaal vertrouwen', 'statusangst', 'subjectieve werkonzekerheid', 'succes en welzijnstheorie', 'trainingsprogramma’s']"
Thuisonder-wijs? Ongelijkheid in ouderlijke betrokkenheid,"Heijne, R.",2021-06-20,"['Sanneke de la Rie', 'Renske Keizer']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In deze studie is onderzocht in hoeverre het effect van familiestructuur op ouderlijke betrokkenheid bij thuisonderwijs samenhangt met de sociaaleconomische status van ouders. Verwacht werd dat het opgroeien binnen een eenoudergezin, evenals het opgroeien binnen een gezin met lage sociaaleconomische status, negatief zou samenhangen met ouderlijke betrokkenheid bij thuisonderwijs. Daarnaast werd verwacht dat de voorspelde negatieve relatie tussen alleenstaand ouderschap en ouderlijke betrokkenheid bij thuisonderwijs zou worden versterkt wanneer de ouder een lage sociaaleconomische status had. In lijn met deze verwachting zou een hoge sociaaleconomische status deze negatieve relatie tussen alleenstaand ouderschap en ouderlijke betrokkenheid juist dempen. Om dit te onderzoeken werden gegevens van 339 gezinnen uit een bestaand dataonderzoek gebruikt. Ouders binnen deze gezinnen werden gevraagd stellingen te beantwoorden over hun ouderlijke betrokkenheid binnenshuis, tijd en energie en kennis en vaardigheden om betrokken te kunnen zijn bij thuisonderwijs. In totaal zijn er zes stellingen gebruikt om mogelijke verschillen in ouderlijke betrokkenheid bij thuisonderwijs te meten. Anders dan verwacht bleken familiestructuur en de interactie tussen familiestructuur en sociaaleconomische status niet significant in verband te staan met ouderlijke betrokkenheid bij thuisonderwijs. Enkel de sociaaleconomische status van ouders bleek deels significant van invloed op ouderlijke betrokkenheid bij thuisonderwijs.","['Familiestructuur', 'ouderlijke betrokkenheid', 'sociaaleconomische status', 'thuisonderwijs']"

These histories are ‘folded into’ the documents as truths, and go on to live on in other documents. By looking at different identities in connection to the moral values and characters represented, I will highlight an alternative narrative. Drawing on the notion of M’Charek’s (2014) folded objects and van Oorschot’s (2014) legal case files folding into themselves, I will show how policy documents, leading up to and following project 1012, shaped perception and the dominant public discourse about prostitution in Amsterdam. This ‘dominant discourse’, is often assumed to be universally true. This research shows how the narratives presented and re-produced can lead to tangible outcomes for people’s everyday lives, because they are often taken as truths.","['Alternative Narrative', 'Critical Policy Discourse Analysis', 'Documentation', 'Folded Objects', 'Prostitution']"
Where do I belong? Sense of belonging in LGBTQ+ second-generation youths.,"de Jesus, S.",2021-06-19,"['Samira van Bohemen', 'Maja Hertoghs']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"While many migration literatures have considered how race and sexual identity comes into play in sense of belonging, little studies have explored how LGBTQ+ second-generation immigrants experience belonging. Second-generation immigrants from the Netherlands were specifically selected as the country self-identifies as free thinkers when it comes to LGBTQ+ freedoms. This in turn can contrast with many migrant minority’s values and ideologies which are often anti-LGBTQ+ sovereignties, causing tensions in belonging amongst these youths. This paper then aims to investigate how identifying as LGBTQ+ may affect belonging. In order to do this, a qualitative semi-structured interview was conducted with seven participants. The interviews were analysed through qualitative thematic analysis in an attempt to provide a comprehensive representation of how these youths experience and navigate their various attachments. After analyses of the interviews, the results revealed that belonging is multi-faceted and varies per individual. It appeared that everyone experienced multiple belongings as they identified with their Dutch, country of origin and sexual identity. As a result of these multiple belongings, these youths also experienced tensions in belonging. This was particularly the case for those who come from conservative family backgrounds because their sexual identity is not deemed acceptable in their religious family homes. These youths therefore navigate their various identities by means of engaging in transnational practices and other coping strategies, such as, social media, communities and music. A conclusion was therefore drawn from the findings that belonging and identity in LGBTQ+ second-generation youths is a complex and fluid sentiment, established and negotiated through communication and different contexts.","['sense of belonging', 'LGBTQ+', 'second-generation immigrants', 'Dutch society', 'country of origin']"

Omdat de sociaaleconomische status van kinderen en hun gezinnen vaak de grootste voorspeller is van toekomstig succes, wordt er in deze studie gekeken naar hoe een hoge sociaaleconomische status zich verhoudt tot faalangst bij kinderen. In dit onderzoek wordt er gefocust op de relatie tussen sociaaleconomische status en faalangst bij kinderen, en hoe dit verband wordt beïnvloed door ouderbetrokkenheid, toekomstverwachtingen en geslacht. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te bestuderen hoe sociaaleconomische status van invloed kan zijn op faalangst en om een nieuwe inzichten te verschaffen omtrent het steeds groter wordende probleem faalangst. Er is gebruik gemaakt van de PISA dataset van 2018 voor dit onderzoek. De hypotheses zijn niet bevestigd, wat betekent dat we kunnen concluderen dat er geen verband is tussen sociaaleconomische status en faalangst en dat dit niet wordt beïnvloed door ouderbetrokkenheid, toekomstverwachtingen en geslacht. Wel komen er interessante uitkomsten uit omtrent het gevoel van faalangst bij kinderen. Zo leiden een competitieve schoolomgeving, de onderwijsprestaties van het kind en wanneer het kind een meisje is tot een groter gevoel van faalangst. Doordat niet iedereen alle vragenlijsten had ingevuld, is er gebruik gemaakt van een kleinere steekproef. Dit kan betekenen dat de steekproef de populatie wellicht niet goed weerspiegelt en hypotheses misschien onterecht verworpen zijn. Voor vervolgonderzoek zou het interessant zijn om het onderzoek opnieuw uit te voeren met een grotere steekproef, en om verder te onderzoeken hoe de schoolomgeving, onderwijsprestaties en geslacht invloed hebben op faalangst.","['Faalangst', 'geslacht', 'ouderbetrokkenheid', 'PISA', 'sociaaleconomische status', 'toekomstverwachtingen']"
Thriving on terror - The indirect influences of terrorism on voting behaviour,"de Roode, J.",2021-06-19,"['Gijs Custers', 'Wenda Doff']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The terrorist attack in Paris in 2015 severely affected the Western world. Thus far, research has mainly focused on the consequences of this attack on voting behaviour in France, which was directly affected by the terrorist attack. This thesis tries to expand the knowledge of the consequences of a terrorist attack by focusing on possible indirect influences of the Paris terrorist attack on voting for populist right-wing parties in a country indirectly affected: The Netherlands. This thesis argues that the occurrence of a terrorist attack would increase voting for populist right-wing parties and would strengthen anti-immigrant attitudes. Furthermore, it would strengthen the relationship between the educational level and anti-immigrant attitudes, as well as the relationship between anti-immigrant attitudes and voting for populist right-wing parties. Using the European Social Survey waves from 2010 to 2018, these expectations were tested using regression analyses. This thesis found a period effect, which could indicate the threat of terrorism affects voting for populist right-wing parties. It also has strengthened the relationship between anti-immigrant attitude and voting for populist right-wing parties. Yet, no evidence is found for the terrorist attack affecting the relationship between the educational level and anti-immigrant attitudes. Also, no evidence is found that the Paris terrorist attack influenced anti-immigrant attitudes directly. Future research could focus on the improvement of the measurement of the threat of terrorism, as well as examining the length of the effects that terrorist attacks have on voting behaviour.","['Anti-Immigrant Attitudes', 'Education', 'Populism', 'Populist Right-Wing Voting', 'Terrorism']"

Om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden zijn vier theoretische verwachtingen geschetst die vervolgens empirisch zijn getoetst. Kenmerken van financialisering blijken wel degelijk voor te komen op de Rotterdamse woningmarkt, deels gefaciliteerd door beleid. Vastgoed lijkt onderdeel te zijn geworden van een schuldgedreven groeimodel, waarbij woningen steeds vaker als investeringsobject worden gezien in plaats van als sociaal recht. Door een forse stijging van woningprijzen en huren in de vrije sector wil de (lokale) overheid inmiddels wel reguleringen invoeren, maar het is de vraag of hier de juiste instrumentaria voor worden ingezet. Vooral in de corporatiesector is veel veranderd ten opzichte van de vorige eeuw en de betaalbaarheid en toegankelijkheid van wonen voor lagere- en middengroepen is geringer geworden.","['Financialisering', 'volkshuisvesting', 'woningmarkt', 'woonbeleid']"

Om deze onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden, is exploratief onderzoek uitgevoerd door middel van interviews met mensen uit het I&O Research Panel.

Sociale media en influencers op sociale media blijken daarbij vooral bevestigend te werken voor denkbeelden die complotdenkers er al op nahielden. Tevens komt naar voren dat gevoelens van vervreemding en anomie een belangrijke rol spelen onder complotdenkers. Maar deze gevoelens worden vooral gevoed door persoonlijk tegenspoed en de reactie hierop vanuit de overheid. Hierdoor worden respondenten aangezet tot complotdenken, maar het geeft vervolgens aan dat de overheid deels verantwoordelijk is voor het feit dat men gaat complotdenken. Enerzijds wordt in dit onderzoek de rol van gevoelens van vervreemding en anomie bevestigd. Anderzijds vormt dit onderzoek een aanvulling op de bestaande literatuur doordat het een licht werpt op het belang van persoonlijke omstandigheden als voedingsbodem voor complotdenken.","['Complotdenken', 'vervreemding', 'anomie', 'sociale media', 'influencers']"
"""We Do Mind the Gap"": What Bulgarian People Think About National Income Inequality","Dimitrova, N.",2021-06-19,"['Jonathan Mijs', 'Sjaak Braster']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Income inequality continues to rise across the world. Prominent scholars and practitioners have acknowledged the many adverse effects that this creates for everyone. Meanwhile, concern over the issue does not seem to be growing. This paradox has been recently observed and named ‘the paradox of inequality’. In Bulgaria, however, where the levels of income inequality are extremely high compared to the rest of the European Union and even the world, people seem to be quite aware of this issue and unusually concerned with it. In this paper, I attribute some meaning to these statistics by applying the qualitative research method of deliberative focus groups in two groups from a relatively low socioeconomic status for Bulgaria and two from a relatively high one. I expected that due to their Soviet past, Bulgarians have developed a culture of ‘shurobadzhanashtina’ (a special form of nepotism) according to which income should be earned rather than in meritocratic ways such as knowledge, skills and experience. I also expected that the different socioeconomic classes live closer together in Bulgaria than in many other countries and because of that they see the levels of income inequality as high as they are unlike in other unequal societies. Finally, I expected that since corruption is extremely high in Bulgaria, people channel a broader discontent with the system inefficiency when they complain about income inequality, which makes it look like Bulgarians are more aware of and concerned with income inequality than other countries. The group deliberations showed little support for the first two expectations but a very strong one for the latter one. While the opinions of the people differed on the first two topics both within the same socioeconomic status and between the different ones, they were more or less in consensus that the income inequality in Bulgaria is too high and that this is a problem owed to a great extent to the inefficient political system – due to both lack of competence and lack of willingness of the government to do better.","['corruption', 'deliberation', 'income inequality', 'meritocracy', ""‘paradox of inequality'"", 'proximity']"

De huidige studie legt de focust op de relatie tussen werkuren en opvoedstress van vaders en moeders en richt zich vooral op het mechanisme tussen de relatie van werkuren en opvoedstress bij vaders en moeders: namelijk werk-familie conflict. De studie heeft gebruik gemaakt van een dataset van het 3HOEK onderzoek met 77 Rotterdamse gezinnen (77 vaders en 77 moeders). De resultaten tonen aan dat de relatie tussen werkuren en opvoedstress van vaders loopt via werk-familie conflict. In het model van moeders is er geen mediatie-effect gevonden, maar is er wel een directe positieve relatie gevonden tussen werk-familie conflict en opvoedstress. Een mogelijke verklaring hiervoor is dat voor vaders externe werkfactoren zoals werkuren, een belangrijke rol spelen. Voor moeders lijken externe werkfactoren mogelijk minder van belang, alleen het werk-familie conflict speelt een belangrijke rol bij de ervaring van opvoedstress. Uit het onderzoek komt ook naar voren dat binnen het familiesysteem verschillende factoren in de opvoeding en werk voor vaders en moeders met elkaar samenhangen.","['moeders', 'opvoedstress', 'vaders', 'werk-familie conflict', 'werkuren']"

All data has been used to make sense of being a woman, what contributes to it and how it is affected. Theory regarding gender performativity, bodily appropriation, normalization of sexual objectification and rape culture are central. It is concluded from this research that being a woman is a process consisting of many contrasting characteristics.

On the other hand, being a woman shows strength to deal with all these obstacles, and to find freedom in overcoming those struggles.","['sexual objectification', 'bodily appropriation', 'sense of womanhood', 'gender performativity', 'rape culture']"
WHEN LITERATURE DOESN’T SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE: An Analysis of Symbolic Boundaries and Exoticism in the Government-Supported Translation and Distribution of Brazilian Literature Abroad,Marina Cheffe,2021-06-18,['Dr. Naomi Oosterman'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The literary world is marked by unequal distribution flows in terms of the language and nationality of works, with the United States representing the global literary hyper-center (Heilbron, 1999). To fight such cultural hegemony, Brazil, a literary periphery country, has developed a translation grants programs by government organization Biblioteca Nacional (BN) to ensure the global dissemination of its literature, to positive effects (Feres & Brisolara, 2018). However, the history of Brazilian literature abroad is marked by an exoticizing gaze and nationality-based stereotypes (Minchillo, 2018; Saldanha, 2018). The aim of this research was to analyze how BN-supported Brazilian literature is distributed abroad, to uncover which authors and works benefit from such a policy program and how this literature is positioned by foreign publishers in terms of exoticizing symbolic boundaries and an othering, ‘literary tourist’ gaze (Saldanha, 2018). The research consisted of an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, beginning with a quantitative analysis to observe the distribution of BN-supported literary works from 2013 to 2020 and the way these works were visually marked in their foreign covers by exoticism markers based on Brazilian literary stereotypes. Chi-Square tests were utilized to find associations between the characteristics of the works, their authors and their foreign publishers. The quantitative results informed the sampling of the qualitative research phase, in which BN-supported works translated into English, French, Spanish or Portuguese from Portugal were chosen for a qualitative content analysis. The textual description of these works and their authors, written by their foreign publishers, were analyzed to further uncover how they were positioned in terms of exoticism or other nationality-related symbolic constructions. It was ultimately observed that, although there were no significant patterns of symbolic boundaries related to exoticizing and othering, these Brazilian works and authors were strongly read through a cosmopolitan gaze, a more recent view found in the foreign reception of Brazilian literature (Rissardo, 2015) that is strongly supported by BN itself (Brune, 2018). These findings demonstrate a weak, though still present, symbolic boundary-making in the foreign positioning of Brazilian literature, pointing more strongly to a cosmopolitan view of Brazilian writers, one that can potentially alienate authors and works unable to fit this global-minded gaze. Findings showed that, despite BN’s efforts, there is little diversity in the authors represented abroad through grants, with the distribution of writers mirroring the lack of diversity and equality in the Brazilian national literary field. Further studies are recommended, to refine the picture of Brazilian literature in translation (including research on works that do not rely on cultural policy grants) and to further observe how less-represented writers (such as black authors and those who are not from the regions of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo) are positioned abroad. More research on the struggle of periphery literary countries to combat cultural hegemony are necessary, to better understand the contemporary literary field and develop stronger tools to increase equality and diversity in the global flows of cultural production and distribution.","['Brazilian literature', 'Center-periphery model', 'Literary exoticism', 'Symbolic Boundaries', 'Global literary field']"

It was ultimately observed that, although there were no significant patterns of symbolic boundaries related to exoticizing and othering, these Brazilian works and authors were strongly read through a cosmopolitan gaze, a more recent view found in the foreign reception of Brazilian literature (Rissardo, 2015) that is strongly supported by BN itself (Brune, 2018). These findings demonstrate a weak, though still present, symbolic boundary-making in the foreign positioning of Brazilian literature, pointing more strongly to a cosmopolitan view of Brazilian writers, one that can potentially alienate authors and works unable to fit this global-minded gaze. Findings showed that, despite BN’s efforts, there is little diversity in the authors represented abroad through grants, with the distribution of writers mirroring the lack of diversity and equality in the Brazilian national literary field. Further studies are recommended, to refine the picture of Brazilian literature in translation (including research on works that do not rely on cultural policy grants) and to further observe how less-represented writers (such as black authors and those who are not from the regions of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo) are positioned abroad. More research on the struggle of periphery literary countries to combat cultural hegemony are necessary, to better understand the contemporary literary field and develop stronger tools to increase equality and diversity in the global flows of cultural production and distribution.","['Brazilian literature', 'Center-periphery model', 'Literary exoticism', 'Symbolic Boundaries', 'Global literary field']"
WHEN LITERATURE DOESN’T SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE: An Analysis of Symbolic Boundaries and Exoticism in the Government-Supported Translation and Distribution of Brazilian Literature Abroad,Marina Cheffe,2021-06-18,['Dr. Naomi Oosterman'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The literary world is marked by unequal distribution flows in terms of the language and nationality of works, with the United States representing the global literary hyper-center (Heilbron, 1999). To fight such cultural hegemony, Brazil, a literary periphery country, has developed a translation grants programs by government organization Biblioteca Nacional (BN) to ensure the global dissemination of its literature, to positive effects (Feres & Brisolara, 2018). However, the history of Brazilian literature abroad is marked by an exoticizing gaze and nationality-based stereotypes (Minchillo, 2018; Saldanha, 2018). The aim of this research was to analyze how BN-supported Brazilian literature is distributed abroad, to uncover which authors and works benefit from such a policy program and how this literature is positioned by foreign publishers in terms of exoticizing symbolic boundaries and an othering, ‘literary tourist’ gaze (Saldanha, 2018). The research consisted of an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, beginning with a quantitative analysis to observe the distribution of BN-supported literary works from 2013 to 2020 and the way these works were visually marked in their foreign covers by exoticism markers based on Brazilian literary stereotypes. Chi-Square tests were utilized to find associations between the characteristics of the works, their authors and their foreign publishers. The quantitative results informed the sampling of the qualitative research phase, in which BN-supported works translated into English, French, Spanish or Portuguese from Portugal were chosen for a qualitative content analysis. The textual description of these works and their authors, written by their foreign publishers, were analyzed to further uncover how they were positioned in terms of exoticism or other nationality-related symbolic constructions.

Art worlds apart: An exploration of fashion curation’s legitimation as art within critical reception,Gkresa Mechili,2021-06-18,['Dr. Julian Schaap'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This paper explores the artistic legitimation of fashion curation, or the lack of it, within critical reception. It looks into the opportunity space, the use and mobilization of resources, and the framing involved in the legitimation of fashion curation as art, but also the opposition to its artistic legitimation. Alongside the historical account of fashion curation, I conduct a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of fashion exhibition reviews and articles found in influential publications that originate from the US and UK during the last decade, in order to investigate fashion curation’s framing by critics.
Fashion is a cultural product that is frequently found in art institutions but at the same time encounters strong dissent over its artistic legitimation. An originally market-oriented genre, widely identified as entertainment, that is increasingly moving towards the broader realm of the arts, but its commerciality and utilitarian nature are seen as the biggest threats to its legitimation, aspects regarded as opposed to other art forms. At the same time, a new discipline has appeared, that of fashion curation; a genre closely related to fashion that emerged through fashion’s entry in museums and the rise of fashion exhibitions. These exhibitions are held in respected museums around the world and attract media attention through reviews and articles. The present thesis explores whether and how fashion curation, given its relation to fashion, may be acknowledged as an art form based on critics’ framing, by addressing the following research question: “How is fashion curation framed by art critics during the last decade, from 2011 to 2021?”. The attention is focused on the critics’ framing because, according to Baumann’ s (2007) theory of artistic legitimation, the role of the artworld agents, including critics, is fundamental in legitimizing a cultural product, since their judgements can inform the way cultural products are perceived by the audience.
In order to provide an answer to the research question posed, I apply a mixture of qualitative and quantitative content analysis to analyze 58 fashion exhibition reviews and articles found in influential newspapers and art magazines originating from the United States and the United Kingdom. Quantitative content analysis is used to detect patterns in the way critics discuss about the fashion exhibitions, while qualitative content analysis is employed for the interpretation of the text data gathered. Thematic analysis is used for coding and grouping the data into two overarching themes: Legitimation and Lack of legitimation. Complementary, the historical developments in fashion, which manifest signs of artistic legitimation, or lack of it, are used to arrive into conclusions concerning fashion curation’s legitimacy as an art form, based on Baumann’s (2007) opportunity space and resources factors.
Altogether the data revealed the ambiguity surrounding fashion curation’s position in the artworld. The main arguments supporting fashion curation’s legitimacy as an art form are confronted with the considerable number of signs indicating its lack of legitimacy. Overall, it can be argued that fashion curation is not legitimized as an artform within critical reception.","['artistic legitimation', 'fashion curation', 'fashion', 'art world', 'museums']"
Religious and National Identification in the Republic of Cyprus,Marisa Ferentinou,2021-06-18,['Dr. Fianne Konings'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Religion’s role in civil society is twofold. It is a homogenizer and a provider of social cohesion, yet at the same time a disruptor of it. Religious identification in the Republic of Cyprus became the mean of separation of the two ethnic communities residing in the island. The Constitution of the Republic provides that those that are faithful members of the Greek-Orthodox Church belong in the Greek-Cypriot community, and Muslims in the Turkish-Cypriot community. This thesis is concerned with the Republic of Cyprus (Greek-Cypriot community) and aims in exploring “How young adults in Cyprus link their religion to their sense of national identity?” The conflation of religion and national identity in Cyprus has been, to a great extent, the product of political/nationalist imperatives. The stronger the role of religion in society, the more the members of religious minority communities can perceive their religion as an aspect that disturbs feelings of affiliation to their nation. This thesis will explore how young adults in Cyprus of ethnic and religious majority/minorities perceive their religion and how it is linked to their national identity. As an ideological system, religion is manifested in governmental structures and policy systems. National educational systems are considered key agents and homogenizers of ideological beliefs on national perspectives. As education is linked with identity formation, this thesis explored as a second research question “What is the role of Cypriotic Religious Education in the formation of national identity?” Previous research on religious education in Cyprus suggests that the lesson offers exclusive narratives of ethno-religious identity and fails to cultivate tolerant attitudes for students. The theoretical framework of this thesis discussed three main concepts, namely, the distinction between ethnic and civic national identity, social identity complexity and secularization. The concepts were explored and linked to Christian-Orthodoxy’s historical stronghold in the Cypriot society and its influence on educational structures. In answering both research questions, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants of various religious and ethnic groups residing in Cyprus. The research employed a grounded theory approach combined with the use of narrative analysis for data collection and assessment. The key findings support that the Christian Orthodox religion does not constitute a characteristic in national self-identification, but its role for young adults is confined as a cultural element of their nation. For religious and/or ethnic minorities in the country, their difference in religion is not an aspect that disturbs feelings of affiliation to the Cypriot nation-state, yet in instances it results in societal and institutional discrimination. Religious education in Cyprus is perceived by participants as a dogmatic lesson that strongly projects the link between the Christian-Orthodox religion and the Cypriot nation-state. Former students of religious minorities argued that the structure of religious education in Cyprus, and the policy of exemption, make them realize their position as outgroups in the school community.","['Religion', 'religious education', 'Republic of Cyprus', 'ethnic/civic national identification', 'ingroup/outgroup membership', 'secularization']"
Rethinking Immigration with the Ethnographic Museum. A Case Study on  Multidirectionality and Implication in the Wereldmuseum,Martha Echevarría González,2021-06-18,['Dr. Hanka Otte'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","To take responsibility for their complicity in colonial activities and crimes such as creating racialized stereotypes and owning looted objects, European museums have revised their collections and exhibitions and turned towards contemporary issues such as immigration in their exhibitions. In Rotterdam's Wereldmuseum - the case study of this research - the interlacing narratives and histories of colonialism, nation-building, and immigration become apparent. Today, the public debate surrounding immigration, which is strongly connected to histories of colonization, continues to affect the livelihood of immigrants trying to build a life in The Netherlands. This debate often highlights the importance of immigrant integration which ignores the continuities of colonialism and reproduces racialized power structures. To find narratives that go beyond the discourse of integration, this study looks at the role of museums as producers and distributors of knowledge and poses the following question: How does the Wereldmuseum change the dominant narrative of immigrants in The Netherlands? To find an answer, this interdisciplinary research bridges theories from cultural memory studies, postcolonialism, museum studies, and migration studies. More specifically, this research uses Michael Rothberg's concepts of multidirectional memory and implication, which offer the analytical depth and clarity to understand the connections between historical violence and contemporary injustices. This research explores their role and function in the museum space through careful dissection of these concepts and qualitative content analysis. After collecting and investigating hundreds of texts and objects from two exhibitions in the Wereldmuseum, this research finds that there are two meaningful ways in which the museum changes the narrative around immigration: by addressing its own and the visitors' implication in past and present injustices and by showing networks of multidirectional memory in the entangled histories of colonialism and immigration. While further research needs to be conducted studying the effectiveness of the exhibition through, for example, surveys and interviews of museum visitors, this paper already contributes to a growing collection of literature on the aftermaths of colonialism and provides a clear methodological example of how to analyze Rothberg's concepts in the context of an ethnographic museum","['Ethnographic Museum', 'Immigrant Integration', 'Multidirectional Memory', 'Implication', 'Colonialism']"
"There’s more to food than meets the eye, or is it just a matter of taste? An exploration of class mobility and its effect on the etiquette of serving the meal and table manners in the Netherlands.",Kimmy Colombo,2021-06-18,['dr. Thomas Calkins'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research aims to explore how class and mobility affect meal etiquette in the Netherlands. The primary focus is on how today’s class and mobility may stimulate social inequality. The impetus is the current gap in research on how class and mobility affect the cultural consumption of meal etiquette in the Netherlands. While considered a leading horizontal and egalitarian country, the growing upwardly mobile population and socio-economic developments have unclear impact on the present social stratification.
Cultural consumption necessitates a set of taught manners and rules, learned through different stages of socialization, which shapes a person’s distinct set of behavior and taste. If Dutch status groups do differentiate themselves through the etiquette they observe, then each group might have its own sort of cultural capital. Class co-determines people’s etiquette as etiquette can signal class; however, the relations between class and etiquette are probably made more complex by social mobility, which creates unclear boundaries by creating discontinuities between primary socialization and later influences in life.
The main questions concern the extent to which class and mobility are perceived through meal etiquette, how meal etiquette relates to the class of origin and destination, and how upwardly mobile people adapt his or her meal etiquette. Stratification is fundamental to better understand how a country operates. By understanding how class or status operates in the Netherlands, one can also better understand how, as individuals and as a group, we could facilitate communication, integration, and the transition into unknown environments. This research investigates meal etiquette amongst 14 Dutch working professionals, split into blue-collar and white-collar occupation groups. The participants were selected based on their Dutch nationality and profession type. The qualitative research approaches the participants through open-ended interviews and thematic analysis.","['Etiquette', 'Food', 'Taste', 'Cultural Capital', 'Mobility']"

"Embodying race – cultural reproduction of ideals of aesthetics, gender and ethnicity in contemporary dance auditions",Marta Miranda da Costa Pinto,2021-06-18,['Naomi Oosterman'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Gatekeepers in the contemporary dance field have one of the most influential roles in the development of the artform as well being responsible for shaping and developing the audience’s perception through their artistic choices. Additionally, gatekeepers result to cultural ideas of aesthetics, gender, race and ethnicity when engaging with hiring practices such as auditions and production practices. From the interviews of choreographers, rehearsal directors and artistic directors of the field of contemporary dance in the Netherlands, this thesis addresses the main research question of, How do cultural ideas of aesthetics, gender, race and ethnicity inform production and audition practices in the contemporary dance field in the Netherlands? Not only do gatekeepers rely on aesthetic conventions of the field when hiring or casting dancers, but also search for specific representations of gender and race in order to find the ideal dancer who will better represent the choreographer or director’s artistic vision. This research revealed that gatekeepers have a material view towards the dancing body as the representation or instrument of the work, where social concepts such as gender, sexuality and race are seen as added material qualities. For instance, the social concept of race is perceived as an added-on quality. Not only is this view undermining the dancer’s agency and sense of self but further objectifies the dancer’s body, specifically the female body. Gatekeepers preach and idealize their art while masking a culture of abusive, manipulative and discriminating attitudes of a hierarchised structure. Additionally, pressures from the public and governmental funds to diversify the performing arts has led to gatekeepers expressing frustration and even resisting attitudes towards diversity efforts. Furthermore, this research gives insights into how gatekeepers reproduce their own habituated practices and ideas on aesthetics, gender, race and ethnicity which have been socialized from their own dance education. Such socialization, reflects that such ideals are deep rooted in the overall contemporary dance culture. In order to address the research question, this study draws on qualitative methodology by conducting semi-structured interviews of gatekeepers and using thematic analysis to analyse and interpret the results. This method of analysis was found to be effective in the interpretation of respondent’s attitudes, experience and how these are influence by their own perceived reality.
This research offers recommendations and deeper understanding on how to better address the problematic practices rooted in the underlying structures of power in professional contemporary dance institutions. Moreover, this thesis recommends how to improve the conducting of auditions and production practices while avoiding the influence of predisposed assumptions of aesthetics, gender and race and ethnicity.","['contemporary dance', 'aesthetics', 'gender', 'race', 'gatekeepers', 'socialization']"
"When highbrow meets lowbrow: are educational differences visible in the consumption of “Trash TV”? How higher- and lower educated millennials legitimize their consumption of reality TV, tabloid TV and talk shows.",Brigitte van Rijn,2021-06-18,['Dr. M. Berghman'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This qualitative research examines the different ways in which both higher- and lower educated people legitimize their consumption of the three categories of trash TV. These categories consist of reality TV, tabloid TV and talk shows. There is already research done when it comes to the different ways that people from a different educational level legitimize their consumption of lowbrow culture. But there is not much research done that combines the three categories of trash TV and the differences in the way people legitimize their consumption of these genres. It is thus interesting to do research on these three particular trash TV genres and to see if there are clear differences among the way higher- and lower educated people legitimize their consumption of it. Research shows that higher educated people usually are more omnivore than lower educated in their television consumption. This means that higher educated people both consume lowbrow television, such as reality TV and tabloid TV and also highbrow television such as the news and serious talk shows. The only difference in their consumption can be found in the way they legitimize this, where lowbrow television is usually legitimized in a more guilty pleasure or ironic kind of way. Lower educated people on the other hand are usually consumers of more popular, lowbrow, culture. It is considered that they can identify more with the popular subjects of these shows and are thus more serious viewers of these genres. This research wants to find out if there is also a difference visible between educational level among a specific age group, namely millennials between the age of 24-39. This group grew up with the emergence of trash TV so it can be assumed that they are familiar with this form of television. For this research fourteen interviews were conducted, seven with higher educated and seven with lower educated respondents. During these interviews, fragments were shown from the three different trash TV genres. Also, multiple questions were asked about their television consumption behavior, if they identify with the different genres and why they either watch this program or not. After analyzing the data, it became clear that there were some differences among the higher- and lower educated respondents. Especially when it comes to the consumption of reality TV and the serious talk show. As was expected, the higher educated respondents were more ironic consumers of the reality TV show and more serious watchers of the serious talk show. The lower educated respondents on the other hand were more often serious watchers of reality TV and tabloid TV than of the serious talk show.","['Trash TV', 'Legitimization', 'Consumption', 'Millennials', 'Highbrow', 'Lowbrow', 'Education.']"
The Microsociology of the Theater Performance: An Inquiry About Interaction Rituals and Flow Experience on Stage During a Physically Distanced Theater Performance,Susanne Vermeeren,2021-06-18,['Dr. M.J. Berghman'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Despite the growing academic interest in the effect of the lack of physical co-presence amongst an audience in cultural experiences, much uncertainty still exists about interaction rituals amongst performers in cultural experiences where the audience is expected to be more passive. This qualitative microsociological research aims to answer the question: How are interaction rituals and the flow experience of theater performers influenced by physical distancing measures? Twelve in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with theater performers who have performed during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study focuses on the experience of theater performers in different situations, amongst which traditional end stage theater, theater-in-the-round, site-specific theater, live stream theater and cyberart theater. A better understanding of interaction rituals on a theater stage was established by analyzing the similarities and meaningful dissimilarities of their experiences and how they deal differently with a corresponding challenge.
Overall, this study has revealed that the physical distancing measures have a significant influence on theater performances. They affect the occurrence of the flow experience and favor a personal approach towards the audience over a collective approach. The research has shown that because of the recent change in generalized culture, the ritual practice of the theater performance is actively adjusted in order to be successful.
The findings of this study have a number of important implications for future practice. For traditional fourth wall theater productions, the audience is best seen as an outsider, and if the performers are able to focus on their inter-acting on stage, they can still have successful interaction rituals amongst each other. Flat-floored theater-in-the-round seems most favorable in this new situation. The audience is addressed directly and the audience can be approached as individuals on the first row. Additionally recording a traditional end-stage theater performance is like a poorly executed movie. Performances need to be designed specifically for the medium which makes them more visual and technical.","['Theater Performance', 'Flow Experience', 'Interaction Rituals', 'Microsociology', 'Cultural Experience']"
Glamping in Taiwan: When the Global Meets the Local,Chih-Yi Meng,2021-06-18,['Dr. T.J. Hoebink'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Glamping is an increasingly blooming tourism trend in Taiwan lately. While it was introduced from abroad into the local context of Taiwan and became a prosperous tourism industry in only five years, the astonishing popularity makes glamping in Taiwan an interesting case to have considerable contributions to the academic debate about globalization. With the case, this study aims to respond to the academic requests for more empirical tourism studies in order to examine the underlying process of globalization, with relevant discussions underneath, including the concepts of cultural homogenization, localization, and glocalization. Besides, glamping in Asian countries as a rather understudied topic in terms of the interaction between the global and the local shows great potential for new visions. These conditions thus form the following research question: how do Taiwanese camping and glamping operators negotiate between the global and the local in view of the increasing popularity of glamping in Taiwan. To find the answer, a qualitative approach was adopted. Online interviews were conducted with thirteen Taiwanese glamping operators.
The results of this research show that the cultural homogenization model is confirmed to be a common and first strategy for Taiwanese glamping providers to develop the global idea of glamping into local contexts of Taiwan. A nuanced observation here is that glamping in Taiwan is homogenized towards examples in both Western countries and Asian countries, thereby rejecting the idea of homogenization as a complete Westernization. In addition, three major glamping localization trajectories in Taiwan are found in this study. The first and the second are to deal with the inflexible and adaptable Taiwanese local resources respectively, while the third one is through local collaborations. In general, localization can already be seen in glamping development in Taiwan, although strictly speaking, it remains mostly on the additions instead of on the event of glamping itself.
An overall conclusion of glamping development in Taiwan is given as a glocalization process (Robertson, 1995), which contains simultaneous existence of the homogenization and the localization. An obvious time order within this glocalization model is welcomed by Taiwanese glamping operators as an effective way to develop glamping sites. Furthermore, the active role (Schuerkens, 2003) of Taiwanese glamping providers during the development underneath either homogenization or localization, represents that they are not defenseless, but capable to respond to the global forces by actions of imitating, adapting, adjusting or reinventing. Besides, information technology is a useful tool within the glocalization of glamping in Taiwan that cannot be overlooked. Finally, Pieterse’s (1995) concept of cultural hybridization is proposed to describe the overall glamping development in Taiwan, as it better highlights the mixing of cultures, including interactions between the West and the East, as well as between the global and the local. Future suggestions for both tourism practices and tourism studies are given in the end.","['glamping in Taiwan', 'globalization', 'glocalization', 'cultural homogenization', 'localization']"
Perception and consumption of tourism products in the age of the wanghong economy. An explorative qualitative study,Tianzhao Li,2021-06-18,['Prof. Anna Claudia Matini'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","With the development of the Internet and technology, various social media have appeared in our daily life, which allows all kinds of information to be spread wider and faster than before. Compared to the past, the way how people gather information has changed as people mainly receive information from social media now. The post-90s generation has also grown up during the development of social media platforms. They are regarded as the first generation of the Internet in China and became the main consuming force. Their purchasing power also shows in the tourism field. Therefore, all the contexts mentioned above have formed the characteristics of the post-90s generation, which are relatively different from previous generations. Furthermore, these characteristics also affect their perception of various products as well as their consuming behavior, especially in relation to wanghong.
Wanghong refers to online celebrities who gained popularity from the internet are also taking advantage of social media to advertise products. Wanghong has been confirmed as having a strong impact on consumers’ consumption of daily commodities. My research was conducted to find out how the post-90s generation reacts to the tourism products advertised by wanghong, and, to what extent, wanghong’s opinions could affect the post-90s’ perceptions and consumptions of tourism products. To do so, I first examined the literature about the wanghong economy and the main characteristics of the post-90s generation in China, looked at the relationship between social media and consumption in China, and presented theories about tourism experience in the era of social media. To collect my data, I used semi-structured interviews and 10 respondents joined my research. I then used thematic analysis to organize and interpret my data. The results show that wanghong’s influences are different in affecting the post-90s’ perception and consumption of daily commodities and tourism products. Besides wanghong’s opinions, their consumption of tourism products is also influenced by spare time and financial power. Meanwhile, some of this generation’s characteristics also play an important role in affecting their consuming decision-making.","['social media', 'wanghong', 'post-90s generation', 'tourism consumption']"
On Cultural Entrepreneurship - Tracing the discourse(s) of a term,,2021-06-16,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Cultural Entrepreneurship as a eld of study is still in a nascent, immature state. In the last two decades, it has gained traction from a broad variety of disciplines, evidently addressing a phenomenon of relevance and interest to a range of academic discourses. In the social sciences, language is the tool-box, and words
and concepts are the tools with which scholars work. The various disciplines claim
the term, without showing awareness of parallel conversations on similar phenomena. This partially results from and partially perpetuates the ambiguous nature of the concepts that make up the term: 'culture' and 'entrepreneurship'. In the current state, 'cultural entrepreneurship' is inadequately grounded, attenuating its use as theoretical concept and analytical tool. Associations concerning entrepreneurship, a term firmly situated in economic disciplines, skews the conversation and inhibits the discourses' interdisciplinary potential. Therefore, an alternative term, ""cultural gardening"", is suggested. This term more clearly reflects the recent conversation on 'meaning cultivation' and cultural change as a procedural, societal conversation. The term shifts the emphasis away from entrepreneurialism, in order to distinguish the discourses on meaning cultivation from those on entrepreneurship within the creative and cultural industries. This thesis provides an interface for the various parallel discourses to interact through, opening up for more diverse, interdisciplinary research.","['cultural entrepreneurship', 'change', 'cultural-creative industries', 'meaning cultivation', 'culture']"

John Locke on the Origin of Child Behaviour,Eline Spaans,2021-06-15,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"John Locke’s Some Thoughts Concerning Education has been very influential on pedagogy and education from the late seventeenth century onwards. In his Thoughts, Locke describes
what he thinks the education of young gentlemen should look like, and he discusses how behaviour can be influenced through education. This work is very much in line with Locke’s more general empirically oriented philosophy, where he assumes that human characteristics, such as knowledge and behaviour, are learned rather than innate. Following this, concerning the origin of the behaviour of children, Locke can be placed on the nurture-side of the nature/nurture debate within modern pedagogy. However, we must be aware that the dichotomy between nature and nurture is not as strict as it seems, and that Locke’s Thoughts contains some elements from the nature-side as well.",

Saving the environment one trip at a time: The motivation and changing tourism decisions of young people who choose not to fly,Francis Garlich,2021-06-14,['Amanda Brandellero'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In 2018, the IPCC published an important report on climate change and showed that there is a need to take stringent measures in all economic sectors to try and avoid climate catastrophes (IPCC, 2018). In that same year, Greta Thunberg decided to take the train instead of a plane to a climate conference, which reinforced the flight shame movement (Orange, 2019). Especially young people were inspired by this movement and started experiencing growing concerns over climate change and their role in it (Lew, 2020). At the same time, young people are also a very influential group of travelers that want to immerse in local cultures and explore new destinations (UNWTO, 2016; Richards & Morrill, 2020). This urge to explore can thus clash with the growing concern over climate change. The purpose of this research is to get a deep understanding of the motivation of young people to stop flying and to see how their tourism decisions are influenced by this choice. Moreover, this research aims to understand how young people navigate their urge to travel after they have decided to stop flying. For this research, ten participants were interviewed. They were gathered through their involvement in activist groups and were thus already very concerned with sustainability. The results show that the participants were motivated by a strong feeling that this was the right thing to do for themselves and that by the chance that they could potentially influence someone else to do the same. This research introduces a shame of “wanderlack”, which can be identified as a social pressure experienced by young people because they do not feel the urge to travel the world. When looking at their changing tourism decisions, it is clear that the logistics of planning a trip have become more difficult, but the participants do think that it is worth to spend extra time and money. However, the results also shows some bottlenecks that endanger the resolution of the participants and can still lead them to make unsustainable choices. This coincides with the fact that many participants turned out to be less strict about the decision and this therefore shows that it is an incredibly difficult decision that is not as clear cut as it seems. Further research can thus be done to see how people negotiate these difficulties and to see how this influences their level of strictness regarding the decision.","['flight shame', 'sustainable tourism', 'slow travel', 'wanderlack', 'tourism decisions']"
Raising the stakes,Robin Marthinsen Kålås,2021-06-14,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"This thesis aims to explore whether online gambling should be considered exploitative, making it morally wrong, and what should be done about this. Initially, the effects of online gambling on individuals, those around him, and wider society is explored. It is concluded that there are several motivations to gamble (fulfilling a deep-rooted need, money, entertainment, etc.) which give different effects, and that these are connected to addiction. The effect on individuals negatively influences family and friends, but positively influences the state institution through
economical and social efforts from the gambling industry. Further, it is concluded, using three different theories of exploitation, that the way which the online gambling industry currently operates is wrong. Lastly, solutions are proposed on three different levels. The most important solutions are that individuals should try to distance themselves from gambling, local community should be strengthened through communities not constantly focusing on markets, and the state should apply a combination of nationalizing gambling and banning the marketing of it.",
The green representation in the outdoor hospitality. A cultural analysis of green campsites in contemporary France,Pauline Nédélec,2021-06-13,['Stijn Reijnders'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Since the dawn of time, camping has always existed. It is now seen as a significant field of tourism studies, especially with the expansion of green tourism. However, little is known about the representation of green campsites in France. Hence, this research focuses on the cultural values that are transmitted by them, as well as their online representations on French websites. This thesis analysed twenty-two websites through an inductive approach by employing a discourse analysis methodology which included both textual and visual analysis at the same time. Subsequently, coding and theming allowed the researcher to identify clear patterns which could be observed. Observations resulted in three main themes encompassing firstly, ‘back to nature in green campsites’; secondly, campsites as ‘places to socialize’ and thirdly, as places that meet ‘high standards and expectations’. The cultural values all revolved around nature, which is therefore the anchor for the others values. In a nutshell, well-being, respect, sharing, conviviality, safety and uniqueness are some of the values transmitted by the green campsites through their texts and pictures displayed online. On a theoretical level, this paper contributes a recent view concerning the camping sector in France, as well as a relevant insight for the management and marketing of outdoor accommodation by empirically assessing discourse surrounding the green camping sector, using established models. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact such values may have on social practices. Furthermore, the results indicated that there is a clear trend towards green tourism, and that it can be studied more deeply in further research.","['Campsites', 'Camping', 'Green Tourism', 'Cultural Values', 'Discourse.']"

From Hospitality to Hostility: The Impact of COVID-19 on the Tourist-Host Relationship,Yvette Ziya Mank,2021-06-11,['Annaclaudia Martini'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 virus took the world by storm. It required society to stand still and left governments with the difficult task of implementing adequate measures, which also had many implications in the field of tourism. Feelings of uncertainty and fear have prevailed, creating uncomfortable situations between tourists and locals and their relation may even resemble temporary ‘alienation’. Hitherto, little is known about the exact effects of the presence of this virus on the tourist experience. Therefore, this thesis dedicates itself to find an answer to “How and in what ways has the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the Western tourist experience, the destination image and the tourist-host relationship in destinations in Southeast Asia”. In order to answer this question, this thesis performed a qualitative research with an ethnographic approach in the form of in-depth interviews with ten participants who practiced international travel to Southeast Asian countries at the time of the Coronavirus outbreak. The results of this thesis demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak unleashed xenophobic behaviour of the local communities  towards the Western tourists, which was caused by several factors, such as media portrayal, information scarcity and (often ungrounded) assumptions. In turn, the local communities acted out of fear, panic, and self-protection, leading to  uncomfortable tourism encounters in which the Western tourist had been Othered, and temporarily took the position of the Reversed Other. Strikingly, the results of this thesis show that the Western tourists interviewed were able to put it all into perspective, by realising and expecting it was a momentary experience driven by steering emotions as panic, anxiety, and protection during a time of crisis. Therefore, interestingly enough, neither the tourist–host relationship nor the  destination image seemed to be negatively affected in the long-term.","['Tourist-host relationships', 'Tourism encounter', 'Destination image', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'the Other']"
The Koreaboo as a media tourist: Soft power of the Korean government and Western Hallyu fans compared as a result of globalization and digitalization,Guntar Sinuraya,2021-06-10,['Annaclaudia Martini'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In recent years, the popularity of Hallyu, the Korean Wave, has been on the rise in Western countries. Hallyu is a phenomenon that is sparked by Korean popular culture. It has been spreading to other countries than South Korea since the 1990s, mainly in the rest of Asia at first, but now also in Western countries, especially after Korean content began to be distributed on social media. Hallyu is, to a large extent, stimulated by the South Korean government as the government provided Hallyu-related industries like media, tourism, and technology with favorable circumstances for them to flourish, and the government did that through policymaking.
In Hallyu there have been controversies regarding sexual misconduct with, and high pressure on, idols resulting in suicides. It has been argued that these controversies are the result of Confucian ideology that is present in Korean society. It has also been argued that the Korean government has been implementing policies regarding Hallyu too nonchalantly, commodifying Korean culture, and that the government has not been focusing on what sociocultural effects this behavior can have, especially considering the soft power the Korean government could have because of Hallyu and the Confucian ideology that could be mediated via Hallyu.
Therefore, this thesis studies the tourist experience of Western Hallyu fans, also mentioned as Koreaboos, not in a derogatory sense, to find out what their experiences reveal about Korean soft power and brand nationalism. This thesis studies Koreaboos’ experiences because it fills the gap between media, tourism, fan and political studies since there has not been enough focus in academia on Hallyu as a meaning-making device, and fans comparing their imaginations about Korea before and after traveling to Korea from the perspective of soft power. To study the experiences of Koreaboos, two main groups of participants were interviewed. Namely, Koreaboos that had an educational background regarding Korea and Koreaboos that did not. They were asked to reflect on their experiences becoming a fan first and then becoming a tourist in Korea.
The results showed that the Korean government proved to have soft power through commercialism of fan products in the West, where it was able to mediate Confucian ideals through Hallyu. In Korea, the exertion of soft power was continued by adopting the fans in a patriarchal social system. However, fans proved to have soft power as well, namely in their identity as a prosumer in the West and as a cosmopolitan in Korea. The results suggest the methods used in this thesis are important for showing that both the Korean government and Koreaboos have soft power, and that this is due to a shift of global power relations, which in turn is a result of globalization and digitalization.","['Brand nationalism', 'Hallyu', 'media tourism', 'soft power', 'transnational fandom']"
The other kingdom of folktales: The local community perspective on folktale touristification in the Belgian Ardennes,"Geradin, Sarah",2021-06-02,['Reijnders S.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Traveling to visit places for their stories is not a recent phenomenon. Yet, the development of pop culture through media has pushed this phenomenon even further, forcing the tourism industry to consider the influence of pop culture on tourists. Compared to TV shows, movies and literature, folktales have received less attention from scholars. Yet, folktales and tourism can be combined to create an experience that blends reality and fantasy, that produces a more unique, original, and sometimes even more authentic experience for tourists. Consequently, a majority of tourism research focussed on the tourist perspective, leaving the local community perspective merely a side note. Therefore, this study looked at how locals evaluate and perceive the touristification of folktales. 16 Interviews were done in the Belgian Ardennes, a region still in the figuring things out when it comes to the touristification of folktales. Folktales and tourism are two important characteristics of the Belgian Ardennes. Tourism is one of the main economic sectors of the region, and folktales and traditions are what makes the region so rich and unique. The outcome of this study showed that the interviewed locals were supportive of the touristification of folktales as they perceived it to be a way to have a meaningful experience, to reconnect with their heritage, and to preserve and valorise it better. It is the impacts often associated with touristification of which the interviewees were more sceptical. Therefore, they perceive certain ways and places to touristy folktales to be more meaningful than others. However, the connections of interviewees to folktales and to tourism in the region influenced their answers, providing more nuanced outcomes. From a conceptual approach, the way locals perceive and evaluate the touristification of folktales also seems to be influenced by a more popular approach to folktales which tends to be static compared to the scholar approach that sees folktales as dynamic. This results in an interesting discussion on the conceptualisation of folktale touristification.","['culture', 'tourism', 'folktales', 'touristification', 'locals', 'Belgian Ardennes']"
"Psychology and Phenomenology of Religious Experiences
- Investigations Into Religious Experiences and Arguments
Against Epistemological Reductionism",Nathalie Maria Kirch,2021-06-01,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Starting from a defense against New Atheist critiques of Religion, this thesis explores
religious experiences from the perspectives of both psychological as well as
phenomenological scholars. First, I criticize the epistemological reductionism which is
implied by both the New Atheists as well as some of their opponents. I then move on to
presenting subjective accounts of truth used in Pragmatism and Phenomenology, as an
alternative to rationalist, third-person accounts of truth. Several writings of William James
are discussed, including parts of his infamous book The Varieties of Religious Experience. I
present an argument for framing Phenomenology as a method of psychological research.
What follows is the presentation of three phenomenological analyses of religious experiences,
which are supposed to highlight their polymorphic nature: Chrétien’s The Wounded Word,
Marion’s The Saturated Phenomenon, as well as Rudolf Otto’s The Idea of the Holy. The
ultimate aim of this investigation is to find a way to combine Science and Religion into a
worldview in which they can coexist.",
Als door een spiegel in raadselen,A.J. de Jongste,2021-06-01,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Het boek Utopia van Thomas More kent een veelvoud aan duidingen. In deze thesis
onderzoek ik de interpretatie van Giulia Sissa. Zij neemt als uitgangspunt de
gemeenschappelijkheid van bezit in Utopia. Zij stelt dat Thomas More het boek zou
gebruiken om een verschil van mening over dit aspect uit te werken. De controverse zou spelen tussen Thomas More als tegenstander van de gemeenschappelijkheid van bezit en Erasmus als voorstander hiervan. Dit meningsverschil is, volgens Sissa, terug te voeren op het spreekwoord ‘Vrienden delen alles’, wat Erasmus in zijn Adagia uit 1515, behandelt. Ook de betekenis van de naam van de verteller Raphael Hythodaeus speelt een belangrijke rol. In mijn thesis beperk ik me tot deze aspecten van Sissa’s stelling. Ik plaats het boek in zijn tijd.

Rechtvaardigheid en Fatsoen,Rogier T.A. van Wijck,2021-05-19,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Medical crowdfunding is an upcoming phenomenon. Through online platforms individuals turn to the masses to raise money for their medical expenses. It aims to address and bridge the gaps and injustices within the current national health care system. However, some have argued that crowdfunding itself might generate injustices. Not every campaign will raise funds equally and meet its target amount. Existing bias in the society might influence a campaigner’s perceived deservingness and consequently their chance of a successful campaign. This raises concerns about equality of opportunity, justice and distributive justice more specifically. In this thesis, I analyse medical crowdfunding from the theory of justice in health care posited by Norman Daniels and from the notion of decency formulated by Avishai Margalit. I argue that in its current form medical crowdfunding does not have a place
within a just and decent system and might even pose a threat to such a system.",

All You Need to Bring is Your Trust: To what extent does free admission to live music venues influence music audience’s perception of music performances?,Mina So,2021-05-05,['prof. Anna Mignosa'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Cultural public institutions, mainly national collections and museums, have adopted free admission to realize democracy and collective ownership of culture. This “open-door” policy has expanded broadly, nowadays, to indicate a pricing strategy adopted across the cultural industry, particularly in the music business. Live music venues have experimented to apply free admission to their music performances. Most of those venues are profit-seeking, and given music performances are the crucial components of their services. Despite this, their forsaking economic profits over the performances arouses curiosity about their continuous interest in operating free admission to the music performances. This question motivated us to investigate the influence of free admission to live music venues on audience’s perception of music performances. We choose BIRD, the live music venue located in Rotterdam, to collect data about the audience who had attended BIRD’s free admission performances. With the data collected via online survey, we test 3 hypotheses using ordered logit regression. The formulated hypotheses test these: The relation between a music audience’s past and present cultural consumption, The impact of free admission on the audience’s appreciation of music performances, The impact of the experience with free admission on the audience’s future consumption.","['Cultural Consumption', 'Consumer behavior', 'Audience', 'Free Admission', 'Pricing strategies', 'Information Asymmetry', 'WTP', 'Live Music Venues', 'Performing Arts', 'Music Performances', 'Concert']"
Self-directed entrepreneurial learning through digital media platforms: An online autoethnography of the YouTube-channel “Impact Theory by Tom Bilyeu”.,Bente van Lierop,2021-04-30,['Dr. Sven-Ove Horst'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Numerous possibilities and opportunities have opened up for students, employees, and creative professionals to improve their personal process of learning, and support their process of self-development by means of using digital media technologies. The problem is how to develop an understanding of the value of using digital media technologies for entrepreneurial learning, and how to effectively apply the self-directed learned knowledge in such a way that their professional lives will be improved. This research is situated in two emerging fields of inquiry: entrepreneurial learning in entrepreneurship research, and online self-directed learning in media education research. The main research question is: What is the value of entrepreneurship videos for online self-directed entrepreneurial learning? With this focus, the study provides insight into how online self-directed learning through digital media platforms can be supportive of conscious self-development as an entrepreneur, and for building a reflective appreciation of continuously developing knowledge around entrepreneurship. This includes learning what it means to become an entrepreneur by yourself (through online self-directed learning). This study uses and critically reflects on the content of recorded and uploaded interview videos of entrepreneurs and their self-development, which are presented on a specific YouTube-channel (Impact Theory by Tom Bilyeu). Two methods of analysis were used to evaluate the data sample of 10 semi-structured interviews that were published on the ‘Impact Theory’ YouTube-channel. The first method is a directed content analysis of the interview content, focusing on what they have learned about doing entrepreneurship. The second method of analysis is an autoethnography, that is used to examine the personal experience of the researcher. The overall aim is to enhance and produce a self-reflective auto-ethnography about what the author (me) can learn from watching videos on entrepreneurship and how this impacts a process of conscious self-directed entrepreneurial learning. The theoretical foundation of the directed content analysis is based on the work of two authors. Firstly, Rae’s (2006) conceptual framework for analysing entrepreneurial learning for technology-based entrepreneurs. Including the themes: personal and social emergence of entrepreneurial identity, contextual learning and negotiated enterprise. Secondly, Cope’s (2005) dynamic learning perspective of entrepreneurship is also used as a foundation for the directed content analysis including the themes: content dimension and process dimension. The  analysis shows that the entrepreneurial development goes hand-in-hand with the development as a person. Specifically, the entrepreneurs prioritized their self-development as a foundation for their development of an entrepreneurial identity, and then used this as a driver and basis to advance in their process of entrepreneurial learning. Through revealing their personal knowledge and reflecting on their experiences, they create a surface of intense self-reflection for audiences. A key take-away is that through optimizing the underlying mechanisms of self-development, one can better navigate the process of entrepreneurial learning and self-directed learning, and thereby become a more conscious entrepreneurial being.","['self-directed learning', 'entrepreneurial learning', 'media entrepreneurship', 'self-development', 'digital media platform']"
Datagedreven sturing,Nellie Manders,2021-04-09,"['Dr. V. Homburg', 'Dr. R.

De belofte dat data inzicht geeft, lijkt nog beperkt waarheid te worden. Welzijnsorganisaties die de jeugdwet uitvoeren, kunnen baat hebben bij de inzet van data voor (toekomstige) ontwikkelingen en nieuwe mogelijkheden om budgetverantwoorde en effectieve hulp in te zetten. Doordat er sprake is van grote budgettekorten en de wens voor een transformatie binnen de sector is er behoefte aan nuttige informatie die kan worden ingezet

"A Future for Psychiatry: Psychedelic Therapy as a Synthesis of Evidence-based Psychiatry and Existential
Psychotherapy",Joel Bornemann,2021-04-09,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"The fields of psychiatry and psychotherapy currently find themselves dominated by
schools of thought that show an admirable scientific purity, but fail to acknowledge
fundamental aspects of the human experience. Conversely, an examination of the history of these disciplines reveals alternative approaches that provide a philosophically deeper and more authentic analysis of human being, but lack the scientific rigor of the mainstream practices. The current thesis proposes a potential synthesis of these two directions in the form of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. It is argued that the nature of the psychedelic experience is such that the philosophical depth of the alternative approaches is unavoidably preserved while simultaneously allowing for a degree of scientific precision akin to that of the mainstream approaches. Ultimately, in order to construct truly effective mental health care, it is argued that the current exclusive domination of the fields of psychiatry and psychotherapy should be outgrown, and that professionals should receive training in a wide array of different conceptual and therapeutic approaches.",
Between Trade and Human Rights,Amadeo Reijnierse,2021-04-05,"['Dr. M. Onderco', 'Prof.dr. A.G. Dijkstra']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The EU has made international human rights standards a top priority of its trade strategies. The essential human rights clause is the operative policy tool to introduce human right standards as conditions in trade agreements, but previous research has demonstrated a lack of effectiveness of international trade agreements to influence domestic state practices. This study aims to analyse the effectiveness of the human rights clause by investigating the research question: what is the effect of ratifying a trade agreement including the human rights clause with the EU on a country’s human rights performance? The main theoretical argument underlying this thesis holds that because the EU usually has a position of dominant commercial leverage vis-à-vis its trade partner, it can make the gains from trade conditional on compliance with human rights standards. Therefore, the main hypothesis expects that if a country has ratified a bilateral trade agreement with the EU, it will demonstrate improved human rights performance. In order to measure the influence of EU trade agreement ratification on human rights performance, the analysis involved a time-series cross-sectional (or panel) multivariate regression with control variables, comparing 126 countries over a 15-year period from 1997 to 2011. No significant influence was found of ratifying the human rights clause on personal integrity rights violations, which indicates the absence of a direct relation between EU trade agreement ratification and human rights performance. Given the inconsistent findings compared to the literature, it is important that future research continues to investigate how treaty commitments are translated into policy action. Other than studying trade negotiations and the state-level characteristics that influence human rights reforms, researching the institutions for monitoring and scrutinizing how a government applies international human right standards to its domestic policies would be a valuable contribution.",

This study applies a value-based approach and presents how core values can be identified to form a basis for creating a community currency. This research makes use of a qualitative content analysis method for which 13 interviews with stakeholders were held.

WOB-VERZOEK OF NIET?,Keoma Jacobs-Moed,2021-03-11,"['Dr. J. van Veen', 'Prof.dr. W. Ebbers']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Dit exploratieve onderzoek hoopt met een verkenning bij te dragen aan nieuwe
onderzoeksrichtingen op het gebied van openbaarheid van overheidsgegevens en de gedragingen
van burgers hierin. Specifiek focust dit onderzoek zich op de mogelijke factoren die de neiging van
burgers om al dan niet in een bepaalde situatie, middels een Wob-verzoek, informatie op te vragen
bij de overheid kunnen verklaren.
De huidige ICT en bredere technologische ontwikkelingen maken het meer dan ooit mogelijk om
overheidsgegevens op een toegankelijke manier openbaar te maken. Dit scriptieonderzoek gaat over
openbaarheid van overheidsgegevens, welke is geregeld op grond van de Wet openbaarheid van
bestuur (Wob). De Wob regelt ook het recht van burgers om informatie en documenten op te vragen
als deze nog niet openbaar zijn; dit kan met een zogenaamd Wob-verzoek.
Het opvragen van niet openbare informatie bij de overheid, op grond van de Wob, lijkt echter niet zo
aantrekkelijk voor burgers te zijn en lijkt hiermee vooral een bezigheid van journalisten. Er is weinig
bekend over de beweegredenen en gedragingen van burgers met betrekking tot het opvragen van
informatie middels een Wob-verzoek.
Met een survey worden de gegevens verzameld. De neiging van burgers om al dan niet een Wobverzoek in te dienen wordt meetbaar gemaakt (afhankelijke variabele) door 4 situatieschetsen,
gevolgd door de vraag in welke mate ze bereid zijn om informatie op te vragen bij de overheid. Drie
onafhankelijke variabelen worden uitgevraagd door 16 stellingen op een 5-punts Likertschaal.
Daarnaast zijn drie controlevariabelen, leeftijd, opleiding en gender meegenomen. De gegevens zijn
met behulp van SPSS multiple regressieanalyse geanalyseerd.
De resultaten laten geen significante verbanden zien tussen 1) vertrouwen, 2) winstverwachting, 3)
bureaucratische competentie en de neiging van burgers om al dan niet een Wob-verzoek in te
dienen. Alle hypothesen van het onderzoek worden hiermee verworpen.
De conclusie is dan ook dat er amper effecten op de neiging van het indienen van een Wob-verzoek
te verwachten zijn aan de hand van de mate van vertrouwen, winstverwachting en/of
bureaucratische competentie.
Het exploratieve karakter in een vrijwel nieuw onderzoeksgebied van passieve openbaarheid heeft
enkele risico’s met zich meegebracht die ook bewaarheid zijn. Achteraf gezien is een kwantitatieve
onderzoeksmethode niet de meest gelukkige keuze gebleken. Met name de betrouwbaarheid van de
metingen, mede door de dunne theoretische basis, is door de matige validiteit niet optimaal. Het
advies is dan ook om een stap terug te doen en eerst met een kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethode te
verkennen welke mogelijke factoren een rol spelen bij het al dan niet opvragen van niet openbare
informatie.",
Anti Virus Software,Donna Lippes,2021-03-11,"['Dr. R. Moody', 'Dr. P. Castenmiller']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Achtergrond
Tijdens de coronapandemie probeert de Nederlandse overheid het aantal coronabesmettingen
te verminderen met maatregelen die een zo klein mogelijke maatschappelijke impact hebben.
Coronavirus tracking apps kunnen hier mogelijk uitkomst bieden. Deze apps monitoren of
iemand in contact is geweest met een mogelijk besmet persoon. Nederland gebruikt hiervoor
de CoronaMelder. Het gebruik van de CoronaMelder is vrijwillig en de effectiviteit ervan
hangt af van het aantal Nederlanders dat de app vrijwillig wil gebruiken. Het is onbekend
welke factoren invloed hebben op de bereidwilligheid van Nederlanders om de CoronaMelder
te gebruiken.
Doel
In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht welke factoren invloed hebben op de bereidheid van de
Nederlandse bevolking om de CoronaMelder te gebruiken.
Methode
Er is in deze studie gekozen voor een cross-sectioneel surveyonderzoek. De data zijn
geanalyseerd door middel van een multipele hiërarchische regressieanalyse. De
onderzoekspopulatie is de Nederlandse bevolking. 166 respondenten hebben de vragenlijst
ingevuld.
Resultaten
Uit de analyse bleek dat de mate waarin iemand gelooft dat de CoronaMelder bijdraagt aan
het verminderen van de besmettingen van het coronavirus, de mate waarin iemand ervaart dat
de omgeving denkt dat diegene de CoronaMelder moet gebruiken en de mate waarin iemand
een privacyrisico ervaart bij het gebruiken van de app invloed hebben op de beslissing of
iemand wel of niet de CoronaMelder gaat gebruiken. De mate waarin iemand verwacht dat het
moeite kost om de app te gebruiken, de mate waarin iemand de juiste ondersteunende middel
bezit om de app te gebruiken en het vertrouwen dat iemand heeft in de overheid of in
technologie bleken geen voorspellers te zijn van het gebruik van de CoronaMelder.
Conclusie
De resultaten laten zien dat bestaande modellen voor het voorspellen van de
gebruikersbereidheid van digitale overheidstoepassingen deels passend zijn bij het
voorspellen van het gebruik van de CoronaMelder. Het inzicht verkregen uit deze studie zou
de Nederlandse overheid kunnen inzetten om de CoronaMeldercampagne effectiever te
maken door op de voor de potentiële gebruiker relevante thema’s in te spelen.",

fysiek domein vinden er echter ook verschillende algoritme-gedreven innovaties plaats, dit levert
ogenschijnlijk geen problemen op (Schaefer, 2020).
Voor het goed toepassen van de mogelijkheden van algoritmen binnen de overheid is het
relevant om te kijken naar factoren die van invloed zijn op het gebruik en de adoptie van deze
toepassing. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld:
Welke factoren zijn van invloed op het gebruik van algoritmen binnen het fysiek en het sociaal
domein van gemeenten?
Algoritmen en gebruik van algoritme-gedreven technologie in de context van dit onderzoek
verwijst naar geautomatiseerde processen en besluitvorming op basis van enorme hoeveelheden
gegevens. Vaak is het daarbij lastig te achterhalen hoe gegevens en processen gebruikt worden en
moet er worden op vertrouwd dat er juist gehandeld is. In de theoretische verkenning zijn een
negental factoren naar voren gekomen die van invloed blijken bij het gebruik van algoritme-gedreven
technologie. Het gaat daarbij om de geschiktheid van de ICT-infrastructuur, het hebben van
voldoende capaciteit om te ontwikkelen en te implementeren. Verder gaat het om de beschikbaarheid
van data, die ook nog gereed moet zijn om te gebruiken. Hiernaast wordt de geldende wet- en
regelgeving genoemd waar aan moet worden voldaan. Ook zijn er variabelen gericht op de overheid
zoals het vertrouwen in het handelen door de samenleving, maar ook de legitimiteit van het handelen
voor de overheid zelf. Tot slot is de invloed van interne afstemming tussen IT en organisatie genoemd
en de perceptie van de medewerker. Dit heeft geleid tot een conceptueel model dat is
geoperationaliseerd.
Er is in dit onderzoek gekozen voor het uitvoeren voor een small-n kwalitatieve
onderzoeksmethode om te achterhalen welke factoren in de praktijk van invloed zijn. Hiervoor heeft
een vergelijkende casestudie plaatsgevonden waarin het sociaal domein is vergeleken met het fysiek
domein. Het verzamelen van data is gebeurd door het houden van interviews en
documentatieonderzoek. De data die is verzameld is getranscribeerd en gecodeerd.
Aan de hand van het conceptueel model zijn de factoren getoetst. In het onderzoek is
gebleken dat elk van genoemde concepten uit het conceptueel model van invloed bleek op het
gebruik van algoritmen. Hiernaast is één variabele toegevoegd aan het model. Ethiek werd aan de
hand van de analyse toegevoegd aan het model. In de analyse werd verder clusters van factoren
gevonden. De factoren konden geplaatst worden in één van de volgende clusters: datalandschap, 
Martijn Remmerswaal PBLQ 4
organisatorisch of doel- en wetmatigheid. Er is verder afhankelijkheid tussen de factoren gevonden,
wat betekent dat als er aan één van de factoren niet kan worden voldaan er ook niet aan een andere
factor kan worden voldaan.
Over het algemeen blijkt de invloed van variabelen in het sociaal domein overeen te komen
met het fysiek domein. Binnen bepaalde factoren is echter wel verschil gevonden. Over het algemeen
kan gesteld worden dat het voldoen aan de factoren binnen het sociaal domein lastiger te organiseren
is. Kwantitatief vervolgonderzoek is nodig om de mate van invloed van de individuele factoren te
toetsen.
Tot slot, zijn er een aantal aanbevelingen gegeven om goed gebruik te kunnen maken van
algoritme-gedreven technologieën binnen gemeenten. Aanbevolen wordt om standaarden te
ontwikkelen voor data en ICT. Verder wordt aanbevolen om capaciteit te organiseren voor
implementatie en verandertraject. Tot slot wordt aanbevolen om te werken met een ethische
commissie om algoritme-gedreven technologieën te adviseren en toetsen.",
"Digitale uitsluiting, beïnvloedt het de kwaliteit van een dienst?",Saskia van der Meer,2021-03-11,"['Dr. R. Moody', 'Dr. P. Castenmiller']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Overheden, wetenschappers, politici, hulpinstanties en burgers signaleren dat niet iedereen in staat is
om via digitale dienstverlening contact met de overheid te onderhouden. Dit heeft ongelijke toegang
tot overheidsdiensten tot gevolg. Tot nu toe richtte onderzoek zich op de ervaring van digitale
ongelijkheid en daaruit volgend gedrag van de digitaal minder vaardige zelf. In dit onderzoek wordt
ingegaan op de perceptie van digitaal vaardigen van digitale dienstverlening die anderen uitsluit.
Om te onderzoeken welke invloed gepercipieerde exclusie door digitale dienstverlening heeft op
de beoordeling van deze dienstverlening door digitaal vaardige gebruikers, wordt een crosssectioneel survey-onderzoek ingezet. Wetenschappelijk onderzoek maakt het waarschijnlijk dat
digitaal vaardigen in kunnen zien dat het welzijn van digitaal minder vaardigen wordt aangetast
wanneer zij geen gebruik kunnen maken van digitale overheidsdiensten. Dit kan de digitaal vaardigen
vervolgens motiveren tot prosociaal gedrag, in dit onderzoek een negatievere beoordeling van de
kwaliteit van het dienstverleningsproces en het resultaat van dit proces. Op basis van de huidige
kennis wordt een passend kwaliteitsmodel gekozen, dat wordt aangevuld met twee onafhankelijke
variabelen, perceptie van digitale ongelijkheid en prosociale motivatie. Het aldus verkregen model
wordt geoperationaliseerd tot een survey en voorgelegd aan Nederlandse burgers met als casus de
DigiD app.
Op basis van dit onderzoek kan gezegd worden dat er aanwijzingen zijn dat het ervaren dat een
digitaal dienstverleningsproces een uitsluitende werking heeft de tevredenheid van digitaal vaardige
burgers over dit proces negatief beïnvloedt. Er kan echter geen definitieve uitspraak worden gedaan
omdat de operationalisatie van de perceptie van digitale ongelijkheid geen goede schaal voor dit
concept opleverde. Er is geen relatie gevonden tussen prosociale motivatie en de beoordeling van
digitale dienstverlening.",
"The WMD non-proliferation clause in EU trade agreements:
A valuable contribution to the international nuclear nonproliferation
regime?",Ilja Donkervoort,2021-02-24,"['Dr. M. Onderco', 'Prof.dr. A.G. Dijkstra']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The European Union (EU) is increasingly characterised as a global actor with considerable influence internationally. The EU derives much of its power from its internal market. The EU has been using this trade power to exert influence in other areas by including non-trade issues (NTIs) in its trade agreements with third countries. One such NTI is the weapons of mass destruction (WMD) non-proliferation clause. Now that the EU has acquired an influential position globally, the EU’s efforts to counter the proliferation of WMD may have a considerable positive impact on international security. Therefore, this study researched how the WMD non-proliferation clause included in EU trade agreements with third countries affects the WMD non-proliferation behaviour of those countries.
The clause consists of three obligations: 1) Comply to existing WMD non-proliferation obligations, 2) Take steps to join more WMD non-proliferation obligations, 3) Develop an effective system of national export controls on dual-use items. In this study, WMD non-proliferation behaviour was conceptualised as the actions that countries have undertaken to fulfil these obligations.
This study researched how the WMD non-proliferation clause affected countries’ WMD non-proliferation behaviour. Based on theories of conditionality it was hypothesised that if any effect of the clause would be visible, it would be visible after the trade agreement had entered into force. Based on theories of policy transfer it was hypothesised that countries with a trade agreement including the WMD non-proliferation clause would perform better on the three aspects that make up WMD non-proliferation behaviour than similar countries that did not have such a trade agreement.
A co-variational analysis was carried out to test the hypotheses. The units of analysis were two countries that signed an EU trade agreement including the WMD non-proliferation clause prior to 2016, Albania and Indonesia. These two countries were each matched with a ‘control’ case that matched them on the relevant identified control variables.
The results found confirming evidence for all but one hypothesis. Countries with the WMD non-proliferation clause did not perform better on the aspect of WMD non-proliferation behaviour that concerns taking steps to join more WMD non-proliferation obligations. However, these countries did perform better on the WMD non-proliferation behaviour aspects of complying with existing WMD non-proliferation obligations and developing an effective export control system than similar countries without said clause. However, only thin evidence was found for the latter hypotheses. More firm evidence was found for the hypothesis that improvements in WMD non-proliferation behaviour would be noted mostly after the agreement including the WMD non-proliferation clause was in place.
The results demonstrate that the EU can use its trade power to exert influence in other areas. However, this influence was limited in the area of WMD non-proliferation. While the WMD non-proliferation clause did slightly strengthen the international non-proliferation regime, policy makers must consider whether there may be better ways than via trade to stimulate WMD non-proliferation.",
Richting Maatwerk voor Marken,Steven Horsting,2021-02-16,"['Prof.dr. A. van Buuren', 'Prof.dr. G. Teisman']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Het voorliggende onderzoek is uitgevoerd in opdracht van Rijkswaterstaat. Zij constateerden dat zij zich bevinden in een veranderende omgeving die naast doelmatigheid ook bewegelijkheid van hen  verlangt. Zij hebben daarom de Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam in 2015 gevraagd de balans tussen exploratie (radicale verandering) en exploitatie (incrementele verandering) in de organisatie te onderzoeken. Voor de opdracht zijn een aantal casussen geselecteerd. Dit onderzoek behandelt exploratie en exploitatie in de context van het project Marken van Rijkswaterstaat West-Nederland Noord. 
	Op Marken is een waterveiligheidsopgave ontstaan toen in 2005 de omringkade werd afgekeurd die het eiland beschermt tegen het water uit het Markermeer. Van 2006 tot 2013 probeert RWS een passend dijkversterkingsalternatief te ontwerpen. Wanneer dit niet lukt wordt een doorstart gemaakt. Tussen 2013 en 2016 onderzoekt RWS samen met overheidspartners en Markers verschillende mogelijkheden, waaronder een Meerlaagsveiligheid-oplossing die de dijkversterking aanvult met waterrobuuste ruimtelijke ontwikkeling en een crisisbestrijdingsplan. Medio 2016 wordt een voorkeursalternatief vastgesteld door de minister. 
	Wat opvalt is dat het governance arrangement (GA), dat de randvoorwaarden voor governance definieert, verschilt tussen fase 1 en 2 van project Marken. De vier dimensies van het GA: actoren, discours, spelregels en macht worden anders vormgegeven. Dit onderzoek wil nagaan of  de veranderingen in het GA van invloed zijn geweest op de exploratie-exploitatiebalans. De centrale vraag luidt dus: Hoe beïnvloedden de gehanteerde governance arrangementen de balans tussen exploratieve en exploitieve innovatie in de twee hoofdfases van project Marken; en hoe kan een governance arrangement worden vormgegeven om de optimale balans tussen exploratie en exploitatie te benaderen?
	Om de vraag te beantwoorden is gebruik gemaakt van de governance arrangementen typologie van Arnouts, Arts, Kamphuis en Van Tatenhove (2012a). Zij onderscheiden vijf ideaaltypische governancestijlen: overheidsregulering, gesloten co-governance, open co-governance, markt-governance en zelf-governance. Elke governancestijl heeft per dimensie verschillende kenmerken die bepalend zijn voor de stabiliteit en dynamiek van het GA. De governancestijlen bevinden zich op een spectrum waarbij overheidsregulering vooral beschikt over stabiliserende eigenschappen, zelf-governance vooral beschikt over dynamiserende eigenschappen, en de anderen beschikken over een combinatie van beide eigenschappen. De samenstelling van eigenschappen bepaalt volgens Duit & Galaz (2008) de adaptieve capaciteit van het GA: de mate waarin het exploratie en exploitatie faciliteert. Exploratie is gebaat bij dynamiek, exploitatie bij stabiliteit. De juiste combinatie van eigenschappen zou dan leiden tot een robuuste governancestijl waarin exploratie en exploitatie optimaal zijn en een ambidexter evenwicht ontstaat. Dit wordt gezien als het theoretisch optimum omdat het robuuste GA over de benodigde capaciteiten beschikt om adequaat te reageren op elke vorm van verandering in zijn omgeving. Door het differentiëren van de casussen op de onafhankelijke variabele wordt het effect van verschillende GA eigenschappen op exploratie en exploitatie zichtbaar. 
	Om een goed beeld te krijgen van de praktijk, en hoe governance arrangementen, exploratie en exploitatie daarin voorkomen, zijn twee methoden gebruikt. Het raadplegen van casus-gerelateerde documenten en het afnemen van 21 interviews met betrokkenen uit beide fases van project Marken. Onder de respondenten waren vertegenwoordigers van de belangrijkste betrokken actoren, wat verhalen opleverde vanuit meerdere perspectieven. 
	Analyse van de onderzoeksdata laat zien dat overheidsregulering de dominante governancestijl was in fase 1 van Marken. Andere governancestijlen komen nauwelijks voor. RWS fungeert als regisseur en werkt grotendeels zelfstandig. In de zoektocht naar een passende dijkversterking is het spelregelkader van het HWBP2 leidend. Stabiliserende eigenschappen zijn sterk aanwezig terwijl dynamiserende eigenschappen juist beperkt zijn. Daardoor laat fase 1 veel exploitatie zien. Exploratie wordt wel geprobeerd maar zet niet door. Het beeld is anders in fase 2. Daarin is een mix van alle governancestijlen zichtbaar waarbij gesloten en open co-governance de kern vormen. RWS regisseert waar nodig, maar coöperatie met overheidspartners en Markers staat voorop. Het spelregelkader is meer open gedurende de eerste helft van deze fase door de afwezigheid van het HWBP2. Vanaf de MIRT Verkenning valt het project onder het nieuwe HWBP dat structuren aanreikt, maar zich tegelijkertijd flexibel opstelt. Het GA beschikt zo over stabiliserende en dynamiserende eigenschappen. Exploratie en exploitatie zijn in deze fase beide van hoog niveau.
	De aard van het governance arrangement lijkt op basis van de resultaten sterk van invloed te zijn op de exploratie en exploitatie. De sterkste invloed komt van de rol van de overheid uit de actorendimensie en van de aard van het inhoudelijke kader uit de spelregeldimensie. Als zelfstandige projectuitvoerder kan RWS in fase 1 grotendeels zelf de richting bepalen. Doordat RWS in fase 2 als partner fungeert in de samenwerking met andere actoren ontstaan pluriforme perspectieven en flexibiliteit. Daarnaast wordt in fase 1 exploitatie gestimuleerd door het HWBP2, terwijl het pogingen tot exploratie vaak blokkeert. Het nieuwe HWBP heeft in fase 2 oog voor zowel exploratie als exploitatie. De adaptieve capaciteit van het GA is in fase 1 dus lager dan in fase 2. Daardoor is in fase 1 sprake van een scheve balans tussen exploitatie en exploratie. Fase 2 benadert met een mix van governancestijlen, hoge adaptieve capaciteit en een sterk ontwikkelde exploratie-exploitatie balans het theoretisch optimum van de robuuste governancestijl. 
	De conclusies leiden tot vier aanbevelingen: 1) combineer governancestijlen. De kwaliteiten van governancestijlen kunnen elkaar aanvullen om exploratie en exploitatie te verhogen. 2) Streef naar samenwerking met andere actoren. Gezamenlijke verantwoordelijkheid voor een collectief doel verbreedt het perspectief terwijl gebundelde krachten efficiëntie bevorderen. 3) Hanteer een spelregelkader dat zowel structuur als flexibiliteit aanreikt. Zo faciliteert het exploitatie en exploratie. 4) Begin een project open en breed. Het geeft de vrijheid om het echte probleem te achterhalen en daarbij de best passende oplossing te zoeken. Dat kan zowel een exploratieve al exploitieve oplossing zijn. 
	De aanbevelingen zijn bedoelt voor projecten van RWS of waterschappen die zijn opgenomen in het HWBP. De context van deze projecten zal grotendeels overeenkomen met die van Marken wat de toepasbaarheid ondersteunt. Andere projecten kunnen eventueel ook gebruikmaken van de aanbevelingen, maar dienen zich ervan bewust te zijn dat zij een grotere vertaalslag moeten maken voor toepasbaarheid in de eigen context.",
EEN ONDERZOEK NAAR DE INVLOED VAN ONGESCHREVEN REGELS OP DE MATE VAN INCLUSIVITEIT BINNEN HET MINISTERIE VAN FINANCIËN,Anne  van Helvoort,2021-02-08,"['Dr. F.B. van der Meer', 'Prof.dr. L. den Dulk']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In de media, het onderwijs en het bedrijfsleven wordt er volop gediscussieerd over het belang van
inclusiviteit. De overheid, waar Financiën toe behoort, heeft een belangrijke taak om in haar eigen
organisatie diversiteit en inclusie te optimaliseren. Een divers ambtelijk apparaat draagt namelijk
bij aan legitimiteit, effectiviteit en gelijkwaardigheid van de overheid omdat bestuurders beter
kunnen inspelen op maatschappelijke problematieken (Baily, 2014; Çelik, 2018). Echter blijkt het in
de praktijk vaak lastig om inclusie te bereiken en te behouden. Volgens Riordan (2014) wordt de
inclusieve bedrijfscultuur vaak belemmerd door ongeschreven regels en gebrek aan steun vanuit de
dominante groepsleden. Zo hebben veel organisaties onbewust prototypen voor succes. Hier komen
subtiele vooroordelen bij kijken die leiden tot uitsluiting.
Om dit probleem gericht aan te pakken biedt dit onderzoek verdiepende inzichten hoe in- en
uitsluiting tot stand komt en welke ongeschreven regels en mechanismen hierop van invloed zijn.
Het onderzoek richt zich op de uitvoerende medewerkers van de afdelingen ‘Inspectie der
Rijksfinanciën’ (IRF) en ‘Fiscaal-Economische zaken’ (FEZ). Beide directies vallen onder de
financiële functie, maar vervullen (deels) een andere rol. Per afdeling zijn de ongeschreven regels
getraceerd en is de ervaren mate van inclusie gemeten. Hierbij is gebruik gemaakt van een
kwalitatieve analyse waarbij twee verschillende methoden middels triangulatie met elkaar worden
gecombineerd.
De eerste methode is de ‘work group inclusion measure’ (WGIM) van Chung, et al., (2019).
Deze methode maakt het mogelijk om inclusie te meten middels de vijfpunts Likertschaal.
Specifiek is voor deze methode gekozen omdat deze zich richt op de componenten identificatie en
authenticiteit. Volgens het theoretisch kader vormen deze tezamen de afhankelijke variabele
inclusie. De tweede methode bestaat uit semi-gestructureerd interviews. De methode maakt het
mogelijk om ongeschreven regels te achterhalen. Evenals een beeld van gedragingen waaraan
medewerkers zich grotendeels (onbewust) houden.",

"Identity and the Socio-Cultural Values of Queer Clubbing Scenes
The Perspective of Clubbers","Pelsy, Théotime",2021-02-01,['Hoeven van der A.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Queer clubbing scenes do not cease to grow in popularity. Queer clubbing events now attract a highly diversified crowd of clubbers willing to taste the assumed freedom and safety of those events. Nevertheless, previous studies have taken limited account of the socio-cultural values of queer clubbing scenes and their contribution to the identity construction of their participants. Since the origins of club culture are closely connected to the history of the queer community, it is assumed that clubbing plays a crucial role in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals. Yet, more recent academic accounts highlighted that queer
clubbing events are increasingly opening their doors to ‘non-queer’ individuals. Hence, the socio-cultural values of queer clubbing scenes have the potential to influence the identity construction of queer as well as non-queer individuals sharing their dancefloors. Therefore, this research aims to explore how ‘queer’ as well as ‘non-queer’ clubbers construct the socio-cultural values of queer clubbing scenes and the impact those values have on their identity construction. 12 qualitative interviews were conducted with a diversified sample of clubbers frequenting Rotterdam’s queer clubbing scene. The data collected from the
interviews show that Rotterdam’s queer clubbing scene play various socio-cultural roles in the lives of clubbers. Namely, Rotterdam’s queer clubbing scene acts as a refuge, a nest, a bubble, and a laboratory for the respondent. Besides, queer dancefloors were characterized
 as a safe space of expression with strong historical values. Results show that Rotterdam’s
queer clubbing scene holds mutually constitutive socio-cultural values for queer and nonqueer clubbers. Finally, the analysis of the data collected from the interview shows that queer clubbing scenes play a crucial role in the expression of the respondents’ identity rather than its entire process of construction. Therefore, more research is required to understand the need of contemporary society subjects for a safe space of expression.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Queer Clubbing Scene', 'Socio-Cultural Values', 'Identity Construction', 'Safety', 'Diversity', 'Expression.']"

Countering the Dragon,Jolien  de Jong,2021-01-09,"['Prof.dr. M. Haverland', 'Dr. M. Onderco']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the European Union (EU) and China in 1975, EU-China relations have grown to encompass annual summits, regular ministerial meetings and more than 60 sectoral dialogues. In 2016, the EU adopted the Joint Communication Elements for a New EU Strategy on China and the Council Conclusions. These documents constitute the EU’s strategy for China. However, the EU’s strategy documents leave some questions unanswered, most important of which concerns: what is the EU’s position on China? This thesis analyses the preference formation of actors, and the content of the EU’s strategy for China from a theoretical perspective.
The research design applied to study this case is congruence analysis. Congruence analysis is an explanatory small-N research design which aims to find empirical evidence for the theoretical relevance or explanatory leverage of a particular theory, in comparison to other theories. The research design employs three theories: realism, liberalism and constructivism, to find out which theory provides the best framework to understand the EU’s strategy. These three theories are selected because they each possess a robust set of core assumptions for foreign policy most likely to provide explanations for this case. The three theories provide expectations regarding the preference formation and the final product of the strategy. Whereas the interests-related propositions concern themselves with the preference formation of relevant actors, content-related propositions are about the textual content of the Council Conclusions.
The empirical section of this thesis looks at the formation of the preferences of the member states first. Realism’s expectation that member states are protective of their sovereignty is somewhat matched by the empirical observations. Liberalism’s explanation of domestic preferences, especially those of business and industry, provides a better explanation of the preference formation of member states. A focus on human rights and rule of law issues seems to lack from the EU’s interests, unlike constructivism expected.
The second section of the empirical analysis looks at the content of the EU’s strategy for China, the Council Conclusions document. Against the expectations of constructivism, the Council Conclusions focus little to the improvement of China’s human rights and rule of law. Furthermore, the document devotes less attention to normative issues, in favour of trade and investment issues. Realism and liberalism prove equally capable to provide explanations for phenomena in EU-China relations, such as the EU response to the Belt and Road Initiative. However, liberalism’s focus on domestic preferences and economic interdependence explains why the EU’s strategy focuses on economic issues. Furthermore, liberalism predicts that speaking with a unified voice, rather than as 28 member states, is a challenge in EU-China relations that the EU seeks to overcome. This thesis argues that liberalism provides the best framework for understanding the case.",

God is a DJ: a thematic analysis of popular-music festival traveler’s experiences through Victor Turner’s framework of pilgrimage,"Leder, Yifat",2021-01-04,['Hoeven A. van der'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis views popular-music festival tourism through the lens of pilgrimage. It combines Turner’s ‘structure and anti-structure’ model (1969) with Turner and Turner’s pilgrimage framework (2011), which requires a meaningful spatial transition. While many of the music festival tourism scholars utilized the first, most neglected to incorporate the latter. As Covid-19 led to policies prohibiting public gatherings, a secondary aim of the study became understanding past experiences in order to develop structures for future music festivals that will be safe while preserving the core structure of popular-music festival
experiences. For this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 respondents who had traveled across two national boundaries to international popular-music festivals (or more). Special attention was paid to the four theoretical processes (i.e., inclusion-exclusion, liminality, communitas and spatial transition), which were also thematically analyzed using the Atlas.ti software. The authenticity of the travelers' experiences was found to be influenced by exterior cultural and political factors. Specifically, gender and nationality affecting inclusionexclusion, and technological advances (cell phones) and low connectivity with the real world affecting both inclusion-exclusion and communitas. While all the experiences incorporate pilgrimage processes, they resembled the later framework of ‘tourism magic’ (Graburn, 2004) more than the Turners' framework. Due to the inclusion of post-travel element and the addition of the return-back-to-real-world process. The implication for future music festivals under pandemic conditions is to rely on groups of travelers to experience their communitas in smaller crowed (e.g.: capsulated tours), as the travelers do not require huge crowds to experience all the four processes. Moreover, some level of hardship or need for adaptation should be kept (e.g., lower communication with outside world, or need to adapt to different customs and behavior), since it is necessary to substantiate the traveler’s experiences of the festival as an out of their real-world
surrounding.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Pilgrimage', 'Structure and anti-structure', 'Music festival tourism', 'Popular music festivals', 'Semi-structured interviews']"
European Integration Cleavage in the 8th and 9th European Parliament,Thijs Stegeman,2020-12-30,"['Dr. Asya Zhelyazkova', 'Prof.dr. M. Haverland']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"As a result of the financial crisis of ‘08- ‘09 and the Euro crisis of ’13-’15, Euroscepticism has become more mainstream and gotten a more prominent place in political debates and elections. This development was particularly visible at the European Parliament (EP) elections of 2014, where anti-European parties significantly increased their share of parliamentary seats. According to Hix, Noury and Roland, this shift has caused a surge in the importance of the pro/anti-European integration division compared to the traditional left-right division, measured in voting behaviour. The 2019 EP elections were not preceded by a similar crisis, but still resulted in an increased share of seats for anti-European Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Therefore, this thesis will focus on the composition of political cleavages in the complete eighth and the newly elected ninth term of the EP.
The term political cleavage was first introduced by Lipset and Rokkan to describe divisions in society which were mirrored in politics. These divisions were usually competing world views which encompassed a varying range of issues, i.e. liberal market views opposed to government intervention. Traditionally, the left-right cleavage has been the most important, while in the 70’s and 90’s cultural values of universal values opposed to local, cultural values gained in importance. Some authors argue that the cleavage of European integration falls along the same division as the cultural cleavage, while others treat it as a new emerging cleavage, quickly gaining in importance.
To analyse the development of the different cleavages, a multidimensional scaling analysis of roll-call data between 2014 and 2019 was done. Roll-call data are the publicly recorded votes of individual MEPs. Using these votes and multidimensional scaling, the ideological distances between MEPs were calculated and plotted in a 2-dimensional graph. To interpret the coordinates of the MEPs in this graph an OLS regression was performed.
The results from this regression showed that in the period from 2014 until the first half of 2019, the eighth term of the EP, a combination of the measurement for European integration and GAL/TAN was the best predictor for the first dimension, while the general left-right and economic left-right measures were most important on the second dimension. During the ninth term, the cleavages shifted and neither cleavage is clearly dominant , although EU integration seems to have a slight upper hand. It can be concluded that since the 2014 election, the EU integration cleavage has lost in dominance, but also that this cleavage has submerged with the cultural cleavage.",

Wilson recommends Economics as a good place to start, as it has the most similar scientific method, and has very well formalized theories. Thus, the present research looks for the places of coincidence starting with the work of conflict analysis and in particular Greed and Grievance. By Means of evolutionary ecology and consilience here I propose how Greed can be defined in operative behavioural processes that explain the chaotic behaviour of the ruling party and doesn’t comply directly with the rational choice. In the same way grievances are viewed as action towards punishment triggered by a sense of perceived depletion of resources and blaming a group that has a easy to recognize marker. Finally the deterioration of the social capital is oriented towards the unfortunate alignment of the biases inherited and the non-ideal environmental cues that result in a dehumanization of a particular group that in other case would be consider a neighbour.",
Covid-19 endogenous policy response: evidence from affected countries,"Egidio, Vincenzo d'",2020-12-18,['Rieger Matthias'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The Covid-19 pandemic triggered severely different policies response across countries and waved the discrepancy in the exposure that each country has in respect to the health crisis. This work offers a first quantitative framework for further investigations on how and whether the mitigation policy mix deployed by the different authorities reflects structural differences in the socio-economic background of developing countries. Starting from an extended version of the SIR theoretical model, I formulate a dynamic optimization problem for the governments to control the spread of the coronavirus. The quantitative analysis identifies the features that outline both the progression of the disease as well as the (disease) mitigation response commitment of each country. Whilst the differences in the intensity of the Covid-19 policy response is only partially driven from differences in the gradient of the transmission rate, I find that the socio-economic characteristics of each country have a deeper influence on the government’s response commitment. Once national authorities and international institutions are able to “endogenize” the pandemic dynamics in their recursive policy planning, the trade-off between health benefits and economic costs will be lower and the agents’ cooperation higher (in adherence with the deployed mitigation regime).","['Covid-19', 'pandemic', 'policy response', 'lockdown', 'recession']"
The nexus between economic growth and transport infrastructure in Indonesia,"Sukesa, Ida Kade",2020-12-18,['Papyrakis Elissaios'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The relationship between transport infrastructure and economic growth has attracted many researchers, including in Indonesia. However, all of these studies show quite mixed results depending on the approach used, the study's location, and the time studied.
This study uses both time-series data analysis and panel data analysis to investigate the relationship between economic growth and three transport infrastructure types. By using time-series data analysis, by employing VAR/VECM, this study concludes that there is a unidirectional relationship from economic growth to the growth in road infrastructure, not vice versa, while the relationships of per capita economic growth with the growth in air and sea transport infrastructure are not significant. A similar result also has been found using panel FEM with robust standard errors. All the growths in three types of infrastructure have no significant effect on per capita economic growth. Similarly, the effects of the level of both road transportation infrastructure and sea transportation infrastructure on economic growth are also not significant. However, the effect of the level of air transportation infrastructure is significant and negative.
Furthermore, in contrast with the effect of the growth rate of transport infrastructure on economic growth, the effect of growth in gross capital formation per capita, as a proxy of infrastructure investment, is positive and significant in all equations using FEM with robust standard errors. This shows that capital investment plays an essential role in Indonesia's economy and might confirm that the growth in infrastructure investment in-creases the demand for intermediate goods and labours, which can stimulate a multiplier effect in the economy.","['transport infrastructure', 'road transport infrastructure', 'sea transport infrastructure', 'air transport infrastructure', 'economic growth', 'Indonesia']"

The study discussed this question by exploring the external debt stocks components of SSA and analysing the major debt creditors in SSA from 2008 to 2018. The study found that China is not the biggest debtor in SSA and Chinese loans in SSA are mainly allocated in infrastructure. What is more, Chinese oversea financing insists the mutual principle without a condition attached, which also comes with longer maturity and competitive rate. The research concludes that loans from China to SSA is an opportunity for the regional nations to spur their economic growth, since such loans complement what those countries’ economic development is thirsty for.","['China', 'sub-Saharan Africa', 'loan', 'infrastructure', 'debt trap', 'economic growth']"

The resilient Citizenry of the CARICOM Region, are prone and accustomed to constant socio-economic crises, however, the Covid 19 Pandemic has prioritized the urgent need for Universal Provision of Social Security (S.S.). A 'Poverty of Resources' Developmental Approach1 is now mandatory, as the Pandemic has exacerbated the Poverty of an historically, structurally-impoverished CARICOM People. The Capitalist, neo-liberal, 'Resources of Poverty' Approach (and Residual S.S. Logic) 2 to S.S. Provision via Cash Transfers, Microfinance, Social Funds, etc. do NOT serve to break the CARICOM Persistent Poverty-Cycle. Residual3 (Negative) S.S. Provision, and the Wrong Citizenship (A Vertical Model of CARICOM Citizenship4)thereof, is structurally (& ethically) incapable of eradicating the Poverty of CARICOM People. Negative S.S.

a grounded exploration","Shamlan, Mai Al",2020-12-18,['Okwany  Auma'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The football environment of Bahrain has been suffocating slowly Due to years of improper

light of ongoing reforms to the sports sector overall, this study uses a grounded theory approach
to explore peoples perspectives on football in Bahrain, and their views on the sector.
Things are not all roses, as Bahrain is infamous for having facelift policies only. So, I
checked with people what they thought of this all, and they told me. As a result, I was able
to bring forward some poignant moments shared with me by participants; some of the hopes
and dreams of their youth, and moments of joy or sadness
I hoped to uncover what they had experienced and how the sector presents itself to the
user, highlighting some issues that should be considered for future improvements. These
improvements included the introduction of better procedures to ensure financial stability
and transparency in the club sector, programmes to stem the waste of talent, a regulatory
body for the private sector, and stopping the waste of talent by introducing well thought out
and multi-impacted youth development policy.","['Bahrain', 'football', 'institutional reform', 'national policy', 'sports for youth development', 'private', 'sector']"
"Political marginalisation and persistent poverty in 
Karamoja, North Eastern Uganda","Okoth, Henry Okidi",2020-12-18,['Meskoub Mahmoud'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Researchers, policymakers, and others have often used ecological factors to explain the persistent poverty in Karamoja sub region of Uganda. Through a qualitative methodology, this paper reveals how political marginalization plays a key role in perpetuating poverty in the region as explained by a range of theories such as marginalisation, racial (ethnic discrim-ination), modernization, dependency, and capability approach.
The study draws attention to the politics of resource allocation, political representation, and engagement of the local people to explain how political marginalization in Karamoja occurs and focus is put on the bias government policy towards pastoralism as a determinant of resource allocation. Whilst lack of political representation at top government levels is associated with poverty, the local leaders also have a role to play amidst national political agendas. It assesses if the local people have sufficient voice in the poverty alleviation and development keeping in mind elites capture and hints on whether Karamoja’s economic po-tentials such as availability of minerals (gold and limestone) and tourism (Kidepo national game park and other game reserves) have produced tangible development in the region.
Persistent insecurity is a key factor that contributes to Karamoja’s persistent poverty. The local people are too exposed to external raids from (Turkana of Kenya and Toposa of South Sudan). The government security forces at border points are inadequate because they are deployed according to the priority demands to serve at the AMISOM (Somalia), Uganda’s missions in DRC, Central African Republic, and South Sudan. The LDUs who are charged with responsibilities to protect people and their property are untrustworthy. This results in the rearmament of communities. Other internal causes of insecurity such as cultural practices of raiding to pay dowry or pride and the role of elites/leaders/businessmen are discussed.
The paper investigates the challenges faced by the people of Karamoja in poverty alle-viation and development and it analyses failures from government side, international NGOs, CSOs, role of elites and the local community.
The paper concludes that the persistent poverty in Karamoja is as a result of political marginalisation in terms of limited resource allocation from central government, lack of ap-pointment of people from Karamoja in top government positions vis-à-vis ineffective rep-resentation from local leaders and that the local people are rarely engaged in poverty allevia-tion and development programs leading to their failures. Importantly, the study asserts that the persistent insecurity is to a larger extent a result of government’s inaction to provide a long-lasting solution. After investigating the challenges in poverty alleviation and develop-ment, the paper posits that it is not only the state which has failed Karamoja but also the international NGOs that made the local population develop unprecedented dependency
As a way forward, the study urges government and development partners to drop the anti-pastoral policy: The government to increase resource allocation to the region to influ-ence development by activating capabilities of the region, extend appointment in key and top government positions to the Karamojong as an empowerment tool that will have a trickle-down effect and provide a long lasting security in the region. On the other hand, the NGOs should discourage dependency through promoting self-reliance initiatives in the communi-ties.","['Political marginalization', 'pastoralism', 'resource allocation', 'representation', 'engagement of local people', 'persistent insecurity', 'persistent poverty', 'Karamoja', 'Uganda']"
Policy implementation and state capacity: a case of goods and services tax in Jammu and Kashmir,"Dar, Mohammed Shahid Saleem",2020-12-18,['Tankha Sunil'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The Goods and Service Tax regime, implemented in the union territory of the Jammu and Kashmir with effect from July 2017, has been taken as a case to study the reasons for gov-ernment organizations implementing any new policy reform as per established norms rather than switching to execution mode as per its requirements. The GST is being considered a mage shift in the tax policy of India from the erstwhile VAT structure which was legislated and administered at state level. The implementation of GST on one hand led to fulfilment of political slogan of ‘one nation one tax’ and on the other hand revolutionized the indirect tax system by subsuming fifteen taxes, six national and nine sub-national, into one basket resulting in less compliance, time and administrative costs. However, while the GST policy as such is efficient and information and communication technology (ICT) driven, no atten-tion has been paid to strengthen the tax authorities who have to regulate and administer the same. This study, therefore, assessed the capacity and readiness of the State Taxes Depart-ment to implement the Goods and Service Tax regime in Jammu and Kashmir. This aspect of the Department is assessed by analysing its capacity, agility and structure. The challenges faced by the State Taxes Department on these fronts were studied and corrective measures recommended. To achieve the results, a qualitative methodological approach was adopted by interviewing key informants from the Taxes Departments, Traders, members of Com-merce and Industry Chambers. Quantitative data has been collected form websites of GST Council, Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, Government of India, Finance Ministries of different states to compare the GST collection at national level and in the neigh-bouring states of J&K. The findings of the study revealed that the State Taxes Department, J&K is lacking the capacity to implement GST due to its non-agility as the same is neither properly structured nor having capacity and a specialized service to administer it. Besides, the enforcement mechanisms adopted are too weak to result in deterrence amongst GST evaders. Thus, for successful GST implementation as pr requirement of the policy, the state government needs to restructure the STD as per design of GST law, create specialized taxa-tion service, focus on capacity building of officers of STD and strengthen the enforcement wing of the department.","['Goods and Services Tax', 'Value Added Tax', 'Input Tax Credit', 'Cascading', 'State Tax Officer', 'State Taxes Department', 'Union Territory', 'Central Excise Department']"
Community participation practices and perceptions in stunting reduction: a case study from Tanzania,"Mahuwi, Petro Aurelian",2020-12-18,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research employed the concepts of participation, power relations and downward ac-countability to uncover problems of NGOs in Tanzania in realising transformative commu-nity participation among communities they serve. These concepts were first reviewed in the literature to understand existing contestations of various scholars in the discourse of com-munity participation. There is substantial agreement in the literature regarding problems of NGOs implementing community participation emanating from misinterpretation of partici-pation. Two NGOs implementing community nutrition project were chosen as a case in this study. A semi – structured interview as part of a qualitative approach was used to investigate NGOs’ perceptions of community, their participation practices and how they attempt to empower communities in an effort to achieve transformative community participation. This paper found that NGOs struggle to achieve transformative participation because of limited autonomy due to their over-dependency on donor funds. The prevalent assumptions among NGO staff that development projects are solutions for poor people deprives the community of their power to decide what is important for them. This paper argues that a holistic en-gagement of community members would perhaps enhance more sustainable solutions be-cause the project would tap local knowledge and identify cultural barriers to transformative participation. Finally, taking community as an integral part of the project cycle may reduce NGO biases against community and achieve more transformative community participation.","['Community participation', 'perceptions', 'practices', 'project', 'NGO', 'stunting', 'Tanzania']"

Responding to these, the government has sought to find alternative ways to finance infrastructure with PPPs becoming an interesting mechanism to address these challenges. This study analyses the challenges of PPPs in supporting Sierra Leone’s governance and development so far. Results show that the PPPs' challenges in the country in this respect include China’s in-volvement in the country’s PPPs, access to finances, market forces, and legal-institutional architecture, corruption, and private sector insecurities. In addition, the research findings reveal legislative authority, and accountability and transparency as the major obstacles faced by PPPs when dealing with the Sierra Leone government and Chinese firm CRSG. Conse-quently, the study findings highlight that through upgrading policies to boost local private sector PPP actors and strengthen institution to combat corruption are key measures to counter the exploitive nature of Chinese state-owned construction companies. Further, employing and enhancing effective engagements to foster transparency in PPP’s overall process are vital measures to increase and uphold public trust and interests in delivering public services. Finally, mobilizing private sector finances and private sector involvement in championing for overall PPP project processes are crucial PPP interventions to comple-ment the government’s better solutions to public service delivery. The research concludes that putting all these facts into con-sideration, PPPs will have great potentials as a tool for long-term development of Sierra Leone’s infrastructure.","['Public private partnerships', 'Challenges', 'Concession agreements', 'Infrastructure development']"

"Rethinking humanitarian aid from a postcolonial/decolonial perspective:
shelter policies after the 2010 Haiti earthquake","Fujita, Yuki",2020-12-18,['Ludeña María Gabriela Palacio'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Haiti is often labelled as “the poorest country in the western hemisphere” (CNN, 2010; World Bank, 2020), one of the “least developed countries” (UN DESA, 2018; UNCTAD, n.d.), upholding a certain level of hierarchical relations between the Global North and Haiti. While resources and humanitarian aid have contributed to the country’s recovery from various dis-asters in the past, Haiti always remains as the ‘poorest’, the ‘least developed’ or ‘dependent on foreign aid’.
This research explores colonial forms of domination and power in the humanitarian sector. The research entails a joint perspective of postcolonial studies, decolonial thinking and dependency theories. Synthesizing these three theoretical frameworks, this research pa-per exposes that a) the humanitarian aid sector is not a set of neutral/independent/impartial practices as defined by the humanitarian fundamental principles. Rather it is embedded in the complex politics of power structures and the impacts the social structures of the affected societies; b) through the practices of aid, the hierarchical relations of ‘providers’ and ‘bene-ficiaries’ are perpetuated between the former colonizers and the colonized; c) aid practition-ers see ‘the object’ of aid through the colonial gaze.
Taking the shelter and housing policies after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake as study cases, a critical discourse analysis of policy documents was conducted. This shows that the colonial systems of domination are indeed perpetuated by the means of humanitarian aid, despite the undoubtably good intentions of international organizations providing the aid. First, it turns out that the humanitarian efforts were dominated by the international organizations, in terms of leadership and decision-making, coupled with the exclusion of Haitians from the institu-tional system. The discourses epistemically and decisively construct the Global North as su-perior and Haiti as inferior, by imposing the epistemology of the Global North, by muting

"Beneficiary Lived Experiences of the Senior Citizens Grant (SCG) Programme in Kamuli District, Uganda","Nakajjiri, Racheal Barbara",2020-12-18,['Okwany Auma'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Cash transfers for older persons have been the major social policy in the fight against inequality and poverty among old people in many African nations including Uganda. Despite the overwhelming accomplishment in alleviating poverty as evidence in literature, cash trans-fers have been criticized for failing to incorporate transformative aspects in the relational and subjective wellbeing lives of beneficiaries from their lived experiences. In light of this criti-cism, this research paper investigates the lived experiences of beneficiaries of Uganda’s Sen-ior Citizen Grant (SCG) in terms of social relations and subjective wellbeing. The implica-tions of the SCG on social relations and subjective wellbeing has been scarcely studied by the various research studies that have investigated the impacts of the SCG. To fill in this research gap, this study explores the effect of SCG on subjective wellbeing and social rela-tions of the beneficiaries from the beneficiaries’ viewpoint. The research employed a quali-tative research design, executed through online interviews. The respondents of the interview included 20 SCG beneficiaries and 4 Key informants involved in the implementation of the grant. A research assistant was involved in making initial contact with the respondents, get-ting their informed consent, and also obtaining key informants’ phone contacts for inter-viewing later. The main question data gathered through the interviews was meant to answer was; What are the lived experiences of beneficiaries of the SCG programme in Uganda? The specific research questions that the study aimed to answer in order to fulfill this aim included: How have family and community relations been influenced by SCG?, How has the SCG influenced state–citizen relations? and What are the effects of the SCG on the subjective wellbeing of beneficiaries?. The findings of the study reveal that the SCG’s implementation has several positive effects on the social relations and subjective wellbeing of beneficiaries despite some failures in positively impacting the social relations and subjective wellbeing of beneficiaries. The negative implications included gender conflicts in households, tensions in relationships between beneficiaries and other community members, limited accountability mechanisms and unawareness of the right to social protection among beneficiaries.","['Senior Citizens', 'Social protection', 'Cash Transfer', 'Social Relations', 'Social Pensions', 'Senior Citizen Grant']"

My focus is on the former enclave inhabitants who took Indian citizenship. I argue in this paper that they have acquired legal citizenship but their social rights are not settled completely. The research uses an analytical framework of citizenship in relation to territory, security, identity and rights on the backdrop of political narrative of BJP’s security and territorial concern and their politics on citizenship. This paper discusses the narrative created by BJP in differentiating a Bangladeshi infiltrators against Bangladeshi refugees and its implication on the Land Boundary Agreement. It also analyses the historical trajectory of the enclave formation and its effect on the lives of the new citizens. The research employs Bacchi’s WPR method to dissect the LBA to understand the grounds on which the agreement was signed and the basis on which legal citizenship is provided to the people and its effect on the rights of the new citizens. The findings of the research also suggest that the marginal position of the new citizens remains intact even after getting Indian citizenship as their experiences of citizenship in relation to land rights remain unresolved.","['Erstwhile enclave dwellers', 'citizenship', 'social rights', 'land rights', 'land boundary agreement', 'politics', 'former enclaves of India', 'BJP']"

Based on qualitative interviews with a range of actors in the interventions aimed at protecting children of the streets in Kampala, Uganda, I discovered that there are multiple interpretations of children’s participation, which vary among the stakeholders, thus negatively influencing on the participation of children of the streets in the interventions aimed to protect their rights. Most of the actors seem to support/prefer the collaborative participation approach, with the children showing some preference for the child-led approach. However, the law enforcement support/prefer the consultative participation approach. Moreover, according to the participants, socio-economic factors and systemic/institutional weaknesses restrict the integration of children of the streets’ participation in the interventions aimed at helping them, thus impacting the effectiveness of the interventions. Therefore, the government and other stakeholders in the sector should establish ways of reducing these restrictions in order to enhance children participation, and hence improve the effectiveness of the interventions aimed at helping children of the streets in Kampala and similar contexts.","['Participation', 'children of the streets', 'rights', 'interpretation']"

The argument that the main cause of hunger and food insecurity is lack of food availability has led to various research and debates about the actual causes of hunger in different contexts. Even though reports of Ghana being just 5% food insecure, an important argument against this view is that household level in rural areas who are mostly farmers still experience food insecurity and hunger despite growing crops and even selling these crops in markets., in spite of various initiatives by international and state actors to address food insecurity and hunger, Ghana still experiences these issues. Contributing to studies, regarding the literature covering food insecurity and hunger in Ghana, this paper teases out the nature, patterns, and everyday experiences and struggles of food insecurity as to the livelihoods of rural households in Ghana. The main aim of the paper was to explore how different social groups experiences food insecurity; the different coping mechanisms that are adopted by the rural households in addressing their food insecurity and hunger conditions; and how the mechanisms help in supporting their livelihoods Akobima community.

The sample of the study was composed of small-scale farmers with different characteristics in terms of landholding status and household leadership (male/female) in the Akobima community. The study’s findings showed a high prevalence of poverty and food insecurity in the Akobima community. The findings showed that women and children are the most affected by challenges as most of the youth migrated to the urban cities to seek better livelihoods. Analysing from the perspectives of SRLA the study found that migration, agricultural intensification as some of the coping strategies employed by the community members to supplement their farming activities. Pluriactivities such as wage labour work, were some productive coping strategy. Social coping strategies such as gifts, donations which form part of food insecurity and hunger concept were used by the people. There was notable absence of government interventions supporting the community as most of them depended on themselves and family members for support.","['food security', 'food insecurity', 'rural livelihoods', 'coping strategies', 'rural households', 'hunger', 'Akobima', 'Ghana']"
Evaluating the economic effects of the Ebola Virus Disease in Liberia using a Synthetic Control Method,"Flomo, Amos Z.B",2020-12-18,['Wagner Natascha'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Countries in the Global South are often vulnerable to the outbreak of infectious disease, which impedes economic growth and compromises the economy on an aggregate level. The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa had an adverse correlation on the economies of the affected countries, leading to a scale down in Liberia productive sectors. There are many pieces of literature assessing the effect of the Ebola virus epidemic. Still, there is no general consensus of its effect on the macroeconomy, especially in Liberia. As such, most of these literature findings relied on descriptive characterization and predictions of the Ebola. Nevertheless, this research attempts to contribute to these existing studies by evaluating the macroeconomic effects of the Ebola epidemic on the Liberian economy. Hence, this research uses the synthetic control method (SCM) to assess the Ebola epidemic's impact on the selected macroeconomic outcome variables of interests. The SCM allows us to construct the synthetic counterfactuals by assigning a weight from a donor pool of thirty-nine (39) African countries within the treatment period from 2004-2018. These weighted average forms the synthetic control and compared it to Liberia, thus depicting each outcome variable's trends that reproduces similar characteristics to Liberia before the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic. For effect on each outcome variable, this study finds that the Ebola crisis led to an increase in the inflation rate by 18% and statistically significance at 5%. Due to the Ebola epidemic, Liberia's unemployment rate increased by 0.8%, while GDP declined by negative 0.9%, and GDP growth by negative 4% over time. The study finds that the estimated treatment effect of EVD compromised the fight against poverty as it contributed to a declined in per capita income between $40-$140 and statistically insignificant at 10%. As a result, it can be deduce that there is no economic convergence in per capita incomes because both the treated unit and control group are developing countries, and none could converge in per capita values. Hence, this research overall findings suggests that though the Ebola epidemic negatively impacted these macroeconomic variables, the impact was not substantial as it has been believed.","['Ebola', 'epidemic', 'EVD', 'Synthetic Control Method', 'SCM', 'counterfactual', 'Liberia']"
Assessing the impact of the Fairmined Certification on the well-being of the small-scale miners,"Uribe Martínez, Natalia",2020-12-18,['Pellegrini Lorenzo'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the adoption of certifications. The Fairmined certification is one, between only two, available to certificate responsible and fair practices of the artisanal and small scale mining. One of the reasons behind the growing trend in the adoption of these kind of certifications is that it as a way to improve the livelihood of the small producers or miners involved. Different authors estimate the effect of such certifications in the well-being of certified individuals; however, in the artisanal and small scale mining sector, I do not find any article that asses the effect of the Fairmined certification on the well-being of the certified miners.
First, I propose a Fairmined well-being index following the well-being indices in the literature. My index considers 27 indicators classified in 6 dimensions. These components are not only material well-being but also mental and physical health, labor conditions and subjective well-being. Second, the information for the index is collected through 321 phone surveys to both, certified and non-certified miners in Colombia and Peru. The period of the data collection is from July to November 2020. Then, I find that on average, miners working on a certified mining organization, have a higher well-being level. That means, that miners working on a Fairmined certified mining organization are better-off, by about 4 percentage points, than those who are not part of a certified mining organization. Acknowledging that the results might suffer from selection bias, I re-estimate the effect using propensity score matching, finding that the results are consistent with the previous estimation. Finally, I also ratify the results when I zoom in the components. Fairmined miners are on average better off than non-certified miners in the components of health and safety, social connections and subjective well-being.","['responsible artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM)', 'fair gold', 'sustainable mining', 'Propensity Score Matching (PSM)', 'well-being', 'average treatment effect analysis']"
"Polarization and reintegration of the (ex-)Jihadi
women back into the Dutch society","Egmond, Astrid van",2020-12-18,['Jayasundara-Smits Shyamika'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research investigates the challenges for the reintegration of (ex-)Jihadi women who want to return to the Netherlands by examining how the debate around this issue is shaped by polarization. This debate is characterized by strong binaries: there is a group who is in favour of allowing the (ex-)Jihadi women to return and reintegrate, and there is a group who is against the return and reintegration. Little research has been done to examine the return and reintegration of (ex-)Jihadis in the Dutch context and how it is influenced by polarization. Hence, this research investigates how societal polarization affects the reintegration of female (ex-)Jihadis into the Dutch society. It further analyses how Dutch citizens relate to the decision of the women to join IS and their desire to come back. Additionally, it questions the role of the media in the debate and how it is affected by polarization.
For this research, qualitative research methods have been adopted: semi-structured in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion (FGD) were conducted. To analyse the qualitative data, polarization theorizing and Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) theorizing has been used.
The results revealed that the debate around the reintegration of (ex-)Jihadi women is highly polarized. There is a strong “us-versus-them” narrative in which two camps are facing each other: those in-favour of the reintegration, and those against-return of the women group. The media is an important factor and polarizing tool in this debate. It is drawn to polarizing opinions and binaries, in their coverage it enlarges these opinions thus reinforcing and strengthening polarization. Overall, nuance is lacking in the media. The high level of societal polarization is limiting social and political progress on this issue, after all there is no agreement on the issue of the returning (ex-)Jihadi women. It is highly recommended that the Dutch government attempts to lower the polarization and creates more room for political progress so that a consensus can be reached on the reintegration of the (ex-)Jihadi women.","['Polarization', 'Reintegration', 'Islamic State', '(ex-)Jihadis', 'The Netherlands', 'Returnees']"
Domestic violence against women during Covid-19:  a case study of rural Gwembe Zambia,"Wamututa, Brennan",2020-12-18,['Misiedjan Daphina'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Socio-economic factors contribute to DV against women. The outbreak of Covid-19 brought with its structural changes in the way of life for humans globally. The quarantine and lockdown of countries due to Covid-19 brought with its economic challenges, social distancing, closure of schools, businesses, loss of employment and other socialization chal-lenges. The pandemic exposed the deep rootedness of the already existing societal inequali-ties especially against the weak in society (women, girls, and children). With the patriarchal and institutionalized societal structures that favor male dominance over women, the pan-demic had pinned women to various forms of Domestic Violence (DV) that produced harsh living conditions for women. Women found themselves in lockdowns with men who could have been abusing them and the lockdown could have opened new avenues for exacerbation of DV. The study examined the perceptions about the consequences associated with Covid-19 measures on the prevalence of domestic violence from a human rights perspective. It calls for more legal consciousness and empowerment of women as a mechanism for DV eradica-tion, and establishment of robust helping seeking mechanisms during such moments espe-cially for rural set-ups. While legal statutes and policies have been passed to curb domestic violence, enforcement still remains a huge challenge and hence, there is need for collabora-tion and concerted effort by different agencies to ensure that women enjoy their human rights and freedoms from in-human treatments, discrimination and inequality which will fos-ter legal equality.","['Domestic violence', 'Human rights', 'Gender', 'Covid-19']"
"Passion, Precarity and Inequality?
Working Conditions of Urban Dancers in Colombia","Sabogal Camargo, Angela María",2020-12-18,['Siegmann Karin Astrid'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Cultural and Creative Industries is a growing sector that has been characterised to offer pre-carious working conditions. Nevertheless, as cultural work operates under the complex di-lemma of passion and precarity, there is no clear understanding of how can social policy effectively support the increasing number of workers to overcome these circumstances. Therefore, any social policy that aims to provide protection needs to question how labour precarity is interpreted and managed, and what are the specific demands of the workers.
By using a life history research and intersectional sensitivity, I analysed the working con-ditions of urban dancers in Bogotá from their subjective perspective. Seven participants of a different class, age, race and gender were interviewed using online means, and a digital eth-nography exploration of their social networks (Instagram, YouTube and Facebook) was con-ducted.
With this research, I will argue that it is necessary to problematize the negative conno-tation of labour precarity because dancers experience their work circumstances according to their positionalities and context. The interconnection of different identity markers influences their perception of precarity and the strategies they used to manage it. Moreover, this diver-sity of experiences has revealed an enrooted problem of cultural work inequality. Regarding their demands, social policy should acknowledge their double facet of artist and worker when listening to their need. This is a process that includes addressing issues both for redistribution and recognition.","['Urban dance', 'Colombia', 'Cultural work', 'Cultural and Creative Industries', 'Precarity', 'Cultural Justice', 'Life History', 'Intersectionality']"
The coffee producing women,"Vélez Mejía, Camila",2020-12-18,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The purpose of this research paper is to analyze and understand the triple burden borne by
women coffee producers in the department of Caldas in Colombia and how this burden
increases or decreases according to the socio-economic settings where these women are situated.
Coffee producing women struggle to handle multiple roles of being household heads,
mothers, wives and union leaders. Following an anthropological methodology that comprehensively
covers the different aspects of women's lives through four essays, this research
paper intends to describe the reality of the reproductive, productive and community management
roles of four coffee-growing women and their daughters. The purpose of this study
is to find out how some of these roles are gendered and have a generational change that
intersects with their class. Using qualitative data obtained through interviews, this paper
argues that due to their economic conditions and the power dynamics between genders, some
of these women face poverty and their work goes unrecognized. At the same time, it is argued
that being involved in coffee production has contributed to their agency and empowerment
within and outside the household.","['Coffee producing women', 'Triple burden', 'Productive role', 'Reproductive role', 'Community', 'role', 'Small producer', 'Medium producer', 'Large Producer', 'Class']"
"Three decades of persistent poverty in Nigeria:
a historical-institutional perspective","Uzomba, Chiamaka",2020-12-18,['Chhachhi  Amrita'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The paper navigates a pluri-causal trajectory to explain why poverty in Nigeria persists de-spite relative economic growth and decades of implementing poverty alleviation pro-grammes. Several scholars of poverty in Nigeria enumerate corruption, political instability, unemployment, and poor educational system amongst a few others as the reasons for the persistence of poverty. The paper, however, argues that there is something deeper beyond these factors considered symptoms and hypothesise that certain institutional reasons and historical moments though compounded by these symptoms are responsible for the persis-tence of poverty in Nigeria. Utilising secondary analysis and by adopting a historical institu-tionalist perspective, this paper presents a trajectory depicting that certain historical moments portrayed through critical junctures in Nigeria’s historical timelines left legacies that did not end after the occurrence of the critical juncture but kept reproducing and influencing poverty dynamics. The mechanism of the legacy reproduction exists through institutions and actors within the political, economic and governance structures. The critical junctures discussed in this paper include the military coup in 1966 and the return to democracy in 1999. Through the analysis of economic policies and poverty alleviation/reduction programmes, also taking into consideration an institutional analysis, the paper discusses how the legacies of the critical junctures are visible in the implementation of policies and programmes.","['Poverty', 'Critical Juncture', 'Institutions', 'Historical Perspectives', 'Economy/Economic Policy', 'Political Regimes']"
India’s agro-ecological crisis and debt entrapments: A multi-scalar analysis on the political ecology of indebtedness,"Shelar, Karishma",2020-12-18,['Gerber Julien-François'],International Institute of Social Studies,"High levels of indebtedness and environmental degradation are at the core of India’s agro-ecological crisis, creating extreme forms of marginalisation and agrarian transformations such that it leaves a large part of the population socio-economically and ecologically vulnerable. However, the two phenomenon must not be singled out and understood with a siloed approach. They are intertwined to each and are bringing about deep-rooted systemic shifts which are enforcing extreme forms of inequalities. The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms by which debt and environmental degradation are interlinked with each other such that they have exacerbated India’s agro-ecological crisis. The study identifies three modes of linkages between debt and environmental degradation – dispossession, differentiation, and displacement; the biopolitics of debt; and commodification and financialisation of agro-commodities, in this case, soya. In the process, the study provides an overarching view of the financial landscape of debt rooted in environmental degradation and social relations of exchange – the types of debt, actors and institutions involved and parameters of environmental degradation.","['debt', 'credit', 'environment', 'degradation', 'gender', 'political ecology']"

Indigenous people and women are especially vulnerable population to the dis-ease as well as to the economic and social consequences of the measures taken to cope with the pandemic. This study uses the concepts of vulnerability and resilience to under-stand the social and economic impact for indigenous women in rural Guatemala, as well as to understand how they are dealing individually and collectively with the crisis. The study finds that poverty and informal economy put them at a higher risk, with many facing signif-icant difficulties with food security. Other difficulties along with loss of income include dis-trust, educational difficulties, lack of access to health services and mental health issues. It is observed a disconnect between national policies and with the inability to make decisions and set measures at a local level, which decreased its ability to cope with the difficulties. The coping mechanisms at a household level included using formal employment of one member to support the family, entrepreneurship and growing their own food. At a commu-nity level, it was highlighted the social cohesion through neighbor solidarity as well as orga-nized cooperation and volunteer work.","['COVID–19', 'women', 'local development', 'indigenous communities', 'vulnerability', 'informality', 'livelihood resilience']"
"Becoming a young farmer in Rwanda: aspirations, pathways and challenges","Bukire, Pacifique",2020-12-18,['Shegro Tsegaye Moreda'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study investigates young people’s aspirations and pathways towards becoming farmers and the social structures and institutional challenges on their pathways to become successful farmers and ensure their future in agriculture in Rwanda. Focusing on the Bugesera district, the study specifically investigates how access to agricultural resources, such as land, affects young people’s success in farming as an occupation and employment source. Using semi-structured online interviews with 12 young people who are currently practising farming, their farming journey and experiences were deeply studied to understand how their aspirations and pathways to become farmers have been shaped. Moreover, how young people use their agency to overcome the constraints they face are also investigated in this study.
Young people’s aspirations to become farmers are shaped through doxic logic of aspiration: unquestioned mainstream propaganda transmitted through school, media, and policy and habitus logic of aspiring, constructed by daily life conditions for a given individual’s position in a certain social structure. The study found that young people’s aspirations tend to emerge and are (re)shaped through a life course, and their pathways to becoming farmers are not smooth; it is a long, non-linear process. For some, aspirations start shaping during their childhood formed through relational processes within a family/household. For others, it is a journey they start later after finishing a certain level of education, such as high school or undergraduate studies. The study also identified the key challenges young people face while establishing themselves as farmers; these include access to land and agricultural inputs, poor rural infrastructure including internet access, and lack of farming knowledge and skills. However, young people apply their agency to counter these challenges. Their efforts include farming collectively in groups by pulling resources and sharing farming knowledge on social media platforms. The study suggests that governmental and non-governmental actors engaged in promoting young people’s employment in agriculture should focus on addressing the key identified challenges young people face to ensure that young people have a future in agriculture.","['young people', 'farming', 'aspirations', 'pathways', 'challenges', 'Rwanda']"
The politics of land based agricultural concessions and rural development: a case of Sime Darby Plantation in Western Liberia,"Cooper, Roosevelt Gbamie",2020-12-18,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Post-war Liberia has experienced a wave of large-scale land agricultural concessions in recent years. In principle, the goal is to transform rural livelihoods and promote economic growth through jobs creation and infrastructural development. However, those large-scale land con-cessions have not met the expectations of job creation and economic empowerment. Instead, public reactions to those concessions operations have threatened the peace and stability of the state. The disenchantments engulfing concession plantations in the country can be at-tributed to many factors, ranging from economic, environmental to social. Many authors have reflected on these issues, not enough studies have focused on the strategies and modes of design and award of these concession agreements. This study explored state-investors strategies in the design and award of concession contracts which led to continued protesta-tions and conflicts between local communities and the concessionaries.
The research focused on the agricultural land concession between Government of Liberia and the Malaysian-based Sime Darby Plantation Liberia (SDPL). It argues that the conces-sion lacks public support because the State ignored basic principles of good governance in the design and award of the concession agreement. To substantial my argument, I adopted qualitative method to gather the perspectives of stakeholders on the concession design and negotiation. I further used four principles of good governance to analyse the findings in line with relevant literatures. The conceptual framework used in this study presents the four di-mensions as: participation, transparency, accountability, and legitimacy. These dimensions are based on what is require in the Public Procurement and Concession Act (PPCA) of Li-beria. The Findings indicate that not adhering to these principles in concessions arrangement can have negative implications on the relationship between local communities and Conces-sion Companies.","['Liberia', 'Large-scale land acquisition', 'land policy', 'concession agreement']"

Using the principal-agent relationship as a key analytical tool, it assesses the impact of technologies in correcting information asymmetries and reducing the transactional costs in the scrutiny of public information. Through the analysis of primary qualitative data, it elucidates how CSOs are contributing to solve collective action problems and what are their incentives to do so. This paper intends to contribute to the literature about the impact and challenges faced in the use of digital technologies in anti-corruption efforts held by civil society to encourage government accountability. It also adds some elements to understand the effect of transparency regulations, and it is suggested that the disclosure of information, despite being a crucial tool for the reduction of information asymmetries, is not enough to keep governments accountable. The discussion is based on two case studies that involve the experiences of CSOs using digital technologies for accountability initiatives. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for the country aimed at potentiating the use of public information and digital technologies.","['Digital technologies', 'civil society organizations', 'transparency', 'accountability', 'collective action', 'Mexico', 'information asymmetries']"

at UN Peacekeeping Operations:
A case study of MINUSCA through a feminist lens","dos Santos, Andiara Valloni",2020-12-18,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Since the approval of United Nations Resolution 1325 in 2000, gender perspectives have started to play a significant role in processes of peacebuilding and peace-transformation within UN peacekeeping. According to the United Nations, working towards gender equality is one of the keys to constructing a better and a just peace. The contribution of this perspec-tive to Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs) is to highlight different roles played by women and men in societies and the disproportional violence that women face, in conflict situations. The gender perspective points to the importance of incorporating women into the military and other components of PKOs, emphasizing the significance of women in decision-making. Resolution 1325 was implemented as part of the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). Under Brazilian Captain Márcia Braga, who worked as a gender adviser in the mission from 2018 to 2019, a gender perspective was implemented in all components of the mission: civilian, police and military. The focus of this research is to analyse, from a critical feminist perspective, the possibilities and limits of the gender perspective developed by the UN in PKOs and to examine the limits and possibilities of the role of a gender adviser. This will be done through the case study of MINUSCA.","['Resolution 1325', 'Women', 'Peace and Security', 'Peacekeeping Operations', 'Central African Republic', 'MINUSCA', 'Hybrid Missions', 'Feminism', 'Gender Mainstreaming']"
The accusation of elderly women as witches in Nigeria,"Bello,  Omolara Sarah",2020-12-18,['Stapele Naomi van'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The research draws on the feminist approach to witchcraft accusations and employs the con-cepts of power and intersectionality in exploring the causes of witchcraft accusations and persecutions and the social and economic effects on the lives of elderly women in the Otta community in Nigeria. Mostly elderly women with poor economic backgrounds and low social status in the community became the main targets of witch hunts and persecutions in the community.
From this, I have argued that poor socio-economic status of the women, their age, gen-der, coupled with the social and economic inequalities in the country and the study areas creates room for people to target and accused the elderly women as witches. In so doing the accusers blame the women for social happenings, hardships, and failures in the society. This situation tends to impact negatively on the social and economic lives of the elderly women and the progress of the country at large. The socio-economic effects on the women are seen in terms of long-term marginalization, stigmatization and discrimination of the women, psy-chological trauma, displacement of the women, as well as the loss of properties, loss of their means of income which is important for their livelihoods and retards economic progress and development.","['Witchcraft', 'Women', 'Power Relations', 'Intersectionality', 'Gender', 'Social Status', 'Economic Effects', 'Social Effects', 'Otta Community', 'Nigeria']"

The main concern is whether the selectively provided cash resources have an effect on the social networks of the beneficiaries. Throughout the research paper, wellbeing is used as a discursive space to look at the often neglected non-material impacts of cash transfers. Particularly, the research looks at the cash transfer programme, examining its implementation in practice and how social relations influence its effect on the wellbeing of cash transfer beneficiaries. Using a qualitative analysis approach, the findings highlight important but diverse effects of cash transfers on relational wellbeing. While effects show opportunities for social capital gains within benefiting communities, they also reveal perverse effects largely arising from targeting issues.","['Cash transfers', 'social relations', 'wellbeing', 'social capital', 'social networks']"

A case study of Yabacon in Nigeria","Manya, Victoria Ojoagefu",2020-12-18,['Gomez Georgina'],International Institute of Social Studies,"There is a significant gap in the conceptualization of entrepreneurial ecosystems in developing
economies of Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite its prominence and recognition as a global
phenomenon, prominent research on entrepreneurial ecosystems maintains a central gaze on
advanced economies in the Global North, with Silicon Valley in California as the inspiration.
Only in recent times have a few promising strands of literature emerged with a focus on
strategies to build entrepreneurial ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa. These studies come
without references to the unique dynamics of ecosystems in institutionally challenged economies
of sub-Saharan Africa. In the present study, I adopt an exploratory analysis of the
software ecosystem in Yaba, Lagos, as a case study to underline traditional and unique elements
that provide support to start-ups within the ecosystem. These distinctive elements
such as protection from police brutality, a positive reputation, private learning centres and
informality, exist as meso-level support to complement the traditional elements of the entrepreneurial
ecosystem. Drawing upon existing literature on the formal-informal dichotomy, I
further present informality as a unique element from which formally registered start-ups derive
sustainability strategies. I contend that informal practices are institutionally preconditioned
choices, caused by the abdication of the government’s responsibilities and exacerbated
by counterproductive state interventions. I contribute a scaffold adapted from Mazzarols
(2014) ecosystem framework to depict the core and peripheral elements that provide support
to start-ups within the ecosystem. From this, I deduce an elliptical illustration of formality

In exploring a slice of this socio-ecological complexity, it particularly addresses how class and gender mediate and shape (and are shaped by) political reactions “from below” in the contestation dynamics, how and why they are undertaken. It uses a framework of feminist political ecology, a loosely configured qualitative research tra-jectory of gender/feminist studies, agrarian political economy, and political ecology. The study is carried out by examining the case of Lapangan Tembak, Besitang, North Sumatra. Based on a border delineation during the Dutch colonial era, Gunung Leuser National Park (GLNP) claims that Lapangan Tembak is under its unit of management. However, the claim is contested as different groups of local community use the land for oil palm plantations, farms, and settlements. In response to the eviction attempts and conservation partnership program done by the GLNP to discipline its borders, local community members engage in various political reactions “from below”. Much of the pre-existing literature often analyses separately the relationships between (1) agrarian and environmental dimensions and (2) gender and class. Hence, this study contributes to a more nuanced understanding by addressing those two sets of interconnections. In doing so, it uses primary empirical materials based on ethnographic-oriented fieldwork done by two research assistants and combines them with secondary data and literature.","['gender', 'class', 'agrarian-environmental contestation', 'political reactions “from below”', 'conservation', 'capitalism', 'Gunung Leuser National Park (GLNP)', 'oil palm', 'plantation', 'Indonesia']"
What’s mine is dine? Investigating the relationship between cultural identity and autonomy over food chains in Barbados,"Nichols, Cara",2020-12-18,['Gerber Julien-François'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research serves to investigate the link between cultural identity and securing autonomy over local food chains. It first documents the change in food consumption patterns in Barbados since the 1950s analyzing the geo-political climate that facilitated such a change. Secondly, it explores the link between food culture and development in the agriculture industry, presenting the tension between utilizing a concept such as culture which is constantly being defined and redefined by the individual and the collective. Lastly, it utilizes corporate food regime analysis as a lens to assess the structure of the agriculture industry in Barbados. It questions whether cultural identity shaped through food should be considered in the development of the agricultural industry, working from the premise that this consideration can ensure sustainability meaning that it caters to the economic, social and environmental needs of the country and its people. Presently, Barbados aims to reduce the food import bill by increasing local production and thus ensure national food and nutrition security therefore increasing ownership of the food supply chain. Using qualitative ethnographic methods, the paper follows three generations of the maternal line of a middle-class Barbadian family documenting their relationship with food from childhood to adulthood. It also draws upon the knowledge of key cultural figures in the form of structured interviews who discuss the Barbadian identity as it relates to food. Moreover, structured interviews were conducted with cultural academics, representatives from organizations such as Farmers’ Empowerment and Enfranchisement Drive (F.E.E.D) spearheaded by Barbados Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation and Barbados Agricultural Management Co. Ltd organizations tasked with the running of the agriculture sector.","['culture', 'identity', 'autonomy', 'agriculture', 'food security', 'food regime analysis', 'corporate food regime', 'foodways']"
Understanding the implications of land grabbing for rural women in northern Ghana: Case study of the daire community in Savelugu-Nanton district,"Essel, Gloria",2020-12-18,['Shegro Tsegaye Moreda'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper examined the gendered implication of land grabbing in northern Ghana focusing on the Diare community in the Savelugu-Nanton District. Over the past decades, land grabbing across Ghana have attracted scholarly research and policy debate on the adverse impact of land dispossession on local communities. However, despite the limited research the implication of land grabbing for livelihood of socially differentiated local communities may have been far more complex than often assumed. Using semi-structured interviews with purposively selected 12 participants, this study examined how and to what extent the lives and livelihoods of different women based on their marital status, age and class have been affected by localized process of land grabbing. The study identified that the current processes of land grabbing are characterized by forceful eviction and dispossession of women of their lands. As a result of land grabs, women reported experiencing a decrease in their food security, loss of livelihoods, and loss of incomes. As customary institutions that privileged men as owners of land remain crucial within the study community, women tend to be underrepresented in terms of negotiations in land deals. There exists a gendered power relation in the community that shapes women’s exposure to land grabbing.

The study concludes that by intersecting with existing patriarchal gender relations, land grabbing in the Diare community further excludes and marginalizes women from access, control and transfer of lands and other resources.","['land grabbing', 'rural women farmers', 'livelihood', 'gender inequality', 'gender power relations', 'Diare']"
Labor movement responses to the Indonesian Omnibus Law,"Saifullah, Aip",2020-12-18,['Borras Saturnino M.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In the middle of the pandemic in 2020, the Indonesian government pushed aggressively for the passage of a new national law on economic investments, consolidating various legislative initiatives in the past into one comprehensive investment legislative bill. It touches on wide-ranging economic themes, from labour to environmental issues, with the overarching agenda of making Indonesia a much more investment friendly country than before. It relaxes many regulations related to labour and environment that were perceived to be disincentives in doing business in the country. With the vigorous endorsement of President Joko Widodo, it got passed into law later in 2020. It is called the Omnibus Law. The business sector praised it. The environmental and labour groups have more complicated relationship with President Widodo who was elected into power with early populist support, including among civil society organizations, including environmental and labour movements. How did the labour movements that used to be friendly to and supportive to Jokowi (the popular nickname of the president) react to the Omnibus Law?","['labor movement', 'Omnibus Law', 'neoliberal populism', 'economic development', 'pandemic', 'Indonesia']"
"Towards country ownership?: 
an analysis of donor-commissioned evaluations of aid programs and projects in the Philippines","Gatdula,  Mark Justine B.",2020-12-18,['Bergh Sylvia'],International Institute of Social Studies,"It has been more than a decade since the development community declared in Paris that aid could and should work, and along with it came the recognition that country ownership is necessary in realizing that goal. Although international assistance has since shifted to empha-sizing the importance of this dimension, it is still not being fully espoused in development evaluation, specifically those commissioned by donors. The study endeavors to determine the extent the Philippine government – a long-time recipient of aid – owns and influences donor-commissioned evaluations. The study investigates the main dimensions of evaluation practice wherein political influences may either or allow country ownership to take place: evaluation purpose and intended use, evaluator, and methodology. The analysis involves the review of 90 ex-post evaluation studies commissioned by the top aid donors in the Philip-pines from 2010 up to present, and used the impact evaluation of the Kalahi-CIDDS pro-gram conducted by the Millennium Challenge Corporation as a case study to elucidate the politics involved in donor evaluations. A mix of quantitative (descriptive statistics) and qual-itative (key informant interviews, desk review) was employed to provide a robust empirical analysis. The study finds that the Philippine government’s ownership and influence in these evaluations are limited due to a confluence of factors. While both donors and the Philippine government share a common purpose for and intended use of evaluations, the dominant practices of donors limit the actual use of evaluation results for their own organizational needs. Donors also predominantly enlist in-house consultants or heavily rely on foreign ex-pertise to conduct evaluations. Finally, donor evaluations remain conventional in its use of positivist methodologies (such as surveys and experimental designs) in evaluations, and have not yet transitioned to the use of participatory approaches which embody the principle of ownership more. Challenges of the Philippine government and donors, and recommenda-tions to address them are likewise provided.","['Official Development Assistance', 'Impact Evaluation', 'Country Ownership', 'Paris Declaration', 'JICA', 'Asian Development Bank', 'World Bank', 'USAID', 'Philippines']"
"Coping strategies of peasant widows: a study of the economic and social contributions of peasant widows to the socionatures of Sirigu, Upper East Region of Ghana",Akasise. Gabriel Azoewine,2020-12-18,['Harcourt Wendy'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Women living in Sirigu are faced with discrimination as a result of gender power relations that mark this patriarchal peasant society. Widows in Sirigu are the worse affected who experience a high level of social disconnectedness, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and stimatization as they struggle to deal with grief of loss and the livelihood challenges that confront them in taking care of themselves and their families, particularly because widows do not inherit the properties of their deceased husbands. The study aimed to identify and analyze the livelihood coping strategies of peasant widows in Sirigu using two conceptual approaches. Using the concept of sustainable rural livelihoods, the study found that pluriactivities such as basket weaving, pottery making, firewood fetching were key sources of livelihoods that enabled them to supplement their work as peasant farmers. Using insights from Feminist Political Ecology the study expanded the understanding of livelihood issues to look at the everyday emotions of peasant widows and socio-natural relations. The findings emerged from in-depth narrative interviews with a selection of peasant widows, paternal orphans, and community leaders in Sirigu. The findings showed that rural poor peasant widows have a range of coping strategies that enable them to navigate their livelihoods as well as social needs that shaped their everyday lives access to resources and relations to the environment, society and culture (described as socio-nature in the study). These coping strategies are defined in the study as personal, social, productive, community and environmental. The findings also showed that churches, non-governmental organisation were key supports to peasant widows though these were not studied in detail.","['sustainable rural livelihoods', 'feminist political ecology', 'peasant widows', 'Sirigu', 'livelihoods coping strategies', 'pluriactivities']"
"Left behind: 
implications of voluntary standards for local producers in the pineapple value chain in Ghana","Agbeko, Josephine",2020-12-18,['Knorringa Peter'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Research on the voluntary standards within global production networks shows a divergence between the argument that voluntary standards can effect positive economic and social change for local producers and the argument that they are a neoliberal tool that furthers the interests of powerful corporate actors. This study proceeds with an empirical examination to clarify the particular implications of voluntary standards for local producers within the certi-fied pineapple value chain in Ghana. The study undertakes an investigation of local produc-ers’ relationship with the governance structure(s) present, the position of the voluntary stand-ards therein, the institutional mechanism(s) that enable or hinder value chain development, and the implications of these for local producers. Literature reviewed covered extant dis-course on the subject, as well as an integration of the Global Value Chain Governance and the Institutional Analysis and Design frameworks. The research adopts a qualitative research technique and employs semi-structured interviews for primary data. It leverages insights from leading actors to conduct an empirical analysis and present credible insights. The re-search findings reveal that for the certified pineapple value chain, voluntary standards poten-tially effect positive outcomes for local producers. However, they are currently embedded within a captive governance system, characterized by insufficient market access, presence of an institutional void; restricted economic upgrading and a deficient social upgrading mecha-nism.","['Voluntary Standards', 'Ghana', 'Pineapple Sector', 'Global Value Chain Governance', 'Institutional Analysis', 'Local producers']"
"Gendered land rights and intersectionality:
experiences of Acholi women in northern Uganda","Amony, Winifred",2020-12-18,['Shehada Nahda'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Land is very vital in enhancing women’s livelihood and food security, thus the need for the protection of women’s land rights. However, women often experience discrimination in relation to land access, ownership, use, and control despite efforts to protect their land rights. This has led to gender inequality in the ownership and access of land in the Acholi commu-nity. This study examines the experiences of discrimination faced by women in accessing their land rights under the customary tenure system in the Acholi community in Northern Uganda. The study is an analysis of secondary data using the concept of intersectionality and gender.
The findings indicate that the intersection of gender and other axis of marginalisation such as marital status and socio-economic situations of Acholi women play a great role in determining women’s access, ownership, use, and control of customary land. In addition to that, the study also shows that gendered practices of institutions such as the state, family and customary institutions reinforce the discrimination face by women in the access and owner-ship of customary land. The study argues that women’s discrimination and gender inequality not only exist in the access and ownership of land but also in land management. Women are deprived of their rights to poses land through gendered practices of inheritance and the mis-use and misinterpretation of customary laws and traditions in a way that favours their male counterparts. Besides women also face challenges of discrimination due to their high illiteracy level, lack of knowledge about existing legislation, and their property right, socio-economic situations, polygamy, power relations in households, limited presentation and participation in land tribunals, conflict resolution and decision making and the existence of legal pluralism where customary laws operate alongside statutory laws. Furthermore, inadequate knowledge about women’s property rights by men, negative perceptions and stereotypes towards women’s, outdated customs, and conflicting interests have also been seen to disadvantage women and create the gender gap in access and ownership of customary land in the Acholi community.","['women', 'land rights', 'customary tenure', 'discrimination', 'gender', 'intersectionality', 'ownership access', 'control', 'Acholi', 'northern Uganda']"
"Sex work and ‘exploitation’:
understanding how the policy-makers and sex worker organizations define ‘exploitation’ in public discourses about sex work in Spain","Krosch, Tamara Stefanie",2020-12-18,['Siegmann Karin Astrid'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Especially, because sex workers are frequently showcased as ‘exploited’ within policy debates in Spain, this research paper intends to understand how Spanish policy-makers define ‘ex-ploitation’ as opposed to how sex worker organizations utilize the term. The aim of these investigations is to understand how the different ontologies of ‘exploitation’ affect the fram-ings of sex work(ers). Hence, this research paper starts by deconstructing common public discourses on sex work with regard to their core assumptions. Specifically, to break the vi-cious cycle, wherein politicians, sex workers, academia, feminists and other spectators get lost in dichotomous debates about sex work, this research paper will offer a novel approach to inspire target-group oriented policy-changes. More precisely, this research paper addresses the following questions: 1) How have policy-makers defined ‘exploitation’ during the Spanish general elections in 2019 and how does their framing differ from that of sex worker organi-zations in the months prior to the general elections? and, 2) What are the implications for the protection of sex worker’s rights under new policy frameworks? Drawing on the toolbox of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this research paper will offer a range of linguistic anal-yses, which demonstrate that policy-makers’ framings coincide with a sexual and identity politics, whereas sex worker organizations’ framings indicate a need for epistemic justice, the combatting of stigmata and the regulation of sex work as a labour.","['sex work', 'exploitation', 'policy-making', 'frame theory', 'critical discourse analysis', 'Spain']"
Chola Contravisual Contemporary Peruvian feminist narratives of re-existence and liminality,"Collantes Tirado, Johana del Pilar",2020-12-18,['Icaza Rosalba'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This Research Paper has two main purposes: firstly, to locate Chola Contravisual feminist collective in the context of feminism in Peru and secondly, to explore the contemporary Peruvian feminist narratives from Chola Contravisual autonomous collective thoroughly. The paper is epistemologically and methodologically informed by approaches derived from the-ories of the margins: decolonial theory and decolonial feminist approaches, these theories are based in modern-colonial spiral logics. Within these logics, modernity understands the world from a Western epistemology, ontology and axiology; creating binaries and neglecting other ways of knowing, thinking or doing; and, coloniality is a logic of erasure and rejection of those other worlds and knowledges that do not belong to a modern conception of the world and human beings. Initially, these theories are combined with feminist autoethno-graphic approaches, while the author is attentive to the impossibility of objective social sci-entific research or strong objectivity (Harding 2005). Moreover, to navigate Chola Contravisual narratives, this research made use of sensing-thinking practices (Leyva 2018a), storytelling (Motta 2016) and it finally created an ‘otherwise’ methodological approach attentive to the author’s positionality and the other practices-knowledges learnt in collaborative work with the collective’s members, as well as in the exploration of their audiovisual work. Similarly, six online encounters were held with Peruvian feminists belonging to different streams: NGOs, advocacy and public policy, academia and other contemporary feminist collectives; for the purpose of setting the context relaying on primary and secondary data. Two main findings emerged from this research: firstly, the contemporary plurality of Peruvian femi-nisms existing in Peru discloses a response to counter a modern-colonial Peruvian state that keeps maintaining social hierarchies and marginalisation (inherited from colonial times) over Peruvians, especially women and sexualised bodies; secondly, Chola Contravisual transgresses the coloniality of gender (intricated oppressions related with gender, sexuality, race and class) by enfleshing feminist ‘otherwise narratives’ of re-existence and liminality. Re-existence means the possibility to engage with art in order to defy subaltern subjectivities and modern-colonial binaries that locates their existences as inferior and the possibility of social transfor-mation (Alban 2009). Meanwhile, liminality refers to the way the collective’s members lo-cated themselves beyond the confines of the modern understanding of the being, the body and the sexuality in binary terms, they treasure their ancestrality and reject to become modern selves nor to be considered the non-beings of modernity (Anzaldúa 2009, Motta 2018a); they inhabit an ‘in-betweenness’ identity that is disclosed in their audio-visual work and cultural projects. This identity is the starting point for a decolonial project, and the other knowledge-practices interweaved throughout this research.","['Liminality', 're-existence', 'resistance', 'coloniality of gender', 'colonial wound', 'healing', 'decolonial feminism', 'otherwise narratives', 'other knowledge-practices', 'decolonial aesthesis', 'decolonial methodologies', 'decolonial research']"
Student perspectives on intercultural classrooms in higher education in the Netherlands,"Kos, Harriet",2020-12-18,['Biekart Kees'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper aims to give an insight in how students perceive their intercultural study setting and their position in it. It strives to provide insight in the learning processes, both regarding the designed, planned curriculum and the coincidental, spontaneous moments of learning. Students who choose an international study experience almost all have an idealised image of becoming part of a global academic community, whether or not fuelled by the promotion of universities. By analysing learning experiences of students in intercultural learn-ing environments in the Netherlands, this research demonstrates how the other students and the study environment play an essential role for most participants.
In addition to choosing a specific field of study, the intercultural study environment is important and ""learning from and with each other"" is perceived as a major added value. During their study period, almost all students experience obstacles related to being part of a diverse group in the academic environment or in their personal living environment. The difficulty of collaboration in group assignments rises in direct proportion to the group’s di-versity. Opinions differ about the way in which they learn from this and to what extent they are equipped (by the university) to apply these encounters as learning moments.
The two research environments, EUR/ISS and RUAS/IB, have similarities, but also differ greatly in their approach and considerations in the field of intercultural education. This research covers both approaches and explains the differences and possible reasons. At EUR/ISS many of the students indicate that they miss the explicit guided learning in the field of dealing with differences and (intercultural) conflicts. Contrasting this, at RUAS/IB a lot of attention is paid to this in the curriculum and by the staff, despite it often not being highly valued by the students surveyed. EUR/ISS students mainly learn to interact informally with students from all over the world, although the strongest relationships often remain those with fellow students from their own region / language area. Their acquaintance with the Netherlands and the Dutch remains limited. The opposite is true for the international stu-dents in the RUAS/IB program, they are a minority in the (English-speaking) student groups and are often used to impart more cultural awareness to mainly Dutch students.
In the context of increasing intercultural awareness, as also envisaged in the UN Sus-tainable Development Goals, it is worth seeking out ways of global learning that suit indi-vidual students with all their different perspectives. This paper hopes to contribute to that by providing potentially relevant insights.","['Intercultural learning', 'diversity in Higher Education', 'diverse global classrooms', 'sense of belonging']"
"Healing old wound of mass violence:
the resurgence of local tradition as reconciliation efforts in East Nusa Tenggara","Kusumawardhani, Karina Larasati",2020-12-18,['Jayasundara-Smits Shyamika'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Late 1965 marked the beginning of anti-communist purge in Indonesia, resulting in millions of people killed, arrested, tortured, exiled, marginalised, and stigmatised. It becomes the beginning of the New Order era under Soeharto, known for its vast development of the country. Notwithstanding the economic growth, human rights violation and mass violence continuously happened. Even during the post-authoritarian Indonesia, the chain of silence has not ended. A half-decade later, people with lived experience of the tragedy are still living in trauma, with most of the victims and perpetrators forced to live side-by-side. Despite the suppression to address the issue, the indigenous people of Sikka in East Nusa Tenggara commenced a customary ritual called Gren to enforce a healthy relationship that once damaged. By framing the ritual of Gren as an alternative paradigm for reconciliation, this research explores the narrative of ecological reflexivity behind the peaceful initiatives. Through in-depth interview and interpretative analysis of symbols, components, and narratives on how the indigenous people perceived Gren, this research surf into the collective healing and its exteriorisation process. It then allows to shed light on how Gren gives a holistic set of understanding on prolonging peace that involves a nexus of human-human and human-nature relationship.","['1965 Mass Violence', 'Ritual', 'Restorative Justice', 'Peace Ecology']"
Take us seriously: the  lack of meaningful child participation in the design process of Child Friendly Integrated Public Spaces in Jakarta (RPTRA),"Patawala, Michael Willy",2020-12-18,['Arts Karin CJM'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The primary objective of this research is to investigate the lack of an enabling environment for meaningful child participation in the design process of the Jakarta Child Friendly Inte-grated Public Space Initiatives (RPTRA). I employed a Child-Centered Participatory Ap-proach (CCPA) involving 19 children (from RPTRA Jaka Teratai, RPTRA Cipinang Besar Utara, and RPTRA Anggerek) as well as 20 adults who worked with these children in the RPTRA design process. The research findings confirm that the lack of an enabling environ-ment for meaningful child participation in the RPTRA design process was triggered by a lack of understanding of child participation among both the children and adults involved. This manifested in various issues including: discrimination in child recruitment; failure to enable equal participation for children from marginalised groups such as children with disabilities; and adult-dominated decision-making causing manipulation of the process and tokenistic child participation.
To address the failure to realize meaningful child participation in this kind of RPTRA activities, I argue for the child rights duty bearers involved in RPTRA to develop a compre-hensive policy aimed at creating an enabling environment for meaningful child participation. This policy should revolve around five holistic elements: raising the awareness of children and adults about children’s rights using creative campaigns as well as capacity building; uti-lising non-discrimination values; providing a monitoring and evaluation system for children; employing a task-based method that is friendly and fun for children; and developing a col-laborative decision-making approach between adults and children.","['Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)', 'Child Rights-Based Approach (CRBA)', 'Child-Centred Participatory Approach (CCPA)', 'Meaningful Child Participation', 'Child-Friendly Public Spaces', 'RPTRA Jakarta', 'Indonesia']"

The historically Black neighborhood of West Oakland is particularly affected, as many white elites and investors have identified it as a place to ‘rehabilitate’ older houses or industrial buildings. In this research paper, I use discourse analysis methods to analyze West Oakland real estate advertisements (written ads, photographs, and video tours of the houses) in order to ‘make strange’ colonial, racialized, and gendered narratives that have been made ‘mundane’ by modern and Eurocentric ways of knowing. I analyze discourses such as the ‘urban frontier,’ (re)development, and exoticization, using a content analysis and critical discourse analysis approach and drawing from lenses that include thinking-from-Oakland, post-development, gender, and other work on the ‘urban frontier.’ I argue that ‘urban frontier’ representations of West Oakland are used to justify economic ‘development’ and racialized displacement; portray the ‘urban pioneer’ as a benevolent masculine hero of Eurocentrism; and construct the neighborhood as an ‘authentic’ experience for the consumption of elite, white outsiders. Market and state institutions stand to profit by this selling of a particular representation of ‘home’ and ‘inhabiting.’","['Housing', 'racialization', 'gender', 'gentrification', 'displacement', 'urban pioneer', 'urban frontier', 'exoticization', 'development', 'post-development', 'urban renewal', 'investment', 'frontier thesis', 'real estate', 'discourse analysis', 'Oakland', 'West Oakland', 'San Francisco Bay Area']"
Intersectional vulnerability and resilience: Syrian male refugee textile workers in Northwestern Turkey,"Özdemir, Merve Merih",2020-12-18,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The arrival and significant increase of the population of Syrian refugees in Tur-key in the last years, brought the issue of their survival as a big community in a new country. By being an important country about textile sector for the West, refugees started to engage with textile work in Turkey. Since the Northwestern part of the country has prevalence of textile work, many Syrian male refugees engaged with this sector. And therefore, since textile work is very open to vul-nerability on labor rights, the situation may be even harder for Syrian refugees. At this point, intersectionality of being masculine, Syrian, a refugee, and a worker can positively and/or negatively alter Syrian male refugees’ vulnerability. For all these reasons, this paper analyzes the narratives of Syrian male refugee textile workers about their work in the textile industry in Northwestern Turkey, from the perspective of labor vulnerability and resilience, and using the framework of intersectionality.","['Syrian Refugees', 'Turkey', 'Textile Work', 'Labor Rights', 'Intersectionality', 'Labor Vulnerability', 'Resilience']"
"Endless Crossings: 
mapping border-crossing journeys from Venezuela through
Brazilian Acolhida operation’s boundaries","de Almeida, Olívia Andrade",2020-12-18,['Stapele Naomi van'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper is an exploration of the borders and boundaries put in place by the
Brazilian Acolhida operation as mapped out by those who have traversed them coming from
Venezuela. Hegemonic narratives put forth by the media and governmental vehicles have
praised the government’s initiative, yet, fairly little work has taken into consideration the ways
in which it affects Venezuelan migrants and refugees attempting and managing to make their
way into the country. This paper dissects the places where these frontiers were encountered
and the ways in which they were experienced by theoretically grounding the discussions on
critical cartography, immigration governmentality and migration and border studies. To
achieve this, this research’s collaborators and I make use of autoethnographic mapping,
through which stories are drawn onto paper and narrated through words, going over paths
taken from various parts of Venezuela all the way to Recife, Pernambuco. Mapping brings
to the forefront how border-crossing is a highly heterogenous experience, greatly based on
where one is positioned within power structures, allowing refugees to either traverse or be
held back at the operation’s frontiers. Acolhida’s institutional arrangement, multidimensional
background, and bordering practices have generated a framework that this research’s cartographers
have experienced at diversely located borders and boundaries. These definitions are
found to eventually conflate, accounting for their entanglement within the operation’s workings.
Finally, mapping also sheds light on their shapeshifting qualities, and the dynamic and
agentic ways through which refugees perform, adapt or contest them.","['borders', 'boundaries', 'bordering practices', 'migration', 'mapping', 'Venezuela', 'Brazil']"

The qualitative interviews research conducted through online Skype and Zoom Meeting video calls due to COVID-19 travel limitations, analyzes the civil society organizations’ legal mobilisation against the mining activity in the Lower Zambezi National Park for environmental rights protection. Although with different specific areas of environmental concerns, the civil society organizations were concerned about endangered local communities’ livelihoods and animals’ welfare. In a bid to protect the environmental rights, they engaged in strategic litigation involving court case supported by other strategies such as public protests, advocacy, social mobilization, engaging international non-governmental organizations and online media peti-tion.
Despite not outrightly winning the court case, the strategic litigation managed to halt the mining project. The strategy of using different media platforms raised awareness such that many Zambians voices began speaking against the mining project forcing the president to halt the project and promising that he would follow the will of the people. Considering growing environmental catastrophes in Zambia such as droughts and large-scale mining pol-lution rendering land unproductive thereby threatening livelihoods, environmental protec-tion needs to be prioritized.

"Reflecting on Kejawen: 
Javanese esoteric teachings in Indonesian national development","Wasisto, Muhammad Adiz",2020-12-18,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Kejawen as a concept of spirituality arose out of ancient Javanese society. Many Western schol-ars have used the term ‘Javanese mysticism’ to refer to Kejawen teachings, which focus on inward rather than outward religious expression and feeling. Kejawen teaching offers an eso-teric understanding of religion and spirituality, one that seems to circulate mainly outside formal religious traditions. This paper demonstrates the significance of Kejawen teaching in spiritual, psychological, and social development in Indonesia, suggesting it has especial rele-vance to issues of peace and violence. Placing Kejawen in its context, this study shows how after independence, national development in Indonesia was influenced by the esoteric ideas of Kejawen, as portrayed in the national motto “unity in diversity”. This expression resembles the post-independence state ideology of Pancasila. Through analysis of key nationalist texts, themes linked to elements of Kejawen teachings, are identified and analysed in this study. This is done by analysing key texts, including Soekarno’s independence speech of July 1945, Pan-casila itself, and material from more recent social media. The reader will find out more about the need for comprehensive symbolic and resource-based recognition of Kejawen teachings in Indonesian society.","['Kejawen', 'religions', 'esoteric teachings', 'indigenous knowledge', 'spirituality', 'Java', 'nationalism', 'resources', 'recognition', 'Pancasila']"

Trade unions accountability towards securing work-ers interests and security is found to be bleak due to which women attain the lowest position inside the plantation hierarchy. In this study, roles of both trade unions and families is fo-cused on either favouring or restricting a fair representation of women workers. Both public and private spaces are considered to study how different social, economic, political, and his-torical elements affect women workers lives.
This study uses a theoretical framework of patriarchy and gender, sexual division of labour, feminization of labour and intersectionality to uncover and analyse how women workers face marginalization that directly and indirectly shapes their position, thereby limit-ing their political representation. This paper argues that the economic space continues to effect women workers’ political representation due to socio-economic, political, and histori-cal factors. Social space of families though is patriarchal in nature; the level of patriarchal authority is not similar inside the tea garden families of Assam.","['tea plantations', 'Assam', 'women workers', 'intersectionality', 'sexual division of labour', 'patriarchy', 'colonial regime', 'trade unions', 'family', 'feminization']"
Unfolding decoloniality: Interpreting decoloniality through a Bourdieuian perspective while tracing the relationship between art and ethnographic museums,"Zisimou, Damianos",2020-12-18,['Hoebink D.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Social demand for more diverse, inclusive and just cultural institutions is constantly increasing calling museums to intensify their decolonial practices and challenge their colonial legacy. Despite the many decolonial actions museums are already implementing, the meaning of decoloniality and what entails in a museum context is still to be defined. Through 14 in-depth interviews, this qualitative study set out to explore the way the concept of decoloniality is interpreted by stakeholders of art and ethnographic museums in the Netherlands as well as how it influences the relationship between the two. This research approached decoloniality through the prism of the coloniality/modernity research group while it substantiated the value of Bourdieu’s field theory as an analytical tool in decolonial scholarly debates. The study showed that decoloniality is perceived as a novelty and as an external issue for the art field while at the same time, ethnographic museums perceive it as an internal necessity and a logical continuation of their practice. Moreover, the position of museum stakeholders in their field was proved to be determinantal in the way decoloniality was perceived. Established museum stakeholders had a
broader understanding of the term and a more conventional approach when implementing it while less established stakeholders were perceiving it only through the practice of their corresponded field and they were demanding more radical approach. Lastly, decoloniality proved to provide a new stream in the existing collaboration between art and ethnographic museums. The study indicated that museum stakeholders perceives the use of their discourse in a different environment rather cautiously but they are still positive to collaborate between them to the extent their autonomy is not harmed.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'decoloniality', 'perception', 'field theory', 'art & ethnographic museums', 'collaboration']"
Keuzes in toezicht,Marijke Azier,2020-12-17,"['Dr. H. Klaassen', 'Dr. V.M.F. Homburg']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Deze scriptie beschrijft een onderzoek naar de effectiviteit van (toezicht)interventies door de Belastingdienst MKB op compliance (naleving van wet- en regelgeving) bij burgers en bedrijven en de wijze waarop dit effect in beeld is gebracht. Naar aanleiding van het onderzoek worden aanbevelingen gedaan om de effectiviteit van de (mix van) toezichtinstrumenten te vergroten.
Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat beïnvloeding van het nalevingsgedrag niet altijd de reden blijkt te zijn geweest om voor een bepaald toezichtinstrument of andere interventie te kiezen. In een aantal situaties was het doel van toezicht het uitvoeren van een proces om deze goed te laten verlopen en bepaalde ‘aantallen’ te halen (output). Als gedragsverandering ten aanzien van compliance wel expliciet was beoogd, dan was er in de meeste gevallen sprake van gemeten resultaat op korte termijn (impact) of in een enkel geval van effect op langere termijn (effectiviteit). Het is belangrijk gebleken om op voorhand bewust te zijn van het doel wat wordt beoogd met de inzet van interventies en welke (effect)meting hierbij hoort. In het beslisschema op pagina 55 is dit inzichtelijk gemaakt en blijkt ook aan welke voorwaarden moet worden voldaan om effectmeting te kunnen realiseren. Los van het feit dat effectmeting zeer lastig is, is effectmeting niet noodzakelijk als met de inzet van een toezichtinstrument of andere interventie geen bewust effect op compliance wordt beoogd. De gekozen aanpak qua inzet van interventies zal in dat geval waarschijnlijk niet aangepast worden.
Daar waar effectmeting heeft plaatsgevonden was er in alle gevallen sprake van een bewuste aanpak om gedragsverandering te realiseren, was er vooraf nagedacht over het beoogde effect en hoe dit te gemeten zou kunnen worden en er werd gebruik gemaakt van extracomptabele vastleggingen naast data uit bestaande databases. Daarnaast was er sprake van inzet van een ruime mix aan interventies met duidelijk accent op preventie en een proactieve houding: voorlichting, communicatie in de vorm van bellen, brieven sturen en samenwerking met externe partijen zoals fiscaal dienstverleners en brancheorganisaties. Naast de samenwerking met externe partijen werd in die gevallen ook gebruik gemaakt van de ervaringen van belastingplichten en/of belastingschuldigen om interne beelden aan te vullen en de verdere aanpak qua keuzes voor interventies op te baseren.
De conclusie van dit onderzoek is dat er weinig ruimte zit bij de verplichte inzet van toezichtinstrumenten die vanuit de uitvoeringsopdracht in de aangifteregeling of het invorderingsproces worden ingezet, maar dat de toegevoegde waarde en het vergroten

van de effectiviteit van de mix aan toezichtinstrumenten gezocht moet worden in de (aanvullende) instrumenten ‘aan de voorkant’ van het toezichtinstrumentarium. Daar waar een bewuste inzet van (een mix van) interventies heeft plaatsgevonden, vaak vanuit een integrale aanpak, heeft dit geleid tot meetbare effecten ten aanzien van het nalevingsgedrag.",

This view creates a clear distinction between those who have acquired the necessary cultural capital and those who have not. This distinction will be a recurring theme in the investigation of the following research questions:
(1) How can classical music become more appealing to a broader audience? 
(2) How do people with varying levels of music education experience repeated listening to a classical piece?
(3) How are their experiences influenced when they are given an introduction to the piece and the composer, and are invited to listen in a personal way?
(4) How does cultural capital impact the way people engage themselves in music? 
My sample consists of people with varying degrees of music education, whose experiences with classical music I investigate through qualitative interviews and listening diaries. The examination of the research questions has provided different insights. Firstly, that contextual knowledge not only can contribute to and positively impact the appreciation of the music for those who are not acquainted with the genre in advance, but also for professional musicians and conservatory students. Secondly, that the conservatory students are not only engaged in the “highbrow”, analytical way of listening, but also listen in a quite personal way which actually seems to be supported by their theoretical knowledge. Thirdly, that there, regardless of level of music education, occur what I introduce as contextual associations as a part of the listening experiences. And fourthly, that even though insight one and two indicates that individuals with more cultural capital have several things in common with those with less cultural capital, as both groups are engaged in personal listening, and both react positively to contextual knowledge, there are clear differences in how the groups generally engage themselves in music. An example of such differences is the finding that musicians have quite theoretical conversations about music in their everyday lives which creates a sphere where only those who have acquired the necessary knowledge have access. Moreover, I suggest that not only cultural capital within the domain of music, but cultural capital in general, as well as educational level, influence not only how individuals express themselves about their listening experiences, but, potentially also, to some degree, shapes the actual experiences with music. These insights provide knowledge which can contribute to strengthen the connection between the domains of cultural capital and highbrow culture, and the domains of audience development and responses to music, as I find that the link between these two clusters of related domains are currently under-researched.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Classical music', 'Listening experiences', 'Cultural capital', 'Music education', 'Audience development']"
"‘Als een vrouwelijke strijder in de bergen iets zegt, krijgt ze geen quote van Reuters.’ -  Een onderzoek naar Westerse berichtgeving over Koerdistan","Stadegaard, Jesse",2020-12-07,['Aalberts C.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Deze thesis onderzoekt de manier waarop berichtgeving over Koerdistan in de Nederlandse media tot stand komt. De Koerden zijn een grote etnische groep met eigen talen, geschiedenis en cultuur en een wijdverspreid leefgebied, maar zonder land. Het Koerdische volk is misschien verspreid over de hele wereld, maar het begrip van de Westerse media over de situatie in Koerdisch gebied is beperkt. De mediabehandeling van frozen conflicts als dat van de Koerden is onderbelicht gebleven in bestaand onderzoek. Door moderne ontwikkelingen op het gebied van verslaggeving moeten buitenlandredacties en correspondenten het zien te redden met een kleiner budget dan in het verleden. Aan de hand van de ervaring van journalisten en Koerden is onderzocht hoe het nieuws over dit type conflicten tot stand komt. Om de overkoepelende onderzoeksvraag “Hoe komt nieuws over het Koerdische conflict in de Nederlandse media tot stand?” te beantwoorden is gebruik gemaakt van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse van elf interviews met journalisten en Koerden in ballingschap. Het onderzoek is van belang vanwege de invloed die media kunnen hebben op de beeldvorming omtrent deze frozen conflicts. De praktijk is dat de Koerden al ruim een eeuw zwaar te lijden hebben onder moordpartijen, mensenrechtenschendingen en onderdrukking. Toch staat het Koerdische conflict niet prominent op de Nederlandse nieuwsagenda. In de eerste plaats is er vanuit de Westerse pers weinig interesse voor de Koerden als het nieuws geen betrekking op henzelf heeft. In een medialandschap met achteruitlopende financieringen voor buitenlandredacties en correspondenten, wordt er niet veel geld besteed aan diepgaande verhalen. De Koerden zijn in de ogen van journalisten vaak geen volk, maar een militaire mogendheid die meevecht tegen Islamitische Staat. Correspondenten bleken zich vaak te ergeren aan het gevestigd perspectief op zaken in het Midden-Oosten, een perspectief waarin oorlog en Arabieren de boventoon voeren. Hierdoor kunnen gebeurtenissen daar verkeerd geïnterpreteerd worden door de media. Veel correspondenten doen verslag vanuit Libanon, Turkije of Egypte, waar de Arabische of Turkse visie op zaken voorop staat. De Koerdische visie raakt in die zin ondergesneeuwd. Zolang Koerden geen eigen staat hebben, zullen ze ook geen internationaal erkend persbureau hebben en dit maakt Koerdistan geen aantrekkelijke plek voor journalisten om zich te vestigen. Bij gebrek aan eigen ogen in het land waar de redacties over schrijven, zijn deze vaak afhankelijk van het nieuws dat via persbureaus wordt gepubliceerd. Dit heeft dit als gevolg dat nieuws over de regio vaak direct van de Turkse regering komt, het machtigste land uit de regio. Turks president Erdogan probeert de Koerden monddood te houden en berichten van Turkse persbureaus worden vaak 1-op-1 gekopieerd. Europese regeringen hebben meer belangen bij het narratief dat de Turkse regering in stand houdt, omdat op deze manier een veilige onderhandelingspositie ten opzichte van Turkije blijft bestaan: een land dat niet alleen een grote economie bezit, maar ook een tactische ligging ten opzichte van het Midden-Oosten en Europa. Geopolitieke en economische belangen wegen dan ook zwaarder dan mensenrechten als het gaat over de totstandkoming van Westerse berichtgeving over Koerdistan.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Koerdistan', 'frozen conflict', 'berichtgeving', 'Nederland', 'buitenland', 'compassion fatigue', 'persbureau', 'correspondent']"
The rise of nationalism in Europe and its relation to Euroscepticism in Germany and Austria,Michel Vat,2020-11-27,"['Dr. A. Zhelyzkova', 'Prof.dr. M. Haverland']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This research is about the relation between nationalism and Euroscepticism. Within this relation, the case study focuses on identity and the feelings citizens have for one specific European institution: the European Parliament. The research question is: What is the influence of identity feelings on the image European citizens have of the European Parliament? Identity feelings are explained by having an exclusive national identity and voting for right-wing parties. The cases of this study are Germany and Austria, from 2013 onwards. Respectively the AfD in Germany and the FPÖ in Austria are the prominent right-wing extremist parties in these countries. In the research, there is a trend visible between having an exclusive national identity and having negative feelings to the European Parliament. However, there is no correlation with the strength of right-wing extremist parties. In general, when these two cases are juxtaposed, the conclusion can be made that an exclusive national identity correlates with a negative image of the European Parliament. However, it is not clear where these feelings come from and why they relate to this negative image.",

Why does a variety of eco-labels in the fashion industry exist and what are their relative
strengths and weaknesses?","Hofman, T.",2020-11-24,['Dekker E.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Over the last decade or so, the fashion industry has experienced a rise of voluntary
certification schemes that has resulted in over a hundred different eco-labels related to the
textile and apparel sector. They address a range of different social and environmental
criteria, as well as different product groups and life cycle phases. The existing literature on
the economics of certification and eco-labelling in the fashion industry suggest that ecolabels that are able to oversee a rather large part of the fashion supply chain – by
broadening the scope of their certification activities – are able to increase transparency,
traceability and reliability and thus perform better than eco-labels who act out a relatively
narrow scope of activities. However, a typology of eco-labels in the fashion industry based
on the scope of their globalized activities has yet to be established. Such a typology allows
for a comparison of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the eco-labels and enables the
distinction of top performers. Therefore, this qualitative study further looks into why a
variety of eco-labels in the fashion industry exist and what their relative strengths and
weaknesses are. In order to do so, a content analysis was carried out for 24 eco-labels and
their websites in order to establish a typology within the variety of eco-labels as well as a
content analysis of 40 critical news articles and blog posts that enabled a comparative
analysis of their relative strengths and weaknesses. Measuring the ratio between the

Using the qualitative method and through indepth interviews, this study aims to explore how Generation Z perceives the values that various luxury brands promote in their advertising. Previous research has shown that luxury and sustainability are opposites in consumer perception. This research attempts to bring nuance and complexity to the perception of sustainable luxury by conducting a thematic analysis, by exploring the feelings and values of the new generation of consumers. Specifically, the objective is to analyze their perception of CSR communication, with a focus on nine advertising campaigns published on Instagram and YouTube. These advertisements concern

Who belongs where and why? Connecting the 'right' body to the 'right' place,Angelique van Dam,2020-11-19,"['Prof.dr. P. Scholten', 'Prof.dr. W. Schinkel']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Successful resettlement requires a safe place for refugees. Besides the preferences of refugees of certain spaces
and available facilities, municipalities are also interested in a successful match of refugees and space; so much
that they prefer certain categories of refugees over others. Families and highly educated refugees are at the top
of this hierarchy. This research focusses on the allocation process and understandings of a 'right fit' of person
and space during the matching of refugees to a place of residence within the Netherlands.
Bureaucrats that are trusted with the task of selection and matching operate behind a screen basing their
judgement on limited information. Therefore, we call them screen-level bureaucrats. Building on the work of
Lipsky (1980) this study will show that screen-level bureaucrats use their policy discretion in almost all their
cases. Moreover, it will show that stereotyping lies at the basis of the very elaborate stories about persons and
places where screen-level bureaucrats rely their judgements on (e.g. ideas on were gay, families and high or low
skilled newcomers belong).
Through extended interviews (46) and observations (34) over a two-year period on a national, regional
and local level, this study sheds light on the practices of screen-level bureaucrats and the construction of
belonging in the first phase of refugee resettlement in the Netherlands. This study emphasizes the complexity of
interaction in digital space: even without physical contact, imaginaries are constructed, enacted and inflected
that have consequences for the distribution of rights and facilities where social categorisation, stereotyping and
principles of deservingness play an important role. Three dominant imaginaries are distinguishes that enact the
ideas of the fitness of person and place in these policy practices; namely imaginaries of deservingness, risk and
integrability.",

De druk van het samenwerken,Denize Eberhardt,2020-11-04,"['Dr. P. Marks', 'Dr. V.M.F. Homburg']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Nederland kampt met een groeiend aantal tekort aan docenten (Ministerie van Cultuur, Onderwijs en Wetenschap, 2017). Een van de grootste oorzaken hiervan is dat de werkdruk hoog ligt in de onderwijssector (Wit, 2006). Een oplossing om de werkdruk te verlagen kan een samenwerkingsverband tussen collega’s zijn. Samenwerken kan zorgen voor meer efficiëntie en een verdeling van de taken en lasten.
Om de werkdruk te verlagen is in schooljaar 2019-2020 op het Scheepvaart en Transport College (STC) gestart met een pilot van een samenwerkingsverband tussen een mentor en een loopbaanadviseur (LOB’ er) op één klas. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om aanbevelingen te doen aan het STC over de samenwerking, door een analyse van samenwerking op werkdruk uit te voeren. Dit wordt onderzocht aan de hand van mixed methods, een combinatie van kwantitatief en kwalitatief onderzoek waarbij de vraag ‘Wat is de invloed van de samenwerking op de werkdruk van docenten op het Scheepvaart en Transport College?’ wordt beantwoord.
Uit de theorie is gebleken dat samenwerking zowel een positieve als negatieve invloed kan hebben op de werkdruk. Daarnaast zorgt samenwerking voor het veranderen van het takenpakket, wat weer invloed heeft op de werkdruk. Ook hebben de moderators persoonskenmerken en leermogelijkheden invloed op de relatie tussen samenwerking en werkdruk.
Onder de mentoren en LOB’ ers is een enquête uitgezet. Van de huidige 63 docenten (die de rol mentor en/of LOB ’er vorig jaar vervulden), hebben 58 docenten de enquête ingevuld. Derhalve was de response-rate ruim 92%, dit is zeer mooi en aanzienlijk waardoor het een goede representatie is van de populatie binnen STC.
Ook zijn twaalf diepte-interviews afgenomen. Hieruit komt sterk naar voren dat kaders en richtlijnen vanuit het management gemist worden. Door het coderen is er een inductieve bijvangst die aangeeft dat er een extra variabele bij het originele theoretische model hoort. Op basis hiervan zou het nieuwe model ‘kaders en richtlijnen’ en ‘faciliteiten’ als moderators erbij hebben. Ook komt alleen het persoonskenmerk ‘perfectionisme’ na het onderzoek sterk naar voren.
Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat bij hogere samenwerking werkdruk toeneemt, maar als de tijd die de docent kan besteden aan (overige) taken hoger wordt ervaren, dat dan de werkdruk afneemt. Uit de resultaten blijkt er tevens sprake te zijn van een mediatie effect van taakinhoud op de relatie. Er lijkt echter geen sprake te zijn van persoonskenmerken als moderator bij de relatie tussen samenwerking en taakinhoud. De werkdruk wordt hoger ervaren dankzij het samenwerkingsverband tussen een mentor en LOB’ er. Door te richten op de relatie samenwerking-taakinhoud-werkdruk, in plaats van samenwerking-werkdruk, kan getracht worden om de werkdruk te verlagen. Ook kan het beter communiceren, het aanbieden van kaders en richtlijnen, het aanbieden van faciliteiten en vervolgonderzoek een bijdrage leveren aan een verlaging van de ervaren werkdruk onder de docenten op het Scheepvaart en Transport College.",
The use of Twitter by corporations for agenda-setting in the media. The conflict between Transport for London and Uber,Lucas van Lint,2020-11-04,['Dr. H.J.C.J. Hitters'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In September 2017 Transport for London announced that Uber was to lose it license to operate in London. In response the ridesharing company started to actively campaign for their continued existence in the British capital. Other than starting a petition, the company used its Twitter account to actively argue why it should stay operational. At the same time the wider news media, specifically newspapers, started to also discuss these occurrences with seemingly similar talking points as Uber used in its tweets. This study therefore aims to answer the question: Was Uber’s Twitter communication during their London license-crisis effective in setting the agenda to its benefit in major British news publications? To answer this question this study conducts a thematic analysis on the tweets sent by @UberUK over a 7-month period. The discovered themes are thereafter applied to newspapers articles discussing Uber and published during the same period by the UK’s four largest papers. The study finds that both the tweets sent by Uber, as well as the news articles discussing Uber increased significantly right after the announcement by Transport for London. The qualitative analysis also shows that this increase in published tweets and news articles can both be attributed to the discussion of the conflict between Uber and London’s transport authority. Finally, even though agenda setting remains a concept that is difficult to measure, based on the findings in this study we can conclude that Uber was successful in setting the agenda in major British news publications during their London license-crisis. Other than these findings this study provides interesting insights regarding corporate reputation, online activism and stakeholderism.","['Agenda stetting', 'corporate reputation', 'online activism', 'stakeholders', 'Uber', 'ridesharing', 'disruptors', 'Transport for London', 'United Kingdom', 'London', 'corporations', 'regulators', 'social media', 'print media', 'new media', 'old media', 'thematic analysis', 'qualitative research.']"

development discourse. Especially in developing countries, the underfunding gap and inefficient
management processes hinder the implementation of local urban infrastructure projects, especially
in sustainable urban mobility. The consolidation of finance for urban infrastructure also takes
prevalence in the framework of achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The city of
Tirana has a long history of urban mobility planning documents, but these plans almost never come
to light. The reasons behind this lack of implementation might be many, but financial resourcing
and management is an important one. Coming from a recent decentralization experience, the
municipality of Tirana reflects issues in access to urban borrowing, land finance instruments, and
poor financial management. The main objective of this research is to shed light upon the nexus

en de kwaliteit van zorg in relatie tot arbeid te vergroten en te versterken (Van Ark, 2019). Hiervoor is
ingezet op het verbeteren van de samenwerking tussen professionals in de arbeidsgerelateerde zorg.
Het programma start nadat het kabinet concludeert dat er geen draagvlak is voor een stelselwijziging
om de arbeidsgerelateerde zorg te verbeteren (Asscher 2015) Het doel van het onderzoek is de inzet
op samenwerking en hoe de uitkomst verklaard kan worden. Dit is onderzocht aan de hand van het
model dat is ontwikkeld door Ansell Gash ( Dit model is bedoeld om factoren te identificeren
waaronder ve rwacht kan worden dat een samenwerkingsproces slaagt of niet slaagt.
Om de hoofdvraag te beantwoorden is een vergelijkende casestudy uitgevoerd. De eerste case is de
Kwaliteitstafel bedrijfsartsen en verzekeringsartsen. Dit samenwerkingsverband is opgesta rt om
kennis en kwaliteitsbeleid te ontwikkelen en tot een financieringsmodel te komen voor het
structureel kunnen ontwikkelen hiervan. De Kwaliteitstafel is ingesteld omdat een patstelling was
ontstaan over de financiering en actoren in het veld er niet i n slaagden om tot een aanpak te komen
van het vraagstuk. De tweede case is het Platform Arbocuratieve zorg. Dit samenwerkingsverband is
opgestart om kennis en informatie uit te wisselen op het terrein van arbocuratieve zorg. De aanleiding
voor het instelle n van dit Platform is de achterblijvende samenwerking tussen professionals in de
arbocuratieve zorg.
In
het onderzoek komt naar voren dat voor beide samenwerkingsverbanden sprake is van een
geslaagde samenwerking en dat de doelstelling is behaald. Verklar ende factoren voor deze uitkomst
zijn het faciliterend leiderschap en het behalen van tussentijdse resultaten. Deze variabelen zijn
bevorderend geweest voor het samenwerkingsproces.
In dit onderzoek is geconcludeerd dat faciliterend leiderschap en tussent ijdse resultaten bepalend
waren voor het slagen van de samenwerking. Vervolgonderzoek kan zich richten op het prioriteren
van de variabelen in het model. Op deze manier kan onderzocht worden welke factoren uiteindelijk
doorslaggevend zijn.

wordt bij het initiëren van een samenwerking het model als een checklist te gebruik en
voor het creëren van gunstige omstandigheden om een samenwerking te laten slagen. Daarbij wordt
geadviseerd in het bijzonder aandacht te besteden aan het faciliterend leiderschap en het behalen van
tussentijdse resultaten. Deze factoren verklaren het slag en van de samenwerking en het behalen van
de doelstelling.
Ten
tweede wordt geadviseerd het samenwerkingsverband een functie te geven die het mogelijk
maakt voor actoren om een directe relatie te zien tussen participatie en beleidsuitkomsten. Dit levert
e en sterke prikkel op om te participeren aan een samenwerking. De input van actoren moet niet
slechts adviserend of symbolisch van aard zijn (Ansell Gash, 2008).
De derde aanbeveling is bij het institutioneel design aandacht te besteden aan de transparan tie van
het samenwerkingsverband. Dit geldt in het bijzonder voor de externe informatie uitwisseling. De
externe informatie uitwisseling draagt bij aan de legitimiteit van het samenwerkingsverband.",
Leiderschapsontwikkeling in de zorg,Roos Jansen,2020-10-28,"['Dr. N. Cannaerts', 'Prof.dr. A. J. Steijn']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Deze ontwikkelingen zorgen voor verschillende uitdagingen, als een tekort aan zorgprofessionals, een hoge werkdruk en dreigende financiële tekorten. Om met deze uitdagingen te kunnen omgaan is er behoefte aan duidelijk leiderschap, leidend tot een veilige werkomgeving en positieve patiëntuitkomsten. De organisatiecommitment van medewerkers speelt een belangrijke rol in werktevredenheid en het verloop binnen een organisatie. Twee leiderschapsstijlen die een rol spelen binnen de publieke zorgsector en de mate van organisatiecommitment zijn transactioneel en transformationeel leiderschap. Daarnaast blijkt dat een balans tussen beide leiderschapsstijlen, in de vorm van ambidextrous leiderschap effectiever zou zijn dan een enkele leiderschapsstijl. Ontwikkeling van leiderschap is van belang bij het omgaan van onverwachte uitdagingen. In dit onderzoek wordt het effect van leiderschapsontwikkeling op de relatie van transactioneel en transformationeel leiderschap op organisatiecommitment onderzocht. Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd binnen het UMC Utrecht, één van de grootste zorgorganisaties in Nederland. Middels een leiderschapsprogramma dat zich richt op het vergroten en verbreden van transactioneel en transformationeel leiderschap is leiderschapsontwikkeling onderzocht. Door het uitzetten van een online-vragenlijst (N = 102) werden data kwantitatief verzameld onder leidinggevenden en medewerkers van het UMC Utrecht. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat leiderschapsontwikkeling geen modererend effect heeft op de relatie tussen leiderschap en organisatiecommitment in de publieke zorgsector. Wel blijkt dat transactioneel, transformationeel en ambidextrous leiderschap alle een positieve invloed hebben op organisatiecommitment, waarbij ambidextrous en daarna transactioneel leiderschap het grootste effect laten zien. Leiderschapsontwikkeling blijkt invloed te hebben op de mate van leiderschap, vooral transformationeel en ambidextrous leiderschap, wat het belang hiervan aangeeft in de publieke zorgsector. Op basis van de resultaten worden praktische aanbevelingen gedaan. Waaronder het omarmen van nog aanwezige leiderschapsstijlen en omgaan met verschillende situaties door het stimuleren van ambidextrous leiderschap, het benadrukken van de noodzaak van leiderschapsontwikkeling op verschillende niveaus en behoeften in een organisatie en het uitvoeren van consequente evaluaties van leiderschapsprogramma’s.","['Transactioneel', 'transformationeel en ambidextrous leiderschap', 'organisatiecommitment', 'leiderschapsontwikkeling', 'publieke zorgsector en kwantitatief onderzoek.']"

In gesprek over je werk: een kwalitatief onderzoek naar R&O-gesprekken en het psychologisch contract,Arco  de Baat,2020-10-24,"['Dr. B. Vermeeren', 'Dr. V.M.F. Homburg']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Doel: HRM-beleid is een belangrijk onderdeel van het werk van leidinggevenden en leidinggevenden vormen een belangrijke schakel in het vertalen van HRM-beleid naar de werkvloer. In een samenleving waar sprake is van een intensivering van werk en HRM-beleid van belang om medewerkers op lange termijn goed te laten functioneren. R&O-gesprekken zijn een belangrijk onderdeel van dit HRM-beleid. Om HRM-beleid goed te laten functioneren moet het aansluiten het psychologisch contract dat medewerkers hebben en dat bestaat uit hun verwachtingen. Het doel van het onderzoek is het exploreren van de verschillen tussen gevoerde R&O-gesprekken door leidinggevenden en waargenomen R&O-gesprekken door medewerkers, met daarin bijzondere aandacht voor de rol van het psychologisch contract.
Theorie: De causale keten van Purcell en Hutchinson (2007) en Nishii en Wright (2007) laat zien dat het zinvol is om de niveaus van geïmplementeerd HRM en ervaren HRM te onderscheiden. Geïmplementeerd HRM gaat over de rol van leidinggevenden en ervaren HRM over de rol van medewerkers. R&O-gesprekken behandelen het functioneren en de ontwikkeling van de medewerker en zijn een onderdeel van HRM-beleid. Het psychologisch contract betreft de verwachtingen van medewerkers van zichzelf, van de organisatie en van de leidinggevende. Dit contract heeft vijf dimensies, waarvan loopbaanontwikkeling, werkinhoud en werk-privébalans in dit onderzoek worden meegenomen.
Methode: Dit kwalitatieve onderzoek bestaat uit een reeks van interviews met leidinggevenden en medewerkers in een zorgorganisatie waarin met doelgroepen met een complexe problematiek wordt gewerkt. Er zijn in totaal 9 medewerkers en 9 leidinggevenden geïnterviewd via een videoverbinding.
Resultaten: Leidinggevenden en medewerkers verschillen in perceptie met betrekking tot het gebruik van gespreksformulieren en het gebruik van een personeelssysteem waarin dit formulier is ingevoerd. Leidinggevenden hebben een negatieve perceptie van deze instrumenten terwijl medewerkers die niet hebben. Dit verschil is niet te koppelen aan het psychologisch contract. Wat betreft de verwachtingen uit het psychologisch contract is er een groep medewerkers waar de leidinggevende aan de verwachtingen voldoet en een groep waarbij dit niet het geval is. De manier waarop de organisatie aan de verwachtingen voldeed verschilde niet tussen deze groepen. De medewerkers hebben veel verwachtingen van zichzelf

In de groep waar de leidinggevende niet aan de verwachtingen voldoet is volgens de medewerker te weinig aandacht voor de werkinhoud, de werk-privébalans en de ontwikkeling van de medewerker. Aan deze verwachtingen kan voldaan worden door buiten de gesprekken voldoende aandacht voor de werkinhoud te hebben van de medewerker, eventueel door werkbegeleiding. In de gesprekken ervaart de medewerker het gesprek over ontwikkeling als meer zinvol wanneer de leidinggevende voldoende van de werkinhoud en de werk-privébalans afweet. De verwachtingen uit het psychologisch contract hebben dus invloed op de perceptie van het R&O-gesprek. Wanneer aan de verwachtingen niet wordt voldaan ontstaat een verschil in perceptie van de waarde van het gesprek tussen de medewerker en leidinggevende.
Aanbevelingen voor vervolgonderzoek: Dit onderzoek het belang van de verwachtingen van medewerkers in de perceptie van R&O-gesprekken. Vervolgonderzoek kan voor andere HRM-praktijken onderzoeken of zij eenzelfde relatie vertonen tot het psychologisch contract. Verder komt in dit onderzoek de centrale rol van leidinggevenden naar voren. Vervolgonderzoek kan ingaan op de vraag hoe de manier van leidinggeven het succes van het HRM-beleid beïnvloedt.
Ten slotte laat dit onderzoek zien dat leidinggevenden negatieve percepties van HRM-beleid kunnen wegnemen door de eigen vrijheid te nemen in het invoeren van dit beleid. Vervolgonderzoek kan de vraag stellen of HRM-beleid als red tape kan functioneren en wat hierin de rol van leidinggevenden is.","['Causale keten', 'geïmplementeerd HRM', 'ervaren HRM', 'R&O-gesprekken', 'psychologisch contract', 'Leidinggevende en medewerker.']"
In hogere sferen innoveren,Robin Martens,2020-10-23,"['Dr. M.Beukenholdt-ter Mors', 'Dr. J. Hakvoort']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Publieke organisaties staan in toenemende mate onder druk, en worden door de toenemende complexiteit van maatschappelijke problemen gedwongen om samen te werken. Daarnaast wordt steeds vaker zichtbaar dat huidige instrumenten en werkwijzen niet meer toereikend zijn bij het oplossen van deze maatschappelijke kwesties. Publieke organisaties worden door deze ontwikkelingen gedwongen om in gezamenlijkheid nieuwe innovatieve beleidsoplossingen te bedenken en ontwikkelen. De publieke sector heeft verschillende karakteristieken die ervoor zorgen dat innovatie en samenwerking niet vanzelfsprekend is. Het Innovatieprogramma Satelliettoepassingen van het Ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid heeft als doel om innovatie en samenwerking te stimuleren. In dit onderzoek wordt dit innovatieprogramma geëvalueerd. De hoofdvraag van het onderzoek luidt dan ook: ‘In hoeverre is het Innovatieprogramma Satelliettoepassingen voor Justitie en Veiligheid succesvol gebleken?’  De moeilijkheidsgraad van deze evaluatie zit in het gebrek aan meetinstrumenten: resultaten worden in het gunstigste geval pas verwacht in een tijdsbestek van vijf tot tien jaar. Het samenwerkingsproces zelf kan wel worden geëvalueerd. Theoretische inzichten vanuit de netwerk- en transitieliteratuur hebben geholpen bij het formuleren van condities die samenwerkingssucces kunnen voorspellen. 

Uit de interviews is duidelijk geworden dat de procesmatige en inhoudelijke ondersteuning vanuit het ministerie essentieel is, en dat de deelnemers niet in staat zijn om deze taken zelf uit te voeren. Daarnaast krijgen de deelnemers volop te maken met de kenmerken van de trage en bureaucratische overheid. De ruimte voor innovatie is beperkt, zelfs bij medewerkers die innovatie in hun takenpakket hebben – vaak als secundaire taak. De respondenten hebben kennisgemaakt met Triple Helix-samenwerking – waarin overheid, kennisinstellingen en marktpartijen hun krachten bundelen - en zien hiervan duidelijk de meerwaarde. Het belang van het individu, en de persoonlijke banden tussen individuen, is van groot belang en kan de samenwerking maken of kraken. 

Het ISJV is grotendeels te beschouwen als succesvol. Er is binnen het ISJV een groot netwerk ontstaan, waarmee het ministerie een verbinding heeft gecreëerd tussen de publieke sector, de academische wereld en het bedrijfsleven. Er zijn dan ook verschillende concrete onderzoekstrajecten opgestart, die zonder het ISJV hoogstwaarschijnlijk niet op gang gekomen zijn. Daarnaast heeft men enorm veel leerzame kennis en ervaring opgedaan. Het ISJV laat echter wel potentieel succes liggen, door gedurende het proces te weinig aandacht te hebben voor dit leerproces. Daarnaast is het ministerie slordig omgegaan met de overdracht van de coördinerende en faciliterende taken, waardoor het innovatieproces is afgeremd. Wanneer het ministerie van deze fouten leert en deze verwerkt in volgende innovatieprogramma’s kan het ISJV een onverdeeld succes genoemd worden. Of het ministerie dat zal doen is dus echter geen zekerheid.

In dit onderzoek wordt een zestal aanbevelingen gedaan aan het ministerie. Allereerst is het van groot belang om duidelijke en meetbare (leer)doelen te formuleren, waardoor het mogelijk wordt om monitoring toe te passen. Daarnaast zou een langere looptijd van een innovatieprogramma de kans op succes waarschijnlijk sterk vergroten. Het overdragen van coördinerende en faciliterende taken moet in de toekomst zorgvuldiger. Het aanstellen van een tijdelijke projectleider kan die overdracht versoepelen.  Tot slot zou het interessant kunnen zijn om de verschillende vraagstukken meer aan elkaar te koppelen zodat deelnemers aan innovatieprogramma’s kunnen leren van elkaars ervaringen.",

De sociale functie van sport voor de Rotterdamse jeugd. Hoe lokale organisaties in hun digitale communicatie reflecteren op de rol van sport in Rotterdam.,"Dongen, Koen van",2020-09-28,['Sterkenburg J. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Deze studie onderzoekt de sociale functie van sport voor sociaal kwetsbare jeugd (4-18 jaar) in Rotterdam en de rol van communicatie in dit proces. In een multiculturele stad als Rotterdam zijn partijen uit verschillende sectoren betrokken bij de totstandkoming van initiatieven die ervoor zorgen dat sociaaleconomisch kwetsbare jeugd kan sporten. Deze initiatieven zijn essentieel voor de ontwikkeling van deze jongeren. Om te beginnen is een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse toegepast op de digitale communicatie van de betrokken organisaties. Dit betreft een tekstuele inhoudsanalyse van websites van de sleutelpartijen in het Rotterdamse sportbeleid waarin relevante thema’s zullen worden geïdentificeerd. Tevens is een viertal expert-interviews afgenomen met deskundigen op het gebied van sport en jeugd in Rotterdam. Aan de hand van de combinatie van deze twee onderzoeksmethoden is duidelijk geworden hoe sportstad Rotterdam betekenis geeft aan de sociale rol van sport voor de kwetsbare jeugd en welke rol communicatie hierin speelt. Tenslotte zal dit onderzoek een adviserend doel hebben en wordt de toekomst van het Rotterdamse sportbeleid ten aanzien van de sociale rol van sport voor sociaal kwetsbare jeugd, met daarin mogelijk enkele aanbevelingen op grond van de onderzoeksresultaten. Na uitvoering van deze studie kan geconcludeerd worden dat de sociale functie van sport in Rotterdam op waarde wordt geschat. Zowel uit de inhoudsanalyse als uit de expert-interviews bleek dat de betrokken partijen over voldoende kennis beschikken wat betreft de positieve effecten van de sociale rol van sport in Rotterdam. Over de mogelijke nadelen van de sociale rol van sport is minder bekend. Deze worden in de digitale communicatie van de onderzochte partijen bijvoorbeeld geheel overgeslagen. Het grootste probleem om de positieve effecten van de sociale functie van sport maximaal te benutten zit hem in de communicatie. Vooral de communicatie met de doelgroep vormt voor sportorganisaties op dit moment nog het grootste struikelblok in een succesvol maatschappelijk sportbeleid in Rotterdam. De gebrekkige communicatie is het gevolg van vele verschillen tussen de sociaaleconomisch achtergestelde jongeren en medewerkers van de onderzochte partijen uit de keten. Om deze verschillen in omgang en cultuur te overbruggen zullen de sleutelpartijen meer initiatief moeten
nemen in de tegemoetkoming van de doelgroep.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'sportparticipatie kwetsbare jeugd', 'rol van sportprogramma’s', 'digitale communicatie']"
DIY Hip Hop & the Power Structures of the Music Industry: The Growing Impact of DIY Hip Hop,"Habteyesus, Hermon",2020-09-28,['Hitters E.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis examines the impact of local Do-It-Yourself (DIY) hip hop artists on the roles of intermediaries. Both hip hop music and independent music are now more popular than ever, while the major record labels – Universal, Sony and Warner – are losing some of their traditionally dominant power at the same time. To find the perceptions of contemporary DIY hip hop artists and their impact on the industry, nine in-depth interviews were performed with hip hop artists and experts. The results firstly show that the esthetic boundaries of hip hop music has been broadened since digitalization of the industry. In the past, the supply of physical music was rather closed due to the gatekeeping role of the majors, but streaming platforms have now empowered consumers by opening up the supply of music. The result is that the public started to accept hip hop music with lower (or cheaper) production quality, empowering DIY artists who reject involvement from corporate investors like major record labels based on personal values. The belief in independent success of hip hop artists is apparent, just like the DIY ethos strongly seems to be present in hip hop music. This identity of contemporary DIY hip hop artists can be a threat to the traditional power structures of the industry, because this type of artist believes that record labels are no longer required to be successful as an artist. Also, it seems like substituting intermediaries like managers, bookings agents and PR persons are becoming more available to local hip hop artists. This way, DIY artists can avoid large record labels but make (multiple) deals with those other, more service-specific intermediaries. Because of the increased availability of intermediaries, it is expected that artists will typically work with a higher amount of intermediaries than before. Findings suggest that the increase in relevancy of intermediaries will specifically be noticeable in the field of artist management. DIY hip hop artists can reject the involvement of record labels, but the complex music industry still asks for codified industry knowledge to be successful. Managers will therefore act as the bridge to the professional industry for local hip hop artists.","['media', 'creative industries', 'DIY', 'hip hop', 'digitalization', 'music industry', 'intermediaries']"
De Kunduz-missie: De verhouding tussen media en beleidsvorming: Een onderzoek naar de verhoudingen tussen de media en overheid over de berichtgeving over de politiemissie in Kunduz.,"Linden, Mandy van der",2020-09-28,['Huiberts E.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In deze thesis wordt onderzocht welke verhoudingen er zijn tussen de media en overheid over de berichtgeving over de politiemissie in Kunduz. De politiemissie in Kunduz was een missie waarbij achteraf is gebleken dat de Tweede Kamer verkeerd was geinformeerd over de verloop van zaken rondom de missie. Dit onderzoek is van belang omdat onderzoek een leemte kan vullen over de academische literatuur omtrent deze politiemissie. Dit onderzoek is ook van maatschappelijk belang omdat bij een toekomstige missie er anders kan worden beslist ten opzichte van die missies. Om de onderzoeksvraag te kunnen beantwoorden zijn er een aantal deelvragen opgesteld. De eerste deelvraag is gericht op de hoeveelheid aandacht vanuit de media voor de politiemissie in Kunduz. De tweede deelvraag is gericht op welke wijze er is gesproken in de Kamerstukken over de missie en welke thema’s hier uit zijn voortgekomen. De laatste deelvraag is gericht op de inhoud van de krantenartikelen. Er is hierbij gekeken of de thema’s die gevonden zijn in de thematische analyse ook terugkwamen in de krantenartikelen. Binnen dit onderzoek zijn drie verschillende onderzoeksmethoden gebruikt. Voor de hoeveelheid aandacht te kunnen meten is gebruik gemaakt van een automatische inhoudsanalyse. Voor de thema’s in de Kamerstukken is gebruik gemaakt van een kwalitatieve thematische analyse waarbij 29 Kamerstukken zijn geanalyseerd. En aan de hand van deze thema’s en bestaande theorie over framing is een codebook opgesteld. Dit codebook is gebruikt in de kwantitatieve handmatige inhoudsanalyse. Voor deze analyse is 20% van de complete dataset van krantenartikelen gecodeerd, namelijk 461 artikelen. UIt de automatische inhoudsanalyse is gebleken dat er in een toenemende mate is geschreven over de missie in Kunduz maar dat het relatieve aantal krantenartikelen laag was ten opzichte van het totale aantal krantenartikelen. Er waren tijdens de missie ook enkele key events aan te wijzen. Deze key events zorgde voor een toename van het aantal krantenartikelen. UIt de thematische analyse is gebleken dat er diverse thema’s zijn terug te vinden. Hierbij is er in de Kamerstukken zelf ook thema’s al ontwikkeld. Binnen deze thema’s worden allerlei samenhange aspecten gepresenteerd. Uit de handmatige inhoudsanalyse is gebleken dat de intercodeursbetrouwbaarheid van de frames zeer goed was te noemen maar de frames kwamen zelf in een redelijke mate terug in de krantenartikelen. Uit de vergelijking tussen de aandacht voor het aantal krantenartikelen en het aantal Kamerstukken is gebleken dat er een matige correlatie. Dit houdt in dat er in een matige mate door beide op hetzelfde moment wordt geschreven over de politiemissie in Kunduz. Uit deze uitkomsten en de bestaande theorieen kan worden vastgesteld dat de verhoudingen tussen de media en politiek niet altijd even sterk zijn.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Kunduz', 'politiemissie', 'beleid', 'media', 'politiek']"
“The first ever” – Creative implementation of an escape room as a tool for supporting brand positioning: A research of international brands adopting the layout of escape rooms,"Pricop, Elena",2020-09-28,['Derda I.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Experiential marketing is a well-established marketing technique that enjoyed the attention of international marketers and brands for the last past years. It is an effective method that helps brands to 
achieve multiple goals by delivering memorable experiences to consumers open to enjoy them. Escape room is a popular and internationally known game format of entertainment. Its demand grew exponentially in a short period of time, and various and numerous brands acknowledged it as a marketing opportunity. Therefore, it is relevant to study the way brands adopted the escape rooms as a marketing tool. By analyzing brands’ communication, this thesis empirically investigates how brands made use of a successful game format in order to support their position. Online articles and videos that contain the voice of the brand, serve to research the implemented marketing strategies by well-known organizations. A thematic analysis method was applied to analyze the collected data. The findings indicated that three main strategies are implemented in order to achieve the goal. First, organizations frequently communicated their points of differentiation in order to be viewed as unique. Second, a relationship between brands and its customers was attempted to be established. Finally, the researched brands creatively implemented an escape in order to support raising brand awareness.","['media', 'business', 'experiential marketing', 'branded escape room', 'brand positioning', 'marketing strategies', 'storytelling']"
Sturing in het Rotterdamse jeugdbeleid,Nadine de Geus,2020-09-18,"['Prof.dr. A. van Buuren', 'Dr. H. Klaassen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Het jeugdbeleid van de gemeente Rotterdam beslaat vele beleidsterreinen waar verspreid over
meerdere organisatieonderdelen honderden ambtenaren met enorm diverse partners werken aan het
veiliger, gezonder en kansrijker laten opgroeien van de jeugd in de stad. Hoe de gemeente in deze
omgeving moet sturen, is een grote uitdaging. De hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek richt zich hierop:
Wat verklaart waarom een sturingsstijl in de omgeving van het jeugdbeleid van de gemeente Rotterdam
als geschikt wordt ervaren? En wat leert dat ons over de toepasselijkheid van een sturingsstijl in een
bepaalde context?
Overheidssturing is de (doel)gerichte beïnvloeding van de samenleving in een bepaalde context (In ’t
Veld, 1989, in: Bekkers, 2012). De wetenschappelijke theorie leert ons dat er vier soorten
overheidsvormen te onderscheiden zijn (Van der Steen et al., 2014): de rechtmatige, presterende,
samenwerkende of responsieve overheid. Iedere vorm kent een eigen unieke sturingsstijl die een
overheidsorganisatie kan inzetten. Vaak is een mix van stijlen in het gedrag en handelen waar te nemen,
ook wel sedimentatie in sturing genoemd. Of een sturingsvorm past bij de omgeving waarin een
beleidsmaatregel zich bevindt, is volgens het ‘fit-for-purpose’ raamwerk (Rijke et al, 2012) afhankelijk
van de perceptie van stakeholders. Door deze tegen elkaar af te zetten, ontstaat een idee over de
toepasselijkheid van een sturingsstijl in een bepaalde context.
In dit onderzoek staan zes maatregelen uit het Rotterdamse jeugdbeleid centraal, te weten prenatale
huisbezoeken, jeugd- en opvoedhulp, het kindpakket, interventie Taakspel, het ROC-Aanvalsplan en
de STAD-pilot van toezicht en handhaving. Aan de hand van interviews met stakeholders is onderzocht
hoe de gemeente Rotterdam stuurt in deze cases, hoe de omgeving daar van invloed op is en hoe
stakeholders daarover oordelen. Uit de analyse van resultaten blijkt dat in alle cases sedimentatie van
sturing waar te nemen is, maar dat in de meeste gevallen een samenwerkende sturingsstijl in een
rechtmatig kader is op te merken. Daarbij is een patroon op te merken waarbij de mate waarin de
sturingsrol van de gemeente als toepasselijk wordt ervaren door stakeholders afhankelijk lijkt van hoe
open de gemeente zich opstelt en hoe ver zij gaat in haar samenwerking met stakeholders.
De vergelijkende analyse leert ons dat zes categorieën van omgevingsfactoren zijn te identificeren die
druk uitoefenen op de gemeente, namelijk politieke, media, bestuurlijke, economische, administratieve
en juridische factoren. Deze maken dat de gemeente bewust en onbewust in bepaalde
sturingsrichtingen wordt ‘geduwd’. In het jeugdbeleid is vooral de bestuurlijke context van grote invloed,
te verklaren door de grootschalige transitie en transformatie van de jeugdzorg. De decentralisatie heeft
ervoor gezorgd dat de gemeente vaker aansluiting zoekt in het sociaal domein door samenwerkend te
sturen en dat zij door de nieuwe verantwoordelijkheidsverdeling meer aandacht heeft voor
rechtmatigheid. Verhoogde druk vanuit politiek en media zorgen ervoor dat de gemeente breder
gedragen probleemoplossingen nastreeft door stakeholders te verbinden – en dus samenwerkend
stuurt. De economische situatie rond maatregelen kan in een competitieve markt zorgen voor veel
nadruk op prestaties, terwijl het in het maatschappelijk middenveld zorgt voor aandacht voor
responsiviteit en samenwerking. Administratieve en juridische kwesties kunnen interne struikelblokken
opwerpen, maar zijn meestal met samenwerkende en rechtmatige sturing te verhelpen.
In conclusie: de keuze voor een sturingsrol wordt nooit op een geheel autonome of onafhankelijke
manier gemaakt. Afhankelijk van de kracht van de pushfactoren in de omgeving van een maatregel
resulteert dit vaak in een bepaalde stijl. Dit relativeert het idee dat een stijl heel doelbewust en
doelgericht door de gemeente wordt gekozen. Toch betekent dit niet dat de gemeente zich moet laten
leiden door toevalligheden en zich moet neerleggen bij de situatie. Bewustzijn van de omgeving waarin 
5
zij zich bevindt, is essentieel. Alleen als de gemeente beseft waarom de ene manier van sturen door
stakeholders als passender wordt ervaren dan andere manieren, kan zij haar vermogen tot passend
sturen volledig benutten. Begrip voor verklarende factoren is nodig om te beseffen wat de consequenties
van haar handelen zijn. De gemeente dient te allen tijde de context van haar beleid in acht te nemen en
zich flexibel op te stellen tegenover invloeden en krachten uit de omgeving.",
The Belt and Road Initiative in the Indian Ocean,Marie Barillé,2020-09-18,"['Prof.dr. G. Dijkstra', 'Dr. M. Onderco']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The Belt and Road Initiative, a gigantic infrastructure project adopted by China in 2013, raises many
criticisms about the Chinese government's motives. Research has shown that the economic cooperation
project could allow China to develop naval military facilities in the Indian Ocean and that poor BRI
partner countries could risk falling into a debt trap. This study aims to contribute to the discussion on
China's motivations based on the implementation of BRI projects in Pakistan. The objective is to
determine whether the BRI partnership with Pakistan is a win-win-economic cooperation or whether
China is trying to assert its dominance in the region.
This research builds on International Relations theories to investigate which theory best explains
China's motives behind the BRI projects in Pakistan. For each theoretical proposition of offensive
realism, defensive realism or complex interdependence, indicators have been defined to compare the
propositions with the collected data.
The data analysis showed that a mix of complex interdependence theory and defensive realism
theory provides the most relevant explanation. The results found that by promoting win-win cooperation,
China is pursuing soft-power economic diplomacy, which can be seen as a means of supplanting US
soft power in Pakistan. The BRI projects in Pakistan have fostered a close relationship of economic
interdependence between Beijing and Islamabad, but that China benefits more from the BRI projects.
On this basis, it is recommended that China should be more transparent about the commercial
viability of projects, the conditions of cooperation and the results achieved. Further research is needed
to examine the share of Chinese workers in the projects, and the social and commercial relevance of the
projects.",

Truth or Truths?,Alida Kramer,2020-09-01,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Founded in 1976, the Wetenschappelijke Raad voor Regeringsbeleid (WRR) strives to
independently provide the Dutch government with advisory reports on policy making and societal developments on the long term. Coming from a political philosophy perspective, in this thesis, I aim to investigate the philosophical notion of a pragmatist truth in connection with such reports. Consequently, the following thesis is proposed: “To what extent is the philosophical notion of truth relate with the concept of plurality, with regards to the WRR’s advisory reports?” This is investigated through the three dimensions of policy making, which have led to a change in the landscape of policy making: polity, knowledge and intervention. Besides, a distinction is made between classical-modernist institutions and new political spaces. Using these theories, the WRR is evaluated. Based on these findings, this thesis argues whether a trade-off exists between a truth or plurality of truths in policy advisory reports.",
Critical Reflection of The Theory of Moral Sentiments: The Fortune of Others,Robert Ernst,2020-09-01,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"In economics, scholars learn that people make rational choices with regards to their own interest. In practice however, this is not always the case. It was this discrepancy that Adam Smith already formulated in 1759 in The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Why are people interested in the fortune of others? Both from an evolutionary and a social-psychological standpoint, there are ways of tracing back the origins of the altruistic nature of man. This inherent altruistic nature was significantly stimulated by both Christianity and the Islam, resulting in systematic forms of giving through practices such as charity and philanthropy.",

employment creation. Within this context young firms develop into large and established
companies and are a source of new jobs for the innovation district. However, consistent
empirical evidence regarding the relationship between employment formation and young
firms within innovation districts is largely missing. With a focus on Rotterdam Makers
District, this study aims to assess the relationship between young firms and employment
formation and explain its determinants. By employing quantitative and qualitative evidence,
heterogeneous results are found. An increase in the number of young firms choosing to locate
in the innovation district’s area is identified and their presence contributes to the number of
new jobs concentrated within Rotterdam Makers District. Nevertheless, this trend oscillates
between a ‘come, grow, and leave’ and ‘come and stay’ scenario. Moreover, it is shown that
these trends are determined by the innovation districts conditions. The results imply that
when young firms are stimulated by support initiatives, and the presence of young firms is in

"Living Rooms for the City: LocHal Tilburg and V&A Dundee, Small City Regeneration in Historical Perspective, 1990-Present","White, Fraser",2020-08-31,['Jacobs E.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis aims to interrogate two cases of culture-led regeneration in the context
of small post-industrial European cities. Using the phenomenon of the urban ‘living
room’ as its starting point, the thesis asks how this hegemonic policy doctrine, made
most famous by the arrival of the Guggenheim Bilbao in 1997, has evolved into the
present day, and how its fundaments have diffused into smaller peripheral cities. A
historical perspective is used to trace the origins and justifications for the arrival of
two self-professed urban ‘living rooms’: the LocHal public library in the city of
Tilburg, the Netherlands, and the V&A design museum in Dundee, Scotland. Both
of these cultural institutions opened within a few months of each other in two former
textile cities united by post-industrial restructuring and serious image deficits.
Despite the seemingly very different functions between a design museum and a
library, the thesis is able to draw a variety of conclusions related to the concept of
the ‘living room’ which unites these institutions in several shared economic, social
and cultural aims. Such aims prove the evolution of this hegemonic policy doctrine
in response to its acknowledged failures, and highlight the agency of small
peripheral cities to shape their own economic futures.","['global markets', 'local creativities', 'glocal', 'culture-led regeneration', 'urban development', 'cultural infrastructure', 'libraries', 'museums', 'knowledge economy', 'small cities', 'textile towns', 'heritage', 'city branding', 'Dundee', 'Tilburg', 'living room.']"
"Gallery Communication Channels & Networking Partners - 
Research on the particular roles of online and offline communication channels
for a gallery and its networking partners","Miebach, E.A.",2020-08-31,['Navarrete Hernandez T.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Galleries are the most essential intermediaries in the art market. Having success in the
art market though, hardly depends on the talent of the artist but rather on the access to decisive
networks and their use. The network is predominant for a gallery’s success in its function as an
art intermediary that adds value to the art market, while having to keep track of the business
aspects. In recent years, due to mergers, monopolisations, increasingly professionalized
business practices and the search for new ways of mediating art in the age of digitisation, as
well as the recent influences emerging from the COVID-19 crisis, the field of action of galleries
has changed increasingly. Galleries are progressively embracing new ways of cooperation,
instead of the traditional individualistic procedures. However, it is surprising how little is
known about the communication channels of a gallery’s network, given their apparent relevance
in the art market. In the course of this empirical research the “who”, “why” and “how” of a
gallery’s network are to be determined. Thus, the aim of this research is to examine the different
offline and online communication channels of galleries, with the objective to clarify their
particular role and importance for a gallery and its networking partners.
After a detailed theoretical research on the characteristics of the art market, the gallery’s
intermediary role, the art market network and communication channels in said network, as well
as the research questions are explored by the means of qualitative empirical research, that is to
say with expert interviews of galleries. It becomes apparent that the network or rather the
connections with the networking partners are the be-all and end-all for a gallery’s success and
that it is not an ""either/or"" decision between the various online and offline communication
channels. Rather it is a complementary combination of the channels, with offline
communication channels (such as personal sales, direct contact, art fairs, exhibitions, events
and word-of-mouth) primarily being used to establish new contacts and online communication
channels (such as the gallery website, E-mails, newsletters, social media and online art
platforms) mainly playing a role for the maintenance of existing relationships with networking
partners. Considering future trends, the social distancing and isolation due to the COVID-19
crisis have reinforced the importance of offline, personal and physical contact and connections,
while giving a simultaneous boost to the use of online communication channels.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Galleries', 'offline and online communication channels', 'network', 'art market intermediaries']"
Small Venues as Networking Nodes: Live Music in the Context of Creative City Development,"Shapiro, Efim",2020-08-30,['Euwe J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Over the course of the last twenty years, cultural industries, including live music, have
gained importance within urban development policies with the rise of the concepts of the
creative city and the creative class. Nonetheless, during this period, more and more small
live music venues have been gradually descending into precariousness with
gentrification, tightening noise regulations and other reasons forcing many of them to
close down. This research aims to connect the study of live music to a broader creative
city development discussion by investigating the importance of small live music venues
and events for networking of music industry practitioners. By studying this issue, this
research strives to highlight the vital role that small live music venues and events play in
the cultural life of cities. The study was conducted in Rotterdam in the spring of 2020
using the means of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Drawing on the notion of social
capital of Pierre Bourdieu and James Coleman and the concept of Live Music Ecology of
Frith et. al this research investigates the mechanisms of social capital formation and the
importance of this resource for bookers and musicians in Rotterdam. As this study shows,
both groups consider networking as a crucial practice to succeed in the industry.
However, due to the hierarchical structure of the live music field, where event organisers
have the power to decide who, where and when gets to play, it appeared to be easier to
mobilize and utilize social capital for bookers, rather than for musicians. It leaves
musicians in a subordinate position, who, consequently, still rely mainly on self-promotion
and not on their networks to advance their careers. Nonetheless, small venues and
events play a crucial role in the formation of networks and milieus of the live music
industry practitioners. These milieus, in turn, allow for more collaborations to happen and
for more events to be organised, which contributes to the cultural output of the city
further enhancing the development of Rotterdam as a creative hub.","['global markets', 'local creativities', 'glocal', 'live music', 'small venues', 'creative cities', 'creative industries', 'social capital', 'networking', 'milieus']"
Following the Product: Traceability of Geographical Association and Supply Chain Processes in Luxury Fashion,"Irfan, Huma",2020-08-30,['Euwe J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research aims to explore the traceability of geographical association and supply chain processes in the luxury fashion industry. Luxury fashion brands reinforce their exclusivity through their association to their Country-of-Origin whereas the details on origin of raw materials, production processes and locations involved in the supply chain processes are overlooked. This results in dissociation of luxury fashion brands from their geographical association as well as neglect towards supply chain processes. Since the Rana Plaza incident in 2013, traceability of geographical associations and supply chain processes has gained importance and the brands are aiming for transparency in the value chain to gain the trust of customers. Therefore, this research studies the contribution of traceability to the redevelopment of brand heritage and brand image of luxury fashion brands since the 19th century. The sample for this research constitutes of two luxury fashion brands: Harris Tweed and Dormeuil. The primary data has been collected through interviews, digital networking sites, and print advertisements. The secondary data for this research includes already published literature on each brand such as books and articles. The results of this study identify that both brands, Harris Tweed and Dormeuil, have been involved in sustainable production practices since the early years of their existence. High quality and exclusivity of the products have been found to be the reasons behind the involvement of brands in fair production practices. However, Harris Tweed is an inherently traceable fabric due to stamping of Orb Mark which indicates the provenance details of the fabric. Therefore, the brand does not feel the need to launch an electronic traceability scheme. On the contrary, while Dormeuil has been an ethically responsible company in the past, the recent launch of its electronic traceability scheme has been driven by the need for transparency by the modern-day consumer. In addition, both brands have also capitalized on their traceability schemes (inherent or adopted) to build an image of sustainable luxury through the print advertisements during 1900s and social media in the present day. Furthermore, Harris Tweed and Dormeuil often highlight their Country-of-Origin (a major geographical association) to reinforce the authenticity and skilled craftsmanship of their brands. It illustrates that brands take advantage of their brand heritage to support their genuineness in producing quality products through sustainable supply chain processes. This research concludes that the traceability of geographical association and supply chain processes of luxury fashion brands relies on the brand heritage to demonstrate that they have always been committed to fair production practices and therefore, redevelops the image of brands as ‘sustainable luxury’.","['global markets', 'local creativities', 'glocal', 'traceability', 'geographical association', 'supply chain', 'brand image', 'brand heritage', 'Country-of-Origin', 'luxury fashion']"
Mainstreaming of multiculturalism,Ivan Ivanov,2020-08-28,"['Dr. A. Pisarevskaya', 'Dr. I. van Breugel']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In 1989 the communist regime in Bulgarian fell. It finally brought democratic changes,
opened the free market, guaranteed freedom of speech and human rights and equality. After
five decades of ethnic tension and human rights violations in the small Balkan country a
discussion formed up. The topic on the agenda was “intercultural education”. Throughout the
90s philosophers, sociologists and education experts debate on how to implement this
intercultural approach. In 2003 the Ministry of Education presented its strategy called
“Educational Integration for children from Minorities” implementing intercultural policies.
In this study I research the implementation of the “National Education Strategy” applying the
theoretical concepts of mainstreaming as a policy implementation strategy and
interculturalism as a policy philosophy. The study focuses on equality as a binding factor to a
common goal. Methods. This study adopted a qualitative case study design, open coding
policy documents and interviews with municipal schoolteachers. Findings. This study found
that equality between minority and majority population in education is used as a factor that
binds interculturalism and mainstreaming. This is observed by deconstructing equality as a
core policy goal into three categories. Category of equal treatment consisting of institutional
and social sub-category. Category of equal opportunity, consisting of educational inclusion
and cultural preservation and development sub-category. Last category is minority
perspective consisting of social, political and economic sub-category. Conclusion. This study
shows that intercultural policies are mainstreamed in Bulgaria’s education with a
predominant emphasis on early levels of education (kindergarten, primary school) and more
limited policy implementation in high-schools and universities. Intercultural education
focuses on teaching children of socio-cultural diversity which is expected to transcend into
the general societal sphere . Recommendations. Although there is a visible structure of how
intercultural policies and mainstreamed, the approach lacks standardization for a smoother
implementation of policies and the effective cooperation between education institutions. The
intercultural dialogue can be deepened much more by involving interested parties with
experience in the field on intercultural education.","['mainstreaming interculturalism', 'integration policies', 'national minorities', 'equality', 'intercultural education']"

This thesis is an exploratory case study contextualizing the history and success of Naked
Communications, an influential agency in the advertising industry founded in 2000. Despite the
closing of its key offices by 2019, this case study draws inspiration from economic geography
grounding advertising as a creative and cultural industry built atop urban-based clusters with a
project ecology, to evaluate what success means for agencies in highly volatile and competitive
settings. Faced with the dual and sometimes paradoxical interest to achieve creative and business
success by way of its reputation and performance, a framework was created to navigate the
historiography the advertising industry as well as how values are managed in shaping the actual
and perceived success of an agency. This study argues that Naked was a successful agency despite
the closing of his business because it built a legacy brand of itself, through its ability to leverage
the agency values of positioning, process, people, place, and purpose, with the four main
stakeholders (clients, competitors, talents, and insiders) of Adland’s milieu and beyond. The
implications of these findings are to provide an alternative framework to contextual success for
firms with an agency-based business model in urban clusters in the creative economy.","['global markets', 'local creativities', 'glocal', 'Naked Communications', 'advertising', 'success', 'project ecology', 'creative economy', 'creative industries', 'cultural industries', 'clusters', 'knowledge transfer', 'culture']"
Advocacy and Policy Change: The Case of VluchtelingenWerk and Immigration Lawyers on the Family Reunification Policy,Lisa Huijgen,2020-08-27,"['Dr. Mark van Ostaijen', 'Dr. Asya Pisarevskaya']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The Dutch family reunification policy for asylum seekers can be seen as quite restrictive. In 2013,
the policy was tightened, which had major consequences for dependent young adults as many
young adults were left behind in unsafe circumstances in their country of origin or in refugee
camps. This specific part of the family reunification policy has received a lot of criticism from
several non-governmental actors, such as VluchtelingenWerk and immigration lawyers. Because
they did not agree with the policy, they advocated for policy change. Eventually, the policy with
regard to dependent young adults changed three times in the period between 2014 and 2016. The
purpose of this research is to examine how the advocacy strategies used by the non-governmental
actors, VluchtelingenWerk and the immigration lawyers, have contributed to the policy changes
regarding the rights of dependent young adults in the family reunification policy in the period
between 2014 and 2016. In order to examine this, this research contains a document analysis of
both parliamentary documents and documents of non-governmental actors and several
interviews. Based on the results of the collected data, the conclusion can be drawn that
VluchtelingenWerk and the immigration lawyers have successfully contributed to the three
policy changes by investing their advocacy in four ways: (1) Defining the problem definition
with the aim to capture attention; (2) Developing policy solutions; (3) Influencing the political
climate; (4) Strengthening the organization capacity. This way, they were able to come to an
agreement on the problem definition and solutions to problems with policymakers, increase the
political will, and to create or respond to a window of opportunity effectively. These factors
eventually led to the three changes in the family reunification policy with regard to dependent
young adults.","['Family Reunification', 'Dependent Young Adults', 'Advocacy', 'Civil Society Organizations', 'Multiple Streams Framework', 'VluchtelingenWerk', 'Immigration Lawyers']"

"""Curry: A Tempting Tale Of The Colony
Analyzing Culinary Cosmopolitanism through the changes in the recipes of curry in London since the Early 1900s to the Early 2000s""","Cheema, Simrat",2020-08-27,['Dijck M. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Curry, an Anglo-Indian word coined by the British, was a product of India’s colonization that went on to become the national dish of Britain in 2001. The thesis investigated this evolution of curry’s culinary cosmopolitanism in London from the early 1900s to the early 2000s.
The term culinary cosmopolitanism can simply be understood as the acceptance of the edible other. But this acceptance is not always as simple as it seems. There are other modalities of culinary cosmopolitanism, which function through translations, generalizations and modifications. The case study of curry highlighted this duality of culinary cosmopolitanism that sought to “absorb” and “adapt” the Other, which questioned the stance of its acceptance altogether.
By making use of digitized archives, 74 curry recipes collected from an English periodical Daily Mail, were compared with the 103 recipes gathered from an Indian newspaper Times of India. This archival research followed a content and a comparative analysis of the changes in the recipes of curry through the three phases of India’s independence, the colonial era (from the early 1900s to 1946), the independence era (from 1947-1990) and the post-independence era (from 1991 to the early 2000s). A significant number of differences could be noticed between the English and the Indian curries because of two contrasting standpoints on the dish, wherein the English curry was found to be a generalized by-product of colonialism, commercialization and racism. This was a result of the translation it sustained, of being called by an English name owing to colonialism; the oversimplification it endured, of being understood only through a common blend of spices owing to the commercialization of curry powder; and the generalization of being associated primarily as a spicy Indian entity owing to the racism against Muslims.","['global history', 'international relations', 'Culinary Cosmopolitanism', 'Curry', 'Commercialization of curry powder', 'Racism', 'Multiculturalism']"
"Why HipHopHuis Matters? A critical inquiry into identity, space and superdiversity in Rotterdam","Beočanin, Jelena",2020-08-27,['Dijck M. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","HipHopHuis in Rotterdam is explored not merely as a local adaptation of hip-hop, but as a place to negotiate identities and power dynamics of a superdiverse population. This thesis investigates and challenges the concept of superdiversity by studying it as lived experience, and as urban reality and historically built narrative and image of the city. In the interplay between the two, I question whether superdiversity in migration and demography of the population also means cultural and social superdiversity. Because of its global popularity, contested artistic expressions and daring social commentary, hip-hop emerged as a space to rethink the reach of superdiversity, with spatial relations as one way to do so. The other way is that of daily interactions captured through ethnography. HipHopHuis is then a contact space through which people interact, extend their biographies and gain opportunities. Finally, the thesis concludes that HipHopHuis’ identity and belonging negotiation depends on the question if superdiversity equals not only cultural diversity but an understanding of cultural differences.","['global markets', 'local creativities', 'glocal', 'hip-hop', 'superdiversity', 'identity', 'difference', 'place', 'space', 'neighbourhoods', 'discourse', 'ethnography', 'HipHopHuis', 'Rotterdam.']"

Collaborative Governance: Formula for succes?,Hester Bähler,2020-08-21,"['Prof.dr. J. Koppenjan', 'J. Nederhand. MSc.']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Increasingly, government relies on collaborative structures in attempt to solve societal issues. This
has also made its marks on public administration literature, which frequently highlights the necessity
of involving non-state actors in public policy, with theories such as collaborative governance and
network governance. This trend of collaboration in the public sector also shows in policy that
addresses education, in which an increase in collaborative structures can be noticed. The
Rekenfaculteit project is an example of this: several stakeholders collaborate in realization of
intensive math tutoring for children in Pendrecht, a neighborhood in the south of Rotterdam. In this
research, the collaboration between organizations in realization of Rekenfaculteit project is subject
of analysis. The research question is: How do collaborative governance process dynamics and what
collaboration produces relate to its perceived success?
Several theories on collaborative governance were explored. Different stages of collaborative
governance can be identified. Many theories go into the process characteristics of collaboration.
Collaborative governance focuses extensively on what elements and characteristics in processes are
needed to get to a fruitful collaborative environment. For this, many different frameworks were
designed. This research follows Emerson, Nabatchi and Balogh’s (2012) proposed distinction
between types of process components: it consists of communication aspect (principled engagement),
a relational (shared motivation) and a functional dimension (capacity for joint action). Furthermore,
it is important to look beyond the process of collaboration: without it evolving into products it is
unlikely that it is perceived successful. The products of collaboration are not as widely studied as its
process dynamics are. A distinction was made between collaborative actions, the impacts these
actions make (outcomes) and the ability to alter the process and actions according to its needs
(adaptation). Lastly, the question remains what success is. When evaluating collaborative governance
as a whole, the tendency is to look at the outcomes of collaboration. Kenis and Provan (2009) stress
that different people are likely to use different criteria, in which one is not more valid than others.
This paper follows this reasoning. It is frequently emphasized that a high quality process is
conditional to achieving success.
Qualitative research was done in order to answer the research question. As mentioned before, the
Rekenfaculteit project was used as a case here. Although unique in the sense that collaborative
structures in education rarely offer such intensive tutoring to primary school students, it is one of
many examples of collaboration in the sector. The case is worth looking into, because it is regarded
as quite successful. Eighteen interviews were held and documents were explored. The data that was
gathered here was used for analysis.
The findings show that all three components of the process dynamics were present in collaboration.
Interviewees were particularly positive about the capacity for joint action: this was established early
on and contributed to establishing the other two components: shared motivation and principled
engagement. Although these were also thought of in a positive way, they took longer to build and
some ongoing issues with the amount of information shared and trust and commitment were noted.
Interviewees were positive about the collaborative actions, although areas for improvements are
4
mentioned. It appearsthat all three components of the process dynamics were crucial in the realization
of the actions: the findings do not show one being more important than the others. With regards to
the outcomes, it appears that the program’s impact on the environment is considered most important.
However, differences occur in what is most important in that aspect: socio-emotional development
of the children or cognitive skill improvements. Although overall positive, some interviewees were a
more negative about the latter. A belief is shared that the noted outcomes are related to the actions,
referring to the tutoring. Adaptation appears a key element in this collaboration: it is said that
Rekenfaculteit extensively focuses on improving itself and that many adaptations were made that
were helpful in improving the quality of the program. Lastly, the question remains what success is
and how this relates to collaborative governance. It appears that success mostly relates to the
outcomes. Again, differences occur in what is considered most important here, in line with what was
said about the outcomes. But success appears to go beyond just outcomes: the quality of the actions,
adaptation and the relational aspect of process dynamics are mentioned as ways to define and measure
success. Thus, success most directly relates to the outcomes, but from what it seems other elements
play a role here as well. However, for the most part one can see that process dynamics, collaborative
actions and adaptive capacity more indirectly relate to success, for the outcomes could not have been
achieved without the aid of them.",
Vrouwelijke statushouders: In de eeuwige schaduw van de man?,Maartje Mertens,2020-08-21,"['Dr. H. Klaassen', 'Prof.dr. A. van Buuren']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Vrouwelijke statushouders, staan ze echt in de eeuwige schaduw van de man? Volgens een
onderzoek van het Kennisplatform Integratie en Samenleving blijft de arbeidsparticipatie van
vluchtelingenvrouwen zwaar achter, zo ook in de gemeenten Rotterdam en Amsterdam. Na
tegenvallende cijfers als resultaat van de Rotterdamse aanpak en betere cijfers vanuit de
Amsterdamse aanpak, wordt gepleit door raadsleden binnen de gemeente Rotterdam voor het
overnemen van de Amsterdamse aanpak. Dit wordt echter hard de kop ingedrukt door de
wethouder. De vraag ontstaat of de wethouder hiermee zijn kop in het zand steekt of dat de
Rotterdamse aanpak wel degelijk standhoudt. Een vergelijking tussen de Rotterdamse- en de
Amsterdamse aanpak ontbreekt vooralsnog. Het onderzoek zal hier dan ook een bijdrage aan
leveren door een vergelijking te maken van beide aanpakken en de focus te leggen op de
economische verzelfstandiging van vrouwelijke statushouders, gezien de actualiteit en de
urgentie van het onderwerp.
Het doel van het onderzoek is om aanbevelingen te doen aan de gemeenten Rotterdam
en Amsterdam om de effectiviteit van het beleid te verhogen aan de hand van een vergelijking
van beide aanpakken. Gezien de focus die wordt gelegd op de economische verzelfstandiging
van de vrouwelijke statushouders in beide gemeenten, luidt de centrale vraag als volgt: “Wat
is de invloed van zowel de Rotterdamse- als de Amsterdamse aanpak op de economische
verzelfstandiging van vrouwelijke statushouders, hoe valt dit te verklaren en welke
mogelijkheden zijn er om de effectiviteit van beleid inzake de economische verzelfstandiging
van vrouwelijke statushouders te verbeteren?”.
Om antwoord te kunnen geven op de centrale vraag is gebruik gemaakt van
literatuuronderzoek, bestaande documenten en evaluaties, respondenten, secundaire analyses,
raadsvergaderingen en de aangeleverde documenten door de respondenten. Uit de resultaten
van het onderzoek is naar voren gekomen dat statushouders vaker economisch zelfstandig zijn
onder invloed van de Amsterdamse aanpak dan door de Rotterdamse aanpak. Doordat bij de
evaluaties geen onderscheid wordt gemaakt tussen mannelijke en vrouwelijke statushouders,
is het niet mogelijk om een harde uitspraak te doen over de economische verzelfstandiging
van de vrouwelijke statushouders in beide gemeenten. Het is wel duidelijk geworden dat de
invloed van zowel de Rotterdamse- als de Amsterdamse aanpak op de economische
verzelfstandiging van vrouwelijke statushouders minimaal is. Aangezien de prikkel vanuit de
Participatiewet is om op de man in te zetten, omdat deze vaak eerder in de gemeente
gevestigd is en meer kans heeft op een snelle uitstroom uit de bijstand, wordt weinig
specifieke aandacht gegeven aan de vrouwelijke statushouder en blijft de arbeidsparticipatie
hiervan achter.
Er wordt dan ook aangeraden aan de gemeenten Rotterdam en Amsterdam om bij de
evaluaties onderscheid te maken tussen mannelijke en vrouwelijke statushouders om zo
inzicht te verkrijgen in de integratie en participatie van hen in de samenleving. Daarnaast
moet de prikkel van het beleid verwijderd worden om enkel te focussen op de mannelijke
statushouder en moet er ook naar het emancipatiebeleid gekeken worden om de economische
verzelfstandiging van de vrouwelijke statushouder te bevorderen. Verder moet ingezet
worden op intensieve begeleiding, maatwerk en specifieke trajecten voor de vrouwelijke
statushouder en moet er een consistente reflectie plaatsvinden van het eigen beleid waarbij
verschillende vormen van leren gebruikt worden. Tot slot wordt aanbevolen om niet te
eigenwijs te zijn om van andere gemeenten te leren, aangezien dit bevorderlijk is voor de
effectiviteit van het beleid.",

De verbondenheid van toegang tot ICT-infrastructuur (Van der Meer & Van Winden (2003) en de institutionele dimensie van ICT-infrastructuur komt naar voren wat impact heeft op het type ICT-infrastructuur. Zoals een stadsarchief wat ingebed zit in de gemeentelijke IT-infrastructuur en hierdoor minder keuzevrijheid van systemen ondervindt. Het belang van digitale conservering komt als conditie naar voren om de ICT-infrastructuur in stand te houden.
De organisatorische factor heeft geen directe relatie met ICT-implementatie terwijl een hoge aanwezigheid van Maturiteit van Communicatie en Maturiteit van Vaardigheden vanuit het Strategic Alignment Maturity Model (SAMM) van Luftman (in Khaiata & Zualkernan, 2009) aanwezig is. De kwalitatieve resultaten wijzen op een zichtbare relatie van de institutionele dimensie op de besluitvorming en het proces van de ICT-implementatie. De uit-beleid-voortvloeiende beoordelingscriteria voor subsidie brengen echter tegenstrijdigheden met zich mee voor het proces van de ICT-implementatie aangezien de impact van de zichtbaarheid van collecties niet naar voren kan worden gebracht.",
Het ontwerpen van beleidsvorming. Een evenwichtsoefening.,Wouter Schramel,2020-08-18,"['Prof.dr. M. Fenger', 'Dr. Ir. J. Eshuis']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In Nederland groeit het streven om de arbeidsmarkt inclusiever te maken. Ook de
regering heeft op dit vlak initiatief genomen. In 2015 trad de Participatiewet in werking.
Deze wet herstructureerde het beleidsveld rond de inclusieve arbeidsmarkt. De wet is
erop toegespitst om meer mensen met een arbeidsbeperking aan het werk te krijgen bij
reguliere werkgevers. Het nieuwe beleid kent echter nog wel gebreken. Niet alle doelen
die de overheid zichzelf heeft opgelegd zijn gehaald. Ook is een belangrijk
vernieuwingsvoorstel niet gerealiseerd. Op nationaal, regionaal en lokaal niveau bestaan
er dan ook meerdere initiatieven om het beleid te verbeteren. Dit gaat echter niet zonder
slag of stoot. Het beleidsveld is complex en beleidsvormingsprocessen zijn weerbarstig.
Zo is een nationaal initiatief gestopt omdat hier onvoldoende draagvlak voor was.
Beleidsmakers proberen beleid nu meer met innovatieve wijze vorm te geven. Dit doen
zij steeds vaker via “interactieve” beleidsvormingsprocessen waarbij meerdere
belanghebbenden worden betrokken om beleid in samenspraak vorm te geven.
Dit onderzoek is een kwalitatieve casusstudie over één van deze interactieve
beleidsvormingsprocessen. Het analyseert het ontwerp van dit beleidsvormingsproces.
Hiermee operationaliseert het onderzoek een variabele met praktische waarde. Het
ontwerp kan immers gepland en uitgestippeld worden. Het is een aspect waar
beleidsvormers controle op kunnen uitoefenen. Dit onderzoek analyseert hoe het ontwerp
van het beleidsvormingsproces de houding van belanghebbenden beïnvloedt. De houding
van belanghebbenden bleek al eerder van cruciaal belang binnen het beleidsveld. Er
bestaan binnen het beleidsveld diverse afhankelijkheidsrelaties tussen de overheid en de
belanghebbenden. Succesvol beleid valt of staat daardoor mede door de houding en
steun vanuit belanghebbenden.
Het ontwerp van het beleidsvormingsproces bleek van wezenlijke invloed op de
houding van belanghebbenden. Het droeg bij diverse belanghebbenden positief en
negatief bij aan de houding tegenover beleid. In alle gevallen kwam dit doordat het
beleidsvormingsproces ‘interactief’ was, of juist niet interactief genoeg was.
Dit onderzoek wijst echter ook uit dat een ‘interactief’ ontwerp niet zonder meer
geschikter is dan een conventioneel ‘klassiek’ ontwerp. Belanghebbenden dichten aan
beide stijlen verschillende kwaliteiten toe. Het onderzoek zoomt in op elf ontwerpkeuzes.
Het laat zien dat er bij diverse keuzes spanningen bestaan tussen verschillende
kwaliteiten. Een interactieve stijl stimuleert bijvoorbeeld de gepercipieerde
representativiteit, terwijl dit ten koste zou gaan van gepercipieerde efficiëntie. De
laatstgenoemde werd juist geassocieerd met een klassieke stijl. De ontwerper heeft
daardoor de taak om bij iedere ontwerpkeuze een balans op te maken: Welke evenwicht
tussen kwaliteiten past bij het proces waar ik naar streef? Het onderzoek geeft inzicht in
de spanningen die ontstonden bij het beleidsvormingsproces in casu.",

Gender Identity and Different Feminist Discourses in Beyoncé’s Music","Rizos, George",2020-08-17,['Borges Lima L.A.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","We live in a time when human rights are still not given and minorities, namely
anyone who does not belong to the white Western cigendered male universe. Feminism
has played a fundamental role in changing regime of patriarchy and achieve equality
between humans in all the levels. Throughout the years, feminism has been influencing
people according to different societal needs and the changing times. That led to the
emergence of several different waves and types of feminism, such as postfeminism,
black feminism and popular feminism. Especially, media have played a critical role in the
emergence of all those kinds of feminism since they constituted the source of the need
of feminism since they function as a lifestyle resource with anything follows, such as the
representation of femininity and the female body in different media texts.
In this research I am presenting different notions of feminism and how those
evolved throughout the time. Following that I am focusing on how femininity is
represented in the popular music industry aiming to understand how different feminist
discourses and the female body is portrayed in Beyoncé’s music. Beyonce is amongst
the most influential personalities worldwide and has been for years a huge supporter of
feminism dealing with issues of gender and societal construction of femininity and black
womanhood. She along with her husband, Jay-Z, have built a colossus in the global
music industry, hence they are always on the spotlight of not only the fans but also the
critics. Scholars and theorists of feminism, amongst them the radical feminist bell hooks,
have been targeting Beyonce for years with the accusation that she cannot be a
representative of feminism because of being hypersexualized, objectifying the female
body, idealizing the institution of family and barely having knowledge of black
femininity. And all those accusations are built on the base that She is trying to build a
feminist persona through capitalist practices.
In this research I am analyzing ten music videos of Beyonce’s discography from
2010 to 2016 in order to understand how different feminist discourses are represented
in her work through the method of Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis through the
eyes of Cultural Studies in my attempt to reach to the conclusion of whether and how
she manages to promote a balanced kind of femininity and create her own, in a sense,

Meta governors as guardians of legitimacy: a theoretical fairy tale or not?,Cas Bulder,2020-08-10,"['Prof. dr. Darren McCauley', 'Dr Asya Pisarevskaya']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"An increasing amount of complex societal issues like COVID-19, Climate change or the banking crisis require governments to more often rely on institutional relations with society to address these problems. These institutional relations are in this research defined as governance networks. However, in these networks decision making processes shift from formal democratic arena’s to informal networks. Different perceptions are found about what this means for democratic legitimacy, thereby providing different norms about how legitimacy in these networks should look like. Furthermore, scholars point towards the crucial role of meta-governors, who via various shaping and steering methods should ensure safeguarding of legitimacy in governance networks. This role is often bestowed on politicians or administrators, but scholars remain sceptical about their capability of democratising networks due to several identified barriers. In addition, as the debate about democratic legitimacy remains unlinked from the application of meta-governance it is unclear how the different norms stemming from the perceptions are reflected in how meta-governors set out to democratise networks.
Therefore this research set out to link these debates and study what role meta-governors’ perceptions about democratic legitimacy might have in how they shape networks to become democratic. Thereby exploring which theoretical norms are found in their perceptions and if democratic norms are the dominant factor in meta-governors’ democratising strategies. By interviewing meta-governors and analysing documents in the context of the Dutch National Climate Agreement several insights are provided. While a group of administrative, political and independent meta-governors has managed to provide a full-fledged meta-governance strategy aimed at democratising the NCA, their perceptions show that critical dilemmas of the theoretical debate are evaded. Furthermore, the role meta-governors give to Parliament seems to have directly influenced the design of the agreement. However, regarding other choices in the managing and shaping of the agreement trade-offs between effectiveness and legitimacy are identified. Though the perceptions about democratic legitimacy are reflected in meta-governors’ strategies, effectiveness arguments thus also have a role.
Although the conclusions of this study might be more indicative than providing empirical prove, in the valuation of the democratising capacity of meta-governance it is vital to take this role of effectiveness into account. Future research would do well to further explore the role of effectiveness and perceptions about democratic legitimacy in the application of democratising meta-governance strategies.",
Aanpakken is ook soms loslaten,Hedi Westerduin,2020-08-10,"['Prof.dr. A. van Buuren', 'M. M. J. Hermus MSc']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"De gemeente Rotterdam heeft een belangrijke taak op het gebied van de gezondheid van haar inwoners. Echter, veel factoren die van invloed zijn op de gezondheid van Rotterdammers bevinden zich ook buiten de directe invloedsfeer van de gemeente of het volksgezondheidsbeleid. Deze invloeden spelen zich af op het snijvlak tussen verschillende organisaties, die over de nodige kennis en middelen beschikken om verschillende determinanten van gezondheid te beïnvloeden. Om meer impact te hebben heeft de gemeente Rotterdam het netwerk Gezond010 opgezet, waarin de samenwerking wordt gezocht met (maatschappelijke) organisaties, bedrijven en initiatieven voor een gezonder Rotterdam voor álle inwoners.
In de hedendaagse netwerksamenleving gaat overheidssturing steeds vaker niet meer alleen uit van regievoering, maar van het opnieuw uitvinden van verhoudingen met andere actoren. De opkomst van netwerksturing als sleutelbegrip in het publieke domein, betreft een onderzoeksveld waarin nog veel te ontdekken is. Het creëren van een netwerk is een relatief nieuwe aanpak voor de gemeente Rotterdam. Netwerksamenwerking omvat een interactief proces, en heeft gevolgen voor de wijze waarop de gemeente opereert. Met Gezond010 geeft de gemeente sturing door partijen te samen te brengen en uitwisseling te stimuleren. De gemeente kan deze beweging deels in gang zetten en ondersteunen, maar de inzet en energie van andere partijen is nodig om netwerkdoelen te realiseren. De ambitie is om duurzame netwerkrelaties te creëren en de samenwerking met- en tussen netwerkpartners te versterken. De gemeente streeft naar een invulling van haar rol binnen het netwerk die dit proces activeert en ondersteunt. De centrale vraagstelling die hier uit voortkomt luidt als volgt: Op welke manier geeft de gemeente Rotterdam haar rol in het netwerk Gezond010 vorm, in hoeverre past deze rol bij de kenmerken van dit netwerk en op welke wijze kan deze rol worden geoptimaliseerd?",
We are all Zurich!,Tine  de Bruin,2020-08-10,"['Dr. M. van Ostaijen', 'Dr. M. Schiller']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This research answers the request of local actors in Amsterdam who seek insights in advocacy strategies to extend the function of the municipal city card improving the position of undocumented residents in their city. This request falls into the context of a growing number of ‘solidarity cities’ facing the challenges of restrictive national immigration regimes resulting in a growing undocumented population. The need for exchange of knowledge and experience amongst cities has been highlighted by several academics. In order to provide the actors in Amsterdam with concrete recommendations, the advocacy for a city card in Zurich has been researched. On the 31st of October 2018 the municipal parliament in Zurich voted in favor of the implementation of the Zueri City Card.
The Zueri City Card is a city pass that aims for legal, political, social, and cultural participation of all people living in the same city irrespective of their nationality and of their residence permit. The outcome in the parliament is a result of years of advocacy by urban actors.
Guided by the Advocacy Coalition Framework, this research identifies the involved actors and their form of cooperation. It sheds light on the resources that have been used to employ various strategies. This has been done based on interviews with the key actors that were involved during this advocacy process. From this study it can be concluded the involvement of a diverse group of actors with various backgrounds, professions and expertise have served as an important foundation. Through these people, the coalition had access to deep knowledge as well as important networks. The most important contributions came from academics, a migration lawyer, the head of the SPAZ and members of the municipal parliament. The last group enabled direct access to the municipal parliament where intense lobbying campaigns took place. This research also shows how the actors have continuously adapted their strategies to the context in which they were working. They have taken into account the timing of their proposal, the sensitivity of the topic and the drastic new way of thinking they promoted.",
Unending Puzzle,Mert Türkmen,2020-08-10,"['Dr Asya Pisarevskaya', 'Dr.I. van Breugel']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Incessant arguments and discussions regarding the legal status of Syrians and the policies addressed to them are the basic point of the origins of this study. The temporariness and vagueness of the legal status is stressed as the leading puzzle that opens the identities and imagery of Syrians to unceasing negotiations. Being one of the primary areas which circumscribes the policymaking and implementation processes, discursive sphere is considered as a substantial environment where the “symbolic politics” and “social constructions of target populations” are prominently manifested and affected the policy changes. Constant alterations and oscillations between the different framings of Syrian immigrants are simultaneously followed by transformations in policy implementation. A significant inference in this study that the policy implementation is quite flexible and malleable that social constructions of target groups can be heavily influential in legitimizing the policy programs is derived from the empirical observation. This research initiates the empirical study by carefully selecting the relevant newspaper narratives and the statements of governmental elites, which are considered to be the preeminent directors of the social constructions and eventually the changes in the implementation of the policies. ‘Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)’ is used as the primary method in order to understand the power relations between elites and the Syrian population, which is concretized with the policy approaches mostly against the favor of Syrians. This paper discusses the tangible effects of social construction of target groups to two interrelated policy implementations, which are “resettlement” and “voluntary repatriation”, with a qualitative approach based on interpretation of social framing, contextual determinants and the policy outcomes.","['Social constructions', 'Policy implementation', 'Discursive practices', 'Resettlement', 'Voluntary repatriation']"

Ook de voordelen die mensen ervaren bij het opgeven van privacy hebben een positief effect op de mate waarin mensen bereid zijn data te delen.

KENNISGEBRUIK IN DE PUBLIEKE SECTOR,Faith Dodi Rusmianto,2020-08-10,"['Prof. dr. P.W.A. Scholten', 'Dr. Ir. J. Eshuis']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Dit afstudeeronderzoek betreft een kwalitatieve, vergelijkende casestudie, waarin inzicht wordt gegeven in de toepassing van wetenschappelijke kennis binnen de Nederlandse beleidscontext. Er is onderzocht of de institutionalisering van beleidsevaluatie van invloed is op kennisgebruik binnen drie ministeries. De context waarin dit is onderzocht, is de interdepartementale operatie ‘Inzicht in Kwaliteit’. Hiermee wil het kabinet een effectiever overheidsbeleid bereiken. Dit wordt gerealiseerd door meer inzicht te creëren in de doelmatigheid en doeltreffendheid van het beleid en door verbetering van het evaluatiestelsel (Houppermans, 2018). Daarnaast draagt de operatie bij aan algemene bewustwording over het belang van de beginselen, geregeld in de vernieuwde Comptabiliteitswet 3.1. De wet schrijft voor dat ieder beleidsvoorstel is voorzien van een toelichting op het beoogde doel; en wat de doelmatigheid en doeltreffendheid is (Ministerie van Financiën, 2017). Eerst is een extensief literatuuronderzoek verricht om inzicht te krijgen in de bestaande theorieën over kennisgebruik en de institutionalisering van beleidsevaluatie. Binnen wetenschappelijk onderzoek worden bevindingen vergeleken met normen en referentiewaarden. Door deze vergelijking wordt wetenschappelijke bewijslast (scientific evidence) gegenereerd. Als er sprake is van consensus over de beredenering en discussie van het wetenschappelijke bewijs, spreken we over wetenschappelijke kennis (Damman, 2018). Een korte omschrijving van wetenschappelijke kennis, is kennis die voortvloeit uit wetenschappelijk verricht onderzoek. Kennis is dan het resultaat van systematische analyses van huidige en eerdere omstandigheden en trends; en de analyse van causale relaties die de omstandigheden en trends verklaren (Head, 2008). Op basis van het gemodificeerde ‘Knowledge, evidence, information and data’-raamwerk van Damman (2018) kan worden gesteld dat kennis een vorm van wetenschappelijk bewijs is, daarom wordt in dit onderzoek ook ingegaan op het onderscheid tussen evidence-based en evidence-informed beleidsformulering.
Voor de methodologische verantwoording van dit onderzoek is gebruik gemaakt van de casestudie literatuur van Yin (2012). De dataverzameling bestond allereerst uit een uitgebreide kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse, per case zijn er documenten verzameld om te analyseren. Vervolgens zijn er interviews afgenomen met medewerkers van drie verschillende ministeries die direct betrokken zijn bij de operatie ‘Inzicht in Kwaliteit’. De interviewtranscripten zijn geanalyseerd conform de fasering van Burnard (1991). Doel van de interviews was om de bevindingen vanuit de inhoudsanalyse in de context te plaatsen.
Belangrijke resultaten waren: 1) In de dagelijkse praktijk wordt niet vaak stilgestaan bij het belang van de bepalingen in CW 3.1, want de naleving van de wet gebeurt onbewust, 2) Ambtenaren zijn zich bewust van het belang van kennis in de onderbouwing van beleidsvoorstellen, maar hier wordt niet altijd naar gehandeld. De conclusie luidt dat er niet kan worden bepaald of de institutionalisering van beleidsevaluatie (CW 3.1) van invloed is op kennisgebruik binnen de ministeries. Op basis hiervan zijn er twee aanbevelingen gedaan: 1) Bewustwording creëren over het belang van CW 3.1 en de rol van kennis, 2) Het onderzoek nogmaals uitvoeren in de vorm van een longitudinaal onderzoek, aangevuld met een particperence observatie.","['wetenschappelijke kennis', 'kennisgebruik', 'institutionalisering beleidsevaluatie', 'evidence-based', 'evidence-informed', 'beleidseffectiviteit']"

Eshuis']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This thesis investigates the factors that affect the policy transfer regarding circular economy between Turkey and the Netherlands and analyses the role of consular diplomacy within this context.
Many governments nowadays are looking for ways to turn their linear economy into a circular one. The European Commission recently introduced the New Grean Deal, to accelerate Europe's transition to a CE. At the same time, the Netherlands has drawn up its own Circular Economy Action Plan to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050. Both plans stress the importance of international cooperation.
Policy transfer is a method used to transfer policy and knowledge from one context to another. In recent years, the increase in globalisation in particular has highlighted the importance of international cooperation for complex problems, such as the transition to a circular economy. This is also emphasised in the Circular Economy Action Plan of the Netherlands, which aims to have a fully circular economy by 2050. Since 2018, the Dutch Consulate
- General in Istanbul has been carrying out activities regarding the transfer of Dutch expertise on circular economy to Turkey. However, this is a process that is uncertain given the differences between the countries. As a result, there is a need for insight into the opportunities and obstacles that arise during this process.
By means of document analysis and 15 in-depth interviews, insight has been gained into the dimensions of the CE-policy transfer process between Turkey and the Netherlands. In each dimension, factors that have an effect on the process were examined. Existing studies on policy transfer provide virtually no insight into how factors affect each other; there is also a lack of insight into the role of consular diplomacy within this process. For example, the research showed that dimensions such as the current environment are not independent but also depend on factors within other dimensions. The research resulted in a framework in which it is indicated how the dimensions: actor motive, current environment, actor relationship and consular diplomacy, affect the degree of adoption, the type of transfer and thus the policy transfer process. To what extent the policy transfer leads to the actual realization of circular economy in Turkey, has yet to be discovered on the basis of a long-term study.",

Voorwoord

Beste lezer,
Voor u ligt mijn masterscriptie ter afronding van de bestuurskundige master Governance en Management van Complexe Systemen aan de Erasmus Universiteit in Rotterdam. Aan het begin van het scriptietraject brak het coronavirus uit, wat ertoe leidde dat de samenleving in een erg ongewone en onzekere tijd terecht kwam. Vanaf het begin af aan was het duidelijk dat het niet slechts een lichte vorm van griep was die met een aantal weken wel weer zou verdwijnen. In plaats daarvan kwamen er grote veranderingen in de vorm van veiligheidsmaatregelen voor de Nederlandse samenleving die tot op het heden nog steeds van toepassing zijn en zelfs nog worden aangescherpt. Desalniettemin veroorzaakte deze situatie veel nieuwsgierigheid bij mij naar de complexe gevolgen die deze crisis teweeg kon brengen en de wijze waarop mogelijke belemmeringen op een bestuurskundige manier opgelost kunnen worden. Ondanks de hectiek rondom het virus is mijn ervaring van het afgelopen studiejaar wel degelijk positief. De master Governance en Management van Complexe Systemen sloot volledig aan op mijn interesses, wat mij zeker geholpen heeft bij het bestuderen van de verschillende onderwerpen. Ik heb dit jaar dan ook veel geleerd en kijk er naar uit om deze kennis in de praktijk toe te passen.
Dankzij Stichting Zorginstellingen Pieter van Foreest, waar ik voorheen drie jaar werkzaam ben geweest, heb ik de kans gekregen om onderzoek te doen in een organisatie waar de impact en gevolgen van de coronacrisis onvermijdelijk waren. Ik wil daarom mijn voormalig leidinggevende, bestuurssecretaris Martin de Groot, en het bestuur van Pieter van Foreest bedanken voor de leerzame kans en de ruimte die ik heb gekregen om individueel onderzoek te doen binnen de organisatie. Daarnaast hoop ik dat mijn scriptie een goede bijdrage kan leveren voor de organisatie. Vervolgens wil ik de bevlogen en spontane respondenten bedanken die dit onderzoek uiteindelijk mogelijk hebben gemaakt, doordat zij zelfs in een periode waarin tijd schaars is bereid waren mij te helpen met dit onderzoek. Ten slotte wil ik graag mijn scriptiebegeleider José Nederhand bedanken voor haar goede begeleiding en feedback bij de uitvoering van dit onderzoek en het schrijven van de scriptie. Bovendien ben ik haar enorm dankbaar voor haar geduld en vertrouwen, waardoor ik het onderzoek en de scriptie op mijn eigen tempo heb kunnen uitvoeren en hierdoor de mentale rust heb kunnen bewaren. 
Ik wens u veel plezier met het lezen van deze scriptie.

Abstract
Door de toenemende verbondenheid op de wereld, wordt de hedendaagse samenleving steeds complexer. Dit zorgt er echter voor dat specifieke gebeurtenissen invloed kunnen uitoefenen over de hele wereld, waardoor de kans op crisissen aanzienlijk toeneemt. De coronapandemie geeft weer in welke hoedanigheid een dergelijke crisissituatie tot abrupte veranderingen kan leiden voor mens en organisatie. De maatregelen die ingesteld zijn om de verspreiding van het coronavirus tegen te gaan, zijn binnen veel verschillende soorten organisaties in het beleid opgenomen. Naarmate de tijd vordert kunnen binnen deze organisaties de percepties van de beleidsuitvoerende medewerkers ten opzichte van het beleid veranderen, waardoor zij machteloosheid, zinloosheid of onverenigbaarheid van de verschillende belangen kunnen ervaren ten aanzien van de maatregelen en van het beleid vervreemden. Binnen deze casestudy wordt er echter onderzocht op welke wijze transactioneel-, transformationeel-, interpersoonlijk-, ondernemend- en netwerkleiderschap invloed kunnen uitoefenen op de mate van beleidsvervreemding. Door het afnemen van semigestructureerde interviews onder vijf leidinggevenden en tien beleidsuitvoerende medewerkers, zijn de verwachtingen en ervaringen met betrekking tot de toegepaste leiderschapsstijlen verzameld en geanalyseerd. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat transactioneel leiderschap een positieve invloed uitoefent op de toenemende mate van beleidsvervreemding. Dit komt doordat de medewerkers geen enkele mate van inspraak ervaren bij de uitvoering van deze leiderschapsstijl. Daarnaast is er veel onduidelijkheid met betrekking tot de zingeving van de maatregelen en wordt er geen aandacht geschonken aan de belangen van de medewerkers. De overige leiderschapsstijlen hebben een negatieve invloed op de mate van beleidsvervreemding. Bij transformationeel leiderschap hebben de medewerkers niet zozeer directe inspraak. Daarentegen wordt er wel aandacht geschonken aan persoonlijke behoeften, waardoor de medewerkers ervaren dat zij enige vorm van invloed kunnen uitoefenen in het vertegenwoordigen van de belangen. Daarnaast wordt er ingespeeld op persoonlijke belangen om medewerkers te overtuigen of motiveren, waardoor de zingeving ten opzichte van de maatregelen toeneemt. Bij interpersoonlijk leiderschap worden de medewerkers actief betrokken bij de besluitvorming rondom de maatregelen, waardoor zij veel inspraak ervaren. Bovendien is interpersoonlijk leiderschap gericht op de intieme relatie tussen de leidinggevende en de werknemers, waardoor de zingeving van de maatregelen eenvoudiger overgebracht kan worden en er vrijwel geen belangenconflicten ontstaan. Bij ondernemend leiderschap is het van belang dat er voldoende middelen beschikbaar zijn om de maatregelen uit te kunnen voeren. Indien het voor de medewerkers niet duidelijk is of er voldoende middelen beschikbaar zijn, zullen zij na verloop van tijd vervreemden van het beleid. Ten slotte is netwerk leiderschap gericht op het verbinden van de verschillende partijen, waardoor zij gezamenlijk in gesprek kunnen gaan om specifieke situaties te bespreken of van elkaar te leren. Doordat er de ruimte is om direct in gesprek te gaan met de andere partijen wordt er meer inspraak ervaren, neemt de zingeving van de maatregelen toe en ontstaan er minder belangenconflicten. Op basis van de conclusie van dit onderzoek wordt er aanbevolen om: 1) actief na te vragen bij de medewerkers op welke manier zij de maatregelen ervaren, 2) de leiderschapsstijlen op periodieke wijze af te stemmen op de situatie en de verschillende niveaus binnen de organisatie, en 3) Ten alle tijden voldoende middelen beschikbaar te maken voor de uitvoering van het beleid en de medewerkers van de beschikbaarheid op de hoogte te stellen.",
Strategieën voor strategie,Manon Maatkamp,2020-08-10,"['Prof.dr. M. van der Steen', 'Dr. R. Warsen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In dit onderzoek zijn vijf strategieperspectieven op het verkrijgen van betrokkenheid van lijnmanagers aan de strategie onderzocht. Het onderzoek vond plaats in de context van het Voortgezet Onderwijs (VO). Meer specifiek vormden drie middelbare scholen binnen de Scholengroep Rijk van Nijmegen (SGRvN) het onderzoeksveld. De hoofdvraag luidde als volgt: “Welke strategieperspectieven zijn werkzaam om betrokkenheid van lijnmanagers aan de strategie te verkrijgen?” De strategieperspectieven die hiervoor gekozen zijn, komen uit het onderzoek van Twist en Van der Steen (2018). Daarbij verwijst een strategieperspectief naar de wijze waarop een strategie-beoefenaar strategie benadert, vanuit de betekenis die hij eraan toekent en vanuit een bepaalde overtuiging hoe hij strategie het beste kan doen. 
De vijf strategieperspectieven zijn: (i) het rationeel-expert perspectief: strategie is een weloverwogen, nauwkeurig en geïntegreerd lange termijnplan of stappenplan, (ii) het visionair leiderschapsperspectief: strategie is een inspirerende visie die de strateeg uitdraagt, (iii) het sensemaking-perspectief: strategie is het ontwikkelen van gedeelde betekenis door interactie tussen betrokkenen, (iv) het political-game perspectief: strategie is een onderhandeling met belanghebbenden om een (winnende) coalitie te smeden die nodig is om een doel te bereiken, en (v) capaciteitsopbouwende perspectief: strategie is het opbouwen van de capaciteit om te kunnen reageren op nog onbekende opkomende veranderingen in de omgeving (Van Twist & Van der Steen, 2018: 9).Elk van de vijf strategieperspectieven kan de strategie-beoefenaar inzetten om andere organisatieleden in beweging te brengen, maar elk perspectief beschouwt de relatie tussen strategie-beoefenaar en de organisatieleden wel op een andere manier (Van Twist & Van der Steen, 2018). Echter, organisatieleden bewegen alleen als zij zich betrokken voelen bij de strategie (George, et al., 2018). Daarbij kan de cognitieve stijl van een individuele lijnmanager voorspellen in welke mate hij betrokken is bij de strategie en de strategie overbrengt naar de publieke professionals. Daarom beschouwt dit onderzoek de cognitieve stijl als modererende variabele in de relatie tussen het inzetten van het strategieperspectief en het verkrijgen van betrokkenheid aan de strategie,
In dit onderzoek worden de drie verschillende cognitieve stijlen: de knowing style, de planning style en de creating style, geïntroduceerd door Cools en Van den Broeck (2007), onderscheiden. De individuele cognitieve stijl bepaalt op welke manier een individu stimuli waarneemt en hoe hij deze informatie gebruikt om zijn gedrag te sturen.  Het concept verwijst dus naar een gewoonlijk patroon of voorkeurswijze. Specifiek voor dit onderzoek is de relatie bestudeerd wat de invloed is van het strategieperspectief dat de strategisch manager inzet en de cognitieve stijlen van de lijnmanagers, op de betrokkenheid van lijnmanagers aan de strategie. 
Er zijn voor dit onderzoek 28 interviews afgenomen op drie verschillende middelbare scholen, met: drie strategisch managers, negen lijnmanagers en zestien docenten. Op die manier is meer inzicht ontstaan in de vraag hoe strategie-beoefenaars door het strategieperspectief dat zij inzetten eraan kunnen bijdragen dat lijnmanagers betrokkenheid verkrijgen aan de strategie. 
In tabel 1 zijn de belangrijkste bevindingen uit dit onderzoek weergeven. Te zien is dat het sensemaking-perspectief, al dan niet in samenhang met het visionair leiderschapsperspectief is ingezet door twee strategisch managers (case X en Z). De andere strategisch manager (case Y) zet het visionair leiderschapsperspectief in, maar het lukt hem niet om zijn ideeën over een goede strategie over te dragen op de lijnmanagers (Van Twist & Van der Steen, 2018). Dit is wel belangrijk binnen het visionair leiderschapsperspectief, waardoor ik stel in mijn onderzoek dat hij dit strategieperspectief niet goed inzet. 
De lijnmanagers uit case Y geven aan dat de wijze waarop het strategieproces nu vorm krijgt, niet past bij hen. Dit lijkt te maken te hebben met het niet goed inzetten van het visionair leiderschapsperspectief door de strategisch manager, maar ook door de cognitieve stijlen van de individuele lijnmanagers. De twee lijnmanagers (R12; R14) geven namelijk aan geen ruimte te krijgen om eigen ideeën te introduceren, terwijl zij dat wel graag willen. Dit past bij individuen met een creating style. Daarbij blijkt ook uit de bevindingen dat de lijnmanagers met een creating style zelfs enige weerstand bieden tegen de strategie door de strategie bewust niet over te brengen. Lijnmanager (R13) geeft aan gebaat te zijn bij meer structuur in het strategieproces, omdat hij nu niet precies weet wanneer er wat moet gebeuren. Bij deze lijnmanager zijn meer eigenschappen van een planning style te herkennen. 
Daarbij stellen alle publieke professionals in deze case stellen dat de strategie niet bij hen aankomt. Op basis van al deze bevindingen blijkt dat door het niet goed inzetten van het visionair leiderschapsperspectief en de cognitieve stijlen van de lijnmanagers, geen geslaagde combinatie ontstaat voor het verkrijgen van betrokkenheid aan de strategie. 
De lijnmanagers in case X, die vallen onder de strategisch manager die het sensemaking-perspectief combineert met het visionair leiderschapsperspectief (R1), blijken niet allemaal betrokkenheid te vertonen aan de strategie. Dit is opvallend, aangezien alle lijnmanagers wel aangeven dat het strategieproces zoals dat vorm krijgt door het strategieperspectief dat de strategisch manager inzet, past bij de wijze waarop zij graag werken.  De lijnmanagers met een planning style (R3; R4) vertonen wel betrokkenheid aan de strategie, aangezien zij de strategie ook overbrengen naar de publieke professionals. De lijnmanager (R2) met eigenschappen van zowel een planning style als knowing style (R2) vertoont geen betrokkenheid aan de strategie. Door bevraging van de publieke professionals (R5-R7) blijkt dat deze lijnmanager de strategie niet overbrengt naar de publieke professionals. Dit kan te maken hebben met de combinatie van zijn cognitieve stijlen, aangezien George et al. (2018) stellen dat de cognitieve stijl van een individuele lijnmanager kan voorspellen in welke mate hij betrokken is bij de strategie en de strategie overbrengt naar de publieke professionals. Toch neemt het onderzoek van George et al. (2018) geen combinaties van cognitieve stijlen in acht, waardoor dit ook niet direct te verklaren is vanuit hun theorie. 
Uit case Z blijkt dat lijnmanagers (R34; R24) eigenschappen hebben van een planning style, terwijl lijnmanager (R22) meer eigenschappen benoemt die vallen onder een knowing style. Dit levert wel een geslaagde combinatie op, aangezien alle lijnmanagers aangeven dat het strategieproces past bij hen en alle publieke professionals aangeven dat de lijnmanagers de strategie overbrengen. Daarmee geven de bevindingen een voorzichtige indicatie dat het sensemaking-perspectief en de planning style en knowing style een geslaagde combinatie zijn.",
Vaardigheden van onzichtbare leiders,Bas Hut,2020-08-10,"['Dr. N. Cannaerts', 'Prof.dr. A. J. Steijn']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Het fenomeen lobbyisme heeft in de journalistiek altijd veel aandacht gekregen. Zo zou de lobbysector weinig transparant zijn en zouden lobbyorganisaties veel politieke macht hebben. Echter, er blijkt relatief weinig wetenschappelijk onderzoek te zijn gedaan de vraag hoe een effectieve lobby in de praktijk tot stand komt. Wel blijkt uit de bestaande onderzoeken dat leiderschap een bepalende factor is. De centrale vraag binnen het exploratieve onderzoek luidt dan ook:
 		´Hoe dragen leiderschapsskills bij aan een effectieve lobby?´
Om adequaat antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag zijn er 17 semigestructureerde diepte-interviews gehouden met lobbyisten van de Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken. Deze organisatie behartigt de gemeenschappelijke belangen van Nederlandse en buitenlandse banken die in Nederland actief zijn en treedt daarmee op als verbinder tussen de bankensector, politiek en maatschappij.
De kwalitatieve studie wees uit dat de kwaliteit van de relatie tussen lobbyist en besluitvormer het belangrijkste onderdeel is om tot een effectieve lobby te komen. Daarbij blijkt dat leiderschapsskills die zich richten op deze relatie als essentieel worden gezien. Er kan tenslotte worden geconcludeerd dat leiderschapsskills een indirect effect hebben op de effectiviteit van een lobby. Zo beïnvloedt de inzet en kwaliteit van leiderschapsskilss namelijk de relatie tussen lobbyist en besluitvormer, wat uiteindelijk effect heeft op het slagen van de lobby.
Op grond van de resultaten zijn de volgende beleidsaanbevelingen gedaan:
•	Aanbeveling 1: Reflecteer na elke gevoerde lobby. Voer eventueel een pilot uit met een uniform reflectieformulier 
•	Aanbeveling 2: Zet een digitaal contactsysteem op met besluitvormers dat naast, of tijdens crisissituaties in plaats van, fysieke afspraken kan fungeren
•	Aanbeveling 3: Verzelfstandig de politieke monitoring in een eigen afdeling binnen de afdeling public affairs","['lobbyisme', 'public affairs', 'leiderschapsskills', 'bankensector', 'beleidsbeïnvloeding en exploratief onderzoek']"
Het enige constante in het leven is verandering,Assia Messouli,2020-08-10,"['Dr. Ir. J. Eshuis', 'Dr. Jitske van Popering-Verkerk']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Het Nederlands kabinet heeft met het Klimaatakkoord het doel gesteld om in 2050 alle woningen op een duurzame manier te verwarmen. Dit betekent concreet dat woningen aardgasvrij worden gemaakt. De gemeente Den Haag probeert met het project ’10 energiewijken’ invulling te geven aan deze klimaatambities. Door het inzetten van verschillende strategieën probeert de gemeente burgers mee te krijgen in de transitie naar aardgasvrij wonen.  Echter, wordt de transitie pas een succes als er draagvlak is voor het nieuwe beleid en alle burgers bereid zijn om de verandering te omarmen. Dit geldt ook voor burgers die geen binding hebben met het onderwerp. Vaak zijn dit laagopgeleiden of ouderen. Om te achterhalen of de ingezette strategieën daadwerkelijk hun vruchten afwerpen, richt dit onderzoek zich op de invloed van veranderstrategieën op de veranderingsbereidheid en het commitment van laagopgeleide ouderen. De onderzoeksvraag die centraal staat in dit onderzoek luidt als volgt: Welke invloed hebben veranderstrategieën op de veranderingsbereidheid en het commitment van laagopgeleide ouderen voor de transitie naar aardgasvrij wonen?

Door het voeren van 15 semigestructureerde diepte-interviews met bewoners en ambtenaren is getracht de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden. Hierbij zijn de wijken Moerwijk-oost, Bouwlust-Vrederust en Mariahoeve als cases onderzocht. Uit dit kwalitatief onderzoek blijkt dat niet alle veranderstrategieën een invloed hebben op de veranderbereidheid. Vooral het willen en kunnen veranderen, worden beïnvloed door strategieën waar bewoners mee kunnen doen en denken. Dit zorgt voor commitment van bewoners.  Daarentegen heeft de veranderstrategie ontwijken geen invloed op de veranderbereidheid. Het niet willen veranderen, wordt hier namelijk mee versterkt.",

Om dit te onderzoeken is gebruik gemaakt van Q-methodologie, waarbij aan 32 deelnemers van co-creatieproject ‘Jij maakt de buurt!’ in Enschede 26 stellingen zijn voorgelegd over hun motivatie om te participeren in dit project.

Policy Learning in the Context of Wicked Policy Issues: A Case Study of Civic Integration Policy in Rotterdam,Leonieke  van Dordrecht,2020-08-10,"['Dr. M. Schiller', 'Dr. Asya Pisarevskaya']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In a case study of the Veranderopgave Inburgering at the municipality of Rotterdam, this thesis explores the influence of wickedness on policy learning at meso-level public organisations. Special attention is paid to the particular and politicized character of integration governance. Learning from fellow municipalities as well as learning from internal resources were identified as the most common forms of learning. Despite the fact that earlier integration systems, primarily the Deltaplan Inburgering, appeared as a valuable source of learning from experience, this thesis found that cross-departmental learning was perceived as a more common form of learning. Wickedness-related characteristics such as non-repeatability and non-computability are helpful in explaining these patterns. Furthermore, the wickedness characteristic of social fragmentation appeared useful in illustrating the impact of internal as well as external fragmentation of integration governance on the processes of policy learning. However, the most important influence on learning appeared to be political influence by way of determining the organisational and financial capacity, and in turn, the very ability of the municipality to function as a learning organisation. Moreover, political influence determined the receptiveness of the municipality towards knowledge and information. Thus, although political influence is generally recognized as an influence on learning in public organisations, it is helpful to pay attention to the combined insights of wickedness theory and scholarship on integration governance to develop a better understanding of policy learning in the Veranderopgave Inburgering and similar assignments in the future. This should contribute to the ability of the municipality, as an important actor in integration governance, to function as a learning organisation.",
"To belong or not to belong, that is the DACA question.",Emma Labovitz,2020-08-10,"['Dr. I. van Breugel', 'Dr. Asya Pisarevskaya']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This study looks at the relationship between shifts in policy and media framing of target groups (DACA recipients) and how these frames impacted DACA recipients’ sense of belonging and identity in the US. Through mapping shifts in frames grounded in Schneider and Ingram (1993) and Newton (2005, 2008) Lauby (2016), and Barbero (2019), this study found that the Obama Administration worked within the existing binary of framing DACA recipients as deserving through highlighting their youth, innocence, humanity, economic benefit, and pitting them against other irregular migrants to further emphasize their deservingness. The Trump Administration moved away from this through both overtly emphasizing DACA recipient’s illegality and covertly dehumanizing them through turning the policy into a political bargaining piece. This switch is reflected in the administration’s shift in policy with the rescinding of the DACA. As media generally echoed the political discourse, it did not have much of an impact on framing. This study found that while there was a clear shift in framing, framing per se had little direct impact on respondents’ sense of belonging and identity. Instead, it appeared that the effect of shifts in framing was indirect, impacting recipients’ sense of belonging by altering the publics’ perception of and behavior towards recipients.",
SCIENTIA POTENTIA EST?,Jurre Honkoop,2020-08-10,"['Dr. Julia Wittmayer', 'Dr. Ir. J. Eshuis']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Citizen Science (CS) has tried to find a place in the traditionally technocratic and centralized field of Dutch air quality policy for over a decade. CS has shown to be effective in engaging citizens with and educating them on the content and procedures of policy-making by engaging them in the scientific process. Yet, the reasons for and type of political impact of specific CS-projects merit further academic attention. This thesis integrates a typology of political impact of CS-projects into the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), and explores how the particular strengths of a CS-coalition and structure of a policy subsystem, relate to the type of political impact generated by a CS-coalition. To do so, 4 CS-projects in the realm of Dutch air quality policy are studied using a diverse cases design. The thesis finds that CS-coalitions come to make political impact through a process in which they establish and build particular strengths, either through gaining technical expertise, through forging ties with government authorities or other societal organizations, or through strengthening their legitimacy, and find a right mode of interaction with more or less collaborative governing coalitions. Within the technical constraints posed by the characteristics of the air quality policy field, governing coalitions decide to counter expected political impact by maintaining distance from the CS-coalition or through co-opting a CS-project or steer CS-work to benefit their own interests by working closely with a CS-coalition or by educating CS-participants from a distance. In collaborative policy subsystems CS-coalitions serve to gather public support for progressive air quality policy, come up with innovative data-based solutions for policy problems or function as a pilot and enabling actor for future forms of interactive governance. In case of lacking cooperation and political will or potential to accommodate wishes of CS-coalitions, CS-coalitions make an impact through changing the political agenda and mobilizing public pressure or through developing the scientific quality of CS-data. The thesis shows that knowledge gains value when politicized, especially in a highly centralized technocratic field such as the air quality field, where official data are not up for discussion, yet the political desirability of stricter norms and impacts of political decisions on people’s health and everyday lives, should be.",
Hoe inclusief is het uitdaagrecht?,Thyrza Eliasar,2020-08-09,"['Prof.dr. A. van Buuren', 'Prof.dr. M. Fenger']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Participatie komt steeds meer op in onze samenleving, zowel overheid als burger zien het steeds vaker als oplossing voor een tal van problemen. Tegelijkertijd zijn er ook negatieve geluiden te horen over de hoeveelheid en type mensen die betrokken worden bij participatie, dit gaat steeds vaker om een selectief groepje mensen, de participatie-elite, die keer op keer op andere manieren betrokken wordt en daardoor steeds meer politieke macht vergaart. 
	Deze scriptie kijkt naar het vraagstuk van deze inclusiviteit bij het uitdaagrecht. Hiernaar is gekeken met een brede blik, waarbij dus niet alleen aandacht is voor wie er een uitdaging indienen en hoe inclusief deze groep is, maar ook naar andere factoren. Zo wordt er ook gekeken naar wie er helpen bij de uitvoering, dit wordt het niveau van de uitvoerders genoemd. De groep mensen die een uitdaging indienen kan namelijk wel exclusief zijn, maar als zij bij de uitvoering een inclusieve groep betrekken is deze uitdaging alweer inclusiever. Vervolgens wordt er ook nog gekeken naar in hoeverre de uitdaging van de initiatiefnemer overeenkomt met de wensen en ideeën van de gemeenschap. Daarnaast wordt er aandacht besteedt aan of de groep mensen waarvoor de uitdaging bedoeld is inclusief is. Er wordt dus bekeken hoe representatief de uitdaging is voor de gemeenschap en in hoeverre de gemeenschap kan mee profiteren van de uitdaging. Deze twee samen zijn het niveau van de gemeenschap. 
	In deze scriptie wordt de inclusiviteit en de aanpak van drie gemeenten met elkaar vergeleken: Den Haag, Utrecht en Rotterdam. Dit resulteert in drie gemeenten die alle drie duidelijk andere keuzes maken en daarmee ook andere effecten genereren. Den Haag is vooral de gemeente die loslaat en daarmee de toegankelijkheid voor de initiatiefnemer niet verbetert. Ze houden daarmee wel genoeg ruimte voor het zelfregulerend vermogen van de initiatiefnemer om zelf in te gaan op de andere twee niveaus. De andere twee gemeenten zorgen allebei voor het verbeteren van de toegankelijkheid voor inwoners die een uitdaging willen indienen. Het grote verschil tussen deze twee typen van sturing komt voort uit waar deze gemeenten de toegevoegde waarde van het uitdaagrecht zien. Voor Utrecht zit de toegevoegde waarde van het uitdaagrecht vooral in het draagvlak en hier ligt dan ook hun focus op. Ze zien dat een uitdaging veel meer draagvlak kan genereren dan de gemeente vaak zelf kan. Hierdoor is het draagvlak in een gemeenschap voor een uitdaging in Utrecht een harde eis. Rotterdam ziet het uitdaagrecht als instrument om meer mensen te betrekken bij het reilen en zeilen van de gemeente en probeert dus met name het indienen en het proces van het uitdaagrecht zo laagdrempelig mogelijk te maken.
	Vooral de effecten van de sturing die gericht zijn op het zo toegankelijk mogelijk maken voor de initiatiefnemer om een uitdaging in te dienen vallen op. Zonder deze sturing wordt de toegankelijkheid minder voor mensen en zullen daardoor minder mensen een uitdaging indienen. Voor de andere twee niveaus kan de gemeente zeker een focus leggen, het gesprek starten en een initiatiefnemer proberen te begeleiden, echter heeft de gemeente hier geen bepalende stem in. Als de gemeente dit niet of nauwelijks doet betekent dit niet dat de uitdaging niet inclusief is. Het zelfregulerend vermogen van initiatiefnemers en de inclusieve doelen die zij misschien zelf nastreven mogen namelijk niet vergeten worden. De reden dat deze sociaal geëngageerde mensen een uitdaging indienen is vaak omdat ze iets beter willen maken voor de gemeenschap, meer draagvlak willen creëren of inwoners beter willen betrekken bij bepaalde taken. Hierdoor is inclusiviteit het gevolg van zelfsturing.",

Political issues mix administrative tasks in a blend where it is difficult to recognize the beginning and the end of each element. Generally, the publicity campaigns carry out for cities are postpone or margined regarding these urgencies. 
City branding, as a relatively new kind of publicity, appears in the situation as a new instrument that looks for making space between these social and economic requirements, to manage the image of the city in the developing course of it. This research has the purpose of investigating how city branding practices find room in Buenos Aires government activities and precisely how effective are they to brand the city using social media. 
For that, the theoretical section includes branding meaning and the relation of it with governance and social media. The method used combines a series of interviews with Public Administrators and researchers on the matter with a media content analysis process focuses on the official Facebook Fan Page of the Buenos Aires Government. 
The results permit to confirm some hypothetical ideas about this practice. The Buenos Aires government is effective at the moment of branding through social media due to include the three elements analysed in this research: actions to recognise the city identity, stakeholder involvement process in the branding practice, and connection between city branding and infrastructure development plan. 
Nevertheless, it found some imbalances in the branding practice and proposes two general recommendations to improve this process. First, the government should integrate the branding process, especially the external and internal to the city branding practice. This action should integrate as well a more definite and regular effort to recognize the city identity together with the incorporation of external actors at the process. Second, researchers on the matter should attach importance to the study of Latin America city branding cases and include them in future literature.",

It is argued here that the culturally and historically unique national contexts, and the resulting unique institutional scripts influence the possibilities for change with regard to institutions and actors dealing with deportation.

However, differences in socioeconomic status and confidence in healthcare could not explain these relationships.

Dear reader, 

This thesis is the result of half a year of dedication and is the final piece of my Master Urban Governance at Erasmus University and thus my time as a student. During those five years, I have learned a lot, both personal and educational.  

For the last bit of this era, I must thank several people. People who encouraged me to challenge myself and to carry on. I was allowed to conduct my research for AT Osborne. A period that looked very different than planned due to the Coronavirus. A period with fewer personal (physical) gatherings, but I did not have to write my thesis alone. Several people have supported me during the process. Even though that was not always easy. First, I would like to thank my supervisor Leon van den Dool for his time, guidance, and virtual coffees. I know how busy the last months have been for you, but whenever we had a meeting, I had the feeling that you had all the time to help me, even on your holiday. I am very grateful. 

Furthermore, I am very grateful to Frits Verhees, my AT Osborne supervisor. I have experienced how complex the world of infrastructure and mobility is and that is why I am very grateful for his substance guidance. The tips he gave, of which I did not always see the importance immediately, turned all out to be of great importance later. Without this subject-specific knowledge, it would have become very difficult for me to arrive at this product. Therefore, Frits, thank you very much.  

Finally, I would like to thank my girlfriend, friends, family, and roommates for making the past 6 months bearable. It has been a tough job and I am truly grateful for your constant support. Especially during a time when having personal contact came under pressure, you showed how important you are to me. Thank you. 

Dear reader, enjoy reading my thesis!

Summary 
In infrastructure planning, uncertainties are emerging, and the environment is becoming increasingly complex.  This requires an adaptive government that can deal with new challenges. For this reason, the Dutch government will replace the Infrastructuurfonds (Infrastructure fund) with the Mobiliteitsfonds (Mobility fund).  A change in funds to be more flexible, collaborative, and innovative. The current Infrastructuurfonds focuses on expanding capacity and there is to a lesser extent room for adaptive planning. For this reason, this study analyses the impact of the Infrastructuurfonds with the Mobiliteitsfonds and determines to what extent adaptive planning can contribute to a more future-proof mobility planning. Adaptive planning is to be able to deal with changing circumstances during a process without limiting future options. 
This thesis examines two roadway trajectories that both show to some extent characteristics of adaptive planning. With interviews and documents analysis is analysed to what extent it can be expected that the Mobiliteitsfonds will lead to more adaptive planning, contributing to a more future-proof mobility planning in the Netherlands. It is determined how the Mobiliteitsfonds can enhance adaptive capacity, what current challenges are in mobility planning and how adaptive planning is expected to alleviate those challenges and to what extent the Mobiliteitsfonds can meet the conditions for future-proof mobility planning. 

The interviews stress the importance of clear goals and giving residents clarity as soon as possible. For this reason, it is argued, it is impossible to be entirely adaptive. Yet, it is argued, to some extent adaptivity is already possible. However, evaluation, a focus on learning and experimenting could improve to be more adaptive. The main contribution of the Mobiliteitsfonds to adaptive planning is that the Mobiliteitsfonds will promote an integral consideration of possible solutions and modalities. Possibly, the experienced bulkheads between modalities are removed and one will consider other solutions then infrastructure solely. In this way, the Mobiliteitsfonds will contribute to a more future-proof planning practice, but not just the Mobiliteitsfonds can facilitate the shift towards future-proof planning. Thus, the Mobiliteitsfonds is considered to be the confirmation of a movement that has already been deployed. It is an evolution instead of the revolution I expected. 

Therefore, it is recommended that professionals show the possibilities of adaptive planning. Adaptive planning has a lot to offer, but one should know the possibilities. The possibilities are not always known amongst stakeholders. One of the manners to show the possibilities of adaptive planning is to conduct experiments. Regarding infrastructure and mobility planning, much is to be gained in conducting experiments.",
The Impact of Social Learning on the Use of IHDs and the Energy-saving Behaviour of Residents Living in a Sustainable Neighbourhood,Clarisse  de Cerjat,2020-08-08,"['Dr. Carley Pennink', 'Dr. I. van Meerkerk']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"By using the single representative and revelatory case study of the eSmart display users in the eco-neighbourhood Eikenøtt in Switzerland, this research aims to answer the following research question: What is the effect of the use of IHDs on the energy-saving behaviour of households living in the Eikenøtt sustainable neighbourhood and what is the impact of social learning on this relationship? The rationale behind this thesis concerns the literature gap explaining how smart metering systems can aid the sustainability of eco-districts projects by ensuring that the residents, actually engage in an energy-saving behaviour. Moreover, existing research on sustainable neighbourhood developments argued that it provides a great context where people are expected to exchange pro-environmental norms and values – as the context promotes high social cohesion – and therefore this paper uses Eikenøtt as an opportunity to verify this. In order to do so, theory testing is used to undercover the effect of the of IHDs on the households’ energy-saving behaviour and to look into the moderating effect of social learning in the neighbourhood on the relationship between the use of IHD and the households’ energy-saving behaviour.
	The households of Eikenøtt having access to the eSmart devices have been sent invites to participate in an online survey and thus this allows to make statistics (via Survey Monkey). Due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the number of valid questionnaires was very limited. However, the results of the statistical analysis – which have been run on the IBM SPSS programme – have shed light on many relationships and trends concerning the concepts investigated. In a first place, the findings indicate that the use of social learning is positively associated with the energy-saving behaviour of the households. In a second place, the analysis does not allow to confirm that social learning has a significant moderation effect on the relationship between the use of the eSmart display and the energy-saving behaviour of the households living in Eikenøtt. Nonetheless, the analysis shows that there is a trend and that the non-significant moderation effect is probably due to the low number of respondents. Furthermore, social cohesion and social learning have been found to be positively correlated and therefore one can argue that this shows the importance of the consideration of public space in the creation (design) of eco-neighbourhoods. To conclude, one should bear in mind that this research cannot be generalized and therefore the findings of this study cannot be assumed to be the same in other contexts.","['Energy-saving behaviour', 'Use of IHD', 'Direct feedback', 'Social learning', 'Transformative learning', 'Instrumental learning', 'Social cohesion', 'Eco-neighbourhood', 'Eikenøtt', 'Switzerland']"
Trust Is Won Not Given: The Influence of Trust on Public- Public Partnerships,Rachel Knibbe,2020-08-08,['Dr. Carley Pennink'],Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The issues that public organisations have to deal with are often overlapping with the scope of other public organisations; thus, by working together, they have a chance to create higher social returns. This could happen if they work together through a public-public partnership (P2P) where they decide to share the risks and resources and have the same core objective, namely to create public value. In urban redevelopment projects there is great potential for P2Ps, because there are often multiple public organizations involved. Hence, the different public organisations can act as a principal on a shared project where they share risks and resources.

This thesis examines two cases studies with potential for public-public collaboration, and analyses what the effect of trust is on the collaboration over time. It examines whether higher levels of trust lead to higher collaborative relationships, and whether this has a positive effect of the project performance. The examined case studies are part of the Masterplan of the stationsgebied Utrecht Centraal, the two cases studies being OV-Terminal Utrecht Centraal and the Uithoflijn. 

 In the case of the OV -Terminal Utrecht it was found that the trust had a positive effect on the partnership over time. The partnership reached higher collaboration levels due to the development of trust over time. Both trust as collaboration impacted the project performance overtime in a positive manner. The project was more time and budget efficient due to the higher trust levels in the partnership. 

On the other hand, the Uithoflijn was the less successful partnership it was evident that trust did not develop over time due to the situational factors, behaviour of the partners and, the initial meeting. The lower levels of trust affected the collaboration between the project partners, which had an adversarial outlook. The low levels of trust and collaboration effected the project performance in a negative manner, since the project went over time and budget due to the nonexistence of collaboration between the project partners.","['Public-Public Partnerships', 'Trust', 'Collaboration', 'Urban Redevelopment projects', 'Rounds Model.']"
Waarom werken medewerkers bij de TU Delft?,Caroline Heijnders,2020-08-07,"['Dr. B. Vermeeren', 'Prof.dr. A. J. Steijn']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Door arbeidskrapte is het voor publieke organisaties lastig om geschikt personeel te werven (Herderscheê & Witteman; Pelgrim, 2019; Steijn, 2006). Literatuur over de publieke sector biedt inzicht in waarom men kiest om te werken voor een publieke organisatie. Uit deze literatuur komt terug dat zowel intrinsieke als extrinsieke motivatie invloed hebben op het kiezen voor een baan bij een publieke organisatie (Beulens & van der Broeck, 2007; Groeneveld, Steijn & Van der Parre 2009). In deze literatuur ontbreekt onderzoek naar de motieven van werknemers van een universiteit. Medewerkers bij een universiteit worden onderverdeeld in twee groepen, namelijk het Wetenschappelijk Personeel (WP) en Ondersteunend en BeheersPersoneel (OBP). Aan de hand van literatuur over de motivatie van het WP en OBP worden verschillen verwacht in motieven om te kiezen voor een baan bij een universiteit (Houston, Meyer & Paewai, 2006; Ryan, 2014; Seema, Udam, Mattisen, 2016; Tytherleigh, Webb, Cooper & Ricketts, 2005). De TU Delft is een goed voorbeeld van een universiteit die soms moeite heeft met het werven van geschikt personeel. Onderzoek naar de motieven van deze twee groepen bij de TU Delft kan meer inzicht bieden. Daarom is de volgende hoofdvraag opgesteld: Hoe verschillen de motieven om te gaan werken voor de TU Delft tussen het OBP en WP en waardoor kunnen deze verschillen verklaard worden?

Op basis van literatuur over baankeuze binnen de publieke sector wordt verwacht dat een aantal intrinsieke en extrinsieke motivatoren een rol spelen. Een belangrijke vorm van intrinsieke motivatie is Public Service Motivation (PSM) (Perry, 1996; Perry & Wise, 1990; Steijn, 2006; Steijn; 2008). Een baan bij een publieke organisatie wordt gekenmerkt door maatschappelijk relevant werk waar PSM gerelateerde waardes bij aansluiten. Andere intrinsieke motivatoren die een rol kunnen spelen, zijn de inhoud van het werk, autonomie en erkenning (Bellé & Cantarelli, 2018; Beulens & van der Broeck, 2007; Herzberg, 1996; Massey, Roger & Brown, 1998; Karl & Sutton, 1998). Een aantal extrinsieke motivatoren zijn mogelijk ook belangrijk voor het kiezen van een baan bij de publieke sector. De motivatoren loon, baanzekerheid en werk-privébalans komen terug in de publieke sector literatuur (Van de Walle, Steijn & Jilke, 2015; Taylor & Taylor, 2011; Groeneveld et al., 2009; Steijn, 2006). Kenmerkend voor een baan in de publieke sector is baanzekerheid en het goed kunnen combineren van werk en privé. Aan de hand van literatuur over de motivatie van het WP en OBP kan verwacht worden dat intrinsieke motivatoren een grotere invloed hebben voor het WP bij het kiezen voor een baan bij een universiteit. De verwachting is daarom dat zij meer intrinsiek gemotiveerd zijn dan het OBP (Houston et al., 2006; Ryan, 2014; Seema et al., 2016; Tytherleigh et al., 2005).
Om de bovengenoemde hoofdvraag te beantwoorden, is kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd waarbij gevraagd is naar de motieven om te werken bij de TU Delft. Het onderzoek wordt gekenmerkt als case study, omdat de TU Delft en haar medewerkers centraal staan. Door middel van semigestructureerde interviews is data verzameld. Er zijn tien mensen van het OBP en tien mensen van het WP geïnterviewd die binnen één maand en vijftien maanden zijn gestart bij de TU Delft. De interviews zijn geanalyseerd met behulp van een opgesteld codeerschema.

Uit de resultaten zijn een aantal overeenkomsten en verschillen tussen het OBP en WP naar voren gekomen. Een overeenkomst is dat voor beide groepen de inhoud van het werk erg belangrijk is geweest in hun keuze. Verder is voor beide groepen baanzekerheid in beperkte mate belangrijk geweest. Verschillen zijn dat PSM, autonomie, erkenning, loon en werk-privébalans voor het OBP een belangrijkere rol hebben gespeeld dan voor het WP. Daarnaast is het belang van organisatiekenmerken teruggevonden. Dit is niet eerder besproken, omdat verwacht werd dat dit niet zou verschillen onder het WP en OBP. Uit de resultaten blijkt dit echter wel het geval te zijn. Voor beide groepen zijn organisatiekenmerken op een bepaalde manier belangrijk, maar bij het OBP hebben organisatiekenmerken een grotere rol gespeeld. Voor het OBP is een dynamische leeromgeving en de locatie erg belangrijk. De werksfeer en een goede en bekende organisatie zijn voor het OBP van gematigd belang. Het WP benadrukt het belang van een goede en bekende universiteit en de locatie. Een verklaring voor de meest genoemde verschillen is het keuzeproces van het OBP en WP. Voordat het WP kiest voor een universiteit, kiezen ze voor een wetenschappelijke carrière. Een wetenschappelijke functie wordt in het algemeen gekenmerkt door maatschappelijk relevant werk, autonomie en erkenning. Doordat een aantal motivatoren inherent zijn aan een wetenschappelijke functie is dit een mogelijke verklaring waarom ze niet benoemd zijn als reden om te kiezen voor de TU Delft. Verder wordt een wetenschappelijke functie gekenmerkt door hard en zelfstandig werken. Dat is een mogelijke verklaring voor de beperkte invloed van werk-privébalans en werksfeer.

Op basis van de resultaten zijn er drie aanbevelingen geformuleerd die gericht zijn op een betere werving van WP en OBP. Deze aanbevelingen luiden als volgt:
1.	De omschrijving van de inhoud van het werk: In de vacatureteksten van het OBP en WP kan met quotes van huidige medewerkers aangegeven worden wat het werk interessant maakt. Verder vindt het WP het praktijkgerichte aspect in het werk belangrijk en het OBP het uitdagende en maatschappelijk aspect. Daarom is het belangrijk dat deze aspecten extra benadrukt worden.
2.	Belangrijk dat de ondersteuning bij de verhuizing van het WP wordt benoemd: Bij het WP wordt het belang van de familie/partner in acht genomen bij het kiezen van een baan. Daarom is het belangrijk dat de steun die de TU Delft biedt bij de verhuizing uitgebreider wordt benoemd in de vacatureteksten.
3.	Benoemen van aantrekkelijke organisatiekenmerken: Het is belangrijk dat het organisatiekenmerk een bekende en goede organisatie in de vacatureteksten van het WP wordt benoemd. Bij de vacatureteksten van het OBP is het belangrijk dat het organisatiekenmerk een dynamische leeromgeving wordt beschreven","['baankeuze', 'publieke sector', 'universiteit', 'wetenschappelijk personeel', 'ondersteunend personeel']"
Right to Cooperate: een kwestie van leren,Anna Peters,2020-08-05,"['Prof.dr. A. van Buuren', 'M.M.J. Hermus (Msc)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In de collegetargets van het Rotterdamse college van Burgemeester & Wethouders is de ambitie meedenken & meedoen geformuleerd. Dit houdt in dat de inwoners van Gemeente Rotterdam aan het einde van de collegeperiode meer meedenken en meebeslissen over ontwikkelingen in de leefomgeving. Right to Cooperate is een onderdeel van deze ambitie en het directe startpunt voor dit onderzoek. Het Right to Cooperate wordt als volgt gedefinieerd: ‘betrokken Rotterdammers en organisaties gaan samen met de gemeente als gelijkwaardige partners maatschappelijke doelen realiseren. Dit gaat niet alleen over de relatie tussen gemeente en burgers, maar ook over de invulling van de gemeentelijke organisatie. De focus ligt op de invulling van de gemeentelijke organisatie, hoe zij samenhangend kan handelen om de initiatiefrijke Rotterdammer het beste te kunnen helpen. 

Gemeente Rotterdam wil inzicht krijgen in hoe het samenhangend handelen er uit ziet, wat hiervoor condities zijn en waar belemmeringen zitten. De hoofdvraag luidt als volgt: Hoe is het samenhangend handelen binnen Gemeente Rotterdam in het kader van Right to Cooperate georganiseerd? Welke gebreken vertoont het en hoe kan zij dit verbeteren? Vervolgens zijn er drie deelvragen opgesteld:

1.	Hoe is de huidige manier van handelen tussen de verschillende clusters op het gebied van initiatieven?
2.	Wat is de gewenste manier van samenhangend handelen tussen de clusters?
3.	Welke aanbevelingen kunnen gedaan worden om het samenhangend handelen in relatie tot Right to Cooperate gestalte te geven?

 Er wordt verondersteld dat samenhangend handelen afhankelijk is van de (mate van) aanwezigheid van bepaalde condities en belemmeringen. De condities betreffen: organisatiestructuur, open & collaboratieve benadering (op individueel niveau) en cultuur. De belemmeringen zijn: beschikbaarheid van tijd en middelen, eilandjespolitiek en prestatiemanagement. De verwachting is dat de condities een positieve invloed hebben op samenhangend handelen binnen de gemeente en de belemmeringen negatief van invloed zijn. Daarnaast is er mogelijk een verband tussen de condities en belemmeringen. Wanneer de condities sterk ervaren worden, zou dit mogelijk een reducering van het ervaren van belemmeringen opleveren. 

Vijftien medewerkers van gemeente Rotterdam hebben deelgenomen aan dit onderzoek. Zij zijn geïnterviewd. De medewerkers zijn zowel werkzaam binnen de clusters als binnen de wijk- en gebiedsorganisatie. Het hoofdvereiste voor geschiktheid voor dit onderzoek is dat de betreffende persoon zich bezighoudt met initiatieven, co-creatie, ‘uitdaagrecht’ of Right to Cooperate. 

De eerste deelvraag gaat in op hoe de huidige manier van samenhangend handelen ervaren wordt. Het is opvallend om te zien dat dit vanuit de twee respondentengroepen (wijken/gebieden & clusters), op een andere manier ervaren wordt. De medewerkers in de wijk- en gebiedsorganisatie benaderen zaken van nature al integraal, omdat zij uitgaan van het initiatief en kijken wat er nodig is om het initiatief, idee of plan verder te helpen. Uit het onderzoek kwam naar voren dat zij regelmatig op een verkokerde houding bij de collega’s in de clusters stuiten. Dat clustermedewerkers spreken ook veel meer vanuit hun eigen onderdeel of onderwerp.

De belangrijkste bevindingen bij de condities en belemmeringen zullen kort samengevat worden. Bij de organisatiestructuur mist onder alle geledingen een visie of beleid met betrekking tot de wijze waarop zaken die clusteroverstijgend zijn aangepakt dienen te worden. Wat Bbetreft het leiderschap is er een verschil tussen de twee respondentengeledingen. De wijken en gebieden pleiten ervoor dat zij een leidende positie innemen, omdat zij de behoefte van de wijk het beste in kunnen schatten. De medewerkers in de clusters stellen dat het leiderschap op alle niveaus moet zitten. In de top moet het goede voorbeeld gegeven worden; waaruit blijkt dat het vanzelfsprekend is om in samenhang te werken en uit de eigen koker los te komen. De tweede conditie open & collaboratieve benadering kent als belangrijke bevinding dat iedereen in de organisatie open staat om elkaar te helpen en mee te denken. Het lastige zit vooral in het creëren van het juiste netwerk binnen de organisatie. Netwerken is een belangrijke factor voor samenhangend handelen in een grote organisatie als Gemeente Rotterdam. Dit wordt dan ook unaniem als belangrijk gesteld door de medewerkers.  De derde conditie cultuur kent enigszins overlap met conditie twee, echter is deze meer op systeemniveau gericht en kijkt naar wat er nodig is betreft culturele factoren in de organisatie. Uit de gesprekken met medewerkers is naar voren gekomen dat cultuurverschillen tussen clusters, wijken en gebieden niet erg zijn; dit is inherent aan de organisatiestructuur en de aard van het werk in verschillende organisatiegeledingen. Een belangrijk onderdeel van een cultuur in een grote organisatie, waar samenhangend handelen centraal staat, is leermogelijkheden. Dit is de grote gemene deler van dit onderzoek. Hier is eensgezindheid over. Medewerkers moeten mogelijkheden krijgen om te leren en best-practices uit te wisselen over hoe je initiatieven aanpakt die betrekking hebben op zaken uit meerdere clusters. 
	Betreft de belemmeringen. De beschikbaarheid van tijd en middelen is de grootste belemmering, en dan met name de tijd. Dit hangt sterk samen met prioritering. De eigen taken en verantwoordelijkheden gaan vaak voor op dingen in samenhang of het helpen van een collega. Medewerkers geven aan dat ze al genoeg te doen hebben met alleen hun eigen werkzaamheden. De overige twee belemmeringen eilandjespolitiek en prestatiemanagement kennen overlap met elkaar. Vanuit de clusters wordt met name een eilandjeshouding, refererend naar de verkokering genoemd. Dit is niet per se belemmerend maar wel vervelend, het kan processen vertragen. Over prestatiemanagement zijn de minst duidelijke bevindingen naar voren gekomen. Het valt op dat medewerkers niet denken in termen van prestatie indicatoren. Daarnaast wordt aangegeven dat samenwerken lastig in prestatie-indicatoren is te omvatten, doordat deze indicatoren gericht zijn op een cluster, team of directie. 

Om een antwoord te formuleren op de onderzoeksvraag is het van belang in gedachte te houden dat er verschillen zijn in invalshoek tussen clusters en wijken/gebieden. Op het moment wordt het samenhangend handelen niet altijd optimaal ervaren. Wel in bepaalde soorten overleggen, zoals CityLab010 of het Kendoe overleg, dit is vaak op formele wijze met een subsidiepot eraan gekoppeld. Op informele wijze wordt er nog (te) weinig samengewerkt om initiatieven of plannen te helpen, terwijl medewerkers wel erkennen dat ze elkaar nodig hebben in hun werkzaamheden. De grootste verbeterslag valt te maken in netwerken en leermogelijkheden. Dit is de essentie van samenhangend handelen. Medewerkers dienen casussen uit te wisselen en netwerk op te bouwen, zodat ze niet iedere keer het wiel opnieuw uit moeten vinden wanneer er een zaak binnenkomt. Om dit praktisch handen en voeten te geven zijn er drie aanbevelingen gedaan:

1.	Geef medewerkers mogelijkheden om een netwerk op te bouwen 
2.	Maak een leiderschapsgroep met expertise uit alle geledingen
3.	Verlies het doel niet uit het oog: voorkom meer bureaucratie, administratieve rompslomp of vertraging van processen",

Voorwoord
Beste lezer,
Voor u ligt een onderzoek naar de invloed van de digitalisering in het werk op de taakinhoud en taakautonomie van wijkagenten. Met dit onderzoek rond ik de master Management van Human Resources en Verandering af. Hiervoor heb ik stage gelopen binnen de Nationale Politie bij de directie Operatiën. Vanwege de uitzonderlijke omstandigheden waarin de wereld zich bevond ten tijde van dit onderzoek met betrekking tot de COVID-19 pandemie, heb ik echter veelal thuis gewerkt. Ik heb hierin veel vrijheid gekregen en ondersteuning wanneer nodig. Hiervoor wil ik graag een aantal mensen bedanken. Allereerst mijn stagebegeleider vanuit de Nationale Politie, Hugo Passchier. Door mij aan het begin van mijn stageperiode mee te nemen naar verschillende vergaderingen en bijeenkomsten, kreeg ik direct een overzicht van het werk van wijkagenten. Dit zorgde ervoor dat ik mijn onderzoek direct goed kon starten. Daarnaast wil ik graag mijn scriptiebegeleidster, Brenda Vermeeren, bedanken. Dankzij haar inzet en uitgebreide feedback heb ik mijn onderzoek kunnen aanpassen en verbeteren tot een product waar ik trots op ben. Verder wil ik Vincent Homburg bedanken voor zijn rol als tweede lezer, waarin hij mij van constructieve feedback heeft voorzien. Ik heb mijn onderzoek hierdoor naar een hoger niveau kunnen tillen. Daarnaast wil ik mijn medestudenten uit de scriptiekring bedanken voor hun feedback. Tot slot wil ik graag mijn vrienden, familie en Michiel bedanken voor hun support tijdens het schrijven van dit onderzoek. Door het vele nalezen heb ik mijn onderzoek kunnen aanscherpen.
Met trots rond ik de master Management van Human Resources en Verandering af en ik wens u veel leesplezier toe!

Samenvatting
Doel: De huidige samenleving wordt gekenmerkt door de steeds grotere invloed van digitalisering. Het is voor wijkagenten van groot belang om mee te gaan in de ontwikkelingen omtrent digitalisering, omdat zij in direct contact staan met burgers en zij zich via digitalisering bij de belevingswereld van burgers kunnen aansluiten. In het Inrichtingsplan Nationale Politie is geconcretiseerd dat wijkagenten 80% van hun tijd werkzaamheden in of voor de wijk dienen te verrichten en 20% van hun tijd reguliere politietaken dienen te verrichten (Politie, 2012). Dit wordt ook wel de 80%-norm genoemd (Politie, 2018). Echter, door de huidige ontwikkelingen omtrent de digitalisering in het werk ondergaat de taakinhoud en taakautonomie van wijkagenten mogelijk een transformatie (Van Lakerveld, Gussen, Stoutjesdijk, Tönis, & De Zoete, 2017). Het doel van dit onderzoek is om hier voor de Nationale Politie inzicht in te verkrijgen, omdat hierdoor de 80%-norm mogelijk dient te worden herzien (Politie, 2018). Om dit doel te behalen, staat de volgende hoofdvraag centraal: ‘’Hoe beïnvloedt de digitalisering in het werk de taakinhoud en taakautonomie van wijkagenten?’’ 
Theorie: Taakinhoud wordt door Langfred en Moye (2004) getypeerd als het soort taken dat een medewerker verricht (p. 934). Er zijn vier taken die wijkagenten kunnen verrichten in hun werk: productie taken, procedurele taken, ambachtelijke taken en coping taken (Wilson, 1989). Taakautonomie wordt door Langfred en Moye (2004) getypeerd als de vrijheid omtrent de wijze waarop een medewerker een taak verricht (p. 934). Er zijn vier vormen van taakautonomie die wijkagenten kunnen ervaren in hun werk: taken rantsoeneren, interacties structureren, de uitvoer van taken structureren en collega’s inzetten (Lipsky, 1980). Digitalisering wordt door Moore, Akhtar en Upchurch (2018) getypeerd als het proces waardoor taken via digitale hulpmiddelen worden verricht (p. 17).
Methode: In dit onderzoek is gebruik gemaakt van twee kwalitatieve methoden: een focusgroep en semigestructureerde diepte-interviews. De focusgroep heeft plaatsgevonden gedurende de bijeenkomst tussen het Landelijk Platform Professie Wijkagenten en het ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid. Bij deze focusgroep waren twintig wijkagenten uit het hele land aanwezig. Naar aanleiding van onder andere de focusgroep is ervoor gekozen om in dit onderzoek digitalisering te kaderen als het gebruik van social media websites en de Mobiel Effectiever Op Straat-app (MEOS-app) door wijkagenten in hun werk (Lakerveld et al., 2017). De focusgroep heeft daarnaast hulp geboden bij het maken van het operationalisatieschema en de interviewguide en biedt op deze manier input voor de semigestructureerde diepte-interviews. Er zijn in totaal negentien semigestructureerde diepte-interviews afgenomen met Nederlandse wijkagenten. 
Empirische bevindingen en analyse: De analyse van de empirische bevindingen laat zien dat social media websites door middel van informatiedeling met burgers, door meldingen die door burgers worden gedaan via social media websites en als informatiebronnen zorgen voor het verrichten van de vier taken van de taakinhoud van wijkagenten. De MEOS-app zorgt door middel van vaste registratiesystemen, als informatiebron en door informatiedeling met partners voor het verrichten van de vier taken van de taakinhoud van wijkagenten. Social media websites en de MEOS-app zorgen als informatiebronnen voor het ervaren van de vier vormen van taakautonomie in het werk van wijkagenten. Social media websites zorgen daarnaast door middel van informatiedeling met partners voor het ervaren van het inzetten van collega’s in het werk van wijkagenten.
Aanbevelingen voor vervolgonderzoek: Ten eerste wordt aanbevolen om in vervolgonderzoek nader in te gaan op hoe de digitalisering in het werk de arbeidsomstandigheden van wijkagenten beïnvloedt. Ten tweede wordt aanbevolen om in vervolgonderzoek in te gaan op hoe de invloed van de digitalisering in het werk wordt ervaren door wijkagenten afhankelijk van hun rolopvatting. Ten derde wordt aanbevolen om in vervolgonderzoek te focussen op de invloed van gepersonaliseerde technologie en gestandaardiseerde technologie in het werk op de taakinhoud en taakautonomie van wijkagenten. Ten vierde wordt aanbevolen om in vervolgonderzoek gebruik te maken van een aselecte steekproef om de wijkagenten die deel mogen nemen aan de focusgroep te selecteren. Als laatste wordt aanbevolen om in vervolgonderzoek wijkagenten te selecteren op het aantal jaren dat zij in dienst zijn en deze evenredig terug te laten komen in de steekproef van de semigestructureerde diepte-interviews.
Aanbevelingen voor de Nationale Politie: Allereerst wordt er aan de Nationale Politie aanbevolen om de teamchefs met hun wijkagenten in gesprek te laten gaan en te vragen naar hoeveel procent van de tijd zij dienen te besteden aan hun wijk om hun werk goed te kunnen verrichten. Er kan op deze manier per verzorgingsgebied een norm worden opgesteld die past bij de problematiek in het verzorgingsgebied. Hierdoor kan de harde kwantitatieve 80%-norm los worden gelaten. De tweede aanbeveling voor de Nationale Politie is om leermogelijkheden omtrent digitalisering aan te bieden aan al haar wijkagenten. Dit kan mogelijk worden vormgegeven door middel van instructievideo’s en een buddysysteem tussen collega-wijkagenten.","['street-level bureaucrat', 'taakinhoud', 'taakautonomie en digitalisering']"
Efforts to improve the neighbourhood: did Rotterdam succeed?,Shelley Wilson,2020-08-05,"['Ir. S. Ruijsink MSc.', 'Prof. dr. J. Edelenbos']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Municipalities regularly undertake urban regenerations hoping to improve the living environment. Rotterdam aims to achieve more and focuses on large-scale urban regeneration. However, the effects of urban regeneration on social sustainability remain debated. Case studies are conducted to identify what the influence of large-scale urban regeneration on social sustainability in Rotterdam is. Hoogvliet (large-scale urban regenerated) and Groot-IJsselmonde (only some small-scale interventions) are compared. Quantitative and qualitative methods are sequentially used to collect the data. 
The analysis showed that a window of opportunity allowed the large-scale urban regeneration to happen in Hoogvliet. The intervention resulted in, amongst other things, an increase in the socio-economic status. Contrary to the expectations, residents in a large-scale urban regenerated neighbourhood did not seem to value (three dimensions of) social sustainability higher than residents in a neighbourhood that has not been large-scale urban regenerated. Nevertheless, the differences in the mean scores between both neighbourhoods were not significant. An explanation for the difference in scores might be the neighbourhood design. In addition, large-scale urban regeneration was not a significant indicator for any of the investigated dimensions of social sustainability. Meanwhile, the results showed that the future situation is expected to be better by significantly more people in the neighbourhood that has not undergone large-scale regeneration. 
The influence of large-scale urban regeneration on social sustainability in Rotterdam seems to be minimal. The findings support the dichotomy that urban regeneration has positive and negative effects. More efforts than large-scale urban regeneration seem necessary to make people feel that their needs can be fulfilled in their neighbourhood, now and in the future. It seems to be about more feasible things that residents experience daily, such as the maintenance of the outdoor space and variety in shopping facilities. Therefore, two practical recommendations are made to guarantee social sustainability in the future. 
The results of this study do need to be nuanced. Other intervening and moderating variables might be in place and relevant to explain the influence of large-scale urban regeneration on social sustainability. The two neighbourhoods are comparable, but not identical. An ideal comparison is impossible. Besides, it is hard to anticipate what would have happened with Hoogvliet if the intervention did not take place. Finally, residents that do not expect the future to be better could expect the situation to remain the same, which is also socially sustainable because demands for now and future generations are fulfilled. One cannot conclude that the neighbourhoods are socially sustainable or not.","['(large-scale) urban regeneration', 'social sustainability', 'Rotterdam', 'amenities and social infrastructure', 'social and cultural life', 'voice and influence', 'contextuality', 'past-present-future']"
Knooppunt ROTTERDAM,Adrie Romijn,2020-08-05,"['Prof.dr. M. Fenger', 'Dr. R. Moody']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op de samenwerking binnen de gemeente Rotterdam op het gebied van de inkomensondersteuning. De onderzoeksvraag luidt: ‘wat is de invloed van verschillende overtuigingen en belangen op de samenwerking tussen de verschillende clusters binnen de gemeente Rotterdam die betrokken zijn bij de opgave om de inkomensondersteuning te verbeteren?’ Om dit te onderzoeken is gebruik gemaakt van theorieën omtrent samenwerking en het bureaupolitieke model. Door het afnemen van kwalitatieve interviews met ambtenaren van de gemeente Rotterdam is inzicht verkregen in de samenwerking en de rol van belangen. Hieruit blijkt dat overeenkomende belangen en overtuigingen bijdragen aan een succesvolle samenwerking. Verschillende overtuigingen en belangen maken een samenwerking niet onmogelijk, maar wel lastiger. Hierin kan dan een betrokkene met een bemiddelaarsfunctie in bemiddelen.",
Samen voor groen: werkt dat?,Nikki Daenen,2020-08-03,"['Dr. J. Willems', 'Dr.ir. J. Eshuis']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Deze kwalitatieve studie geeft inzicht in de ervaren effectiviteit van gemeentelijke participatie-instrumenten voor de continuïteit van groen-sociale burgerinitiatieven. Hierbij is gekeken naar zowel financiële participatie-instrumenten, zoals subsidies, als communicatieve/sociale participatie-instrumenten, zoals contactpersonen en netwerken. Uit negentien interviews en drie documentanalyses is gebleken dat financiële participatie-instrumenten vooral effectief kunnen zijn bij het creëren van financieel gezonde initiatieven, mits ze verder gaan dan alleen het leveren van een financiële bijdrage, door bijvoorbeeld te helpen bij het opstellen van een businessplan. De communicatieve/sociale participatie-instrumenten kunnen groen-sociale burgerinitiatieven aan elkaar linken en zo een diverse netwerkstructuur creëren, zodat burgerinitiatieven elkaar kunnen helpen. Beide punten zijn belangrijke componenten van de continuïteit van burgerinitiatieven. Echter kan er bij beide participatie-instrumenten meer effectiviteit behaald worden door de bijdrage van participatie-instrumenten aan de organisatorische capaciteit van burgerinitiatieven te vergroten. Ook waardering wordt naar aanleiding van dit onderzoek als een cruciaal component van continuïteit gezien, waar met name communicatieve participatie-instrumenten aan bijdragen. Groen-sociale burgerinitiatieven hebben vaak een waarde die zich moeilijk laat kwantificeren. Een herwaardering van zachte, maatschappelijke waarden zou het belang van groen-sociale burgerinitiatieven vergroten en daarmee de continuïteit ervan kunnen verhogen. In de toekomst zou mogelijk een combinatie van een financieel en een communicatief participatie-instrument kunnen zorgen dat de continuïteit van groen-sociale burgerinitiatieven verder wordt vergroot.","['participatie-instrumenten', 'continuïteit', 'groen-sociale burgerinitiatieven', 'effectiviteit']"
Towards a sustainable EU: Comparison of 3 Cooperation Types and Their Impact on Governing Effectiveness,Markéta Svobodová,2020-08-03,"['Dr. D. McCauley', 'Dr. I. van Meerkerk']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The purpose of this study was to build on previous Public Administration research, contributing a better understanding of three cooperation models (PPPs, Co-production and Society-driven cooperation) and their respective perceived governing effectiveness in two different European contexts. Since the topic of Interactive Governance is relatively under-researched, this study was to show how different forms of Interactive Governance work in practice and how they could be used to reach sustainable transition. A final aim of this study was to address Derk Loorbach’s call for a framework of effective cooperation models serving as a guide in various societal contexts. The research question guiding the study is: What is the influence of cooperation models (PPPs, Co-production and Society-driven cooperation) on the perceived successful effectiveness of steering in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, in the context of a sustainable transition?
To come up with answers to the research question, a mix of qualitative methods was used. First, six case studies of Dutch and Czech sustainable projects, where each cooperation model was seen in practice, were analyzed. Then, 18 interviews with Dutch and Czech respondents who worked or are currently working on the sustainable projects identified, were conducted. 
The results show that achieving perceived governing effectiveness under PPPs is more straightforward than under the other two cooperation models, which builds on the existing theory that this is the case. However, one of the main contributions of this study is the finding that Co-production and Society-driven cooperation both reach higher governing effectiveness in the Czech cases than in the Dutch. Because of the differing cultural and institutional contexts, the Czech government is advised to consider applying Society-driven cooperation and the Dutch government may apply Co-production, to reach sustainable transition. 
This study concludes that PPPs have a direct positive influence on the perceived successful governing effectiveness in both contexts, yet they are not suitable in aiming for a sustainable transition. Second, Co-production has more of a positive influence on the perceived successful governing effectiveness in the Czech case, though having a high potential in the Dutch, in terms of reaching the sustainable transition. Last, Society-driven cooperation also has more of a positive influence on the perceived successful governing effectiveness in the Czech case, though having a rather negative influence on governing effectiveness in the Dutch case, regarding the sustainable transition.",
"Participatie in een inclusief Zuid-Holland, doen de laaggeletterden mee?",Job Holzhauer,2020-08-03,"['Dr. M.A.C. van Ostaijen', 'Prof. dr. P.W.A. Scholten']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"De hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek is: Wat is het overheids- en burgerperspectief op participatiemogelijkheden van laaggeletterden binnen de provincie Zuid-Holland en welke verbeterpunten komen daaruit voort? Dit is gedaan via een kwalitatief onderzoek. Verschillende taalambassadeurs, medewerkers van de provincie en een docent Nederlands zijn geïnterviewd. 
Laaggeletterdheid is een maatschappelijk probleem in heel Nederland en ook zeker in de provincie Zuid-Holland. Het aantal laaggeletterden groeit nog steeds. Dit onderzoek is gericht op hoe laaggeletterden participeren en kunnen participeren in Zuid-Holland. De provincie heeft als ambitie een inclusief Zuid-Holland waarbij iedereen mee kan doen. Dan is het belangrijk dat de ruim 500.000 laaggeletterden ook de mogelijkheid moeten hebben om mee te kunnen doen. 
In de literatuur was het nooit heel duidelijk hoe laaggeletterden participeren bij de overheid. Verschillende onderzoeken gaven verschillende conclusies. Wel was over laaggeletterden bekend dat ze minder participeren in de samenleving, vaak onder de lage inkomensklassen vallen en moeite hebben met het vinden van werk. Binnen dit onderzoek is geprobeerd aan de hand van verschillende vormen van interactieve beleidsvormingen en de participatieladder van Arnstein te kijken hoe laaggeletterden participeren. 
Het uiteindelijke antwoord op de hoofdvraag is dat laaggeletterden non-participeren. Ze behalen niet de beoogde trede op de participatieladder en hierdoor lijkt het dat laaggeletterden niet participeren. Ze willen wel participeren of co-creëren. Vooral meepraten en meedenken is iets waar laaggeletterden het meest interesse in hebben.",
Act Now! Or vote for change: Een frame-analyse op de narratieven van GroenLinks leden en Extinction Rebellion participanten,"Feenstra, M.",2020-08-02,"['Emiel Rijshouwer', 'Willem Schinkel']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Afgelopen maanden is er een groei te zien in politieke participatie. Betrokken verenigen zich onder verschillende groepen, waaronder Extinction Rebellion en GroenLinks. De media berichtte voornamelijk over groeiend onconventionele politieke participatie, ten koste van traditionele vormen van politieke participatie door toenemend institutioneel wantrouwen. Dit bleek niet voldoende verklaring te geven. Gedurende dit onderzoek is er bestudeerd wat dan wel de redenen zijn voor verschillende leden van Extinction Rebellion of GroenLinks om betrokken te worden bij een of beide groepen. Hierbij is er gebruik gemaakt van kwalitatieve diepte-interviews met twaalf verschillende respondenten. De narratieven van deze respondenten brengen verschillende vormen van betekenisgeving tot uiting. Deze narratieven zijn met elkaar vergeleken en vervolgens geanalyseerd door middel van de frame-analyse van Goffman (1974). Vervolgens zijn er vier frames opgesteld die antwoord geven op de onderzoeksvraag: “Welke frames onderbouwen de keuzes voor politieke betrokkenheid van jongeren bij Extinction Rebellion of GroenLinks?” De vier frames zijn opeenvolgend identificatie, institutioneel vertrouwen, ideologie en instrumentele motieven. Binnen elk van de vier frames zijn verschillen waarneembaar waarom een respondent voor een groep kiest, en niet voor de andere groep.","['Political Participation', 'Frame analysis', 'Activism', 'Identification', 'Institutional Trust']"

De publieke boundary spanners en de passage van bureaucratie,Marijn Stouten,2020-07-31,"['Dr.ir. J. Eshuis', 'Dr. J. Willems']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Het onderzoek beschouwt door middel van kwantitatief en kwalitatief onderzoek (gemixte methode) de invloed van de bureaucratie op de werkzaamheden van boundary spanners bij één van de Nederlandse ministeries. Samenwerking en onderlinge verbondenheid worden binnen de overheid steeds belangrijker bij het aanpakken van maatschappelijke vraagstukken die niet meer binnen de verantwoordelijkheden van één directie passen (Groeneveld, 2016; Sanderson, 2006). Boundary spanners weten over de grenzen van directies heen te treden en dienen als tussenpersoon en verbinder die onderlinge samenwerking tussen directies weten te stimuleren (Van Meerkerk & Edelenbos, 2014). Bureaucratie werpt daarentegen juist grenzen op en zorgt onder andere voor specialisatie en fragmentatie waarbij de directies juist focussen op hun eigen werkzaamheden en de verbinding niet opzoeken (Nederhand et al., 2018). Het onderzoek bekijkt daarom of de boundary spanners in deze organisatievorm nog steeds hun twee typerende werkzaamheden (Aldrich & Herker, 1977) kunnen uitvoeren. De hoofdvraag van het onderzoek luidt: Op welke wijze beïnvloedt bureaucratie de werkzaamheden van boundary spanners bij het Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat? 
Om een antwoord op deze vraag te krijgen is binnen het onderzoek een wetenschappelijke basis gelegd op basis waarvan het onderzoek kon worden uitgevoerd. Deze wetenschappelijke basis behandelde de beschikbare kennis over, van, voor bureaucratie en boundary spanners in de publieke sector en schetste het verwachte verband tussen de twee kernbegrippen. Empirische data werd gegenereerd door gebruik te maken van een gemixte methode waarbij de werknemers van vier specifiek geselecteerde directies werden onderzocht. Ten eerste werd bij deze vier directies een enquête verspreid welke het verband tussen de bureaucratische organisatiekenmerken en de werkzaamheden van boundary spanners onderzocht. Naar aanleiding van de enquête zijn vier verdiepende interviews gehouden waarbij elke directie werd vertegenwoordigd. 
Uit het kwantitatieve onderzoek waar 54 respondenten aan deelnamen (26% van de gehele onderzoekspopulatie) bleken geen significante verbanden te bestaan tussen de bureaucratische organisatiekenmerken en de informatieverwerkingsfunctie en externe vertegenwoordigingsfunctie, de twee werkzaamheden van boundary spanners. Opvallend was de hoge mate van ervaren taakverdeling en specialisatie en lage mate van ervaren hiërarchie door de boundary spanners. Uit het kwalitatieve onderzoek bleek in aanvulling op de kwantitatieve resultaten op welke wijze de twee werkzaamheden van boundary spanners worden uitgevoerd. De informatieverwerkingsfunctie wordt voornamelijk uitgevoerd door informatie te selecteren en filteren op relevantie en prioriteit. Dit doen boundary spanners met het oog op de eigen directie. Bij de externe vertegenwoordigingsfunctie lijkt het belangrijk te zijn dat de boundary spanner kan vertegenwoordigen vanaf het juiste hiërarchische niveau in de organisatie.
Aanvullend op de bestaande wetenschappelijke literatuur concludeert dit onderzoek dat boundary spanners geen sterke invloed van bureaucratische organisatiekenmerken ervaren. Kwantitatief onderzoek wijst aan dat in deze onderzoekscontext geen verband bestaat tussen de bureaucratie en de werkzaamheden van de boundary spanners. Dat boundary spanners weinig invloed ervaren van de hiërarchische structuur kan duiden op voldoende autonomie en manoeuvreerruimte voor de werkzaamheden die zij uitvoeren. Anderzijds is het mogelijk dat zij om de belemmering van hiërarchie heen kunnen werken. Binnen deze bureaucratische organisatie kunnen boundary spanners dus functioneren en zorgen voor onderlinge verbinding tussen directies waarbij onderlinge afhankelijkheid wordt ondervangen. Uiteindelijk komt dit de aanpak van maatschappelijke vraagstukken ten goede. 
De wetenschappelijke aanbevelingen van het onderzoek bevatten een voorstel voor een vervolgonderzoek. Het onderzoek dat voor u ligt is namelijk zeer select omgegaan met het selecteren van de onderzoekspopulatie. Daarnaast is het onderzoek voornamelijk verkennend te noemen en behoren de conclusies ondersteund te worden door een uitbreiding van de dataset. Daarbij is binnen dit onderzoek geen vergelijking gemaakt tussen boundary spanners en niet boundary spanners. Praktische aanbevelingen focussen zich onder andere op de rol van leidinggevenden. Zij behoren vanwege hun belangrijke positie de identificatie van boundary spanners op zich nemen en de bekendheid van de boundary spanner vergroten. Daarnaast kunnen zij boundary spanners helpen door het geven van ondersteuning en feedback, autonomie en manoeuvreerruimte. Dit komt de effectiviteit van boundary spanners ten goede.",

How do Asian and Western-European female students perceive body diverse models",Pui-Mun Chan,2020-07-31,['Dr. Anne-Mette Hermans'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","What is the socially acceptable female body type? For a prolonged period of time, women of bigger body shape and size are discriminated against by society in various cultures. Today, many are still experiencing this discrimination, however, some cultures are beginning to embrace and accept that there is a diverse range of body shapes and size which makes each one of us unique. In the media and in advertisements, there is a lack of portrayal and representation of diverse body types. For this reason, many brands are beginning to feature different body types to fulfil customers’ demand and acknowledge that there are various body types around us. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to explore the perception of Asian and Western-European female students on body diverse models. Furthermore, this thesis will also explore the perceptions of female students from Asian and Western-European countries on body diverse models displayed by clothing brands from ‘the East’ and ‘the West’ on Instagram. Hence, the main research question is: How do female students from all over the world perceive models with diverse body types presented by clothing brands from ‘the East’ and ‘the West’ on Instagram? and the sub-research questions are: (1) How do Asian female students perceive model’s body diversity presented by clothing brands from ‘the East’ and ‘the West’ on Instagram? (2) How do Western-European female students perceive the model’s body diversity presented by clothing brands from ‘the East’ and ‘the West’ on Instagram? To address the main research and sub-research questions, twelve semi-structured interviews have been conducted with female students of Asian and Western-European backgrounds. All participants are aged between 22 to 26, residing in respective countries of their culture. All participants were recruited utilizing the friends of friends method. Stimulus materials were also utilized for this research study from four clothing brands from ‘the East’ and ‘the West’, Neiwai (China), Jstyle (South Korea), ASOS (United Kingdom) and Universal Standards (United States). The stimulus materials which included a total of sixteen images, four from each brand's displayed images of women of diverse body types featured on the brand’s Instagram account. These images were shown to participants during the interview. Following the completion of all interviews, all interviews were transcribed and utilized as the base to conduct a thematic analysis. The thematic analysis resulted in three main categories and four sub-categories which helped to address the main research and sub-research questions. Findings show there needs to be more body diverse models displayed in the media and by brands in advertisements and to model for clothing brands.","['Body diversity', 'East-Asia and Western-Europe', 'Clothing brands', 'Instagram', 'Semi-structured interviews']"
‘Beyond Green and White’,Christine Eamer,2020-07-30,"['Dr. Maria Schiller', 'Dr.  Asya Pisarevskaya']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"A unique programme entitled the “Programme d’appui aux nouveaux arrivants” (PANA) exists in the Canadian majority Anglophone province of Ontario, within the minority French-language education system. This programme offers additional support to newcomer immigrant children who are undereducated and need assistance to catch up academically to their Canadian-born peers through a formal curriculum policy. This study linked the discussion of education policy as a means for collective identity construction to the fostering of a diverse and inclusive society, through analysis of the case of the PANA programme. It did so especially through the lens of the institutionalism inherent in the French-language education system. 
	Policy analysis of the PANA formal curriculum documents, as well as qualitative interviews with actors at the provincial, regional and local levels of educational governance in the province, generated interesting reflections. Notably, institutionalism, while having a role in the PANA programme does not define it. This finding differed from the expectations of the study which were based on historical institutionalism and integration theories. 
	The use of an abductive methodology revealed the existence of a complex web of actors involved in the governance of the PANA programme and its associated policy framework. These actors hold differing interpretations of the PANA programme and its relative importance when it comes to the dichotomy of collective identity construction and diversity and inclusion. Ultimately, local teachers, as the actors responsible for the implementation, are street-level bureaucrats who hold a high level of discretion within an opportunity transparent field, allowing for agency. They are, in fact, mandated to alter the programme to local demands through the concept of prudential curriculum, and adapt it to each child through ‘différenciation pédagogique’. This discretion is expressed by actors holding a broad range of understanding, training and motivation.
	While it does create some challenges, it is recommended that the potential flexibility within the institutional framework of the French-language education system be used to implement more training, standardisation and centralisation, and thus ensure a more consistent quality of the service provided through the PANA programme within the province.",

"Listening to stories from the borders - 
Uprooting, Disjuncture, and Metamorphosis through Contemporary Storytelling
Events on Migration","Filippone, A.",2020-07-24,['Hoebink D.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study explores the context of storytelling events: oral performances in which migrants interpret
their life experiences in front of an audience. The research focuses on how listening to life stories on
migration affects the listeners, at an individual and a collective level. More specifically, it investigates
the role of storytelling events as a mediator between the listeners’ understanding of their narrative
identity and the narratives on migration built by mass media and NGOs.
In order to explore the existential and social dimensions of storytelling, 10 semi-structured interviews
have been conducted with usual participants of storytelling events on migration, organized in different
parts of the world.
The conceptual core of this study is first informed by Ricoeur’s theory of narrative identity, and second
by Van Gennep’s conceptualization of the rites of passage, and in particular of the liminal stage.
Through this interdisciplinary approach at the cross path of philosophy, sociology and anthropology,
the analysis demonstrates the listeners’ understanding of storytelling events as a collective rite of
liminality: as a transitory, in-between state, from disruption to potential for social change. Participants,
after an initial a form of rejection and tension towards the story, are able to negotiate what they heard
and reincorporate those feelings in a critical reflection on their own society’s stereotypes and limits.
Therefore, the context of storytelling events creates a bridge between migrant and host society’s
members by inviting both groups to experience dialogic moments.
Finally, the potential of a theoretical approach to storytelling joins the vibrant conversation on the postcolonial approach by positing storytelling events on migration as a form of knowledge production
disruptive of Eurocentric knowledge. By giving voice to migrant experiences and memories,
storytelling events can become the environment in which deep-rooted prejudice can be transformed
into new, culturally democratic, discursive forms.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'liminality', 'migratory experience', 'storytelling', 'narrative identity', 'hegemonic narratives.']"

The construction of masculinity in rap songs’ lyrics from 1990-1995 and
rap songs from 2005-2010","Lykotrafiti, M",2020-07-24,['Dankoor K.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Rap music constitutes one of the most popular genres worldwide. The genre
started as a means of protest for African Americans against the social inequality.
Nevertheless the content altered over the years and rap music eventually took a
different direction and turned out to be as an anti-feminist movement. The central
content of the lyrics was firmly connected to sexist ideas and stereotypes regarding
the interaction between the two genders. For this reason, it is vital to examine the
alteration of the lyrics over time and the promoted role models through rap. Since the
most content analyses examined videos, thereby this paper aims to fill the existing
academic gap. Thus, the following research question emerged: How is Black
masculinity constructed in raps’ song lyrics from 1990-1995 and rap songs from
2005-2010? In order to provide an answer to the posed research question, three
subquestions were created. In detail, this paper analyses the construction of
masculinity in the 90s’ (first subquestion) and in the 00s’ (second subquestion)
leading to the third subquestion regarding the most noticeable similarities and
differences between these two eras. By analysing 12 songs, the qualitative content
analysis identified 4 themes for each era with misogyny being in the spotlight.
Moreover, an additional theme that was extracted although contradictory to the
aforementioned is the reference of love. The analysis aims to bridge the literature
gap concerning masculinity in rap music and also to delve into the interaction of the
genders which is depicted in rap music.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'masculinity', '90s’ rap', '00s’ rap', 'content analysis', 'lyrics', 'Hip Hop culture']"
Refugees’ Navigating Social and Symbolic Boundaries Through Food Practices,"Mawazini, J.
     and 
    
  


Schaap, J.",2020-07-24,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Food is so strongly tied to culture and identity and undeniably establishes symbolic boundaries
between groups. Syrian food is a relatively a new research topic that is attracting more attention
in recent years as part of the growing interest in the refugee crisis since 2015, when refugees,
especially Syrians, started to cross the Mediterranean Sea and arrived in Europe. This
qualitative study is conducted to explore, how Syrian refugees draw/bridge boundaries through
food practices, from an insider position who understands Syrian culture and is able to interpret
refugees’ responses meaningfully. This research is done based on twenty in-depth interviews
with Syrian refugees from mixed socioeconomic, cultural backgrounds whose ages range
between 24 and 40 years old. All respondents have been living in the Netherlands since 2015.
All interviews took place between December 2019 and March 2020 in various cities in the
Netherlands. This study revolves around the cultural identity of Syrian refugees by drawing a
timeline from the moment they arrived in the Netherlands until the date of the interview.
In the conclusion, results show that there is an experienced difference between home
and the host country that, from the very beginning, causes boundary drawing and crystallizes
the lines of cultural boundaries. Maintaining boundaries with the Dutch natives and sustaining a
sense of home are simultaneously established through food that enables the maintenance of an
embodied sense of comfort. The construction of cultural identity through food has many
dimensions that reach further than everyday activities. It has triggered interest in researching
the social phenomena of food and culture. This is not only related to the food itself (taste,
ingredients) but also the practices surrounding food consumption (cultural differences regarding
hospitality, the eating, ritual, ethnic restaurants, religious values; moral and gender roles).
Stereotypes and role expectations play a large role here as well. They clearly show that people
are often simply unsure how people from another group may respond. Then, there's also the
double-edged sword of food that attaches refugee migrants to their country of origin, while it
establishes a platform to share identity and communicate with people. The warm ties to food
and a place of belonging can also create barriers against the host country, where life is felt to be
unstable and cultural differences are constantly experienced. This catches Syrian refugees
between the hammer of change and the anvil of resistance/acceptance. Hence, cultural change
is inevitable and identities are not only constructed, they are reconstructed and resettled based
on new mechanisms of acculturation.
6
On the other hand, the bridging-potential food has, is relatively high, because people
seem more inclined to 'taste' unfamiliar food than they want to meet or be around unfamiliar
people. The practicality of communication and boundary crossing demonstrate the pleasure of
breaking bread with Dutch people, which is critically seen as a positive reinforcement when food
creates connection this way and helps smooth out difficulties of communication in a pleasurable
way.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Syrian refugees', 'integration and acculturation', 'food practices', 'cultural identity', 'symbolic and social boundaries']"

We, the diasporic youth talking about the Homeland - 
Visual Elicitation Study of Turkish Diasporic Youth’s Identity and Place Perception","Noto, M.",2020-07-24,['Calkins T.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","By inquiring into the narratives and system of discourses, this study explores the identity and
place-based perception of the Turkish diasporic youth. Specifically, this study is concerned
with how being born and raised in a country different than the home country impacts the selfidentity construction and the perception itself of the country of origin. To that end, 12
Turkish immigrants based in the Netherlands have been interviewed according to an
intersection of video-elicitation technique integrated within semi-structured interviews.
The use of moving pictures arises out semiotically as a social practice, by means of which
hidden nuances of the everyday life are unraveled and alternative meaning-making are
conveyed. Under the following premises, the screening of 6 short movies has been employed
as a springboard for discussion. The theoretical framework of this study is rooted in the
constructionist and interpretive approach of symbolic interactionism, according to which the
self emerges out of the dichotomy of the domestic and public sphere, shaping the Me and the
I. Moreover, this study has been colored by the theories of Pierre Bourdieu, in regard to the
Habitus and Cultural Capital.
Tracing the results of the thematic analysis, three main factors have been identified as playing
a considering role in influencing diasporic youth’s perception. First of all, the family
environment as well as the public one, materialized in the very concept of Habitus, lay out the
groundwork for the identity construction process. Intrinsically attached to the latter, another
factor identified is the concept of Cultural capital, through which not only the participants'
practices in terms of language, traditions and customs, but also their reception of the movies
has been understood. Finally, the difference in gender and the implication of it on the
representation of the self has furthermore confirmed the finding, according to which the
identity and the perception of the home country differs and develops across the habitus, the
cultural capital and the gender. As a result, the diasporic youth’s identity remains in between
the here and the there in a continuous dualism between the inner and the outer self, as being
the eternal foreigners bouncing at the backdrop of the domestic versus the public dichotomy.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Turkish diaspora', 'Self-identity', 'Habitus', 'Cultural Capital', 'Video-elicitation', 'technique']"
"Empowering Craftsmanship in Makerspaces - 
Managers’ Perception and Enabling of Craftsmanship
in Utrecht’s Creative Cluster
Makers van Merwede","Tian, X.",2020-07-24,['Brandellero A.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Place-specific, small-scale craft manufacturing is experiencing a renewed interest in
urban cultural policy as it addresses issues associated with consumption-oriented city
development. Under this potential craft revival, the extent to which urban
manufacturing centres such as makerspaces facilitate craft is not clear. While prior
literature often relates makerspaces to digitalization, less academic interest has been
shown in the relationship between makerspaces and the wider revival of
craftsmanship in the urban context. In order to respond to such a knowledge gap, we
must look to the managers of such spaces, those facilitate crafts and making within
their makerspace in response to urban policy challenges. Hence, this research
investigates managers’ perception and facilitation of values of craftsmanship in the
makerspaces of Makers van Merwede, a creative district in Utrecht. The research
method contains in-depth interviews with managers from three of the makerspaces,
accompanied by observation of public events and document analysis of Merwede’s
redevelopment plan. The main findings of this research indicate that managers
perceive and facilitate values of craftsmanship in ways that foster a better collective
making environment. They reinforce the cultural, social and economic values of
craftsmanship within a excellence-driven, trust-based community and strengthening
the societal values of craft externally, in the broader urban area. The redevelopment
agenda of Merwede requires makerspaces to incorporate a mixed-use future
neighbourhood and, while creativity is sought to be retained, urban policy still
requires some makerspaces give way to residential plans. Hence, managers tend to
facilitate craft towards the needs of the neighbourhood to define their involvement in
future redevelopment plans. In conclusion, craft is experiencing a revival in Makers
van Merwede because the dimensions of craftsmanship are actively practiced there.
Nevertheless, a more progressive policy should be advocated to harness crafts and
making.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Craftsmanship', 'Makerspace', 'Manager', 'Makers van Merwede', 'Urban', 'Cultural Policy']"

inclusion/exclusion - 
Urban art in de Afrikaanderwijk","Grund, M.
     and 
    
  


Schaap, J.",2020-07-24,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the last decades, an important issue on the agendas of European countries is the ‘assumed’ concentration of poverty in urban neighbourhoods. The debate about the one-sided composition of neighbourhoods in terms of socio-economic circumstances affecting liveability and safety plays a significant role in changing policies to redevelop cities. Redeveloping degraded places into lively, mixed neighbourhoods is often approached by city councils as the answer, for having a positive effect on the whole city and its image. In the city of Rotterdam this gentrification process plays a significant part in the redevelopment of the city from a working-class harbour city to a more ‘cosmopolitan’ modern city, attractive for residents with high economic and cultural capital. The Afrikaanderwijk is one of the neighbourhoods in which this process can be closely observed, for that it is near the city centre and is known for high criminality rates, poverty and social housing. The last couple of years, the municipality has started to invest to revitalize the neighbourhood and make it more attractive for more-fortuned newcomers. A tool, which is employed to ‘enhance’ the liveability of the residents is commissioned street art, though the question raises, if this is the case? The aim of this research is to understand if an imposed tool as street art as part of the gentrification process enhances liveability and if it is conducive to feelings of inclusion for original residents and newcomers. 
Method: This research consists of eleven in-depth interviews, consisting of newcomers, creative entrepreneurs, yet mostly original residents of the Afrikaanderwijk. During the interview, ten images of graffiti and street art in the neighbourhood are presented to the respondents and they are asked to respond and reflect on them. The choice of using images is to reflect the complexity of the discourse about the aesthetic value of street-art and graffiti as a tool of gentrification and to what extent it is conducive to feelings of inclusion or exclusion. 
Results & conclusion: The results show that the respondents indicate that the municipality disregards the original residents, which is influenced by the way the municipality, together with housing corporation Vestia, have implemented the steps of gentrification. The original residents perceive some positive sides of the changes (e.g. less crime, safer feeling). Nonetheless, the feeling of exclusion dominates for the original residents. In this research, the original residents perceive street art as part of the gentrification process different in comparison to the newcomers. The commissioned street art has the opposite effect for the original residents, which is related to their experiences with this process of gentrification, though also is affected by their cultural capital and their perceived appreciation for the arts. For the newcomers, the presence of the street art works reflects a feeling of pride, for the fact that it is a popular form of art which portrays a certain class. This research shows that the changes in the urban environment, specifically the portrayed street art, mostly plays a role in feeling excluded for the original residents with low economic and cultural capital. Original residents perceive the applied works as imposed to cover up their displacement. This demonstrates that the municipality ignores the needs of the—mostly original—residents, resulting in this group feeling excluded and not feeling as the desired group of residents. Enforcing and presenting street art in the urban space in the Afrikaanderwijk as something positive and contributing to the liveability is a form of symbolic violence by the municipality. It is not made for the original residents; it is made for the newcomers.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Gentrification', 'Inclusion', 'Street art', 'Urban space', 'Rotterdam']"
"Diversity in the cultural sector of Rotterdam - 
The dynamic relationship between cultural policy and cultural institutions","Bhugwansing, D.",2020-07-24,['Eijck K. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The aim of this thesis is to investigate to what extent the objectives of the cultural policy
framework of Rotterdam’s municipality match the objectives and practices of the city’s cultural
institutions. This research specifically focuses on diversity in cultural institutions’ programming
and audience. The impetus for researching this topic is the debates in the Netherlands that
have been centering around diversity in the cultural sector and policy making since the second
half of the twentieth century.
The data set of this thesis consists, first, of the cultural policy framework of 2017 – 2020
of Rotterdam’s municipality. In addition, the annual reports of 2016 and 2018 of 18 cultural
institutions in the city are analyzed. Two cultural institutions per discipline, as determined by
the Rotterdam Council of Art and Culture, were selected based on the highest amount of
subsidy received. The nine different disciplines are architecture, design and e-culture, visual
arts and photography, cultural education and social cohesion, dance, film, municipal collection
and heritage, literature and debate, music, and theater. The research is conducted by means
of qualitative content analysis.
The main findings of this thesis show that the focus of the municipality’s cultural policy
framework is on the diversification of the audiences and audience research. However, it seems
that the municipality’s recommendations are non-binding. The focus in most of the annual
reports of the cultural institutions is on programming rather than audience composition. But
even in the discussion of programming, it remains unclear how diverse the programming is. In
most cases the discussion of programming is limited to a description of the storyline without
specifying which audience segments the cultural institutions are trying to reach. With regard to
audiences, cultural institutions provide limited information on their audience reach and
audience composition. If information is provided, this is limited to visitor numbers in most cases.
Another remarkable finding is that some cultural institutions implicitly discuss diversity. They
often remain vague and speculative. As a result, is it not clear what exactly is meant by certain
statements. Moreover, the majority of cultural institutions has not started to conduct audience
research at all. Therefore, the overall picture of how a broad and diverse audience is going to
be reached and attracted by the cultural sector as a whole – a wish expressed by Rotterdam’s
municipality – is missing.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Cultural policy', 'Cultural institutions', 'Diversity', 'Programming', 'Audience']"

"Culture education through museum labels - 
Labels in museums and the cognitive skills they enhance to children of
primary school age.","Zisimopoulou, A.",2020-07-24,['Konings F.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","We live in a time where technological innovation and globalisation are provoking tidal shifts
in the way we learn, work, live and communicate with others. Children growing up in these
times will need to master a set of different skills to cope with a constantly changing reality.
But what are these skills and what is the best way to promote them? While many have tried
answering this riddle, it seems that radical changes are needed to, not only adjust the
relevance of information provided, but to also dive deep into the structure of the learning
process itself. On this note, the field of cultural education has much to offer.
Cultural Education can help children understand their culture and the culture of others.
Education though does not occur only in formal learning places such as schools, but also in
informal learning places such as museums. Hence, how can we connect cultural education
and museums? In this thesis I attempt to bring together these two disciplines, by exploring to
what extent do museums advance cognitive skills in young audiences of primary school by
the use of exhibit labels. To do so, I have approached this matter by conducting interviews
with museum professionals involved in the labelling process and by conducting content
analysis of labels of their respective museums. In this way, this research aims to reach the
very essence of how labels can have a pivotal role in promoting a set of cognitive skills. My
findings testify that museums can indeed promote cognitive skills through object labels, but
in order to succeed in advancing all skills efficiently, a diversity of tools is needed to be
utilized in building up sequence. Finally, by paying closer attention to the structuring of labels
according to my recommendations, I believe museums will be in a better position to promote
the skills they strive to develop in their young audiences.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Cultural education', 'museum labels', 'young audience', 'cultural cognition', 'constructivism']"
Uncertainties Through Time: Career Trajectories of Fashion Photographers,"Maglevanaia, Daria",2020-07-23,['Dijck M. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Fashion photography started its’ emergence in the mid 19th century and sooner turned
into one of the most important parts in garment production and advertising. However, during
all the time fashion photography as a professional field is a way of trying to find a balance
between commercial and “artsy” (editorial) work. The career trajectories of fashion
photographers is a complex structure, where each subsequent interaction with the fashion
industry depends not only on skills but also on the symbolic positions and trust. Belonging to
the symbolic economy as a creative industry, this field builds its laws of constructing status,
as well as rewards for the work. Based on previous studies, there are two pathways of career
development for fashion photographers. On the one hand, they can grow their symbolic
capital and recognition through low- or unpaid collaborations with legitimate actors
(magazines and brands) and publish editorial work in independent magazines. After a while,
they can be noticed by specific commercial clients who not only have budgets but also
recognition in the field. In the other hand, those, who tend to focus on commercial (and
financially rewarding) work from the beginning can face a short-term existence in the fashion
world despite the immediate monetary profit without obtaining any status positions. This
research explores the trajectories of fashion photographers career paths looking into their
collaboration with other agents of the fashion world, taking into account processes of
obtaining different forms of capital and conversion of then into each other and exchange of
them into symbolic one. This research paper is focused on a mixed-method approach, using
semi-structured interviews with fashion photographers as well as quantitative analysis of the
longitudinal data, collected from archival and recruitment website ”models.com”. It includes
information about the cover and editorial photoshoots in fashion and lifestyle magazines and
campaigns for clothing and accessory brands from 1985 to 2019. Based on this, we can see
the role of social networks in career development in the field of fashion photography as well
as obstacles on a professional pathway.","['global markets', 'local creativities', 'glocal', 'global markets', 'local creativities', 'fashion history', 'fashion photography', 'social', 'networks', 'creative labour', 'precarity', 'cultural industry']"
Scenario planning: toekomstige leiderschapscompetenties,Anne  Ter Vrugt,2020-07-23,"['Dr. R. Moody', 'B. Broekema MSc.']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Dit onderzoek hoopt meer inzicht te geven in toekomstige leiderschapscompetenties voor de publieke sector. De gehanteerde strategie is een scenariostudie op basis van de TAIDA methode (Lindgren & Bandhold, 2009) waarin vier scenario’s op basis van de belangrijkste onzekerheden tot stand zijn gekomen. De hoofdvraag luidt daarbij als volgt: Welke toekomstscenario’s zijn in de publieke sector te onderscheiden en welke (mogelijk) relevante leiderschapscompetenties komen in deze scenario’s naar voren? Een scenariostudie wordt veelal ingezet om vroegtijdig te anticiperen op mogelijke toekomsten. Scenario’s geven verschillende beelden hoe de toekomst er uit zou kunnen zien (Lindgren & Bandhold, 2009; Janssen et al., 2002). Vanuit de literatuur zijn ook toekomstige leiderschapscompetenties benoemd zoals samenwerkingsgericht (’t Hart, 2014) en nieuwe huidige competenties zoals het omgaan met sociale media (Van der Wal, 2017). Door middel van zowel kwalitatieve als kwantitatieve methoden en een trendanalyse zijn de onzekerheden gedestilleerd. In totaal hebben 98 respondenten de vragenlijst ingevuld en zijn 4 experts uit de wetenschap en 15 medewerkers uit de publieke sector, met/zonder leidinggevende functie geïnterviewd. De volgende scenario’s zijn daarbij tot stand gekomen op basis van ongelijkheid onder burgers en politiek-bestuurlijke middelen van de gemeente als belangrijkste onzekerheden: 

Scenario 1 ‘de boot gemist’ kenmerkt zich door crisis, wantrouwen, weinig politiek-bestuurlijke middelen en een hoge mate van ongelijkheid tussen burgers. Een leidinggevende is daarin beheersend, verbindend, stressbestendig en bezit een sterk reflectief vermogen.
Scenario 2 ‘to innovate or not to innovate’ impliceert een grote ongelijkheid tussen burgers. Er zijn echter wel meer politiek-bestuurlijke middelen. Aan de ene kant zijn er geld en mogelijkheden om te experimenteren met innovaties, aan de andere kant heerst er angst voor risico’s. Dit scenario vraagt om een besluitvaardige leider, met lef, reflecterend vermogen, en een verbindende en nieuwsgierige houding. 
Scenario 3 ‘utopia?’ lijkt een gunstig scenario waarin een gemeente veel politiek-bestuurlijke middelen heeft en er weinig ongelijkheid tussen burgers is. Nieuwe competenties zoals het omgaan met technologie en digitalisering lijken hierin centraal te staan. 
In scenario 4 ‘de gemeenschap overheerst’ is het zelf organiserend vermogen van burgers sterk aanwezig. Burgers zijn zelfvoorzienend en solidair naar elkaar waardoor er ook nauwelijks sociale ongelijkheid is. Een leidinggevende is samenwerkingsgericht, heeft een faciliterende rol en een nieuwsgierige blik. 
Overkoepelende toekomstige leiderschapscompetenties zijn communicatieve vaardigheden, samenwerkings- en veranderingsgericht en een sterk reflectief vermogen.",
Fathers’ Support Systems - A Comparative and Qualitative Analysis of Higher and Vocationally Educated Fathers’ Involvement with Children’s Academic Education,"Schippers, M.",2020-07-23,"['Renske Keizer', 'Renske Verweij']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"A growing body of research has considered parental socioeconomic status and its relation to children’s educational chances. However, research into the ways in which fathers are involved in their children’s education is limited, especially regarding children’s (post-)adolescent, tertiary educational period. To understand fathers’ role in perpetuating social inequalities through parental educational involvement, the present study fills the gap in existing literature and answers the question: How do the educational involvement and the motives given for this behavior differ between fathers with different levels of socioeconomic status? This qualitative study maps the experiences, attitudes, and reported behaviors of higher educated and vocationally educated fathers regarding their children’s academic educational career. Data was gathered in ten in-depth interviews with six higher educated and four vocationally educated fathers. This study finds that vocationally educated and higher educated fathers provide different ways of support to their university-going children. Vocationally educated fathers reported an inability to aid with the educational process directly and instead focused on emotional and practical support. Higher educated fathers focused on active involvement with their children’s higher educational career. This is in line with Lareau’s works on “natural growth” and “concentrated cultivation.” The Dutch context in this study ensures that all fathers highlighted their role as financial guides throughout their children’s academic education. The discrepancies in involvement between higher and vocationally educated fathers are important for policy-makers and researchers focused on intergenerational transmissions of social inequalities.","['Cultural capital', 'intergenerational transmission of inequality', 'paternal educational involvement', '(post-)adolescent children', 'support systems']"
Recalibrating city branding to Social Cohesion,"Parra Giraldo, Isabel",2020-07-20,['Laar P. van de'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Products, services, people, countries, and cities all think themselves in brand terms. The
branding of cities has been commonly thought as an image-building strategy and often
attacked along with city marketing for boostering gentrification, social inequality and
exclusion. A relatively high number of authors argue that city branding leads to socially
divisive outcomes by excessively benefiting specific target groups. In contrast, an
equivalent number of publications regarding city brands stress the potential they have to
create a common identity and define a new shared sense of belonging able to bond
residents to the city.
City branding has often followed the trends and methods of business brands. Over the
years, business brands have changed evolved and adapted. From first being considered a
name and a logo, it is now commonly accepted that brands evoke emotions, generate
identity, and create communities. Brand communities are socially constructed entities
formed by deep emotional bonds, that share culture, rituals, traditions and codes of
behaviour.
City branding can learn from business branding the methods to create a community. In this
way city branding contributes to the social cohesion of cities.
City brands have the power to inspire and create cohesion when they are defined in
participatory processes and guide the decisions of the development and governance of
the city. This conclusion is based on theoretical insights and empirical data from
Amsterdam, Barcelona and Rotterdam. The city branding of Rotterdam was treated as a
case study.","['global markets', 'local creativities', 'glocal', 'city branding', 'urban governance', 'social cohesion', 'city marketing', 'city brands']"

that contributed to the climate problem and in turn inquire how we can move past these philosophical ideas and change our attitudes towards nature, so that we can address the climate problem better. I argue that environmental ethics should be based on the reconnection of the human with nature. To do this, I first investigate the complexity of the climate problem. Second, I discuss past conceptions of nature, from the ancient Greek conception of physis to twentieth century critiques about the devastation of the earth. In the third section, I discuss the contemporary ideological and political economic context of the climate problem, particularly neoliberalism and environmentalism. In the final section, I investigate alternative conceptions of nature by Bruno Latour, Jason Moore, Timothy Morton, Rosi Braidotti, Donna Haraway and Val Plumwood.

SENSING,Ramona Brugman,2020-07-17,"['Dr. V.M.F. Homburg', 'Dr. R. Moody']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op sensing, de inzet van sensoren, door gemeenten in de publieke ruimte. Het doel van het onderzoek was te bepalen welke factoren de acceptatie van burgers beïnvloeden in het geval van vier verschillende typen sensoren. 
Door middel van een literatuuronderzoek naar de adoptie van technologie in algemene zin en sensing in het bijzonder is een zevental hypothesen opgesteld. Deze hypothesen veronderstelden relaties tussen acceptatie en perceived usefulness, perceived risk, vertrouwen in technologie, vertrouwen in de overheid, anxiety en sociale invloed. Van de emotionele houding naar de sensor toe werd verwacht dat deze een mediërende rol zou spelen bij perceived risk en anxiety.
Om de invloed van deze factoren op de acceptatie van verschillende sensoren te testen is een kwadrant opgesteld op basis van impact en anonimiteit. De vier sensoren in dit kwadrant waren luchtkwaliteitssensoren, ondergrondse huisvuilcontainers, slimme straatverlichting en camera’s met gezichtsherkenning.
De hypothesen zijn vervolgens getoetst door de afname van een survey onder 215 respondenten, allen inwoner van Nederland. De respondenten hebben een vragenlijst met 22 stellingen per sensor en nog 4 stellingen met betrekking tot vertrouwen in de overheid beantwoord.
De kwantitatieve data die deze survey opleverde is vervolgens statistisch geanalyseerd met, afhankelijk van de veronderstelling in de hypothese, multipele hiërarchische regressieanalyse en mediatieanalyse. 
De conclusie van het onderzoek is dat de acceptatie verschilt per type sensor. Camera’s met gezichtsherkenning zijn veel minder geaccepteerd dan de andere drie typen sensoren. Er zijn verschillende determinanten die inwerken op de acceptatie van de specifieke sensoren. Perceived usefulness, vertrouwen in technologie en anxiety zijn bij alle typen sensoren van invloed op de acceptatie, maar de mate waarin ze bepalend zijn, verschilt per type sensor. Voor luchtkwaliteitssensoren en ondergrondse huisvuilcontainers is vooral perceived usefulness verklarend. De acceptatie van slimme straatverlichting wordt vooral verklaard door het vertrouwen in de technologie. De acceptatie van camera’s met gezichtsherkenning wordt het sterkst verklaard door de angst die men heeft voor deze sensor.",
"Turn on, Tune in, Drop out: a Typology of Modes of Uses of Psychedelic Microdosing","Grušauskaité, Kamile",2020-07-16,['Eijck K. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In 2011, American psychologist James Fadiman coined the term ‘microdosing’, - taking small
doses of psychedelic substances that do not induce intoxication or altered states, but rather
subtle outcomes such as, among others, increased focus. Psychedelic microdosing has quickly
become a mass media phenomenon, with accounts claiming microdosing has become the new
secret to enhancement in work contexts. Drawing from literature on psychedelic microdosing,
technologies of the self, self-identity and sociology of work and leisure, this study understands
microdosing as a technology individuals introduce into their lives to modify themselves for
various purposes and explores the ways in which the 1960s iconic drug that once offered
turning on, tuning in and dropping out, is now finding new uses across different contexts. The
study asks how do individuals use microdoses of classic psychedelic drugs? And how do these
individuals make sense of microdosing in their daily lives regarding their work and the self?
The findings indicate three different uses of psychedelic microdosing: (1) as technology of selfesteem and control at work, (2) as a self-help technology, and (3) as a technology of ‘slow living’.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'Psychedelic drugs', 'microdosing', 'self-identity', 'work', 'leisure', 'modernity']"
"From Pink to Ink: Understanding the decision-making process of women who dressed
their post-mastectomy scars with decorative tattoos","Rodriguez Rodriguez, Maria Fernanda",2020-07-16,['Berghman M.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Breast cancer is the most recurring type of cancer among women and an increasing number of
women opting for a mastectomy: a medical operation in which one or both breasts are removed
with the intention of treating or averting breast cancer. However, there is an emerging population
of cancer survivors in European nations that rather than attempting to reconstruct their breasts to
resemble as much as possible ‘normal’ breasts, have turned to dress their scars with decorative
tattoos. Thus, by means of semi-structured interviews and a phenomenological standpoint, this
research set itself the goal to understand why do women who have undergone a mastectomy
choose to dress their scars with decorative tattoos instead of attempting to regain ‘normalcy’
through breast reconstruction or 3D areola tattoos? The results obtained from the interviews
with fifteen women showed that the disillusionment with one part of the other of breast
restoration techniques has led these women to find an alternative form of healing that allows
them not only to close a painful chapter of their life but also to regain control over their bodies
after a period of time in which agency was taking away from them. Decorative post-mastectomy
tattoos allow these women to grant their bodies with new meanings and produce their own
interpretation of their feminine body and identity. At a practical level, this study hopes to
improve the support systems of these women by possibly providing professionals in the medical
field, tattoo artists, and family members of cancer survivors with a deeper understanding of their
motivations and decision-making processes for choosing an alternative restorative route - such as
decorative tattoos - after their mastectomy. At an intellectual level, however, this study aims to
narrow a gap in the academic field concerning the relationship between mastectomies and
alternative methods of healing such as decorative tattoos, as well as to broaden the understanding
regarding meaning-making and the ‘normal’ feminine body.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'Alternative femininity', 'Decorative mastectomy tattoos', 'Gender embodiment', 'Social stigmatization']"

Kennisdeling in teams,Willemijn Gils,2020-07-13,"['Dr. B. Vermeeren', 'Alissa van Zijl MSc.']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Aanleiding	
Het succes van publieke organisaties is voor een belangrijk deel afhankelijk van de mate waarin medewerkers de kennis die ze hebben, met elkaar delen. De snel veranderende omgeving en toenemende beschikbaarheid van informatie, hebben er de laatste decennia voor gezorgd dat deze kennisdeling alleen nog maar belangrijker geworden is (Gorry, 2008). Om effectief in te kunnen spelen op vraagstukken in het publieke domein, is het van belang dat organisaties actief inzetten op de kennisdeling van hun medewerkers. Zo kan voorkomen worden dat er allerlei losse eilandjes van kennis ontstaan, waarbij niemand weet welke kennis er in een organisatie beschikbaar is en waar deze te vinden is. In de literatuur is weinig onderzoek gedaan naar kennisdeling in teams in publieke organisaties. Aangezien publieke organisaties bij kennisdeling tegen andere problemen aanlopen dan private organisaties (Amayah, 2013; Bozeman, Reed & Scott, 1992; Gorry, 2008), is meer duiding van kennisdeling in publieke organisaties gewenst. Om inzicht te bieden in de mechanismen achter kennisdeling in publieke organisaties is in dit onderzoek een nieuwe invulling gegeven aan een bestaand raamwerk, namelijk het ability-motivation-opportunity model (Appelbaum, Bailey, Berg & Kalleberg, 2000). Dit raamwerk maakt het mogelijk om op basis van de losse beïnvloedingsfactoren die in de literatuur besproken worden, een overkoepelend model op te stellen met factoren van invloed op kennisdeling. Op basis van bovenstaande aanleiding, is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Welke ability-, motivation-, en opportunity-factoren zijn van invloed op de mate van kennisdeling tussen teamleden?
Theorie
Kennisdeling wordt in dit onderzoek verklaard met behulp van het ability-motivation-opportunity (AMO) model (Appelbaum et al., 2000). Dit model geeft inzicht in de factoren die de kundigheid van medewerkers vergroten (ability), de motivatie om te presteren verhogen (motivation) en medewerkers de kans geven om te presteren (opportunity). Deze dimensies blijken uit eerder onderzoek op verschillende manieren invloed te hebben op het gedrag van medewerkers (Jiang, Lepak, Hu & Baer, 2012). De toepassing van het model op kennisdeling is een relatief nieuw onderzoeksveld (Argote, McEvily & Reagans, 2003). De dimensies roepen met betrekking tot kennisdeling de volgende vragen op: Zijn medewerkers in staat om kennis te delen? Zijn medewerkers gemotiveerd om kennis te delen? Krijgen medewerkers de kans om kennis te delen? Door middel van literatuuronderzoek zijn variabelen geïdentificeerd die van invloed zijn op kennisdeling en gecategoriseerd onder één van deze dimensies. Onder ability wordt in dit onderzoek gekeken naar persoonskenmerken, teamkenmerken en vertrouwen. Op het gebied van motivation worden public service motivation, gemeenschapsoverwegingen, persoonlijk voordeel en extrinsieke beloningen onderscheiden. Bij opportunity wordt aandacht besteed aan tijd, informele netwerken, organisatieklimaat en management steun.
Methode
Om de hoofdvraag te beantwoorden, is gekozen voor een onderzoek van kwalitatieve aard, waarbij de invloed van ability-, motivation-, en opportunity-factoren op kennisdeling in teams in de diepte geduid kan worden. Het onderzoek kent een case study ontwerp, waarbij het HR expertteam van het Amphia Ziekenhuis centraal staat. De data is verzameld aan de hand van semigestructureerde interviews met alle teamleden en de afdelingsmanager, waardoor het aantal afgenomen interviews op 14 uitkomt. Na afloop zijn alle interviews getranscribeerd en met behulp van een uitgebreid coderingsschema geanalyseerd.
Resultaten
Uit de beschrijving en analyse van de interviewdata is een drietal bevindingen naar voren gekomen. Ten eerste is duidelijk geworden dat vooral de factoren gemeenschapsoverwegingen (waarbij kennisdeling gemotiveerd wordt door teambelang), persoonlijk voordeel (waarbij verwacht wordt persoonlijk baat te hebben bij kennisdeling), informele netwerken (waarbij via informeel contact kennis gedeeld wordt), management steun, en gezamenlijk doel van invloed zijn op de mate van kennisdeling tussen teamleden. Ten tweede blijkt de opportunity-dimensie in zijn geheel het meest bepalend te zijn voor de mate van kennisdeling. Dit betekent dat de context, meer dan het vermogen of de motivatie om kennis te delen, bepalend is voor de uiteindelijke mate van kennisdeling van respondenten. Ten derde zijn uit de interviewdata twee nieuwe variabelen naar voren gekomen, namelijk fysieke afstand en gezamenlijk doel. De fysieke afstand tussen collega’s blijkt de mogelijkheden die respondenten ervaren om kennis te delen te verminderen. Een gezamenlijk doel heeft invloed op de motivatie en mogelijkheden om kennis te delen en lijkt daarmee een modererende rol te spelen.
Aanbevelingen
Op basis van de interviewdata zijn een viertal aanbevelingen geformuleerd ter verbetering van kennisdeling in het onderhavige team. Deze aanbevelingen luiden:
1.	Zorg voor een gezamenlijk teamdoel, zodat het voor teamleden duidelijk is waar het team voor staat en ze beter in kunnen schatten welke kennis relevant is om te delen.
2.	Faciliteer naast informele contactmomenten meer formele overlegmomenten, zodat teamleden beter op de hoogte zijn van elkaars projecten en sneller zien waar ze hun expertises samen moeten brengen om vraagstukken op te lossen.
3.	Ondersteun als afdelingsmanagement actief kennisdeling, door niet alleen verbale aanmoediging te geven, maar door ook actief mensen te verbinden en zelf het goede voorbeeld te geven.
4.	Bevorder de interpersoonlijke relaties op de HR-afdeling, zodat medewerkers kennis als gemeenschappelijk goed gaan beschouwen dat gedeeld moet worden met anderen.","['ability-motivation-opportunity model', 'kennisdeling', 'interviews', 'teams', 'zorgsector.']"
Interest Group Framing in the European Union: membership representation or institutional appeal?,Katharina Ruppert,2020-07-10,['Dr. Asya Zhelyazkova'],Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This research starts from the observation that the study of interest groups and in particular of interest group framing remain a niche within political science although it is central to understanding the functioning of advanced democracies. By strategically highlighting some aspect of a policy proposal while omitting others, interest groups frame it. This study examines the extent to which different types of interest groups and European institutions affect the frame selection by interest groups when lobbying. This case study is based on the ePrivacy regulation. The ‘two logics of interest groups’, developed by Klüver, Mahoney and Opper (2015), serve as the theoretical basis. They postulate that the organizational structure of interest groups as well as the characteristics of the EU institution that has been lobbied, influence interest group’s frame selection. Three types of interest groups, namely sectional groups, cause groups, and firms are subject to the analysis. They do not only represent different interests (private versus public interests) but they also possess different organizational structures. While scholars commonly approach the topic of framing quantitatively, this study takes a qualitative approach. It therefore overcomes underlying methodological obstacles and adds clear value to the existing literature. A dual approach of hand-coding and computer-assisted qualitative content analysis through the software MAXQDA allows to gain a detailed insight into the selected policy proposal, namely the ePrivacy regulation. This research revealed that frame choice varies systematically across the types of interest groups. Additionally, the findings also suggest that frame choice is not necessarily affected by the institutional characteristics of the European Commission and the European Parliament respectively. The narrow focus on studying economic and public frames with regards to the ePrivacy regulation provides room for further research. Extending this study to the Council, selecting another policy area or including other types of frames would allow to enrich the research findings.","['ePrivacy', 'European Union', 'framing', 'interest group', 'lobbying']"
The Theory Behind Naming and Shaming,Nanette Verburg,2020-07-10,"['Prof.dr. M. Haverland', 'Prof.dr. A.G. Dijkstra']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Naming and shaming is the principle of publicly stating and shaming human rights violations in a country in order to improve compliance with the human rights treaties these countries have ratified. The question this thesis will try to answer is what the mechanism behind this principle is. In order to find this answer, a co-variational design, more specifically a cross-sectional comparison is used. Two cases are compared to see the influence of naming and shaming and the theories that make this work. The two cases that are compared are Bolivia and Colombia in the timeframe 2015-2019. The countries are similar as they are both named and shamed, they have ratified the Bill of Rights, and they have almost signed the same economic agreements to try and create more economic cooperation. To research the mechanism behind the principle, two theories will be investigated through a congruence analysis to see which one explains the workings of naming and shaming the best. The two theories are related to political legitimacy and domestic activism. By using annual reports from human rights organizations to show the naming and shaming and by using newspaper articles to show the situation in both countries, the two theories were analyzed. Bolivia proves to have relatively low levels of legitimacy over the last five years but high levels of activism, while Colombia starts with low levels of legitimacy but improves to higher levels and proves to have low levels of activism. In both countries, human rights compliance is proven to be relatively low; in Colombia more than in Bolivia. The theories state that countries with low legitimacy and countries with much activism would be more likely to comply with human rights. This would be the explanation for the naming and shaming principle. The analysis showed that, both Bolivia and Colombia, in times of low levels of legitimacy, would adapt their behavior and comply more with human rights. It can, thus, be concluded that legitimacy influences compliance. For domestic activism, however, the countries did not show that much activism leads to more compliance. Activism was used to make the government aware of the demands of citizens, but it did not increase human rights compliance.",
The Identity of the European Union as an International Security Actor,Dyone Dedden,2020-07-10,"['Dr. M. Onderco', 'Prof.dr. A.G. Dijkstra']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This thesis looks at Security Sector Reform (SSR) missions of the European Union (EU). These missions are focused on reforming the security sector in states that are not capable of providing security to its citizens. This thesis found that there is a lack of academic literature that is linking the identity of the EU to specific SSR missions. Besides, this thesis also found that the academic literature on SSR missions lacks theoretical explanations. This thesis fills these gaps, as it is analysing the SSR missions of the EU to find out what kind of international security actor the EU is in these missions. This analysis is done by looking at three different types of powers, namely Normative Power, Realist Power and Liberal Power. The identity of the EU within the SSR missions can be revealed by looking at which kind of power the EU applies during its SSR missions. This thesis used a combination of congruence analysis and causal-process tracing to analyse documents of specific SSR missions. A coding framework that was connected to the different types of powers, was used to find out which power was dominant.

Women waging War and Peace,Britt Veldhuis,2020-07-10,"['Prof.dr. A.G. Dijkstra', 'Dr. M. Onderco']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Since the World Conference on Women of September 1995 by the United Nations, female political participation was put at the forefront of political decision-making (UN Women, 2020a). A country’s achievement in women’s political participation is typically measured by its share of women in national legislatures (UN Women, 2020b). The gender balance in politics is increasingly shifting towards more female participation. Simultaneously, numerous studies showed differences for men and women when it comes to decision-making processes, especially in regard to violent conflict. An analysis of 40 peace processes since the end of the Cold War shows that when women are exercising a strong influence on peace negotiations, the chances of successfully reaching an agreement went up. Moreover, the total number of countries involved in internationalized conflicts is exploding annually, calling for thorough investigation into conflict prevention, management and conciliation. This research therefore examined the influence of women legislators on decision-making in regard to conflict. After conducting a literature review, it was expected that an increase in the share of women in national parliaments decreases the share of military expenditure as part of GDP. Moreover, it was expected that an increase in the share of women in national parliaments decreases the number of armed conflicts a country engages in. Based on two standard multiple regression and one binary logistic regression, both hypotheses had to be rejected. Explanations for findings contrary to expectations referred mainly to the need to examine the concept studied in more nuance and to control for more interfering factors. Support for this recommendation was found in additional literature.",
The Reproduction Of Practice In Habitus And Its Implications For Social Mobility,Jim Bentem,2020-07-09,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"In this paper it is argued that Bourdieu’s theory of practice presents an overdeterministic picture of practice. Furthermore the weaknesses of habitus are systematically discussed. This is followed by a discussion on how these weaknesses overemphasize reproduction of practice. This leads to a scheme in which social mobility rarely occurs. Empirical studies are used to evaluate how accurate this scheme is. It is concluded that it is partly accurate, and that habitus is useful for explaining the problems of social mobility. Habitus can be used to frame public policies in areas such as immigration and upwards social mobility.",
"DAC donors, Chinese engagement and the effectiveness of democracy assistance",Marlyn Chantre,2020-07-08,"['Prof.dr. A.G. Dijkstra', 'Prof.dr. M. Haverland']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This research aimed at determining whether Chinese engagement has an impact on the effectiveness of DAC donors’ democracy assistance in Sub-Saharan Africa. Earlier studies have argued that Chinese development assistance undermines Western efforts in terms of good governance. Democracy assistance in this study is not considered as condition for aid, rather it is perceived as an objective of aid. Studying the effectiveness of democracy assistance is a complicated process. The establishment of a causal link between democracy activities of DAC donors and the improvement of the quality of democracies is limited by context-specific factors. Based on the examined literature, it was expected that the presence of Chinese development assistance would weaken the effectiveness of DAC democracy assistance.
	A covariational case study method was applied to study the effectiveness of democracy assistance. To be included into the case study, a country should be a recipient of DAC democracy assistance and should either have a high or low level of Chinese engagement. Based on the literature review, economic performance, aid dependence, regime type, political stability and regional spill-over effects need to be considered to reduce the influence on the effectiveness of democracy assistance. DAC democracy assistance was defined as projects and programs aimed at improving the quality of democracy in the recipient country. Chinese engagement refers to Chinese development assistance based on the 2000-2014 AidData set. The level of Chinese engagement was related to the recipients GNI over a period from 2000 to 2014. The final sample consisted of Mozambique and Zambia with high-level Chinese engagement, and Malawi and Tanzania with low-level of Chinese engagement. After the case selection, the projects and programs from top DAC donors were selected. The project and program evaluation reports of these donors were the main source of data. The effectiveness of democracy assistance was measured based on the State of Democracy (SoD) framework from IDEA. The SoD framework from IDEA is a global approach to assess the state of democracy in a country. The final adopted framework consisted of the thematic areas: citizenship, law, and rights; responsive and accountable government; and civil society and popular participation. 
	The results of this study were mixed. It could not be concluded whether democracy assistance is more effective in countries with low Chinese development assistance than in countries with high Chinese development assistance. All countries did show some form of regression in terms of the space for civil society and political freedoms. This suggest that the effectiveness of DAC donors’ democracy assistance was influenced by context-specific factors rather than Chinese engagement.",
"A Critical Philosophical Reflection of ""A System of Logic: Ratiocinative and Inductive"" by John Stuart Mill",Bart de Zeeuw,2020-07-07,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Proper, indisputable knowledge is the very root of science as we know it today. Therefore, John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) has formalized the scientific method to acquire this type of knowledge, in his book System of Logic. Particularly, he maintains that inductive logic is the only true basis of knowledge. This paper will elaborate on the most principal features of Mill’s System of Logic. Subsequently, a skeptical stance towards Mill’s views will be put forward. This will consists of a summary and
elaboration of the Mill-Whewell debate. Besides, Hume’s view on inductive logic will be presented. Consequently, I will conclude that Mill missed a chance to really address Hume’s problem, which entails the question whether one can infer a general law from single, observable instance.",
"The liaison between European contemporary art institutions and
superstar commercial galleries: a network analysis","Manfrin, M.
     and 
    
  


Mazza, I.",2020-07-07,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The contemporary art world is characterized by a lack of objective criteria and quality
uncertainty: different stakeholders cooperate and are mutually committed in the determination of
art as such. Contemporary art institutions and commercial galleries involved in the primary art
market are among its main contributors. Both exhibit and promote contemporary artists, but they
differ essentially in their purpose. Institutions in fact are driven by a cultural aim whereas gallerists
by a monetary one. This feature represents one of the cornerstones of the present art system. In fact,
the independence of institutions’ curatorial decisions appears to be crucial in the achievement of
their mission and in their cultural role in the contemporary art world. However, this type of
institution is characterized by cost disease and limited funds. Superstar commercial gallerists are
then able and interested in backing exhibitions in order to increase their artists’ visibility and,
consequently, their market value. This phenomenon represents a clear threat to the well-being of the
contemporary art world.
The present thesis in fact aims to detect a liaison between a small circle of superstar
commercial galleries and contemporary art institutions in Europe. In order to do so, a quantitative
method, defined as network analysis, is the most suitable in detecting ties between these two
stakeholders. The dataset was set up by including living artists, and their respective intermediaries,
that had major solo shows at a sample of 20 prominent European contemporary art institutions in
the last decade.
The results gave empirical evidence of a tendency for these institutions in exhibiting artists
represented by few superstar commercial galleries. These findings then trigger different
interpretations: superstar gallerists can be seen as reliable and informed quality certifiers in the
contemporary art system, undermining their institutional counterparts. Moreover, an economic, and
more concerning, explanation regards the formal irruption of the market sphere on the institutional
one. Superstar commercial gallerists, thanks to their outstanding turnovers, can represent a serious
menace to the cultural authority of institutions involved in the contemporary art world.
Undoubtedly, these two stakeholders are reciprocal in their essence but it is important to remark
how they have to be necessarily independent of each other.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'commercial gallery', 'contemporary art', 'network analysis', 'superstardom', 'art', 'institution.']"
"Classical music and audience development - 
Exploring the viability of mobile apps in live classical
music concerts to attract and engage young audiences","Merino Ruiz ,  B.",2020-07-07,['Brouwer F.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","One of the discourses about the world of classical music explains how it is
immersed in an audience crisis. During the last decade, the audiences have aged, classical
music performances appear to encounter lower participation, and traditional values of
classical music seem to be detached from the way of living in society nowadays.
However, trends are emerging to break down the barriers between high-arts and low-arts
and attract new audiences to live classical music concerts, aiming to make classical music
accessible to everybody. This research delves into new practices and audience
development practices focused on attracting and engaging with young audiences.
Therefore, it reflects on how symphony orchestras and ensembles are including
innovative practices, and how mobile apps is one of the tools starting to be included
during the classical music concert despite the unacceptance of mobile phones in the
concert hall. Thus, we consider the research question to what extent could the use of apps
during the classical music concert could be a tool for audience development for young
people between 18 and 34 years old?
Firstly, the research aims to gather perspectives about the use of mobile apps in the
classical music concert among young people with different frequencies of attendance to live
classical music concerts. Motivations and barriers for attendance to live classical music
concerts are also explored. The quantitative results show some problems and possibilities that
mobile apps might present in live classical music concerts, being them a good introductory
experience for new audiences yet regarded inappropriate to use. Secondly, interviews with
management staff members and musicians from some symphony orchestras and ensembles aim
to explore further the possibilities of mobile apps. Other successful alternatives to attract young
people to classical music concerts are presented. It can be concluded that mobile apps that give
information about the music are a tool that can be used in more informal settings of live
classical music concerts, but there are better alternatives to attract and engage young audiences
with classical music.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'mobile apps', 'concert attendance', 'young audiences', 'audience development', 'classical', 'music', 'innovation.']"
"BENEFITS, ADVANTAGES, AND USEFULNESS OF MUSEUM NETWORKS
The case of Fondazione Musei Senesi in Tuscany","Benassi, A.",2020-07-07,['Navarrete Hernandez T.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis presents a case of network analysis applied to the cultural sector. In particular, it
investigates a network of 45 museums in the Lands of Siena, unified in 2003 under Fondazione Musei
Senesi. The aim of this research is to investigate to what extent is it useful for museums to be part of
a network, assuming a threefold perspective according to the main points of view on the subject: that
of the Foundation itself, as the “head” of the network, the museums within the system, and the visitors.
Results have revealed that, as expected, networking in the museum sector has a massive potential.
However, the case of Fondazione Musei Senesi has also pointed out the complexities of networking
and the limitation to properly exploit this potential. Nonetheless, data has also shown that, by taking
into account different stakeholders’ perspectives together, some useful insights on the benefits of
networking can still be reached. This because each specific point of view allows a different
perspective on the subject and, when compared, they can provide an extensive overview of the
usefulness of networking for all the stakeholders of the network itself.
The evidence obtained from interviews and surveys lead me to conclude that, although the difficulties,
it is still useful for Sienese museums to be part of the network. In the end indeed, the social and
cultural mission of these museums is more easily pursuable by joining together rather than by acting
individually and this is emphasized by social media followers and museums’ visitors, especially in
critical situations such as the spread of Covid-19.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'socio-economic networks', 'network organization', 'networking strategies', 'museums', 'multi-perspective analysis.']"

festival organisations and the awarded film directors show a gender gap, which is
persistent in both Europe and North America. The film festivals which have been
established earlier, seem to have more female directors and executives. Film festivals
with more female employees also have more female directors and executives. All in
all, this research did not find a causal relationship between the gender of film festival
management teams and the gender of the awarded film festivals. Nonetheless, it did
find that certain aspects of the geographical location, and the longitude of existence
of a film festival affects the female representation within the director and executives’
positions and amongst the film festival team members in general. It is important that
film festivals implement gender equality in their organisations because they have the
power to influence the success of awarded film directors and influence society’s

"THE ECONOMIC AND CREATIVE IMPACTS OF

Does Spotify’s attractiveness stifle or challenge the artists creativity,
in an era of musical overabundance and competition characterized by a
lack of economical transparency?","Carnoy, F.",2020-07-07,['Abbing H.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Music has enormously changed in recent times. Compared to a hundred years ago,
nothing is done in the same way. The recording techniques, the production, the distribution and
the listening have continuously developed, and sometimes dramatically changed, from decade
to decade until now. Naturally, these several shifts could and should be analyzed from multiple
perspectives. In this thesis I will examine the relation between the economical and the creative
evolution of the music industry with the advent of streaming services, more specifically with
the arrival of Spotify. Many observers1 have pointed out that the economics of music streaming
lacks transparency. It is often criticized for its low artists compensation and for its distorting
influence on the music market. In contrast, the democratic access to a huge catalog of music
history combined with tailored suggestions of discoveries appears to be an exceptional
incentive for artistic creativity. I will present these elements and ponder over their ambiguous
coexistence by interviewing multiple professionals of the music industry. Two managers of the
main collecting society for the French artists and performers2 have shared with me their opinion
on the health of jazz and classical music. Also, nine artists practicing different genres of music
and belonging to different generations exposed to me their process of inspiration as it is
influenced by Spotify. The diverse results allowed me to detect and discuss several types of
responses to the inspiration process encounter when confronted with streaming services. This
will lead to partly elucidate the economical and creative impact of music streaming and suggest
further possibilities for improvement, as far as transparency (on the economic side) and
creativity (on the artistic side) are concerned.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Streaming', 'Music', 'Spotify', 'Creativity', 'Inequalities']"

the coming years? The study comprises examinations of existing theory on cultural nightlife,
liveability, successful cultural policy measures and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with
a range of different stakeholders and actors of the Rotterdam nightlife sector. The results of
the interviews were categorised in the core themes relating to nightlife (facilitation). While the
discussion on individual themes and concepts lead to quite universal ideas and visions, it
found that the issue of a city’s nightlife as a whole is complex and interwoven with almost all
other facets of organising city life. Some possible focus points for nightlife policy were
identified as a result of the interviews, but to truly facilitate a safe, varied and flourishing
nightlife, long-term vision, intense collaboration, customization and multi-disciplinary
approaches within and between the municipality and external bodies are necessary.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'cultural nightlife', 'cultural policy', 'Rotterdam', 'liveability', 'nightlife facilitation', 'nightlife regulation.']"

Handke, c.",2020-07-06,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The aim of this thesis is to explore whether artists benefit in terms of attention from having
their music featured in commercials. The research follows a quasi-experimental research
design and the main method of analysis takes the form of a short-interrupted time series.
The data for the advertisements is collected from two main sources: (1) all Super Bowl 2020
TV commercials which contained a commercially available song; and (2) All TV commercials
from brands that appeared on the Forbes Most Valuable Brands of 2019 list, which also
contained a commercially available song. The data for attention towards an artist is
measured as daily evolution of Spotify monthly listeners obtained from the music marketing
analytics tool Soundcharts. In order to assess whether the advertisement affected the
attention the time series was divided into a pre and post period with release date of the
advertisement serving as the interruptive element. The research design consisted of two
complementary statistical methods: (1) an OLS regression based on the differences times
series and (2) an OLS regression analysis based on the analysis of the residuals. This study
has found that that in general featuring music in a commercial that is related to a Most
Valuable Brand, classified as ‘regular’, has a more positive outcome on the attention towards
an artist, than featuring music in a mass advertising event such as the Super Bowl. It was
also shown that with regards to popularity, less popular artists benefit more in terms of
attention if the advertisement is released in an independent way and more popular artist
profit from mass promoted events. The findings enhance our knowledge of the relationship
between advertising and music, and the study has thrown up many questions in need of
further investigation. The insights provided may be useful for both artists and advertisers, not
only from the creative point of view but also the more economic and business side.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Music', 'Advertising', 'Attention', 'Popularity', 'Superstars', 'Informational Cascades']"

Major Record Labels’ Strategic Positioning in the Digital Popular Music Market,"Aprikian, A.",2020-07-06,['Dekker E.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The Internet has revolutionized the tradition market structure of the music industry,
moving from a total vertical integration of activities under major record labels’ control
to a rise of independent labels and a segmentation of supply chain’s activities. It has
thus led to debates about the importance of major labels in guaranteeing artists success
in the digital era. This research aims to understand whether the use of the Internet has
lessen majors’ market power to the extent that DIY practices taken over by independent
labels can compete with majors’ production, promotion and distribution strategies. It
focuses on the French popular music market after the Internet revolution and and it
is based on tracks’ performances in Spotify’s Top-200 charts between the beginning of
2017 until the end of 2018. Short-term success is measured by the discounted amount
of streams of each tracks present in the database, and long-term success is indicated
by their survival probability on charts. An OLS regression has enabled to underline
majors’ outperformance for album tracks on the short run while an AFT model has
revealed longer survival time of signed tracks in top-charts. Thanks to a distinction
between several organizational deals allocating supply chain’s activities to different types
of labels, this research shows that major record labels hold a competitive advantage in the
promotion field while independent labels are fierce rivals in production and distribution
operationalization. Thus, majors are expected to attract aspiring artists with new acts
guaranteeing outstanding marketing plans which will ensure them higher instant fame
and better career management over the long run. In the digital era, online strategies are
crucial to compete with new players on the market, however their use is not sufficient to
build a sustainable artistic career in the French popular music industry. Major record
labels can thus still assert their market domination if a re-positioning towards unmatched
promotion strategies is appropriately undertaken for promising artists.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Technological change', 'Major records labels', 'Market segmentation', 'Short-term buzz', 'Career longevity']"

principles. This study is focussed on the transition towards CE in a specific area: the textile and
clothing (T&C) sector, with a primary focus on The Netherlands. The study can be used as an
exploratory and exemplary study for the global T&C industry. With an eye on the challenges the
T&C industry is facing, the overarching research questions are:
How is the transition towards CE implemented, in the case of the T&C industry in NL?
Who are the stakeholders involved in the transition process towards CE, why are they involved and what
for?
The research will address the following sub topics; how will different stakeholders in the
Multi-Level-Perspective define the role of policy in the transition, what kind of stakeholders are
involved and what is their role, what is the level of transition in CE of the T&C industry in NL
currently according to stakeholders from the MLP, what kind of CE innovations are identified by
stakeholders in the MLP and what is the role of these innovations to CE in the T&C industry in
NL.
In order to answer the questions, the research is conceptualized with the transition theory
and Multi-Level-Perspective (MLP) with macro (sociotechnical landscape), meso (sociotechnical
regimes) and micro (niche-innovations) levels. Besides the use of the MLP, CE transition indicators
are used in this research to adequately substantiate the theoretical ground of the study. A
triangulation approach with multiple sources of empirical and secondary data collection are
applied for this study. The study consists of in-depth semi-structured interviews (n=9),
participant observations (n=1) and a document analysis (n=16). For the analysis of the empirical
data the Value Mapping Tool (VMT) has been used.
The transition towards CE in the T&C industry in NL is taking place on a lower- and
higher level transition. In the MLP, key stakeholders, the purpose and valuation differs
substantially. The socio-technical landscape and the sociotechnical regime interact on policy level and
coordination of the CE innovation landscape via intermediaries and intermediary organisations.
Multi-stakeholder collaboration is therefore crucial in the transition towards CE. Including not
only technical but also cultural innovations because they prove the value of culture in the
transition towards CE in the T&C industry in NL.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'circular economy', 'transition', 'fashion', 'multi-stakeholder collaborations', 'intermediaries', 'governance']"

two work for a festival and one works for bot a festival and a nightclub. Purposive and snowball
sampling were deployed to tap into an insightful set of data that was gained from insiders of the
Dutch electronic dance scene. The research shows that the main impact of festivalization for
nightclubs is the emergence of fierce competition over audiences and artists, both during and
outside of the festival season. Nightclubs tend to tackle these implications by enhancing the overall
experience of the club; by creative programming, and by utilizing their relationships with audiences,
artists and other stakeholders within the industry such as other nightclubs, festivals and booking

empirical evidence are compared and combined. First, the concepts of adaptive reuse,
sustainability and circular economy are reviewed, from which it can be concluded that their
intrinsic correlation justifies the development of the cultural toolkit. Additionally, a conceptual
model, which classifies the adaptive reuses under the four pillars of sustainability, is developed.
Following, a multi-criteria evaluation of past projects of adaptive reuse is presented, in order to
gather empirical evidence. The application of the toolkit takes place for a specific case study
and leads to the appropriate suggestions of sustainable adaptive reuse. The overall result of this
thesis is a comprehensive and objective toolkit which leads decision-makers into autonomous,
well-founded, efficient and effective conservation interventions.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Built Heritage', 'Sustainability', 'Adaptive Reuse', 'Decision-Makers', 'Cultural', 'Toolkit']"

retail business, but the rise of the experience economy, as well as the creative industry, has
offered new opportunities to creative entrepreneurs (Warde, 2015, 2017; Pine and Gilmore,

the online shopping trend despite the market uncertainty. The gap in academic research on
concept store business practices is yet to be filled. Therefore, this thesis is dedicated to
understanding the concept store as a cultural entrepreneurial practice by finding out how
entrepreneurial preferences and values affect the lifecycle of concept stores. With a group of
crucial literature on consumption changes and cultural entrepreneurship as the research
foundation, a qualitative empirical study, which consists of 10 interviews with concept store

Carvalho Marques, L.",2020-07-06,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis aims at analyzing the role of stakeholders in regional economic development
through the movie industry, in particular how stakeholders interact to foster regional economic
development. The movie industry is a creative industry able to have a positive impact at the
regional level, both in terms of direct and indirect economic effects. The specific case of Rocco
Schiavone in Aosta Valley was used to analyze stakeholders' dynamics and experiences, but also to
investigate whether the movie industry has had positive or negative effects in the region.
By interviewing 14 stakeholders involved in different tasks within both the movie
production and regional economic development, it emerged the awareness and the esteem regarding
external movie production that films in the region. It emerged that regional economic development
through the movie industry is the product of the mobilization of external stakeholders and resources
in given regions; and that within the movie industry panorama, the cultural and artistic objectives
have the priority over economic incentives. So, the movie production of Rocco Schiavone decided
to film in Aosta Valley because of artistic reasons, and not because of the monetary incentives
provided by institutional local stakeholders. It emerged also a collaborative relationship among
stakeholders led by the common interests in achieving similar objectives, or collateral objectives.
In fact, by achieving the objective of the movie production, then all the objectives can be
achieved consequently. For what concerns economic effects on the territory, the production of
Rocco Schiavone has had a positive economic effect in Aosta Valley Region because it developed
the movie industry at the regional level by creating new professional workers of the movie sector,
by generating positive economic returns, and by creating a rising phenomenon of film-induced
tourism. This thesis, so, could show the importance of collaboration among stakeholders to achieve
common goals and the actual positive effect that the movie industry can have on regional economic
development.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Movie industry', 'regional economic development', ""stakeholders' management"", 'Aosta', 'Valley region', 'Rocco Schiavone']"
The impact of Spotify features on music discovery in the streaming platform age,"Stanisljevic , D.",2020-07-06,['Handke C.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Music discovery and music consumption, in general, have changed significantly in the age
of digitization. Physical record stores were replaced by online music streaming platforms.
This evolution changed the music industry for both consumers and artists. The music industry shifted to a subscription-based business model, offering access to immense music libraries for a monthly fee. Spotify, as the biggest music streaming service, has had a large
role in this shift. The music streaming giant incorporated techniques to guide users through
their enormous music catalog by offering music recommendations. Research suggests that
Spotify has caused an increase in quantity and diversity of music consumption. This thesis
studies the role of the different Spotify music discovery features on the perceived impact of
Spotify on music discovery among students. This research applies a cross-sectional research
design with an online questionnaire that was filled out by 152 respondents. Students that
actively use Spotify to consume music were sampled from the population. The data was analyzed by applying the statistical analyses; Pearson’s correlations, One sample T-test, and
multivariate OLS-regression analyses. Two separate models were tested in the regression
analyses measuring the relationship between the different Spotify music discovery features
and the dependent variables measuring the perceived impact of Spotify on music discovery,
and Spotify perceived as the most useful music discovery tool. The results of model 1 indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between the Spotify music discovery
features discover weekly, and recommendations based on previous listening behavior and
the dependent variable PSEMD. While the results of model 2 indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between the music discovery features discover weekly, recommendations based on previous listening behavior, popular playlists and the search bar, and
the dependent variable PMUMDT. These results suggest that these Spotify music discovery
features effect the perceived impact of Spotify on music discovery among students. With the
music discovery feature, recommendations based on previous listening behavior having the
strongest effect on the perceived impact of Spotify on music discovery.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Music discovery', 'Spotify features', 'recommendation system', 'music consumption', 'music variety']"

symbiosis of the cultural sector. Topics such as quality uncertainty, quality assessment and stakeholder
management are addressed with special focus on the policy mandates from the policy report of 2021-
2024. These mandates include “the fair practice code” and “inclusion and diversity”. We found that the
mission statement of organisations plays a central role in their operationalisation. We also found that the
dominant strategy of programming is partnering up in order to share costs and risks, exchange ideas and
making a bigger impact through reaching a broader audience. This study is a good steppingstone for
future research in the field of artistic programming, a topic that has hardly been covered in academics.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Quality uncertainty', 'quality assessment', 'stakeholder management', 'subsidies', 'audiences', 'gatekeepers', 'artistic values', 'economic values', 'social values', 'goals', 'mission statements', 'classical music', 'organisations', 'non-profit organisations', 'policies', 'policy mandates', 'fair practice code', 'inclusion and', 'diversity', 'access', 'equity', 'customer confidence', 'innovation', 'collaboration', 'partners.']"
The impact of Instagram on pre-digital visual artists,"Agostini, G.",2020-07-06,['Abbing H.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","There was a time when art only adorned the walls of palaces, buildings and public spaces. A time
when people would pay to gaze upon real sculptures, drawings and paintings. However, the advent of
social media brought about a seismic shift in how people discover, experience, share content, news
and art. This new form of media allows people from all over the world to be connected and form
relationships for personal or business needs. In this sense, the art world has been revolutionized.
This study focuses on some of the protagonists of this new world namely traditional visual artists
who are experiencing this transition. It aims to capture the approach of some of the visual artists to
burgeoning online environment, focusing on artists who were part of the “pre-digital generation”.
These artists have a wealth of experience of the traditional channels but they are now having to work
within an increasingly digital world. The study also explores the way in which visual artists are
becoming more commercial. Nowadays artists need to consider not only their work but their brand
image, use marketing tools and at all times they cannot be seen to be diminishing the integrity of their
art. It also investigates how traditional visual artists have adapted to a new hyper-connected world,
with all its associated demands. Instagram, the most popular social network in the art world, has
completely changed the methods of promoting, producing and interacting with artworks. As a result,
traditional artists have experienced radical changes in their working lives and methods. Therefore,
this research seeks to explore how these changes have affected pre-digital visual artists’ core values. It
also attempts to shed light on the infuence of Instagram upon the art world – both economically and
culturally - and the changing relationship between artists and their digital audiences.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Instagram', 'pre-digital traditional visual artists', 'values', 'commercialism', 'self-branding', 'authenticity.']"
"How do female DJs negotiate their place in
the male-dominated environment of E/DM?","Geille, L.",2020-07-06,['Abbing H.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis investigates the gender gap in the E/DM (Electronic Dance Music) industry,
which is still male-dominated. More particularly, it investigates the individual and collective
experiences of female DJs in France. The aim is thus to understand how these women have
managed to become DJs, and how they have managed to create some space for themselves,
both individually and collectively. This research is based on theories about gender-related
issues women can face in the E/DM industry, as well as on theories about female
communities, their advantages and their challenges.
In order to explore this topic, the research method that has been used is qualitative research.
It draws on twelve semi-constructed interviews with female DJs and/or active members of
female and queer communities. During those interviews, these women shared their personal
experiences as well as their opinions about some aspects of the scene.
This thesis shows that nowadays, in France, female DJs face way less barriers than the
previous generation. They still face some gender prejudices – especially at the beginning of
their career – that become less and less present as they gain recognition and legitimacy.
Being part of the gender minority can also prove to be an advantage sometimes, as they face
less competition, and benefit from increasing awareness about the need for more parity in
line-ups. There is also an increasing number of female/queer collective initiatives that help
those women getting empowered and self-confident, getting more recognition while
progressing within the safe-place of those communities.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Electronic music', 'Gender', 'Community', 'Feminism', 'DJ']"

The study is conducted in two phases which enables to create multiple frameworks for the categorization and analysis of knowledge production and knowledge circulation. Members of the SlutWalk movement are highly involved in knowledge production on themes that are strongly related to the dimensions of sexual violence. The SlutWalk movement produces alternative forms of knowledge, where experience knowledge and interpersonal knowledge are dominant forms of knowledge. These types of knowledge produces evidence through narratives and testimonies, creating experimental facts that are able to adapt to the multidimensionality of sexual violence and the contemporary struggles the issue is situated in. The circulation of knowledge is maped out based on the transferability of knowledge and the mobility. The transferability of knowledge is influenced by the form of knowledge and the sources providing knowledge. These aspects provide an explanation as in why certain types of knowledge does not circulate within certain publics and why there’s a need to march with the SlutWalk.","['knowledge production', 'alternative forms of knowledge', 'knowledge circulation', 'dominant knowledge', 'experimental facts']"

The younger generations are deemed to have a more positive stance towards the European Union than the older age cohorts. Nevertheless, earlier studies have found that youth in Eastern Europe tends to be more Eurosceptic than their peers in Western Europe. This thesis focuses on Croatian young adults in Croatia and the Netherlands as the question arises if young adults who left their home country in search for better living standards, think differently about European integration than their fellow Croatians in Croatia. Through a parallel mediator model, using self-obtained data, various mediators are being tested in relation to the differences in Euroscepticism among the two groups. Besides general explanations for Euroscepticism such as political trust, knowledge and social-economic position, a specific focus is being put on nationalism due to Croatia’s complex history. The findings indicate that overall, there is limited difference between living in Croatia or the Netherlands on Euroscepticism. However, it can be stated that Croatian young adults in Croatia are slightly more Eurosceptic than their peers in the Netherlands. I found that, as expected, especially nationalism can explain the effect of living in Croatia or the Netherlands on Euroscepticism more for the Croatian young adults in Croatia than in the Netherlands. Hence, the findings of this research contribute to broadening the theory on the phenomenon Euroscepticism by shedding a light on the importance of nationalism among Croatian young adults.","['Euroscepticism', 'nationalism', 'young adults', 'Croatia', 'the Netherlands']"
Politics of Internet Memes: How Dutch University Students Give Meaning to Political Internet Memes,"Forotan, Y.",2020-07-05,"['Gijs Custers', 'Godfried Engbersen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This study looks at the meaning Dutch university students give to political internet memes and how this meaning relates to their political attitudes and behavior. In order to provide a better understanding of the meaning these Dutch students give to political internet memes, this research deviated from the quantitative nature of similar studies and did online focus groups instead. The online focus groups enabled participants from various locations in the Netherlands to interact with one another simultaneously. The results show the participants have clear political standpoints and are not reliant on internet memes as a way of influencing their political attitudes and behaviour. Internet memes function as a way of relatability, which is a perquisite of an internet meme to be funny. Furthermore, internet memes serve as a way of social validation in which memes that university students agree with reinforces their beliefs. However, a meme that university students disagree with can cause frustration and even polarization. An aspect that is not was mentioned in previous literature is the role of serendipity. Serendipity is the chance for someone to encounter something that they did not expect. Also, the temporality of an internet meme matters whether university students consider this internet meme funny or not. An internet meme would be shown at its best shortly after it was created and can get quickly outdated. Lastly, recommendations have been made for future research.","['internet memes', 'political attitudes', 'serendipity', 'social validation', 'temporality']"

Taking willingness-to-pay as proxy for preferences, cost-benefit analysis relies on the view that wellbeing is the satisfaction of preferences. Hausman and McPherson argue that this view must be rejected. This essay explores Hausman and McPherson’s argument that, although preference satisfaction theory is mistaken, reliance on preferences in cost-benefit analysis can be justified by an evidential connection between preferences and well-being. This piece also considers a critical reaction from Alexander Sarch, who argues that the evidential connection is not yet enough to justify the reliance on preferences.",

Sustained effects in development projects,Julia Kooijman,2020-07-03,"['Prof.dr. A.G. Dijkstra', 'Prof.dr. M. Haverland']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Many development projects aim to make a difference and have an impact on the life of local citizens. Researchers and aid donors generally recognize the need for development projects to aim for sustained benefits of their project interventions. This is particularly important for agricultural projects. In many developing countries in Africa, the agricultural sector employs a large number of the population. Moreover, increasement of agricultural production can lead to food security in that country and more exports, which can generate incomes for local farmers. With aid donors laying more focus on sustaining project benefits, one would think that they will fulfil the criteria of sustainability when executing and completing their work. Literature has been written about criteria project developers should take into account when designing and executing projects, however not much attention has been brought to what extend project developers do take the criteria for sustainability in mind when designing, implementing and finishing their projects and which factors are necessary for sustained benefits. Therefore, this research answered the following research question: ‘To what extent are the criteria for project sustainability derived from literature important for the expected sustainability of agricultural development projects?’. This is done by conducting a case study and assessing ten agricultural development projects by use of a conceptual framework, which included twelve factors that are important for sustained benefits of agricultural projects.
The results indicate that agricultural development projects can be expected to have sustained benefits if they include factors of the conceptual framework in the projects that are found to be necessary. Those factors are: capacity of local stakeholder; existing policies and policy support; M&E during project implementation; and no harm to environment. Other factors from the conceptual framework can contribute to sustained benefits but are not necessary. For project developers one could see trade-offs between factors were made: none of the projects did involve all factors from the conceptual framework. One finding of this study was that, even though there is much emphasis in both literature as well as in the projects themselves on capacity building, some projects still failed to achieve the desired level of capacity of local stakeholders by the end of the project. Therefore, a recommendation for future research is to research why this is, so project developers and executors can overcome this capacity problem in future projects. This can help to increase the number of agricultural development projects with sustained benefits. Based on the finding of this study future research could also asses why few projects continue monitoring and evaluation activities after project activities stopped, and what the impact is of not continuing those activities on the sustained benefits of those projects.",

The future is in the (h)air. A qualitative study examining the decision-making process of hair salon owners to adopt digital communication technologies for their hair salon.,Nikki Batenburg,2020-06-30,['Drs. Matthijs Leendertse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The rise of new technologies and a shift towards digitization has led to a technological retail revolution which stimulated the increase of media technologies available for retail experiences. As a consequence, digital communication technologies such as social media platforms, tablets, mobile phones, window screens, websites, and webshops have become more important than ever before and are increasingly adopted by hair salon owners for internal and external purposes. Earlier academic research has identified four main drivers that hair salon owners and managers consider during the decision-making process of adopting a digital communication technology. Two of these identified drivers, being the Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use of a technology, derive from the Technology Acceptance Model, a model that explains a user’s technology acceptance process. Further, the potential business (dis)advantages and threats that are considered by hair salon owners are linked to the driver business considerations. Likewise, the last driver, being creative considerations, is also recognized as an important driver within the adoption process of a digital communication technology. This current research aims to examine how hair salon owners decide to adopt a digital communication technology for their hair salons. By conducting a qualitative research based on nine semi-structured expert interviews, this research paper aims to investigate how hair salon owners decide to adopt digital communication technologies for hair salons. Results have shown that three out of four drivers are recognized to be important factors during the decision-making process, whereas there is one driver that is unconsciously considered by the hair salon owners. Further, hair salon owners affirmed that offering an omnichannel shopping experience by utilizing digital communication technologies has lead to various financial business benefits, such as a bigger reach and an increase in product sales. With this, the majority of hair salon owners acknowledged the importance of creativity within the hair salon, thereby arguing that service-oriented creativity and organization-oriented creativity are regarded as equally important as they complement each other. Remarkably, findings have shown that seven out of nine participants perceived the technology as easy to use before adoption, but this positive perceived ease of use changed after adoption for four participants as they stated that the technology was in reality rather hard to use. In conclusion, the findings derived from the interviews show that the four drivers specified in earlier research are also considered to be important factors to consider during the decision-making process of adopting a technology. The four drivers are thereby also recognized as factors to measure whether the adopted technology can be considered as successful and valuable for the salon.","['digital media use', 'Technology Acceptance Model', 'expert interviews', 'decision-making process', 'hair industry']"

"Going green together:
Environmental CSR communication in relation to climate change and its effect on
consumer social responsibility","Christis, Julia",2020-06-29,['Wang Y.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","More than ever, corporations play a crucial and unavoidable role in tackling climate change
through for example shifting consumer perceptions towards climate friendly consumption
patterns. Nevertheless, campaigns that incite consumers to make green choices and
affiliate themselves with an environmentally conscious brand or product are scarce. This is
partially due to the fact that little research has examined what techniques in environmental
CSR messages effectively move consumers to purchase, affiliate with or trust an ecofriendly product or company. Along with this gap in literature, the array of consumer
attitudes and behavior beyond purchase intention that environmental CSR communication
can affect needs to be extended. This study’s aim was to shed more light on how, in
relation to the current climate discussion, companies advertising their green products can
incite consumers to make more eco-friendly purchase choices and gain their trust and
advocacy with the help of environmental CSR messages. Through a quantitative online
experiment with ten conditions (N = 304), the following research question was examined:
To what extent do advertisement (neutral vs. climate responsibility vs. sustainable use of
natural resources), message style (discreet vs. uniform vs. over-communicating) and praise
tactics (consumer praise vs. company praise) in environmental CSR messages affect
consumer trust, purchase intention and consumer advocacy?
In line with previous research findings, the results showed that in order to make
consumers purchase a green product and trust and advocate for a company, it is best to
use a uniform, congruent message style, whereas greenwashing techniques were the least
effective. Contrary to this study’s expectations, employing rhetorical praise tactics and
addressing specific environmental CSR actions to advertise a product did not evoke
significantly higher levels of consumer trust, advocacy and purchase intention. Moreover,
consumers’ level of perceived intrinsic and extrinsic company motivation for engaging in
CSR actions moderates the relationship between CSR messages and consumer attitudes
and behaviors, as well as level of consumers’ environmental engagement and
environmental advocacy. These findings add to previous research on environmental CSR
communication by narrowing down the circumstances under which environmental CSR
messages are effective, helping companies to affiliate consumers with their goals towards
ecological sustainability in the long term. Additionally, the results call for a re-examination
of using greenwashing techniques, as well as highlight the importance of action-message
congruency, transparency and intrinsic or extrinsic motivation as central building blocks for
a truly effective environmental CSR message.","['media', 'business', 'environmental CSR communication', 'purchase intention', 'consumer trust', 'consumer advocacy', 'perceived CSR motivations', 'ecological sustainability', 'company', 'praising', 'consumer praising']"
"Racial Diversity in TV commercials: The Consumer Perspective
A comparison of Perceptions","Bou Moughalabie, Karen",2020-06-29,['Kneer J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Minorities around the world have been voicing their concerns towards the lack of proper
representation within the media for decades now. From black communities being
stereotypically portrayed as the tireless athletes, to Asian individuals presented as the typical
intellectuals, there has been a worldwide uproar against these clichéd ideologies, especially at
a time when social media platforms have entered every home. Historically, minorities have
been faced with either racist representations of the such, or no representation at all. It is
arguable that society has come a long way when it comes to this issue within the media, and
advertisements more specifically. Due to this increased interest in the diversification of
media, researchers have been exponentially studying the impact of racist advertisements on
the brand perceptions of minorities for years, as it is proven that advertisements have a big
impact on the consumer's point of view of the brand in question. However, this study aims at
comparing the effects of the different uses of diversity within advertisements on Caucasian
individuals and People of Color alike, in order to better understand how race within
advertisements can impact all segments of society differently and to highlight the power that
Caucasian individuals can have if they were to speak out towards the effects of inclusivity on
their brand perceptions. It aims at showing the reader that no matter who he is, he can push
for accurate inclusivity within advertisements, thus bringing awareness to the still existing
race problems all over the world in order to hopefully create more inclusive and appropriate
commercials. Additionally, this thesis also incorporates several theories, including that of
Social Identity and the Affect Transfer Theory in order to better understand why and how
these opinions are formed. Effectively, the research showed that there seems to be no
difference in the perception of Caucasians and People of Color when it comes to their
perception of the different types of inclusivity in advertisements, meaning that Caucasian
individuals tend to generally have favorable opinions towards inclusive brands while
maintaining negative emotions towards brands that feature racist commercials. The main
differences, however, stem from how the two groups of individuals' Social Identity plays a
role in their assessment of the brands. By examining how the level of the participants' Social
Identity within their groups reflects on their set opinions, this thesis is able to better
understand how one's belonging to their group can alter how they perceive certain
phenomena, especially those pertaining to race.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Inclusivity', 'Advertisements', 'Marketing', 'Social Identity Theory', 'Affect', 'Transfer Theory', 'Brand Associations.']"
"TV Tinder
Exploring how the use of a video match-maker system can potentially improve co-viewing
experiences of online public television","Broeders, Jessica",2020-06-29,['Timmermans E.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research investigated to what extent our mock-up version of a group recommender system –
that was created for the purpose of this study – positively contributed to the co-viewing experience
of two people (a dyad), regarding public service media. Through the theory on Social Uses of TV by
Lull (1980) we have shed light on the oftentimes forgotten social context in the development of
group recommender systems, and their underlying algorithms to predict accurate viewing
suggestions. By building on this theory with empirical research in the field, we have arrived at our
hypotheses. A quantitative cross-sectional survey research was conducted to gather our data from
a sample that matches the target audience of the Dutch public broadcaster NPO. We have taken
some inspiration from experimental research in designing our methodology to ensure that the
presentation of our mock-up group recommender system (GRS) was as closely linked to reality as
possible (in our case duplicating the existing interface of the NPO online streaming platform). We
foresaw that a match or mismatch in the viewing interests of our dyads, and the indication of their
social relationship quality would influence the intention to follow up on the recommendations
produced by our GRS. However, as appeared from our results, these associations were not
significant. In this study, perceived usefulness of the endorsed videos by the GRS was measured
looking at three constructs that recur in the debate on creating recommender system algorithms,
being accuracy, novelty, and diversity of recommendations. A Hayes parallel multiple mediation
model was conducted on the mediating power of perceived usefulness on the relationship between
the perceived relevance of the GRS (captured by further use intentions) and the watching
intentions of the suggestions put forward by this GRS. The results from our mediation analysis tied
in closely with the prevailing accuracy-diversity debate as it complicates the creation of a diversityaware recommendation model serving the societal function of the public broadcaster. Only
accuracy was found to fully mediating this relationship, however, we argue in our discussion that
although the concept of diversity is harder to measure in terms of audience acceptance, it should
not be underestimated for its valuable contribution to the richness of the media landscape in the
Netherlands.","['media', 'business', 'Co-viewing', 'Group Recommender System', 'Public Broadcasting', 'Diversity', 'Video', 'Endorsement']"
"Brand image creation by anti-food waste focused social enterprises on
Instagram","Cator, Marloes",2020-06-29,['Derda I.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","As the number of active users on Instagram grew rapidly, businesses are increasingly using
the platform to create awareness for their brand and establishing online brand image. Accordingly,
the number of social enterprises advocating for a social goal increased. These organizations also
started to use Instagram to create a brand image. By advocating their social goal online, social
enterprises encourage their followers to contribute to help to achieve this goal. In this case, the focus
lays on intending to reduce food waste worldwide. This thesis researches the ways how anti-food
waste focused social enterprises build their brand image on Instagram. As Instagram grew into a
platform for organizations to identify and present their selves as a brand, brand image creation by
social enterprises on Instagram can contribute to a longer existence and higher impact on the social
enterprises’ social goal. By conducting thematic analysis on the Instagram pages of three social
enterprises, this study examines how the brands create their brand image on Instagram. Hereby,
tools and strategies for online brand image creation are considered. The findings point out that social
enterprises actively engage their followers through stimulating co-creation and by educating them.
By doing so, social enterprises aim to encourage their followers to take action and start reducing
food waste. First, the social enterprises under study largely involve their followers to co-create their
brand image, as the content of followers is often reposted and input and experiences of followers are
regularly asked for. Through this process of co-creation of content and brand image online, an online
brand community is built. The creation of online brand communities has become increasingly
popular, as the sense of belonging to the community results in loyal customers. Second, social
enterprises educate their follower base in the field of food waste. The brands inform and educate
their followers in their posts by sharing recipes, tips, and easy hacks, the social enterprises try to
involve their followers in their attempt at reducing food waste. Therewith, social enterprises are
utilizing different tools and strategies for brand image creation to encourage their followers to get
involved in reducing food waste.","['media', 'business', 'Social enterprise', 'Anti-food waste', 'Brand image', 'Instagram', 'Social media marketing']"
"Gone Girl: Exploring the associations between individual attachment styles,
rejection sensitivity and online dater’s ghosting behaviour as well as the
moderation role of gender","Chen, Zhixuan",2020-06-29,['Timmermans E.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study aims to explore how dispositional factors relate to ghosting behaviour when people use online
dating apps. Dispositional factors in the current study are specified as individual rejection sensitivity,
attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Ghosting behaviour is defined as a breakup strategy that
people use to terminate their romantic relationships by cutting off all the contact channels with their partners
and avoiding other’s attempts to reach out. Besides, ghosting is considered as a one-sided breakup strategy
conveying the breakup message to partners without making a clear declaration. In addition, the gender
difference was also examined within the association between individual rejection sensitivity and ghosting
behaviour in online dating. Gender was initially hypothesized as a moderator within such association. For
this research, a quantitative method was used to collect data. More specifically, a cross-sectional online
questionnaire was distributed through various social media platforms. This study focused on Chinese online
dating situation, hence all the participants were adults from China. In total, 326 participants filled in the
online questionnaire. After filtering out inactive online daters, 171 questionnaires including 91 males and 64
females with the average age of 26.99 were left as effective data. The outcome of this research showed that
rejection sensitivity was negatively associated with ghosting behaviours in online dating, implying that
people with higher rejection sensitivity would be less inclined to ghost their online dating partners, which
was an opposite outcome to the hypothesis. On top of that, attachment avoidance was not found to be
associated with ghosting behaviours, while the results regarding attachment anxiety were mixed. People with
higher attachment anxiety would have less ghosting intentions in their mind, however, this could not predict
their actual ghosting behaviour. Lastly, gender plays a significant role in moderating the association between
individual rejection sensitivity and ghosting behaviour, indicating there would be a difference in online
interpersonal behaviours between males and females who are rejection-sensitive. For males, those with
higher rejection sensitivity would have a significantly lower ghosting intention and be less likely to
implement ghosting as a breakup strategy. While for females, rejection sensitivity can predict higher
ghosting intention and a higher likelihood to implement ghosting behaviours but the predictive power is
modest. Theoretically, these findings can expand the understanding on how dispositional factors play a part
within online interpersonal communication. Also, they can make contributions to the development of
contemporary online dating apps. One example is that based on these findings, current online dating apps are
able to improve their designs so that users can dissolve their online relationships in more compassionate
ways. Further, this study also brings some initiatives to the research about online dating behaviours,
particularly ghosting. Simultaneously, it is suggested for future researchers to take the cultural factors into
consideration since this is one of the main reasons causing the inconsistency of current results with previous
literature. Given that Chinese people are found to be more sensitive to others’ rejection compared to
American and European people (Lou, & Li , 2017), further research may explore how online dating
behaviours differ within eastern and western cultural contexts","['media', 'creative industries', 'Online dating', 'Ghosting', 'Rejection Sensitivity', 'Adult Attachment Styles', 'Gender Difference']"
"Constructieve journalistiek in het klimaatdebat
Een onderzoek naar nieuwe routines toegepast op
klimaatverandering in Nederlandse kranten","Claessens, Tom",2020-06-29,['Ruigrok N.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In deze thesis werd onderzocht in welke mate constructieve journalistiek een rol speelde in
het Nederlandse klimaatdebat tussen 2015 en 2020. Constructieve journalistiek is een relatief
nieuwe stroming in de media die probeert te breken met genormaliseerde routines in de
journalistiek die leiden tot een negativiteitsbias in nieuws. Zodoende proberen journalisten
die deze zienswijze hanteren de positie van de burger in een democratie te versterken en het
maatschappelijk debat op een positieve manier te stimuleren. Deze thesis probeert daarmee
een bijdrage te leveren aan de kennis over de mogelijkheden tot publieke opinievorming in
het Nederlandse klimaatdebat. Centraal in dit onderzoek stond de onderzoeksvraag: “In
welke mate wordt door Nederlandse media constructieve journalistiek toegepast in de
verslaggeving van het klimaatdebat?”
Voor het beantwoorden van de onderzoeksvraag is een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse
over 515 krantenartikelen uit populaire en kwaliteitskranten uitgevoerd, waarbij een nieuw
analyseframework is opgebouwd op basis van de gedrags- en communicatiewetenschappelijke
literatuur over de uitvoering van constructieve journalistiek. Dit framework vergeleek de
aanwezigheid van constructieve en klassiek negatieve elementen als nieuwsselectie,
brongebruik en framing en combineerde deze elementen vervolgens tot een samengestelde
variabele die de mate van constructiviteit in verschillende sets artikelen mat. Op basis hiervan
konden vergelijkingen gemaakt worden tussen de mate waarin constructiviteit voorkwam in
populaire en kwaliteitskranten en welke aspecten van de klimaatdiscussie wel of niet in een
constructieve vorm beschreven werden. Voor dit laatste werd een topic model uitgevoerd dat
de verschillende subthema’s in het Nederlandse klimaatdebat identificeerde.
Als belangrijkste uitkomst laat dit onderzoek zien dat constructieve journalistiek wel
degelijk aanwezig was in het Nederlandse klimaatdebat, maar in frequentie van voorkomen
duidelijk ondergeschikt was aan klassieke negatieve journalistiek. Ook werd vastgesteld dat
zogeheten kwaliteitskranten meer dan populaire kranten constructieve journalistiek bedreven
binnen het klimaatdebat. Tot slot werd constructieve journalistiek vooral toegepast op de
koppeling tussen klimaatverandering en onderwerpen die affiniteit met technologie hebben en
in mindere mate ook met ontwikkelingen in de staat van klimaatverandering zelf.
Constructieve journalistiek werd tevens vaker bedreven in een oplossingsgerichte vorm dan
in een vorm die specifiek gericht was op het betrekken van het publiek in het maatschappelijk
debat. De resultaten van deze thesis laten zien dat constructieve journalistiek op verschillende
plekken in de media in een andere hoedanigheid wordt bedreven en dat er mogelijkheden zijn
om bepaalde aspecten van het klimaatdebat constructiever te benaderen. Deze kennis draagt
daarmee bij aan de algehele kennis van de staat van constructieve journalistiek in het
Nederlandse medialandschap.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Constructieve journalistiek', 'klimaatverandering', 'klimaatdebat', 'Nederland', 'framing']"
"Don’t go Hollow, Friend.
An in-depth analysis of an online videogame community and their communication.","Diets, Indy",2020-06-29,['Borges Lima L'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Technology is changing how people communicate, how people connect with one another,
and how relationships between strangers and friends alike are constructed. This thesis aims to
explore the configurational relationship between a form of media, in this case the videogames of the
Dark Souls franchise, and a community that almost exclusively exists and interacts in virtual
environments. The most relevant findings in this thesis were related to how members of this specific
virtual community communicate with each other, express their sense of belonging to this
community and how the Dark Souls videogame (communicative) mechanics play a role in this.
Therefore, the research focuses on the Dark Souls videogame franchise gameplay, and the Dark
Souls community that exists on the content-sharing and forum-like website Reddit. The aim of this
thesis is to answer the question: How are certain gameplay elements of the Dark Souls franchise
used by the related virtual community to both construct and observe this community, and to
communicate with other community members?
A thematic analysis was used in this research to research the configurative relationship
between Dark Souls gameplay and the Dark Souls Reddit community. Before the thematic analysis
was conducted, several hundred threads and posts were collected from the three most active Dark
Souls related ‘subreddits’. Additionally, Dark Souls gameplay mechanics that allow players to interact
with other players through online functionalities were analysed in order to make sense of some of
the contents that were stumbled upon during the thematic analysis of the community on Reddit.
The analysis of the gameplay also helps understand some of the most arguably most important
mechanics within the videogame that, observable in the results of this research, configure the
community, it’s members and the communication among them.
The results of this research show that a configurative relationship between the Dark Souls
videogames and the online Dark Souls related Reddit community exists. Usage of Dark Souls jargon
in discussion on Reddit shows that the gameplay and lore of the franchise configure the modes of
communication in the community. What also reflects that affectation of the virtual universe is the 
2
way Dark Souls community members identified themselves, and how they expressed a certain sense
of belonging to this specific community. Additionally, community members also discussed how
individual gameplay experiences are altered by the larger Dark Souls community. The online
functionalities of Dark Souls allow players to (involuntarily) enter the virtual world of other players,
leading to unique, unintended gameplay experiences. What became evident throughout the analysis
of the relationship between the community and the gameplay, is that the (common) experiences
had by community members lead to a common understanding of emotions, jargon, gameplay
interactions, discussions and more, showing the importance of the gameplay itself in the
construction of the community and the subjects discussed, and even in what manner they discuss
these subjects.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Community', 'Communication', 'Videogames', 'Reddit', 'Virtual']"
"Feminist Technologies:
Encoding Feminism in Dating Applications","Cvetkovska, Isidora",2020-06-29,['Arora P.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The topic of this research are feminist technologies. The investigation specifically deals with dating
apps as feminist technologies taking on the dating app Bumble as its central case study. The main
research question asks how feminism comes to be encoded into dating app technology and how it
shapes the contemporary romance economy. Three sub-questions operationalize the research
further by asking which feminist ideas are encoded and why, how the design of the app influences
interactions and shapes feminist practices, and lastly, what the users’ perceptions of the encoded
representations are. The theoretical framework introduces various feminist theories but specifically
focuses on the intersectional, queer and cross-cultural perspectives of what constitutes feminism.
The methodology of the investigation is qualitative and data collection and analysis is done by
conducing one-on-one interviews with users of the app. In addition to this, an app ethnography is
conducted using the walkthrough method. The findings present results from both parts of the data
collection. The main themes that arise are the paradoxical trust relationship between the app and its
users, the fluid versus binary understanding of gender roles, the dating expectations that exist with
regard to gender, the creation of safe spaces within the app, and the diversity of the matches within
the app. The discussion concludes that Bumble encodes feminist ideas at two levels. At the surface,
intersectional feminist ideas dominate, while in the core of the app outdated feminist ideas take
over. With regards to practices, the influence of the app’s design does not always aid Bumble in
translating its values from the surface level to the core design and experience of the app, thereby
creating a disconnect between what is said and what is done. Lastly, the perceptions of the
representations that users hold are different than how Bumble constitutes of these same ideas. The
research suggests three points of improvement for Bumble: firstly, updating the gender and
sexuality categories and how they are implemented within the app’s design; secondly, moving away
from gendered ideas of sexuality and assumptions about women’s sexual needs. Thirdly, revamping
the safety and privacy features of its app to provide a safe space for all.","['media', 'business', 'feminism', 'technology', 'dating apps', 'encoding', 'bumble']"
"Just for the Fame and Wealth?
Exploring CSR and CSR communication in the Chinese Privateowned business sector","Cui, Violet",2020-06-29,['Wang Y.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research aims to explore the perception of CSR and CSR communication
strategies in the Chinese private-owned company sector. The Chinese private-owned
business sector has a highly complex structure, as differently from the Western
business context, the Chinese market is highly free-oriented but significantly
influenced by its government. Simultaneously, traditional Chinese culture also
influences contemporary business ethics, forming a unique context for how CSR is
perceived as well as communicated. In order to explore CSR in this very context, this
research employed a qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews with
experts who work in the field of CSR. The main results reveal a paradox in the
perception of CSR in China, which lies in the relation between CSR and philanthropic
donations. Furthermore, through examining institutional factors it is shown that
companies encounter external pressure to conduct CSR. These external drivers come
from the government, industry, and stakeholders such as customers. Meanwhile,
companies are also internally driven to pursue CSR, especially the corporate leaders is
a significant driver influencing companies CSR strategies as well as philanthropic
donations. The results also show that corporate leaders will be triggered by two major
emotions when it comes to CSR decision-making, that is, gratitude and guilt. More indepth explanation is provided with the respect of how these two emotions emerge. In
terms of CSR communication, a one-way stakeholder information strategy is mostly
witnessed among the private-owned companies. Two major approaches to conduct
this strategy have been found: information prominence and identity prominence. In
conclusion, this research adds to the existing CSR concept and framework by
specifically focusing on the Chinese business context. Future possible research
directions are also suggested based on the current findings.","['media', 'business', 'corporate social responsibility', 'CSR communication', 'CSR drivers', 'private-owned company', 'China.']"

"Online art for everybody’s sake
How emerging visual artists market their personal brand on social media","Lechner, Marie",2020-06-29,['Leendertse M.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In a time where social media platforms dominate communication and selfexpression, it is once more essential to stand out in the sea of entertainment. Hence
companies and individuals alike started to engage in personal branding and relationship
marketing, two of many marketing tools, to keep their heads above water. These trends
have not surpassed the occupational sector of visual artists as their career progression is
nowadays also reliant upon their social media marketing behaviour. It is important to note
that online channels like Facebook or Instagram tore down former institutional walls
between artists and society. These obstacles have been carefully constituted over centuries
by established organisations like museums and visual art galleries. Those still regulate the
tensions between supply and demand.
However, the easy accessibility of artworks via phone or computer screens is not
only profitable for already established artistic household names like Ai Wei Wei or Banksy
but even more for emerging visual artists. By sharing their pieces directly with a dispersed
audience, upcoming artists can circumvent the traditional gatekeeping role of the previously
mentioned museums and art galleries. Distinct brand identities thereby support consistent
and clear online communication, thus aiding at gaining a foothold not only in the social
media sphere but also within the artistic world.
The research’s findings especially show that any entrepreneurial task, like
communication, sales, or network expansion, can efficiently be executed within an online
framework. Although an emerging visual artist’s artistic integrity might constrain
performance centred ambitions on social media, it simultaneously correctly endorses selfpromotion activities. In the course of the analysation it became evident that especially
Instagram supports the communication of emerging visual artists' brand identities. The
platform provides numerous affordances suitable for the profession.
III
The supporting data is collected through the qualitative method of expert
interviews. Thereby first-hand insights into the social media marketing behaviour of
emerging visual artists are gained. In the means of analysing the different social media
approaches of emerging visual artists, the study contributes to the current academic
research in the field of visual art.","['media', 'creative industries', 'emerging visual artist', 'social media', 'brand identity', 'artistic identity', 'relationship', 'marketing']"
"Which motivations lead football fans to engage with the
team on Instagram?
A quantitative research","Marinakis, Gregory",2020-06-29,['Bhansing P.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Football is arguably the most popular sport worldwide. The reason is that football fans are
developing unique, long-term relationships with their favourite team. As a result, the football
industry is generating massive revenues annually. Football teams have transformed into
quasi-brands exploiting their brand name. However, up to this point, research is scarce
regarding football fans engagement on Instagram. Instagram is a dynamic social media
platform that in recent years has transformed into a particularly promising marketing tool.
There is a lack of research on how football fans engage in their favourite football team’s
Instagram and the underlying motivations leading to engagement.
This study attempted to contribute to the limited literature, regarding engagement on
social media in the sport context from the fans’ perspective, by revealing the ways football
fans engagement is realized in Instagram and the motivations leading to it, paving the way for
future research. The research question developed was: “Which motivations lead football fans
to engage with the team on Instagram?” The motivations leading football fans to engage with
their favourite football team were based on Uses and Gratifications theory and the three types
of engagement were based on the Consumers’ Online Brand-Related Activities framework.
The research method that was chosen to investigate the research question is quantitative, in
the form of a survey that was distributed online through Qualtrics. The data from the
questionnaire was later analyzed with SPSS to test the model attempting to explain which
motivations lead to each level of engagement.
The main finding of the study is that engagement in Instagram was found to happen in its
own particular way. Thus, three new levels of engagement were developed, namely Light,
Considerable and Deep, to measure accurately Instagram engagement. The motivations, that
results have shown to influence Instagram engagement, are Empowerment, Brand Love,
Integration and Social Interaction and Remuneration. Specifically, Brand Love and
Integration and Social Interaction were responsible for Light engagement, Empowerment and
Remuneration were responsible for Considerable engagement and Empowerment and Brand
Love were responsible for Deep engagement. The conclusion is that engagement is realized in
different ways on each social media platform. Research needs to further investigate football
fans engagement in social media to better understand football fans’ behaviour. Sports
marketers must attempt to stimulate the motivations that seem to work in each social media
platform to drive engagement and create firm long-term relationships between football fans
and football teams.","['media', 'business', 'social media', 'social media engagement', 'Instagram engagement', 'relationship', 'marketing']"
"The Cult of the Line: How streetwear products became status symbols
A qualitative research examining the value of cultural credibility
for enhancing reputation of streetwear brands","Kraševec, Pia",2020-06-29,['Wang Y.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research aims to explore the phenomenon of cultural credibility of streetwear
brands and factors that contribute to its establishment, while also delving into
existence of status symbols and their meaning within the field of fashion and
contemporary society. The concept of cultural credibility presents a contemporary
aspect to examine corporate brand’s image and reputation as it predetermines that
consumers play a major role in its establishment as well as its fostering and
adaptation. This is a novel approach to look at monetization of popular culture
within the fields of fashion and corporate branding and it emphasizes the codependence of organizations and consumers in establishing contemporary brand’s
ecosystem. Simultaneously, this research explores the correlation between modern
streetwear brands and luxury brands in terms of their managerial approach that
reflects in their communication and positioning, while discovering the emergence
of status symbols and their meanings within societal context. These mentioned
phenomena are examined through a qualitative approach of semi-structured
interviews that were conducted with consumers as well as brand experts from
multiple countries. The main results present the first working definition of cultural
credibility and explain the factors that contribute to its establishment in the realms
of streetwear and fashion in general. It also offers an insight into the roles that
consumers take in fostering cultural credibility and perception that they have of
what forms a status symbol and what role it has within the contemporary society.
Due to lack of theoretical resources, understanding of cultural credibility is still in
the developing phase and this research is adjourned with aspirations to build upon
the recent findings and furtherly examine monetarization of popular culture that is
manifested through the phenomenon of cultural credibility.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Cultural credibility', 'reputation', 'streetwear brands', 'status', 'symbols', 'brand image', 'fashion', 'corporate branding']"
"After the Gold Rush
Understanding how millennials give meaning to vinyl in
today’s digitalized music market","Sancho Hernandez, Lucia",2020-06-29,['Driessen S.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis aims to explore how globalized millennials give meaning to the process of
consuming vinyl records in today’s digitally saturated music-market. It does so to through
fourteen semi-structured in-depth interviews, composed of a globalized sample of millennials.
These interviews have then been subjected to a thematic analysis, which revealed there are
both manifest and latent motives in which globalized millennials give meaning to the process of
consuming vinyl records in present-day. On the one hand, there are manifest factors such as
materiality, physicality, and rituality, as well as the appreciation for the overall vinyl culture that
stems greatly from record shops. On the other hand, there are latent reasons which are
predominantly based on the content that the vinyl holds, in terms of music and memories, and
how this constructs consumers’ identities. This leads to conclude that even though the
seventies are to be considered vinyl’s gold rush, it is perhaps safe to say the format is
experiencing a shakeup with a new generation in this 21st century. Instead of trying to surpass
another music format, vinyl is adapting and coexisting in a way that allows for it to be
appreciated by an enthusiastic and select audience, and thus showing how this format can
survive and thrive well after the gold rush.","['media', 'creative industries', 'vinyl', 'millennials', 'digitalization', 'identity', 'music.']"

How Entrepreneurs Overcome Contextual Challenges in their Formation of Entrepreneurial
Identity Through Narrative Identity Work on Social Media","Rego, Anaelle Do",2020-06-29,['Horst S.O.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The mediatization of society has led to the global transformation of commercial and socio-cultural
institutions. Most importantly it has revolutionized the ways in which labor is enacted. As a result, an
increase of technological phenomena such as digital entrepreneurship has occurred. Because of this,
researchers in the entrepreneurship field are increasingly calling for more theoretical developments
regarding the digitalization of entrepreneurship and how digital technologies have changed
entrepreneurial processes, particularly in regard to social media and narrative identity work. The
limited current theories and studies of these natures tend to take on more of a western emphasis,
however. Thus, focusing specifically on the Global South, the aim of this thesis is to build a new
theoretical perspective for understanding the phenomenon of digital entrepreneurship in the Global
South. The focus in particular is to address, describe and reflect on the ways in which entrepreneurs
in the Global South develop their entrepreneurial identity through (narrative) identity work on social
media. Accordingly, the main research question of this study is: How do digital entrepreneurs in the
Global South develop their entrepreneurial identity using social media and narrative identity work?
Because social contexts play a significant role in entrepreneurial identity formation as well as the fact
that theories on entrepreneurial contexts are also sought, in addition to the main research avenue,
social contexts are also taken into consideration and is a sub focus of this study. To achieve the main
and sub focus of this thesis a qualitative methodology was employed. 10 entrepreneurs from the
Global South participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews and the data gathered was analyzed
using thematic analysis. The findings revealed that through the development of their entrepreneurial
role, entrepreneurs in the Global South form their entrepreneurial identity by using different narrative
identity work strategies on different social media to pursue digital opportunities. Moreover, the
findings also revealed that despite resource scarcity, limited entrepreneurial ecosystems, and minimal
support and empowerment from local governments, digital entrepreneurship in the Global South
enables economic development, urbanization, personal development and emancipation. The thesis
concludes with social and practical recommendations as well as suggestions for future research.","['media', 'business', 'Digital entrepreneurship', 'Global South', 'Social media', 'Narrative identity work', 'Entrepreneurial contexts', 'Entrepreneurial challenges']"
"BLOGGERS: ONE FOR THE BOOKS
Exploring the relationship between book bloggers’ personal motivations and
recommendation techniques","Razzaq, Ferwa",2020-06-29,['Ferreira Gonçalves J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Book bloggers play an important role in the circulation of books in the book industry.
They review and recommend books, organize reading events and giveaways, and often help
authors publicize their books by obtaining advance reading copies (ARCs). They use personal
blogs and platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube to reach their audiences through
electronic word of mouth (eWoM), assisting in attracting consumers’ attention not only through
blogging, but by microblogging. However, there are significant research gaps in this area,
proving a lack of studies on book bloggers, the process of creating reviews, as well as diversity
and representation in the book blogging community and book industry. While research exists on
bloggers in general and reviews from various media (e.g. film and TV), there is limited research
on the producers’ processes; i.e. the reviewers themselves – in this case, book bloggers. This
study provided a start for this area of research by exploring the relationship between book
bloggers’ personal motivations and their recommendation techniques on Twitter, i.e. their
process of creating posts. This research question was embedded in the context of diversity and
representation, and thus book bloggers personality traits and ethnic backgrounds were examined
to obtain a richer outlook. Relevant literature was reviewed to build a framework for the study,
which employed a uses and gratifications perspective. A new scale was created to measure
recommendation techniques, and the study was carried out by means of an online survey (N =
330). The statistical analysis of the data gathered from the respondents lead to a number of
interesting results. Major findings showed that there is indeed a relationship between book
bloggers’ personality traits and personal motivations, as well as between their personal
motivations and recommendation techniques. Personality traits lead bloggers’ to have certain
motivations for book blogging, and these motivations lead them to use certain recommendation
techniques for posting. Examination of the book bloggers’ ethnic backgrounds provided further
insight into how their motivations are influenced in an industry in which inequality and biases
are present like any other. This has certain implications for the book industry that should be kept
in consideration, particularly in today’s age, as discussed further in this paper. Finally, the
conclusion offers potential areas for further research.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Book bloggers', 'eWoM', 'motivations', 'recommendations', 'U&G']"
"Non-sports related product endorsement by Cristiano Ronaldo: celebrity
marketing through the eyes of young Greek Instagram users","Roussos, Nikos",2020-06-29,['Borges Lima L.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Social media influencers are great tools in the hands of marketers and a powerful
weapon in the competitive sectors of branding and advertising through new media channels.
Instagram is one of the most rapidly evolving social media platforms where brands rely more
and more on their marketing strategies and in order to create effective endorsements they
choose the best possible celebrity influencers to reach their target audience. One of the most
favorite categories of celebrity influencers is the celebrity athletes who have a great impact on
several Instagram users with many different interests. The most famous athlete and the
individual with the most followers on Instagram is Cristiano Ronaldo, who is the main case
study in this research.
The purpose of this research is to investigate how Greek young Instagram users
perceive non-sports related endorsements by celebrity athletes, like Cristiano Ronaldo.
Moreover, the research aims to explore the impact of the use of Cristiano Ronaldo on users’
purchasing intentions and the influence of electronic word-of-mouth on users’ perceptions on
Instagram endorsed posts. To collect the appropriate data was used the method of qualitative
in-depth interviews with 8 young Greek Instagram users between 18 and 29 years old. For the
analysis of the collected data was used the method of thematic analysis from which emerged
the patterns to answer the research questions.
The findings bring out that Cristiano Ronaldo is able as a celebrity influencer to have
a positive influence on endorsements where he promotes content out of his expertise.
Moreover, he seems to have a positive impact on users’ perceptions when it comes to
purchasing decisions. Furthermore, in celebrity influencers’ endorsed posts the influence of

the portrayal of women in adverts for luxury brands in
Vogue.","Rodrigues Jorge Facca, Ana Carolina",2020-06-29,['Evolvi G.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Through the lens of semiotics, this work analyses the portrayal of women in advertising for
luxury brands in the American Vogue, from 2015 to 2019. For this reason, this research introduces
the history of the magazine, the definitions of luxury, the contextualisation of the topic, the
research question and the social and scientific relevance. Later, a theory background is presented
and the theoretical framework explained, which includes Goffman’s codes (1979), the liberal
feminist movement’s general principles, the American feminist movement and the influence of the
feminism in the fashion industry. After that, the methodology is delineated including the research
design, details of data collection, conceptualisation, operationalisation, sample description, data
analysis and ethical concerns. Following this, the results are described and conclusions drawn,
including theoretical and social implications, the critical assessment of the study and suggestions
for future research. Furthermore, it is found that women are still sexualised, objectified and
infantilised in advertising. Besides this, some unique nuances are observed such as the use of the
low angle to objectify women’s bodies instead of empowering them and the portrayal of racial bias
related to black models in adverts. Lastly, this research points out how companies/brands should
work together and continue to create images that are more gender-equal, that protect women’s
welfare but are also profitable in business terms.","['media', 'business', 'Advertising', 'luxury brands', 'Vogue', 'woman']"
"‘Intelligence that will win this war’:
Investigating Artificial Intelligence for Conservation","Rusch, Natasha",2020-06-29,['Arora P.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Artificial Intelligence is a novel technology being utilized to combat wildlife poaching in
Africa. Poaching in Africa is not only part of a highly illegal and lucrative industry, but it
correspondingly is effecting the ecosystems in depleting and causing the endangerment of
many species, including Rhino, Elephant, Pangolins and Wild Dog. A range of strategies are
utilized to combat poaching, however, the prevalence of poaching is still apparent. Therefore,
the research will address to what extent can/does AI mitigate the wildlife poaching problems
in Africa. More specifically, the research investigates the various beliefs about poaching
the biggest challenges and existing strategies in countering poaching and the
current initiatives and devices utilized. Research communicating the priorities, engaging
stakeholders and sharing best practice, in accordance to these various artificial intelligence
technologies available is limited. This study utilizes a mixed method approach including the
qualitative analysis of interviews of key stakeholders in the field of conservation including
those in the field, NGOs and technology experts, as well as news articles considering the
potential of artificial intelligence technology in conservation. The main findings of this study
include, that neoliberalist conservation ideologies still hold merit, there needs to be a reexamining of what constitutes as ‘information networks’ and the question of funding and

"Virtual reality door een
journalistieke bril:
een exploratie naar de (meer)waarde
van driedimensionale en computer
gegenereerde journalistieke verhalen","Moerland, Jordy",2020-06-29,['Kester B.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De digitalisering brengt constante en soms onnavolgbare veranderingen met zich mee. Binnen die dynamiek
is ook de journalistiek onderhevig aan de bijkomende gevolgen. Met virtual reality lijkt zich in dat kielzog
een medium aan te bieden die de journalistiek kan wapenen tegen een sterk veranderd landschap. Door een
kwalitatief audiovisueel analysemodel te ontwikkelen en toe te passen op 20 geselecteerde computer
gegeneerde 360°/vr-verhalen is er getracht een antwoord te vinden op de volgende onderzoeksvragen: (i) ‘Op
welke manieren wordt 360°/virtual reality gebruikt binnen journalistieke verhalen?’ en (ii) ‘Welke
(meer)waarde heeft dit voor het journalistieke verhaal?’. Dit onderzoek heeft zodoende ten doel gehad in
beeld te brengen hoe computer gegenereerde virtual reality binnen journalistieke context wordt gebruikt en
welke (meer)waarde hier al dan niet aan gekoppeld kan worden. Uit de analyses is echter gebleken dat
virtual reality echter een medium is gebleken met de nodige beperkingen. Allereerst is er een constante
spanning tussen het vergroten van bereik versus het aanbieden van interactie. Ten tweede blijkt het überhaupt
lastig te zijn om interactie te implementeren in virtual reality, waardoor veel van de geanalyseerde producties
het niveau van een sferische kijkdoos niet weten te ontstijgen.
Het lijkt voor de journalistiek beter te zijn om computer gedreven virtual reality voor nu te laten voor
wat het is. Enerzijds lijkt het medium nog altijd niet zo populair te zijn geworden als op voorhand werd
gedacht. Anderzijds dient zich in de vorm van augmented reality (ar) een alternatief medium aan waarmee de
oorspronkelijke premisse van virtual reality (groten)deels kan worden verwezenlijkt. Zo weet ar het
probleem van een klein bereik bijvoorbeeld te omzeilen doordat verhalen die middels deze techniek worden
aangeboden slechts een smartphone vereisen; in contrast met een additionele en vaak dure vr-bril. Verder
kunnen interactiemogelijkheden makkelijker geïmplementeerd worden doordat diezelfde smartphone over
een ingebouwd touchscreen beschikt. Vooral interactie lijkt van toegevoegde waarde omdat dit element het
verschil maakt tussen enerzijds statische en anderzijds dynamische verhaalvertelling. Ook brengt het
onderzoek naar voren dat het de moeite waard is om de rol van audio verder te bestuderen. De bevindingen
tonen sterk aan dat het toepassen van hoogwaardig diëgetisch geluid zwaarder weegt in de geloofwaardigheid van een productie dan dat de visuele stijl dat doet. Dit kan de journalistiek kansen bieden om op
laagdrempelig niveau immersie te implementeren binnen media met een groter bereik.
Virtual reality lijkt momenteel vooral een nichemarkt te bedienen. Hoewel het nog verre van
uitgesloten is dat dit medium in de toekomst alsnog haar weg weet te vinden naar het grote publiek, lijkt het
voor nu echter logischer om de vr-bril op te bergen en in te zetten op toegankelijkere manieren van digitale
verhaalvertelling.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'digitalisering', 'journalistiek', 'interactieve verhaalvertelling', 'virtual reality', 'audiovisuele', 'analyse']"
"When PUBG is not just a game:
An exploratory study of young Asian expatriates and maintaining social connections with
those back home","Nguyen, Le Bao Khanh",2020-06-29,['Hera T. de la'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (hereafter referred as PUBG) is a multiplayer online game which
was released in late December 2017. Since its release, PUBG has become a global phenomenon,
and is now the 5th highest selling video game of all time. With its large user-base, PUBG
outperformed all other games in Asian countries. In contrast to existing stereotypes, PUBG has
been perceived to enhance social connection among young players. Social connection facilitated by
group confrontation and the collaborative nature of multiplayer online games cannot be ignored
but remains scarce in academic research. Parallel to that, the affordance of multiplayer online
games as another form of social networking platform has provided young Asian expatriates more
opportunities to acquire social connection, especially with those back home. By conducting indepth interviews from a hermeneutical phenomenology approach, this study investigates the ways
young Asian expatriates make use of the multiplayer online game PUBG to maintain existing longdistant social connections. The data was taken from ten in-depth interviews with young Asian
expatriates who are active players of the researched game. A qualitative thematic analysis method
was utilized to analyze the complete data. The analysis indicates three main emerging themes. The
first theme, emotional responses, describes players’ emotional engagement during game play with
existing ties from their homelands. The findings indicate a centrality of positive emotional
experience among gaming experience in a shared game with friends. The second theme, Just a
Game?, narrates the participants’ immersive involvement and their perceived social and cultural
capital from gaming with friends from their homelands. The final theme of uses and gratifications
reveals how young Asian expats socially benefit from their gaming behaviours and experiences.
The results of this study show the unique role of the multiplayer online game PUBG in
maintaining social connections by providing an immersive social environment where expatriates
and their long-distant ties can obtain emotional support, exchange social and cultural capital as well
as obtain a shared identity regardless of geographical distances and different social contexts. In
addition, this study has filled in the literature gap in examining expatriate social connections with
existing ties from their home countries and further added to the research in the field of gaming. For
gaming companies and creators, this research provides insightful findings related to gaming
elements that can boost social outcomes.","['media', 'business', 'multiplayer online games', 'PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds', 'social connection', 'expatriates', 'uses and gratifications.']"
"The impact of the use of gamification in Corporate Social
Responsibility communication on Millennials","Pagani, Maria",2020-06-29,['Wang Y.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In recent years, the application of gamified techniques to CSR communication was
suggested by several scholars, but only a few studies were conducted to test its effectiveness
and suitability (Coombs & Holladay, 2015; Maltseva, Fieseler, & Trittin-Ulbrich, 2019). This
study employed an online experiment (N=245) to determine whether the presence of gamified
techniques in visual and/or textual Facebook posts delivering CSR messages can influence the
respondent for what concerns environmental attitude and pro-environmental behavioural
intention. Moreover, the paper aims to investigate whether other prior conditions, such as
familiarity with videogames and knowledge in the matter of sustainability, play a role in the
development of positive behavioural and attitudinal reactions in response to the gamified CSR
messages. Hence, considered the novelty and relevance of the topic, the gap in the literature
and the little investigation on the potential of gamification in the field of CSR communication,
the research question was formulated as follow: To what extent can gamification be used as an
effective tool for CSR communication activities among Millennials?
Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions, each of
which included similar CSR content but differed both for the feature of the message (textual
message with or without visual stimuli) and for the display of gamification techniques (present
or absent). The present results suggest that gamification might not be an apt tool for CSR
communication to an extent, supporting the claims of academic detractors of gamification
applications in corporate communication and CSR activities. However, this study contributed to
the expansion of the academical knowledge about the topic and contributed with relevant
insight about a specific generational cohort (Millennials), the usage of social media in CSR
communication (in this case Facebook) and the possible effects of moderator factors (namely
Familiarity with video games and Prior knowledge in matter of sustainability). Despite the
ambivalent outcomes, this study emphasized the demand for further empirical researches in
the field of gamified CSR communications, adding specific directions for future studies.","['media', 'business', 'corporate social responsibility', 'CSR communication', 'gamification', 'Millennials', 'social media']"
The effect of different types of CSR on eWOM intentionsand behaviors of employees.,"Meijer, Suzanne",2020-06-29,['Prooijen A.M. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Having positive employees as online ambassadors for your organization can be valuable.
Especially social networking sites (SNS) are a platform on which information can be spread
widely and rapidly. This study focuses on a specific part of online ambassadorship, electronic
word-of-mouth (eWOM). The things employees say about an organization in an online
context can be a significant predictor of an organization its reputation. To attract important
stakeholders, such as consumers, future employees and investors, a positive reputation is of
great importance. Research shows that one way to engage employees in online
ambassadorship on social media is through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
communication. Gaps in the literature however exist with regards to the deeper understanding
of CSR. Therefore this research looked into the different CSR topics (economic, legal, ethical
and philanthropic) and their effect on eWOM intentions and behaviors of employees. This
study has focussed on the SNS Facebook, as it is still the most widely used social media
platform. Online ambassadorship of employees can be important for all sorts of
organizations. However, most research that has been done has looked into the effects for
bigger companies. This research was designed to add to the literature about employee
engagement in small medium businesses (SMEs) as these kinds of businesses represent a
large amount of organizations in Europe. Among Dutch SMEs, a survey was conducted to
measure the eWOM intentions and an experiment was conducted to measure the actual
eWOM behaviors. This mixed methods approach was used to look for differences between
the intentions of employees and their actual actions. The results of the survey showed that
there is no direct effect between CSR types and eWOM, but there is an indirect relationship:
economic and legal-ethical CSR have a positive effect on organizational identification, which
in turn has a positive effect on eWOM. The experiment showed no significant relationships,
although the results indicated that ethical-philanthropic CSR had the most positive effect on
eWOM behaviors of employees. This research first of all concludes that the findings
contribute to the existing literature on organizational identification and CSR, as CSR can
have a positive effect on organizational identification. However, this research suggests that a
more specific CSR measuring instrument needs to be created for studying the effects of CSR
in a SME context.","['media', 'business']"

Outcomes of advertising and brand perception of traditional, side banner, product placement and
influencer advertisements.","Ochoa Ferrazzini, Maged",2020-06-29,['Opree S.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Does the type of online advertisement truly matter? This research examines the differences
that traditional advertisements, side banner advertisements, product placement advertisements
and influencer advertisements have on brand image and advertising perceptions. This was achieved
by examining the differences between each type of advertisement by testing the level of
advertising liking, advertising engagement and advertising skepticism. The different types of
advertisements were chosen as they frequently occur on the internet. According to previous
literature, there are differences in how effective each type of advertisement is. Here, literature
explains that traditional advertisements, product placement advertisements and side banner
advertisements are effective when introducing a product or brands. While this is also the case for
influencer advertisements, these are additionally effective when engaging consumers. When
analyzing how important advertising liking and engagement can be when talking about brand
attitudes, previous literature explains that these two factors help to form the image of the
company. To test this, an online survey was conducted in which women were exposed to a type of
advertisement for the brand Clinique Laboratories, with a sample size of 144. Among the questions,
participants were asked to answer different statements regarding advertising liking, advertising
engagement, advertising skepticism and brand attitudes. Additionally, participants were also asked
about their previous knowledge of the brand and the advertisements.
The results of this showed that indeed there is a difference between the types of
advertisement, in particular that advertising liking and advertising engagement can predict positive
brand attitudes. When testing for which type of advertisements were most effective, traditional
advertisements was indeed found to be the most effective regarding advertising liking, followed by
influencer advertising. Although traditional advertisements were more effective, influencer
advertisements showed that it could also be effective during the introductory phases. Finally, with
regard to advertising engagement, as expected influencer advertisements were shown to be the
most effective, supporting previous literature. Thus, this result suggests the importance of the type
of advertisement, depending on the goal of the company.","['media', 'business', 'online advertisements', 'advertisement perception', 'brand perception', 'brand attitudes', 'influencer advertisements']"

"“Are you a Barbie girl?”
A diachronic qualitative study on how Barbie’s image changed between 2000-2019, based on the brand’s advertising.","Raftopoulou, Nefeli",2020-06-29,['Hermans A.M.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In this day and age, more brands tend to engage with inclusive advertising campaigns in order to
stay relevant and competitive in the market. One of these brands responding to the trend towards
inclusion and diversity is Barbie. The popular doll has been criticized for promoting a single type of
femininity based on stereotypes regarding appearance and roles. Despite the social influence that
Barbie may have on young girls’ perceptions with regard to female images and roles, the brand has
been extremely successful for over 5 decades. In 2012, however, Barbie’s sales have started
dropping significantly, a fact that paved the way for Mattel, the manufacturing company behind
Barbie, to change the doll’s branding strategy. As a result, since 2015, Mattel aims to break the
stereotypical representation of women and ‘to better reflect the world girls see today’, by adding
dolls with diverse skin tones, body types and hairstyles. This thesis investigates whether the changes
that the doll brand has incorporated are apparent in the brand’s advertising campaigns over the
years. Thus, the research question ‘How has femininity been constructed in Barbie’s advertising
campaigns between 2000-2019?’ is raised. To answer this research question, thematic analysis was
implemented on a total of 100 video advertisements (5 per year) for Barbie by Mattel, in order for
the researcher to observe the gradual shift regarding femininity within the time period of interest.
This thematic analysis resulted in six main themes, which were combined to provide an answer to
the research question. In general, it was found that the construction of femininity through the
adverts of the brand has undergone significant changes after 2015. Although white Caucasian
features, sexiness, thinness and attentive looks were prominent features of femininity until 2015,
femininity, after 2015, is constructed through diversity in ethnicity, body types and looks. The shift
of the doll brand is not limited to female images; stereotypically female roles and activities related
to outward appearance or to personality attributes like emotional, nurturing, and concerned with
people and relationships that were predominant in the years 2000-2015, were gradually less
observed after 2015. Overall, it could be said that despite the changes that were observed through
the process of thematic analysis, there are still various types of women that are not represented
through the dolls of the brand.","['media', 'business', 'Barbie doll', 'gender', 'femininity', 'stereotypes', 'shift', 'advertising']"
"A story of immersion:
The design and production process behind the storytelling of immersive
museums and art exhibitions","Popoli, Zoi",2020-06-29,['Derda I.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Gradually, museums have been reflecting on the kinds of exhibitions they create and
consequently, shifting their approaches as far as exhibition design is concerned. Visitors’ criticism
and demand to move away from passive, encyclopaedic with curatorial authority exhibitions, to
ones that engage visitors and place them at the centre of focus has ignited this change in exhibition
design. For this reason, museums have begun to experiment with the exhibition design and look for
new ways to engage and intrigue visitors. A way to do so is by employing immersive approaches
together with strong storytelling which can create memorable experiences and redefine the user
experience. However, despite the increased adoption of immersive exhibitions, the design and
production process behind such exhibitions has not been investigated in-depth yet, with scholars
reporting that the accounts of designers and experts who are not part of the museum team are
rarely taken into consideration in studies. Thus the research combined the narratives of
interviewed experts and identified a design and production model consisting of five phases (initial,
concept, design, production, and opening phase), which extends our understanding of the creative
process for immersive exhibitions, while simultaneously denoting changes in contemporary
exhibition design in general, due to the wide integration of immersive approaches in nearly all
exhibitions.
The research also revealed the changed dynamics of a detailed and expanded two-sided
production model which requires the close collaboration of multiple experts. Nonetheless, the
proliferation of the roles required in exhibition design and production has been filled by external
collaborators, and the museum team has not expanded to include all those new roles. Finally, the
creative process is not technology-driven since the development of a leading story lies at the heart
of the identified model and informs the overall process. Therefore every exhibition is a story, and
immersion is being used as a way to enhance the storytelling and engage and submerge visitors in
what they experience.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Immersive exhibitions', 'Storytelling', 'Exhibition co-production', 'Museum exhibitions', 'Creative process']"

First, is to expand on the current literature by
examining the implications that streaming services have brought in the globalization of pop
music. Second, is to examine the applicability of the explanatory determinants in this growing
digital market, as it is believed that technological advancements could potentially diminish
the importance of certain explanatory determinants, such as cultural centrality, cultural
proximity, and physical distance. Since streaming consumption accounts for more than half
of the overall music consumption worldwide, this is done by analyzing the annual top 100
pop music charts that incorporate both online and offline consumption for the markets of
the U.S., the U.K., Spain and South Korea for 2019. Notably, during the analysis further
attention is given to the prominence of language and record labels. Overall, the results show
that there are substantial differences between the Western markets and the market of South
Korea. Generally, South Korea was had most domestically oriented chart in the sample, while
U.S. was the most successful origin country. Surprisingly, the international success of K-pop
seems to be limited, while Latin music songs and artists were found in all four countries.
Furthermore, while the analysis shows that the explanatory determinants, and especially the
destination effects, have become less important, the charts still seem to reflect the preexisting offline power relationships of the industry. Particularly, the presence of majors was
significant in all Western markets, while South Korean charts mostly consisted of domestic
labels. All things considered, the findings of this thesis contradict the notion of one global
market and instead suggest the conceptualization of multiple centralities in similar future
studies.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Pop music', 'Latin music', 'K-pop', 'record labels', 'streaming services', 'globalization']"
"Pro-Environmental Social Media Influencers strike on #fridaysforfuture
An exploratory study of communicated narratives on Instagram
to tackle climate actions","Heuel, Lena",2020-06-29,['Mittal R.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Planet earth’s temperature is still on the rise and the world needs to wake up because: Change
is coming, whether they like it or not. The young girl Greta Thunberg from Sweden struck for the
climate, together with 4 million people from all over the world, for a whole week in September 2019.
Her intentions are clear: reminding global leaders of the necessity to adapt and mitigate the system to
become environmentally friendly.
Yet, the ‘Fridays for future strike’ is not only addressed to global leaders, but also to society.
The majority of the world’s population, people under 25 years old, do not support a pro-environmental
attitude. Pessimism, negativity and a hopeless scenario define the picture that young Europeans see in
a changing climate of the world. Therefore, questions arise, whether young people are able to change
their perception so that a predicted dangerous temperature change could be prevented?
(Social) media plays a crucial role to represent the public’s opinion. Social Media Influencers
(SMIs) have become the new journalists and gain popularity by their virtual followers. Since social
media sites became part of young people’s everyday life, which role do SMIs play in communicating
climate change appropriately? More precisely, this research explores the communicated narratives
during the time of a proven example (Fridays for future), to ultimately answer the question: How did
selected Instagram influencer accounts communicate a pro-environmental attitude to young people in
Europe?
Three purposively selected Instagram influencer accounts provided the data to identify
dominant underlying patterns, expressed in communicated narratives. 90 captions and 60 visuals in
total build the foundation for the conducted content analysis. Four overarching categories and 11 subthemes, based on a profound thematic and visual analysis, allowed an in-depth understanding of
communicated climate actions.
Ultimately, this research shows that Instagram influencers contribute by their focus on an
emotional and personal representation of climate actions. Human imperfections, vulnerability and ecoanxiety were communicated openly, to approach the user with empathy and authenticity. In doing so,
collective climate activism as well as an individual responsible consumption and production behavior
become apparent as a best-practice example. Furthermore, this research identified topics that are
crucial but either missing or reported on a low level. The findings show fossil fuels, defined as the
largest contributor to global warming, could be further explained to tackle efficient climate actions
from a long-term perspective. Finally, Instagram allows the transmission of clear messaging if visuals
and texts are aligned coherently.","['media', 'business', 'Climate Change', 'Fridays for future', 'Climate Actions', 'Social Media Influencers', 'Instagram']"
"The art gallery in the digital age:
How can galleries sustain their businesses in times of
digital business transformation?","Habelsberger, Beatrix",2020-06-29,['Bhansing P.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Various art market participants – and especially art galleries – have long been
reluctant to embrace digital channels for selling art. Previous research has repeatedly
stressed that the art market follows its own rules, as the value of art cannot be determined
objectively. It is formed in the social context through the interaction of various actors and
gatekeepers, including galleries. Due to the rapid digitisation, which affects all business
areas and thus also the art market, the question arises how galleries can maintain their
business in times of digital business transformation. Despite the increasing relevance of
digital channels in the gallery business, there has been little research on online sales and
their impact on the gallery business. This thesis therefore addresses this gap and explores
how galleries can sustain their business in times of digital business transformation. The
following four sub-aspects are addressed: (1) the tension between the traditional business
model and innovation; (2) the extent to which galleries have already integrated digital
channels into their business model; (3) how digital channels can best be integrated into the
gallery business model; and (4) the consequences of implementing digital sales channels.
Thirteen expert interviews with gallery owners and managers in Vienna were
conducted. They were asked about the innovation through digital channels and impact of
these channels on their business. The interviews were analysed using the qualitative
research method of thematic analysis. The analysis resulted in four major themes: First, it
revealed that several factors that characterise the gallery business, such as personal
relationships, the need for the physical experience of art, and lack of transparency for
maintaining organisational legitimacy, inhibit openness to innovation. Second, it was found
that despite these factors, several galleries are already successful in selling art online, with
those in the lower price segment more likely to run online shops, while those in the higher
price segment are more likely to sell art on the basis of their digital footprint and online
presence. Third, since experts agree that online sales are most likely to happen when
customers are familiar with the gallery and have already established trust, a multi- and omnichannel approach was found to be the most appropriate way to integrate online sales
channels. Fourth, the analysis revealed that customers and galleries are becoming more
open to the consumption and sales of art through digital channels, so there is potential for
the business model to expand into the digital sphere. The role of the gallery as gatekeeper
will continue to play an important role in this process. The results suggest that art galleries
with an international focus should focus on the integration of online channels into their overall
business model. Concurrently, galleries active in the national market seem not yet to be
ready for the digital experience and sale of art.","['media', 'business', 'art market', 'online art sales', 'multi-channel', 'art galleries', 'business model', 'innovation']"
"Framing of (corporate involvement in) Amsterdam Pride
A content analysis of Dutch news media reports","Hoogkamer, Ted",2020-06-29,['Chaudhri V.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study depicts the current state of Amsterdam Pride and accompanying corporate
involvement in Dutch news media framing, situating Amsterdam Pride in a CSR research
context. These days, stakeholders often expect companies to take a social stand, while
stakeholder skepticism of CSR is on the rise as well. Discussions about both the societal and
commercial value of the Amsterdam Pride specifically have become increasingly present in
the Dutch LGBTQ+-community, with some accusing companies of misusing the Pride for
their own benefit (pinkwashing). Research on events like Amsterdam Pride and pinkwashing,
let alone on LGBTQ+-related CSR, has been limited. This study aims to start filling this gap.
Media are known to have an agenda-setting function; what they make more salient, has an
effect on what audiences think about and how they think about that, making a media framing
study an appropriate starting point for Pride CSR research. Through a content analysis of
162 Dutch newspaper articles from 2018 and 2019, insights were generated about media
framing of Amsterdam Pride discourse – and corporate involvement discourse within that.
The results showed that Amsterdam Pride has been framed as a newsworthy, debatable and
timely topic, with growing popularity. Emancipatory discussions about representation in
diversity, acceptance and activism were the most dominant topic in the media. Articles about
Pride programming and history were second most dominant, followed by matters of
nuisance, corporate involvement, and societal relevance. These findings imply that, although
Pride corporate involvement is a discussion-worthy news topic, other emancipatory issues
were deemed to have more news value sometimes: the Pride’s societal existence in its
current form needed to be defended or debated first, before jumping to commercial aspects.
Zooming in on corporate involvement showed that Pride CSR is usually equalized with
companies being present at the Canal Parade, thereby making other types of involvement
less salient. Media framing of those activities in terms of company motive attributions and
CSR media frames were highly polarizing. Most articles were either very positive (valuesdriven motive attributions; optimist media frame) about Pride CSR, or very negative (egoisticdriven motive attributions; cynic media frame), thereby framing corporate involvement as
either a boon or a deterrent for Amsterdam Pride. Pinkwashing was a key argument in some
of these negative discussions, showing multifaceted manifestations beyond academic
conceptualization, while some articles did display more nuance in their value judgment.
Either way, moving forward, companies will have to evaluate how they take their Pride social
stance in attempting to avert media or stakeholder skepticism.","['media', 'business', 'Amsterdam Pride', 'CSR', 'LGBTQ+-community', 'media framing', 'pinkwashing']"
"A ‘dog’s breakfast’
If and how marketers can about-face the ecological paw print
consumers leave on the pet food industry","Hoppezak, Priscilla",2020-06-29,['Prooijen A. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The emergence of trends such as veganism and vegetarianism have promoted the reduction of
meat consumption and thus agricultural production worldwide, about-facing the ecological
footprint of humans. However, this progress gets continuously overruled by the worldwide
increasing ecological paw print of the pet food industry. Ecological paw print refers to
human-caused greenhouse gas emissions by meat production for the pet food industry. In an
era of Internet and great communication technologies, online advertisements have the power
to facilitate a shift in consumer purchase intentions towards more sustainable pet food. To
promote the reduction of meat production for the pet food industry and about-face the
worldwide growing ecological paw print.
This study examined the potential influence of brand-specific claims in online
advertisements, social norms and trust on consumer purchase intentions towards dog food
brands. An online survey was conducted including an experiment as participants were
randomly assigned to either one of two manipulations or a control group, measuring the
effect of health claims and environmentally beneficial claims in online advertisements on
purchase intentions towards dog food. Within the survey, dispositional trust and
anthropomorphism regarding dogs were measured as personal traits. The concepts social
norms and situational trust were included in the analysis as potential mediators. Overall, the
findings revealed that health claims lead to higher purchase intentions towards dog food
brands amongst dog owners regardless of any further information on the product and the
pressure of social norms compared to environmentally beneficial or neutral claims.
Situational trust in a brand was found to be independent of brand-specific claims but does
positively influence purchase intentions as an independent variable. Furthermore, a potential
relation between anthropomorphism towards dogs and purchase intentions was not found to
be significant.","['media', 'business', 'sustainability', 'pet food industry', 'purchase intentions', 'marketing', 'communication', 'online advertising']"
"Van mysterieus
longvirus naar
coronacrisis

Simone Jordaans

Een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse naar de berichtgeving van online nieuwsmedia
over het coronavirus.","Jordaans, Simone",2020-06-29,['Huiberts E.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In december 2019 kwamen meerdere mensen met longklachten het ziekenhuis binnen in de
Chinese stad Wuhan. Het bleek het besmettelijke coronavirus te zijn, toen nog veel het ‘mysterieuze
longvirus’ genoemd. In Nederland leek er op dat moment nog niet veel zorgen te zijn om het virus.
Er werden drie scenario’s in gedachten gehouden; het virus blijft in China, er komen wat incidentele
besmettingen in Nederland, of er komt een ‘grote’ introductie van maximaal twintig patiënten
tegelijkertijd. De kans dat het virus zich in Nederland zou verspreiden, achtte het RIVM klein en
bovendien zouden we goed voorbereid zijn mocht het virus toch opduiken.
Het coronavirus werd veel opgepikt door de Nederlandse media, van extra journaals tot
aan liveblogs. Sinds de eerste berichtgeving vanaf het mysterieuze longvirus gaat er geen dag voorbij
zonder nieuws over nieuwe besmettingen, dodenaantallen en bezorgde wetenschappers. Er klinken
geluiden of media niet overdreven veel aandacht hebben gegeven aan het coronavirus en of zij niet
de dreiging van het virus overdreven. Het doel van het onderzoek is om te achterhalen hoe de
Nederlandse nieuwsmedia online berichten over het coronavirus.
Enerzijds is gekeken naar de hoeveelheid berichtgeving van nieuwsmedia online. De mate
van aandacht die de nieuwsorganisaties gaven aan het coronavirus is goed te verklaren door de
nieuwswaardigheid van situaties. De correlatie tussen de mate van aandacht aan corona tussen
online nieuwsmedia blijkt significant en sterk. Het lijkt dan ook terecht dat het deze toename in
het aantal artikelen op die momenten resulteert in de perceptie dat het een belangrijk onderwerp
is.
Anderzijds is gekeken naar framing op basis van toonzetting, thema’s, mediaframes en
bronnen. In eerste instantie was de berichtgeving geruststellend en werden risico’s van het
coronavirus ontkracht, in tegenstelling tot de verwachting dat zij overdreven. De alarmerende toon
kwam later toen het virus in Nederland grotere gevolgen met zich meebracht dan de verwachting
was. Wat betreft het thema ligt vooral een nadruk op de gevolgen van het virus en worden de
opvattingen van experts en betrokkenen steeds belangrijker. Het wijst voorzicht in de richting van
dramatiseren, wat wordt bevestigd door de resultaten van mediaframes. Het human interest frame
wordt steeds belangrijker, De media geven in hun berichtgeving een menselijk gezicht aan de
situatie rondom het coronavirus wat eveneens in de richting wijst van dramatiseren. Tot slot is er
gekeken naar de gebruikte bronnen. De geruststellende toon is goed te verklaren als de vergelijking
met de geraadpleegde bronnen wordt gemaakt. Chinese autoriteiten stelden immers de WHO in
het begin gerust en ook hier in Nederland gaf de overheid een geruststellende boodschap af. Verder
komt in het gebruik van bronnen ook sensationalisme terug. Gezondheidsautoriteiten en 
3
overheidsinstanties moesten naarmate het virus dichterbij kwam steeds meer ruimte maken voor
belanghebbende organisaties.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Coronavirus', 'nieuwsmedia', 'gezondheidscrisis pandemie', 'berichtgeving', 'framing']"
"Genderstereotyping like it’s 1999
Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar hoe schadelijke genderstereotypen in reclames
voorkomen kunnen worden","Kramer, Marleen",2020-06-29,['Nikken P.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Diverse onderzoeken tonen aan dat genderstereotypen in reclames consumenten negatief kunnen
beïnvloeden. Door de portrettering van genderstereotypen in reclames lopen consumenten het risico
dat zij niet elk beroep kunnen uitoefenen en ervaren zij druk om te voldoen aan genderstereotype
schoonheidsidealen. Met name kinderen zijn kwetsbaar, omdat zij meer moeite hebben om reclames
kritisch te evalueren. De gedachten van Nederlandse reclamemakers over genderstereotypen en de
oplossingen om met genderstereotypen om te gaan zijn nog onbekend. Het begrijpen van de gedachten
van reclamemakers is belangrijk om genderstereotypen in reclames te verminderen. De volgende
probleemstelling stond hierbij centraal: Hoe denken reclamemakers over genderstereotypen in
reclames en aan welke criteria moeten reclames volgens deze groep voldoen, om negatieve gevolgen
van genderstereotyperingen bij kinderen te voorkomen? Middels 12 semigestructureerde interviews
met reclamemakers is de probleemstelling onderzocht. De interviews zijn thematisch geanalyseerd,
daaruit blijkt dat reclamemakers zowel voor- als nadelen inzien van genderstereotypen. Voordelen zijn
dat genderstereotypen zorgen voor de focus op de boodschap en gebaseerd zijn op gemiddelde
kenmerken waardoor veel mensen worden aangesproken. Nadelen zijn dat genderstereotypen zorgen
voor negatieve reacties van consumenten en dat ze inefficiënt zijn op de lange termijn. Deze inzichten
zijn van belang, zodat beter wordt begrepen hoe genderstereotypen een boodschap overbrengen en
daarmee hoe genderstereotypen kinderen beïnvloeden. Ook blijkt dat reclamemakers denken dat
profile targeting ervoor kan zorgen dat consumenten beperkt worden in hun ideeën over wat gender is.
Bij profile targeting worden persoonlijke gegevens van consumenten gebruikt om een boodschap op
een doelgroep te richten. Hierdoor zien consumenten alleen genderstereotype beelden die specifiek op
hun zijn gericht. Als het gaat om kinderen als ontvangers van reclames blijkt dat reclamemakers zich
verantwoordelijk voelen voor het werk dat zij doen. Daarbij zijn drie typen reclamemakers te
onderscheiden: (1) de ethische reclamemaker die geen reclames wil maken die schadelijke gevolgen
kunnen hebben; (2) de reclamemaker met meerdere belangen die de gevolgen wil voorkomen, maar
ook de opdrachtgever wil dienen; (3) de onbewuste reclamemaker die zich niet bezighoudt met de
gevolgen van genderstereotypen op consumenten. Ten slotte, op basis van de interviews konden negen
criteria worden opgesteld die reclamemakers kunnen hanteren om schadelijke effecten van
genderstereotypen te verminderen, namelijk: criteria voor gender schoonheidsidealen waarbij de
nadruk ligt op het voorkomen van gevaarlijke schoonheidsbeelden, criteria voor het omgaan met
genderrollen waarbij de focus ligt op de gelijkwaardigheid tussen man en vrouw en criteria voor
reclames waar kinderen in voorkomen hierbij ligt de focus op het toekomstbeeld van kinderen.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Genderstereotypen', 'Reclames', 'Reclamemakers', 'Profile targeting', 'Kinderen', 'Criteria']"
"Building the New Beauty Cult
Exploring the Rhetorical Processes of Identification on the Example of the Beauty Brand
Glossier","Kalousová, Karin",2020-06-29,['Antuna D.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The beauty industry has gone through a significant change during the past decade. Women have
started to challenge the pre-defined ideas of beauty imposed onto them by society and beauty
companies. Social media abruptly transformed how beauty brands can communicate with their
audience and decreased their control over the conversation. On top of that, millennials with their
new approach toward lifestyle and consumption became a very relevant generation to which the
brands needed to adjust. Thus, the current situation now more than ever calls for a better
understanding of the effective ways to use the digital communication channels, that can be still fully
controlled by the brands – owned media. This thesis aimed to expand the understanding of the
effective usage of the owned social media by exploring the active role of the companies in the
identification process between brands and customers. This was explored through the research
question of what the rhetorical processes of identification behind the beauty brand Glossier are. By
observing the customer brand identification theory through two concepts – identification theory of
Burke and de Chernatony’s brand identity model – an active role of the brand in the customer brand
identification process was considered and explored. A qualitative analysis combining the rhetorical
and visual discourse analysis tool explored the rhetorical processes of identification on an example
of 151 Instagram posts from the successful beauty brand Glossier. The analysis revealed, that one of
the reasons for Glossier’s success can be the complex network of associations specifically made to
attract millennials. These connections are based on the simpler associations supporting the
mechanical identification, unusual associations enhancing the analogical identification along with
the specific framing of the social ideas embracing the ideological identification. The brand is trying
to avoid causing negative feelings in its consumers, which was a traditional marketing strategy of
the beauty brands for a long time, and instead of that focuses on arousing positive feelings. The
digital culture plays a crucial role in the customer brand identification process. It supports the
feeling of belonging to the brand community while it enhances customer brand identification
through the co-creation. Also, the framing of social ideas about inclusiveness and the promotion of
the natural non-transformational looks could lead to the dissociation. In conclusion, this thesis
found that if brands want to actively support the identification process and build a new beauty cult,
they should communicate simple, unusual, and social ideas attractive for their audience while
showing brand identity through the customers’ content.","['media', 'business', 'customer brand identification', 'digital branding', 'beauty', 'brand identity', 'rhetoric']"
"Digital opportunities or additional barriers?
Exploring the experiences of higher educated refugees using social media in
their search for adequate employment","Irvine, Kelly",2020-06-29,['Paz Alencar A.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","One of the main barriers highly educated refugees face in the Netherlands is obtaining
adequate employment. Social media is becoming an increasingly important tool during the job
search process. Social network sites such as LinkedIn present opportunities for refugees to
obtain host country social capital. Therefore, great emphasis is often placed on using social
media for professional purposes by organizations and policy makers, as this would enhance
refugee resilience. Refugee resilience is embedded in neoliberalism, favouring entrepreneurial
mind-sets and focused on personal agency. However, caution must be taken when presenting
social media as a solution for refugees to overcome contextual barriers they face during the
job search process, as social media might not present equal opportunities for everyone. This
study therefore examined the experiences of highly educated refugees in the Netherlands who
used social media for professional purposes, generating insights in these experiences from the
participants’ point of view. Eight semi-structured interviews have been conducted, embedded
in theories of social capital, employment, social media and the digital order, and neoliberalism
and personal agency. Findings indicate that refugees have embraced this neoliberal mind-set
and the use of social media for employment purposes. Over the past years, there has been a
rise of digital professional refugee networks. In these social media networks, employment
information is shared, vacancies are posted and resources are being exchanged. However,
many participants seem to focus their digital practices mainly on such refugee networks,
limiting opportunities for obtaining bridging social capital containing native contacts. This
focus is a result of negative experiences many participants have had on social media, such as
online bullying and discrimination. These experiences, as well as cultural differences, often
lead to reluctance amongst refugees to profile themselves on social media. In conclusion,
higher levels of trust are necessary on social media platforms in order for everyone to express
themselves freely and engage with each other openly.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Refugees', 'employment', 'social media', 'neoliberalism', 'highly educated']"
"Urban Social Future Imaginaries
in Detroit: Become Human (2018)","Açikel, Aylin",2020-06-29,['L. Borges Lima'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research dealt with the urban social future imaginaries of the simulated Detroit
from the year 2038 found within the video game “Detroit: Become Human” (2018),
abbreviated as DBH. The aim of the research was to analyze the ways in which the
simulated future version of Detroit in DBH mirrors or defies the urban social traits,
issues, conflicts, and future plans of the ‘real’ contemporary Detroit, which struggles
with socio-economic decline, poor living conditions, and racial injustices. Hence the
main research question was “How does Detroit: Become Human depict future
imaginaries of Detroit’s urban social environment and its Android citizens?” Racial
differentiation based on skin color amongst humans has been replaced by the human
versus android/deviant dichotomy in DBH, hence the issue of race focused on the
androids in the game. The research question could be divided into the matter of
racial discrimination and futuristic or realistic potential city identities. The concepts of
the urban social from urban sociology, social dominance and social status in video
games, urban/street games, sci-fi hierarchies in visual media, environmental
storytelling, and race/racism in video games provided the theoretical foundation. The
method of research was qualitative, intending to analyze how the individual citizen
experiences the urban and social dimensions within the urban environment of DBH’s
Detroit. The close-reading technique ensured an in-depth reading of the media text,
in this case the video game DBH. In the manner of purposeful sampling, the video
game DBH served as the primary source of data collection, with additional sources
from the extras section in the menu or other behind-the-scenes footage being added
through theoretical sampling. The recorded data derived from two separate playthroughs of the entire game on the PlayStation 4, in order to collect as much data
about both the violent and peaceful paths of the android rebellion, as well as the
machine or deviant paths. In the data-making process, the recorded data was
structured based on the 32 chapters of the game, whereby each play session
encompassed the play of full chapters, each session lasting around 25-55 minutes,
after which it was saved and transferred unto an USB-Stick. All the collected data
was analyzed from the perspective of multimodal critical discourse analysis,
assessing the primary social and power dynamics within the game. The main findings
showed that the urban social environment in DBH’s Detroit is characterized by
segregation, slavery, genocide; objectification and (sexual) liberation; abuse, crime,
junk – Ghetto Detroit; Sci-Fi Metropolis – Dream city versus Dystopia. Despite the
player’s ability to make different choices within the game, the overall city identity
remained the same, combining both a ‘dreamy’ fulfillment of current ‘real’ Detroit’s
plans and an overall liberalized society with its persistent social issues of racial
discrimination and urban/ghetto living conditions. It emerged that the concept of
“future imaginaries” in video games does not merely signify potentials. Future
imaginaries also display future projections of realistic contemporary concerns that
must be solved by the individual/player in the near future, thereby creating interactive
tales of caution and inspiration.","['media', 'creative industries', 'urban', 'social', 'detroit: become human', 'future imaginaries', 'video game']"
"Gotta Catch ‘Em All!
A case study on Pokemon Go players and their experiences with
online and offline social relations","Bellaard, Fabian",2020-06-29,['Hera T. de la'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Within the research field of game studies, an ongoing discussion is held between different
scholars and their opposing opinions and statements concerning the impact of online gaming
on gamer's sociability. This back and forth discussion on whether or not online gaming is
perceived negatively or positively concerning one's social relations is hard to determine, due
to the variety of contradictory opinions and research results. Moreover, with the launch of
Pokemon Go in 2016, possible new perspectives to the discussion of gamer's sociability have
been introduced. Due to the pervasive game structure of Pokemon Go and the incorporated
use of augmented reality, online players are encouraged to enjoy the game in a new gaming
environment. Due to pervasive gaming, online games are no longer bounded to an online
gaming environment but can be practiced in the offline 'real' world. Due to this innovative
change, the player's considered sociability has been questioned once more. Hence, the new
setting in which pervasive games are enjoyed, and the encouragement of players to go
outside, new social interactions amongst gamers has occurred in the outside offline sphere.
Therefore, this case study research on Pokemon Go focuses on how Pokemon Go players in
the Netherlands experience social relationships, both online and offline, through gameplay.
Since Pokemon Go is a pervasive game, gamers can foster both online and offline
relationships with other players. This form of online game is rather new and, therefore,
underrepresented in academic research. According to a qualitative research design, twelve
in-depth interviews were held to gain more understanding and insights into this new online
gaming player sociability. Study shows that a more in-depth variation within the concept of
gamer needs to be provided to answer the research question. Not every gamer has the same
motivation, intention, and experiences. Therefore, a broader spectrum of the concept of
gamer is given. Moreover, in Pokemon Go, online gaming has no negative impacts on
player's offline sociability. Nevertheless, it can be seen as an improvement of gamer's offline
social relationships. However, this is only applicable to players who have intrinsic
motivations and interest in enlarging their social circles.","['media', 'business', 'Pokemon Go', 'Social relationships', 'Player experiences', 'Qualitative study', 'Indepth interviews.']"
"Cross-Cultural Differences in Online Corporate Communication About Diversity
A Comparison of Companies From 15 Countries on the Way How They Communicate About
the Workforce Diversity on Corporate Websites","Bolozenko, Nastya",2020-06-29,['Hoefhuis J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","A globalization of the modern world and demographic shifts in the society have led to a
growing interest of organizations in the topic of workforce diversity. Research in the fields of
management and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reveals that managing diversity at the
workplace has the potential implications for organizational outcomes, depending on how
companies approach it. At the same time, organizations worldwide have started to
communicate about diversity issues on their corporate websites, making implicit their
motives to tackle workforce diversity. Yet, little to no advancements have been made in
terms of researching cross-country differences in the way organizations address and approach
the topic of workforce diversity and the role of a national culture in shaping the latter.
Applying a theoretical framework provided by Thomas and Ely (2001), the study
compares companies from 15 countries with the biggest economies in the world regarding the
way they report on workforce diversity on their corporate websites. Countries are compared
based on their cultural set of values, defined by Hofstede (2001) as level of individualism.
The paper employs quantitative content analysis as a research method and analyses 150
corporate websites by evidence of workforce diversity communication, type of diversity
addressed, and diversity management perspective applied by a company. The study
contributes to the underdeveloped literature on the topic of online workforce diversity
communication by revealing cultural patterns in organizational reporting on the topic. It is
then revealed that the level of individualism in the country positively correlates to evidence
of online diversity promotion. Moreover, even though for most of types of diversity reported
the association with individualism scores was not identified, the analysis showed significance
for promoting equal rights for people with any gender identity and sexual orientation, and for
those with different educational and professional backgrounds. Finally, there is a significant
relationship between diversity perspectives applied by a company and level of individualism
in the country.","['media', 'business', 'Diversity', 'Culture', 'Individualism', 'Diversity perspective', 'Online', 'communication']"
"CROSS-CULTURAL FEMINIST TECHNOLOGIES:
The Role of Feminist Values in Bringing Gender Equity to the Tech Sector in the Netherlands","Başaran, Ayşegül",2020-06-29,['Arora P.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study aims at understanding the role of feminist values in bridging the gender gap in the
technology sector in the Netherlands. Statistics show that inherent inequalities are observed in the
Dutch tech sector, namely the underrepresentation of women in the industry, the prevalence of male
dominance in senior management positions, and the gender pay gap. These structural problems in tech
contribute to the marginalization of women and other underrepresented groups in the industry and as
such create serious implications for the wider society, such as less diverse tech teams that may result in
biased technologies leading to discriminatory consequences. Hence, there is a push to diversify the
workforce to integrate feminist values into the design systems of technologies. Several initiatives have
sprung in recent years in the Netherlands to promote more women and diversity in tech and create a
more equitable tech industry, which will be referred to as #WomenInTechnology initiatives in this thesis.
This study analyzed how these initiatives construe feminism and embed such values in their missions.
For this purpose, in-depth interviews as a qualitative research method were conducted with 8
representatives of #WomenInTechnology initiatives. The results of the interviews uncovered valuable
insights into the extent of impact and approaches of feminist initiatives in the tech scene in the
Netherlands. The findings reveal the industry’s approach to diversity, the discourse of a Dutch feminism
indigenous to the cultural context of the country, and the guiding values shaping the mission of the
#WomenInTechnology initiatives. Overall, a marked shift in the tech scene has been identified with
diversity promotion increasingly becoming an area of interest to companies. To conclude, this study
contributes to the gaps in the literature on diversity and inclusion in tech and values in design.","['media', 'business', 'Diversity and inclusion', 'gender equity', 'technology', 'values in design', 'feminist values']"

A qualitative analysis of masculine representations in US fitness supplement brands’ social media
advertising","Baglin, Eva",2020-06-29,['Hermans A.M.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis addresses the ways that masculinity is represented in US fitness supplement brands’
social media advertising. Previous research has shown that advertising is a field in which social
norms are both dictated and reflected and that masculine representations in advertising are often
stereotypical. The purpose of this research is twofold: a content analysis attempts to capture the
masculine representations of two fitness supplement brands in their social media advertising and two
focus groups were conducted in order to discuss men’s perceptions with regards to the constructions
of masculinity. A qualitative thematic analysis of 150 posts from brands Dymatize and Muscle
Pharm’s Instagram pages was conducted in order to answer the research question ‘How do US
fitness supplement brands Dymatize and MusclePharm use and simultaneously shape the concept of
masculinity in their social media advertising? In order to capture men’s experiences on the subject,
a perception study was included in this research which consisted in conducting two homogeneous
focus groups with four men in each group aged 19-26 years old who expressed their views on
masculinities generally, and more specifically on fitness supplement brands’ representation of
masculinity in advertising. A thematic analysis of the focus group data aimed to answer the
subquestion ‘How do young international males perceive the marketing of fitness supplement brands
on Instagram?’ . The results of this research indicate that brands Dymatize and Muscle Pharm
generally contribute to the widely accepted stereotypical representation of masculinity in a
hypermasculine manner. Moreover, the results revealed that men often feel pressured to look and act
a certain way in Western society, however the participants observed a shift in the definition of what
it means to ‘be a man’ towards an increasingly multidimensional model.","['media', 'business', 'Masculinities', 'hegemonic masculinity', 'hypermasculine markers', 'toxic masculinity', 'consumption']"
"Het Openbaar Ministerie onder een vergrootglas van de media
Een onderzoek naar berichtgeving van het Openbaar Ministerie in Nederlandse kranten","Elabbadi, Fadoua",2020-06-29,['Ruigrok N.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De relatie tussen het Openbaar Ministerie (OM) en de media staat in deze thesis centraal. Het OM
probeert via persberichten de berichtgeving in de media te beïnvloeden om draagvlak bij het publiek te
creëren. Aan de andere kant hebben de media enerzijds de taak het publiek te informeren, maar zijn
anderzijds ook afhankelijk van het publiek, zeker in de steeds commerciëler wordende mediamarkt.
Deze relatie tussen de media en het OM is onderzocht aan de hand van de onderzoeksvraag “In
hoeverre hebben persberichten van het Openbaar Ministerie invloed op de media-agenda van
Nederlandse populaire en kwaliteitskranten en in hoeverre worden deze berichten ge(re)framed?”
Hierbij is, middels een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse, gekeken naar drie aspecten: de hoeveelheid en
de selectie van de persberichten in het nieuws, het citaatgebruik van het OM in mediaberichtgeving en
de invloed van het OM op het gekozen perspectief, oftewel (re)framing. Bij al deze aspecten zijn de
verschillen tussen populaire en kwaliteitskranten onderzocht. Uit het onderzoek komt naar voren dat
de media steeds vaker gebruikmaken van persberichten van het OM, vooral de kwaliteitskranten. Het
gaat dan voornamelijk om persberichten over gewelddadige onderwerpen. Vooral bij populaire
kranten hebben geweld, drama en sensatie de overhand, terwijl kwaliteitskranten diverser zijn wat de
gekozen persberichten betreft. Toch vinden de kranttypen de persberichten op dezelfde momenten
nieuwswaardig, zijn de citaten van het OM oververtegenwoordigd in de mediaberichtgeving en hebben
beide kranttypen een sterke voorkeur om slachtoffers en daders in de berichtgeving aan het woord te
laten. Deze overeenkomsten duiden op gelijksoortige procedures in het nieuwsselectieproces, oftewel
institutionalisme van het nieuws. Het nieuws dat het OM heeft weten aan te sturen, bevat vooral
episodische, gezag- en handhavingsframes. Ook zijn de media geneigd voornamelijk persberichten
met thematische en slachtofferframes te reframen naar episodische, gezag- en handhavingsframes.
Bovendien worden politieke frames in het nieuws op complementaire wijze gebruikt en neigen
journalisten naar stereotypering, waarbij er sprake is van associaties tussen personen met Marokkaanse
herkomst en criminaliteit.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'media', 'populaire en kwaliteitskranten', '(re)framing', 'het Openbaar Ministerie', 'criminaliteit', 'stereotypering']"
"EWOM intentions and renewable energy
A quantitative research on how social media behaviour is influenced by media portrayal, trust,
and environmental concern","Graaf, Ellis de",2020-06-29,['Prooijen A.M. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Global warming is taken more seriously now that more people start to experience the consequences of
it. Consumers are becoming aware that they can contribute to the stagnation of this rise in temperature
by changing their consuming habits. Switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy is one of the
actions consumers can take to contribute. Energy suppliers often promote themselves online, which is
also the place where consumers search for information about their products. Online messages by other
consumers and organisations are very important in this process. The individual level of environmental
concern is assumed to play a big role in the decision whether to participate in electronic word-ofmouth (eWOM) about renewable energy or not. This is also expected of the level of trust the consumer
has in the organisation. This research aims to discover more about the relationship between media
portrayal of renewable energy and the intention of consumers to participate in eWOM about this, and
its relation to trust and environmental concern.
To answer the research question, an online experiment has been conducted with a unifactorial
design with three conditions (green condition, grey condition, and a control condition). The sample
consists of 273 respondents. The results show that media portrayal did not have a direct effect on
eWOM intentions. Media portrayal does significantly influence the level of trust the respondent has in
the organisation. The green condition showed higher levels of trust than the grey condition.
Consequently, higher levels of trust lead to more positive eWOM intentions. Environmental concern
does not have a moderation effect on the relationship between media portrayal and eWOM intentions.
Furthermore, a full mediation of trust has been found in the relationship between positive/green media
portrayal and negative eWOM. Only a partial mediation of trust has been found between negative/grey
media portrayal and negative eWOM. For positive eWOM, no mediation has been found. The findings
provide insights for marketers and energy suppliers on how to create a strategy for promoting their
products, and into what happens when negative or positive messages are posted about them by a third
party. More research will be necessary to be able to fully comprehend the relationship between media
portrayal, trust, environmental concern, and eWOM.","['media', 'business', 'renewable energy', 'eWOM', 'trust', 'environmental concern', 'media portrayal']"
"The Relation between Augmented Reality and its Spatial Context
Conceptualising the defining features of AR","Feustel, Tom",2020-06-29,['Derda I.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Key decision-makers in Big Tech have raised the notion that Augmented Reality (AR), a
technology that enables the overlay of virtual elements onto the physical world, will emerge as
an integral part for the way we interact with digital information in the nearby future. A growing
body of AR research has examined in what way AR’s technological particularities have
implications for several areas of application, such as industrial, marketing, entertainment and
cultural use-cases. What did not get as much attention was AR’s second defining feature that AR,
by widely adopted definitions, is spatially embedded in three-dimensional space. Therefore, the
purpose of the present research is to address the complex relation between AR and the space in
which it is deployed. To approach the research topic an exploratory qualitative research design
was applied, which gathered qualitative data through semi-structured, in-depth expert interviews
with a heterogenous group of AR practitioners and conducted a thematic content analysis to
examine the data and derive relevant results. In the course of the study AR’s media
characteristics and the role of space for AR are conceptualised in order to examine the spatial
relation. It was found that a purposeful application of AR profits from the interdependency with
its immediate spatial environment and improves the user experience. Further, found implications
of the relations between AR and space are that certain AR media characteristics, such as
visuality and interaction, drive AR’s ability to mediate a sense of place and even allow for placemaking, which describes the social construction of place. The study concludes with the proposal
to adapt the definition of AR in a way that stronger accounts for the importance of a purposeful

How Companies Use Data to Understand Consumers","Şen, Feyza",2020-06-29,['Pridmore J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Consumers have grown accustomed to having various choices for both products and brands
hence it has become more difficult for companies to stand out among their rivals. Since only the product
offering is not adequate to acquire and retain consumers, companies try to differentiate over the
relationship they establish. Understanding the customers, their needs, motivations, preferences, and
behaviors are key to building this relationship. Once the companies know who their customers are, they
create segments by dividing them into groups which enable them to target the right customers, with the
right offering, from the right platform, at the right time. Due to the growing use of digital tools, the
amount of generated data has also been increasing. Accordingly, corporations that extract meaningful
insights from consumer data and leverage these insights as a strategic element in their business
strategies are able to gain long-term competitive advantage. However, this practice can also be seen as
surveillance and has social implications such as privacy concerns. Therefore, this research aims to
examine how consumer-facing companies in the Netherlands across different sectors gather and use
consumer data for commercial purposes.
In this research, a qualitative critical analysis of consumer data usage by companies as a
surveillance practice was carried out from a marketing perspective. In the course of this, ten in-depth
interviews with businesspeople were conducted with an average duration of around 45 minutes per
interview. These interviews were analyzed and interpreted according to the constructivist approach of
grounded theory. The findings derived from the interviews outlined four key themes that further helped
to answer the research question and sub-questions.
The first theme demonstrated that building close relationships with customers plays a critical
role in triggering engagement and retaining customers. Second key point is that considering a datadriven culture has been increasingly integrated into society and businesses, the ways companies
connect with their customers have been affected by the use of data as well. The third theme showed
that data enables companies to build detailed customer profiles and develop predictive models based
on which they implement targeting strategies to change the behaviors of their audience and create
market differentiation. However, in a sense, sharing their data also means giving away their privacy for
consumers. For this reason, the last theme further provided new perspectives on the concept of data
privacy and the regulations of data protection.","['media', 'business']"
"Climate change sceptics in the German online news
To what extent is scepticism about climate change present in German online
news websites?","Eickhoff, Milena",2020-06-29,['Verboord M.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Climate scientists agree on the existence, human cause and negative impact of
climate change. Nonetheless, there are still people who are sceptical about it and this is
reflected in the media, also in Germany, the 6th most CO2-emiting country in the world.
Currently climate change mitigation policies are urgently needed to avoid a global warming
of more than 1.5°C and media outlets play an important role in this process. They can not
only increase public attention but also provoke or undermine public action. In a time when
the internet becomes increasingly important for news consumption in Germany, there is very
little research on online news regarding climate change scepticism. Furthermore, a study
that combines climate change scepticism with an analysis of (political) actors and framing
theory is still missing. This Master Thesis analyses to what extent scepticism about climate
change is present in the German online news using a quantitative content analysis. The
sample of this thesis consists of 241 online news articles from Der Spiegel, tagesschau.de,
Bild.de and Focus Online in the period of January to December 2019.
The focus of the analysis is to investigate the general level of fundamental, attribution
and impact scepticism, the most important actors in the articles and the frames that are
being used to report about climate change. This study shows that overall scepticism about
climate change is not present in the German online news. Because previous studies
emphasize that conservative news outlets are usually the most sceptical about climate
change, this finding leads to the conclusion that especially conservative online news outlets
have become less sceptical in the past years. Nevertheless, sceptical actors are frequently
mentioned, and politically left-wing oriented news websites are more likely to mention and
criticise them. Furthermore, the framing of the climate change debate does not depend on
the political orientation but instead on the topical focus and/ or type of news outlet. For
instance, the tabloid news website Bild.de highlights conflict frames and is least likely to
mention consequences of climate change while the political quality news website Der
Spiegel is most likely to use responsibility frames and highlights consequences of climate
change in nature.
This thesis emphasizes the responsibilities that news outlets have in times of crisis,
by, for example, highlighting the scientific consensus on climate change instead of focussing
on conflicts between famous actors to increase revenue. Future research could either
qualitatively analyse how news websites report about sceptical actors or take social media
into account, as it is also increasingly used for news consumption.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Climate change', 'online news', 'framing', 'scepticism', 'Germany']"
"Identity work of Dutch
dropshipping entrepreneurs
An in-depth analysis of the identity work of dropshipping entrepreneurs within the sharing economy","Sonder, Demi",2020-06-29,['Horst S.O.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","As evidence shows, new digital affordances are changing the way we communicate with our social
environment. At the same time, the developments in this area create new opportunities for entrepreneurs by
extending and innovating already established business models within the e-commerce industry. Considering
the enormous impact of the e-commerce boom, dropshipping has become one of these new phenomena. It is
a form of entrepreneurship that has lowered the barriers to start successful entrepreneurial journeys and
therefore gained a growing interest globally and increasingly within the Netherlands. While this business
model is rather new and under-researched in general, no academic attention has been given to identity work
around dropshipping entrepreneurs. In other words, there is a paucity of studies addressing who the
entrepreneurs behind the scenes are, their entrepreneurial identities and their entrepreneurial identity work.
Furthermore, with online Dropship communities on the rise, tribal marketing might help conceptualize and
practically support new ways of value-creation of dropshipping entrepreneurs and facilitate new processes
and practices of identity work.
 In this research Dutch dropshipping entrepreneurs have been interviewed based on their experiences
with their membership of one or more Dropship communities which have been labelled as E-tribes in order
to examine its role in the entrepreneurs’ identity formation. As the relation between identity work and
dropshipping has not been made before, this thesis aims to offer a contextualized understanding of young
adults’ entrepreneurial identity formation and identity work within the e-commerce industry. The research
question in this Master thesis has been formulated as: “How do Dutch dropshipping entrepreneurs develop
their entrepreneurial identity through identity work in their start-up communities?” In order to answer this
research question, an in-depth literature review was complemented with qualitative empirical research in the
field.. To gather empirical data, dropshipping entrepreneurs were selected through both snowball- as well as
purposive sampling techniques. The emphasis was on the exploration and interpretations of experiences and
perceptions of a like-minded group of individuals, allowing for an in-depth understanding of the topic under
study.
 Through a thematic analysis of interview data with Dutch dropshipping entrepreneurs, I discovered
four themes which summarize different aspects of entrepreneurial identity work. These themes have been
labelled as; The Self as a marketing tool, entrepreneurial identity struggles, a collective identity and the
entrepreneurial spirit. These results imply that Dropship communities have a great impact on the identity
formation of its entrepreneurs, which smartly make use of current technological affordances. Furthermore, it
appears that the discourse around the “sharing economy” is a profound base of all developments. Ultimately,
the research shows that it creates impactful pillars that support the entrepreneurs’ identity formation through
sensitizing them to unique opportunities for building social capital, networking, self-development,
entrepreneurial identity formation and the shared creation of a collective identity","['media', 'business', 'Identity work', 'entrepreneurial identity', 'e-commerce', 'dropshipping', 'sharing economy', 'tribal', 'marketing', 'E-tribes']"
"New Media Advertising Exposure: A Poisoned Apple?
An Empirical Study on The Effects of Social Media Advertising on Life Satisfaction in
Adolescents","Starre, Manon van der",2020-06-29,['Opree S.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Nowadays, the second most common thing for adolescents to do, apart from sleeping, is devouring media
content, which shows an exorbitant quantity of advertising. This is very worrisome, as adolescents are very
vulnerable due to them transitioning through a turbulent time in life, and previous research has shown that
traditional media advertising has, among other things, detrimental effects on self-esteem, body image, objectified
body consciousness and life satisfaction. The occurrence of these effects is explained by the social comparison
theory, the cultivation theory, and the body-objectification theory. There is reason to believe that these effects
are also caused by new media advertising, which in this research was narrowed down to social media platforms
with advertising. Moreover, effects might even be stronger due to the penetration of such media in normal life
and the emphasize on visuals, editing options, and like buttons. However, to date there is scarce research
investigating this issue. Therefore, the first research question in this research was: ‘What are the effects of social
media advertising exposure on adolescents’ self-esteem, body image, objectified body consciousness, and life
satisfaction?’. Furthermore, this research investigated whether new media advertising literacy buffered the
effects of social media advertising, as previous research showed advertising literacy can be used as a cognitive
defence against negative advertising effects. Therefore, the second research question was: ‘Does social media
advertising literacy mitigate unintended advertising effects in adolescents?’ The research questions were
answered with a quantitative research method, namely a self-report survey. This self-report survey was sent to
parents of a high school in the Netherlands and posted in a KLM Crew Facebook page, which resulted in 159
valid responses from adolescents between 16 and 18 years old. Subsequently, (hierarchical) multiple regression
analyses were used to analyse the results. Results showed that social media advertising, measured by social
media exposure, only significantly predicted objectified body consciousness, while self-esteem, body image, and
life satisfaction were not significantly affected. Furthermore, new media advertising literacy only moderated the
effects on self-esteem significantly, and not the effects on body image, objectified body consciousness and life
satisfaction. However, the significant effect was not as expected, considering that new media literacy functioned
as a buffer under low social media exposure circumstances, and as a catalyst under high social media exposure
circumstances. In conclusion, the detrimental effect of social media advertising was small and only present with
objectified body consciousness. Therefore, this research provides no ground for concerns relating to unintended
new media advertising effects. However, what is worrisome is the exponential amount of use of (social) media,
which was once again confirmed in this research, as this could lead to severe negative psychological
consequences. Hence, it is important to start regulating or mediating the amount of media use of adolescents.
Similarly, new media advertising literacy, as measured in this study, is an ineffective buffer for negative
advertising effects. All in all, learnings from this research could be implemented in other forms of media, in
order to diminish detrimental negative unintended advertising effects of such media as well.","['media', 'business', 'Adolescents', 'Social media advertising', 'Unintended advertising effects', 'Life', 'satisfaction', 'Advertising literacy']"
"To what extent does the consumption of National and International Media relate to the
development of National, Foreign and Global Identities and how is the development
affected by Intercultural Competence?","Teschner, Rebecca",2020-06-29,['Hofhuis J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Cross-cultural research has already widely identified various factors that flow into
the development of national cultural identities. Media have thus been continuously
identified as one crucial factor that can shape cultural ingroup identities. This means that
media are considered as one main driver for cultural transfer which do influence national
cultural ingroup sentiments. In short, media consumption can shape national cultural
identities. This was already widely confirmed among individuals who do live in their
national home culture and among immigrants who adapt to their new home national
culture. In short, when individuals consume media from their home national culture
(National Media Consumption), they also identify stronger with their home national culture
which is referred to the concept of National Identity. This was also approved among
immigrants who identify easier to their new home national culture when they consume
their new home national cultures’ media. Predominant research has, however, not gone
beyond the provided scope as given thesis aimed to fill a crucial gap. Past research has only
measured such relations among individuals that are physically surrounded by the national
culture the media content also originates from, implying that the social cultural context was
always given next to the media consumption. The conducted study thus set a focus on
another target group as the investigated sample lived in their home national culture but still
practiced International Media Consumption. In addition, the study identified various types
of International Media Consumption in order to measure the impact on identity more
accordingly. The concept of International Media Consumption was thus split into Foreign
as well as Global Media Consumption since different outcomes and personal dimensions
were expected that indicate different consumption motives. Based on this, one main goal
was consequently to measure Foreign Identity adaptation when Foreign Media
Consumption is practiced. Another crucial goal was to confirm that Global Identities
positively relate to Global Media Consumption. Given hypotheses thus implied that
ingroup identification with a distinctive national culture or superordinate ingroups was
possible by solely consuming international media content. The cultural social environment
was therefore eliminated. Moreover, the concept of Intercultural Competence was also
applied in order to measure its impact on expected relations. In short, the conducted study
aimed to prove that the cultural impact of media is strong enough to relate positively to
such identity outcomes, indicating that a social environment is not needed to adapt an
ingroup identity while also measuring the impact of Intercultural Competence. The
following research question emerged from these revelations:
To what extent does the consumption of National and International Media relate to
the development of National, Foreign and Global Identities and how is the development
affected by Intercultural Competence?
A self-administered online survey was applied in order to reach all research goals.
The results revealed that a positive relation between media consumption and identity
ingroup sentiments were only existent when the individual was socially embedded in the
corresponding environment. It could consequently be concluded that the cultural influence
of media is not relating to the adaption of national cultural or superordinate identities when
the social context is not provided.","['media', 'business', 'National Media Consumption', 'National Identity', 'International Media', 'Consumption', 'Foreign Media Consumption', 'Global Media Consumption', 'Foreign Identity', 'Global Identity', 'Intercultural Competence']"
"Enchanted since childhood:
Place attachment and the role of online media in the relationship between
Efteling and fans","Staak, Julia van der",2020-06-29,['Mc Carthy W.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The theme park industry has seen a large increase in attendance and revenue in the past few
decades, yet research on this topic has remained limited to the various Disneyland and Universal
parks across the world (Williams, 2020). Efteling belongs to the top three theme parks in annual
attendance in Europe, yet almost no research has been done in relation to this park that opened in
1952 in the Netherlands. As both the theme park and the online social media industries have grown
rapidly, the role of fans, visitors, and park management is examined within this recent concomitant
phenomenon. Therefore, the aim of this research is to find out how social media platforms have
changed the perception and behavior of fans and visitors towards Efteling.
The focus of this research has therefore been twofold. First is the concept of place
attachment in relation to fans of Efteling, which was researched according to the framework of place
attachment (Manzo & Perkins, 2006) within the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions.
Second is how fans of Efteling have utilized social media in relation to the park and how this use has
changed the relationship between the fans and management. A mixed-method approach with an
emphasis on the qualitative using grounded theory was used by conducting eight in-depth interviews
with fan group moderators and employees of Efteling management, distributing an online survey
amongst Efteling fans, and engaging in participant observation of a fan event in Efteling.
By analysing the findings according to the three dimensions of place attachment by Manzo
and Perkins (2006), it was evident that fans of Efteling are attached to the theme park on cognitive,
affective and behavioural levels. Efteling fans were found to be both dedicated and critical from
often visiting the park that first started at a young age. The themed environment in the special
Efteling style was deemed a critical element in the attachment to the park. The fan community online
and in the park is sub-divided into smaller well-acquainted groups. Online social media platforms
were used by Efteling fans to form communities and inform and be informed regarding Efteling and
the theme park world in general. Mostly the platforms were used to share a passion for Efteling with
like-minded fans. The use of social media has also created a two-way relationship between fans and
Efteling management, who regarded fan group moderators as ambassadors for the theme park with
whom to collaborate and grant special opportunities. Thus, both the perception and behavior of fans
towards Efteling have changed a great deal in recent years due to social media, resulting in a more
open and inclusive mind-set by management regarding fans and how they can contribute to the theme
park.","['media', 'business', 'Efteling', 'fandom', 'place attachment', 'social media', 'theme parks']"
"The risks of online dating: an explorative study of the perceived risks of Tinder
use","Stoilova, Deliya",2020-06-29,['Tenbult P.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The world in the 21st century is becoming more fast-paced and increasingly digitized. This
digitalization can be understood as a separate plane of existence, an extension to the physical world, where
almost all its aspects are reflected and transformed. Romance is no exception, with online dating fast
becoming a standard way of meeting new people and engaging in romantic relations and Tinder being its
prime example, as it is the first mobile dating application, as opposed to a dating website. Yet, despite the
growing number of Tinder users, stigma still persists with non-users continually appraising online dating
as something outlandish or even dangerous. Objectively, Tinder interactions are not without risks, however
traditional dating is not exempt of risks either. The risks associated with Tinder have only vaguely been
academically explored, unsurprisingly so as literature on the topic of Tinder is presently limited. This
presents researchers with the opportunity to expand upon the possible knowledge and to contribute to the
understanding of this phenomenon.
In order to fulfil this need for more in-depth investigations, this study set an objective of
measuring the effect gender and sexual orientation have on the risk perception of Tinder risks. Thus, by
employing a quantitative approach, an experiment was conducted with a sample of 126 participants, all of
which had shared their experiences with the mobile application through an anonymous online survey. The
data obtained was used to conduct a set of tests to determine the predictive power of gender and sexual
orientation. The findings did not discern gender and sexual orientation as the most significant predictors of
risk perception, with three out of the four hypotheses tested within the study being rejected. A significant
link was only found between gender and risk perception of inappropriate interactions (overtly sexual
messages, unwanted advances, and aggression). These findings contribute to the understanding of risk as
an individual-centric and complex topic, one deserving further exploration. Additionally, the results
prompt reflection on whether gender and sexual orientation truly do play such an integral role in human
perception and behavior, a topic that deserves more extensive exploration both within and without online
dating.","['media', 'business', 'Tinder', 'online dating', 'gender', 'sexual orientation', 'perceived risks']"
"Data Breach Crisis
The impact of crisis type, pre-crisis reputation, and crisis response strategy on
perception on organizations","Vollebregt, Charlotte",2020-06-29,['Wang Y.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Due to the rise of the Internet, the automatic collection of information of online users
and transformation into extensive data collections keeps on expanding. The threat for
online users is that these data gathering practices of organizations could result in the
occurrence of a data breach crisis. For organizations situated in a data breach crisis, it
is challenging to manage stakeholders' perceptions and engagement in secondary crisis
communications. The issue of data breach crisis is a relatively new topic, which makes
it relevant to explore this with an audience-centered focus since little research has been
done on this context. This study was conducted using three data breach crisis types
(intentional and internal crisis vs. unintentional and internal crisis vs. intentional and
external crisis), two crisis response strategies (denial vs. no response) and a different
pre-crisis reputation (high vs. low). These factors, in combination with two stakeholder
emotions, namely anger and sympathy, and individual privacy concerns, were
connected to the perception on organizations. Also, emotion and individual privacy
concerns were connected to secondary crisis communication. In this way, the results of
this study provide a broad understanding of which factors are essential for organizations
to keep in mind to control stakeholders’ perceptions and the resulting secondary crisis
communications. The following research questions were conducted: “How do crisis type
(intentional and internal vs. unintentional and internal vs. intentional and external), crisis
response strategy (denial vs. no response) and pre-crisis reputation (high vs. low) affect
the perception on organizations after a data breach crisis?” and “What are the roles of
emotion and individual privacy concerns on the perception on organizations and
secondary crisis communication?”. An experiment design was developed by using the
online tool ‘Qualtrics’ to answer the research questions. The online experiment was
implemented by using a 3 X 2 X 2 factorial between-subject design for a total of twelve 
conditions. A convenience sampling method was distributed by using the online tool
‘Amazon Mechanical Turk’. After cleaning the data, 563 participants were included in
the final dataset. The results showed a significant impact of the difference of an
intentional and internal data breach crisis and an intentional and external data breach
crisis, the difference between high and low pre-crisis reputation, and intensity of
emotion on the perception on organizations. Also, the intensity of emotion and individual
privacy concerns had a significant impact on secondary crisis communication. When an
organization has to deal with managing a data breach crisis, the results indicate that the
most important aspects to keep in mind are the internal or external occurrence of the
crisis, the reputation of the organization before the crisis, stakeholders’ emotions
towards the organization, and individual privacy concerns. More extensive research on
this field is required for both marketers and scholars to develop a deeper understanding
of the impact of data breach crisis on stakeholders.","['media', 'business', 'data breach crisis', 'crisis response strategy', 'pre-crisis reputation', 'privacy', 'concern', 'secondary crisis communication']"
"The Representation of Mental Illness in Contemporary Film
Thematic content analysis of fictional and based-on-a-true-story films","Vesere, Anete",2020-06-29,['Antunes D.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","At the core of this research paper was the aim to explore the representation of mental illness
in contemporary film. The research placed focus upon examining whether these portrayals are still
largely negative or whether there is a general trend towards representing mental illness in a more
humanizing and empathizing manner. Additionally, the study attempted to determine whether mental
illness was represented differently within based on a true story and fictional films. A total of four films
in English that were released between 2008 and 2020 were selected as a part of the sample – two
fictional and two based on a true story films about individuals with a mental illness.
Previous findings suggest that overall, the portrayal of mental illness within film is largely
negative and therefore contributes to the persistence of a vast majority of stereotypes and stigmas
surrounding mental illness. Since media, especially films, are one of the primary sources of knowledge
about mental illness for individuals who have never had direct contact with someone who has a
mental illness, it is crucial that these portrayals within film do not continuously foster negative
stereotypes. Moreover, according to the disability rhetoric, an individual should never be defined
solely through his/her medical diagnosis, but rather through who this individual is as a person beyond
the diagnosis. Therefore, through qualitative content and thematic analysis, this research explores
the encoding process of contemporary films and provides an insight into what elements are most used
when portraying mental illness.
A total of four themes emerged throughout the analysis process – (1) Stereotypical
representation, (2) Overcoming adversity, (3) Personal experiences of the individual with mental
illness and (4) Separating the individual from the diagnosis. The findings of the research show that
even though the representation of mental illness within contemporary film is still largely dominated
by negative and inaccurate portrayals, there is a general trend towards depicting mental illness in a
more accurate manner, specifically, within fictional films. Moreover, the findings suggest that there
were in fact some challenging representations and two out of the four films depicted a conflict
between two opposing ways of perceiving mental illness – social and medical model of disability.
Lastly, even though the films analysed include a lot of negative stereotypes, they also try to represent
the individuals beyond their mental illness.","['media', 'creative industries', 'mental illness', 'representation theory', 'contemporary film', 'disability rhetoric']"

A study of possibilities of facilitating ongoing advertising campaigns in direct
partnerships between brands and digital production companies","Urychová, Charlene",2020-06-29,['Leendertse M.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the current world, many spheres of life are constantly changing. It can be agreed upon that
big portion of changes is caused by innovation and digitalization. In the field of marketing and
advertising, any innovation plays significant role and digitalization changed the industry enormously.
Ongoing developments brought shift from occasional to continuous communication, from traditional
platforms to new media and new channels, from automated or even random communication to highly
personalized one. Ongoing advertising campaigns currently seem to be the main way of commercial
communication, and therefore they are paid rich attention to. With their emergence and shift in need
of design, production and performance also comes a need for new, more efficient ways of production
of such campaigns. It has been suggested that such production could be achieved by implementing
theoretical findings and new business model, however it has not been attempted yet. We aimed to
change that with our research, by collecting data relevant for the topic from industry experts. The
results derived from our research provide insights into direct collaboration between brands and digital

"Venezuela onder vuur
Een multi-methodologisch onderzoek naar de berichtgeving
over Venezuela in twee mediaystemen","Verstegen, Stan",2020-06-29,['Huiberts E.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Dankzij het bewind van president Nicolás Maduro en zijn voorgang Hugo Chavéz is
Venezuela uitgegroeid tot een dictatoriale staat. In de zomer van 2017 loosde Maduro een
controversiële grondwet door het parlement waarmee hij de oppositie buitenspel kon zetten.
Verder sprak Amnesty International van een humanitaire crisis in het land vanwege een
zware economische crisis en het tekort aan voedsel, medicijnen en goederen. Het gevolg is
dat de laatste jaren miljoenen Venezolanen het land zijn ontvlucht. Sinds de start van de
crisis is een politieke machtsstrijd gaande tussen de huidige regering en de oppositie. Deze
strijd kwam begin 2019 tot een hoogtepunt toen oppositieleider Juan Guaidó openlijk de
aanval begon tegen Maduro. Ook eisten buitenlandse regeringen dat Maduro zou
opstappen. De gebeurtenissen in de zomer van 2017 en begin 2019 zorgden ervoor dat
Nederlandse en Amerikaanse kwaliteitskranten relatief veel aandacht besteedden aan
Venezuela in vergelijking met andere periodes. Normaliter is buitenlandberichtgeving een
nieuwscategorie die weinig aandacht krijgt van media, omdat het economisch gezien niet
interessant wordt bevonden. Een kwalitatieve thematische inhoudsanalyse heeft aangetoond
dat de gebeurtenissen in de zomer van 2017 en begin 2019 dermate nieuwswaardig werden
geacht, dat hier wel aandacht aan besteed moest worden. Met behulp van de theorieën over
nieuwswaarden en agenda-setting bleek dat Nederlandse en Amerikaanse kwaliteitskranten
de thema’s power elite, politiek beleid, tweestrijd en slecht nieuws hanteerden om over te
gaan tot berichtgeving. Naast het agenderen van de gebeurtenissen in Venezuela, is aan de
hand van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse gebleken dat Nederlandse en Amerikaanse
kwaliteitskranten in de periode 2015 tot en met 2020 het conflict in Venezuela hebben
geframed. Hierbij hebben zij het vaakst het conflict frame toegepast, gevolgd door het
economic consequences frame, het anti-government frame, het human interest frame en het
violence frame. Daarbij is op het anti-government frame na geen significant verschil ontdekt
in het gebruik van de frames tussen Nederlandse en Amerikaanse kwaliteitskranten. Ook
geldt dat zowel Nederlandse als Amerika vaker een episodische focus in hun berichtgeving
hanteerden in plaats van een thematische focus. Vanuit de literatuur is bekend dat
Nederlandse en Amerikaanse media van elkaar verschillen, maar in dit onderzoek was hier
geen sprake van. Zowel de thema’s als de manier waarop Nederlandse en Amerikaanse
kwaliteitskranten Venezuela hebben getypeerd, kwam overeen. Daarmee gaat de theorie
over mediasystemen voor dit onderwerp niet op en kan gesteld worden dat het Nederlandse
en Amerikaanse medialandschap meer op elkaar zijn gaan lijken.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Venezuela', 'mediasystemen', 'nieuwswaarden', 'framing', 'Nederlandse en', 'Amerikaanse kwaliteitskranten']"
"How Brands Become Activists
A critical analysis of Brand Activism","Vink, Noah",2020-06-29,['Scalvini M.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Consumer behaviors are shaped by a desire to express and support political and
ethical perspectives. Therefore, brand advertising communication increasingly employs
strategies that include social and political values. However, not only are they communicating
social and political values, brands also voluntarily take a stance on what they think is good
for society. This increasingly popular corporate strategy has been defined as brand activism.
Through brand activism, values that are traditionally linked to social movements and are
initially discussed in political or private conversations, enter the advertising sphere.
Therefore, this strategy can be considered as ethically problematic: is it ethically 'right' to
cover profit-raising goals with presenting social and political values connected to social
activist aims?
Numerous critical studies have examined on micro-level how advertising mass
communication ""persuade"" and ""manipulate"" consumers. Since brand ctivism is an
emerging research field, the specific occurring advertising phenomenon has not been
approached extensively critically by academics yet. This research aims to assess brand
activism critically as a persuasive advertising strategy that creates political and social
meaning by communicating political and social values and taking a stance.
The main research question reads: how do brands claim discourses of social activism
and sets of moral values embedded in their visual video communication? A qualitative,
critical discourse analysis is sufficient for answering the main research question. Critical
discourse analysis is the appropriate method for this study since CDA typically analyses texts
and visuals and exposes strategies that appear neutral initially, but which may actually seek
to shape representation of events and persons with a particular goal.
Since this study concerns the in-depth study of brand activism, data selection had to
match the predefined profile of brand activism in advertising. Furthermore, this study
selected its data from the winner list of the Cannes Lions International Festival Creativity.
This decision ensures a certain level of quality and professionalism of the selected data.
During the analysis, the legitimization framework of Van Leeuwen (2007) was an assisting
framework to identify discursive strategies that legitimize the claim on social activist
discourses and sets of moral values.
The findings of this study present that brands claim activist discourses and sets of
moral values by multiple discursive strategies: inclusion of third parties (The Media, The
Famous and the Experts), by actually undertaking action with focus on specific outcomes, by
creating a ‘Us’ vs. ‘Them’ framework through moral evaluation and by four different brand
activist narratives (‘Frontline Activist’, ‘Collaborator’, ‘Whistleblower’, ‘Hidden Activist’). The
implications of these findings outline a brand activist discourse in which brands are not
mentioning commercial activity. Brand are above all concerned about the activist brand
image and undertaking action, which can be interpreted as misleading.","['media', 'business', 'Brand activism', 'advertising', 'cause marketing', 'advertising', 'legitimization']"
"More Than Just Music: Uses and Gratifications of
NetEase Cloud Music Among EDM Fans in China","Zheng, Meishan",2020-06-29,['Hoeven A. van der'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Over the past few years, the music industry in China has been witnessing
two major shifts: whilst the prevalence of music streaming services are taking music
digitalization and mobilization to another level, the rise in popularity of EDM
(electronic dance music) is another striking phenomenon. More specifically, the genre
not only has been appearing frequently on the domestic music charts, a good number
of renowned EDM festivals and artists have also been participating actively in the
flourishing EDM event scene across urban China. It is noteworthy here that the online
EDM streaming in China is often associated with NetEase Cloud Music (NCM) – a
music streaming platform that provides abundant EDM-related services, and NCM is
often seen as a hub for EDM lovers and artists to interact. To find out the reasons
behind this phenomenon, this thesis explores the uses and gratification of NetEase
Cloud Music among EDM lovers in China. Situated at the theoretical intersection of
uses and gratifications research, music streaming studies and EDM studies, this
research fills the knowledge gap of existing studies by presenting great insights into
the uses and gratifications of one of the biggest music streaming services in China and
sheds a light on the ever-growing domestic EDM market. By conducting 12 semistructured interviews with users located in 9 different cities, this qualitative study
evaluates the factors including the usage, the motivation of use, the perception of the
role NCM plays in the domestic EDM market, etc. Evidence is found in this study that
users can derive satisfaction from the convenience utilities, which encompass the
user-friendly layout, gigantic music library, multi-functionality and easy music
discovery. Besides, the social features of the platform also play crucial roles in terms
of user gratification, as they enable users to express their opinions on music by
sharing the music to other social media platforms (mostly WeChat), commenting and
instant messaging. On top of that, the NCM’s annual music report custom-made for
its users is highly appreciated by the majority of the respondents, as it is more detailed
compared to other music streaming services. Moreover, NCM is also being used as a
platform where users can learn more about music genres, the background of music
and music production techniques. Another noteworthy outcome is that the actions of
downloading music, arranging digital collections and consuming copyrighted music
can create and increase the sense of digital music ownership, hence generating greater
user satisfaction. NCM is also being used by musicians to publish and promote their
own music, while monetary rewards can be acquired from the platform. Furthermore,
the platform is being perceived as a trend-setter and a gatekeeper in the domestic
EDM market in China, exerting a great impact on the EDM trends. However, some
respondents claimed that the influential role of NCM can lead to the formation of an
imbalanced market – as it is more likely for NCM to promote renowned musicians or
sponsored music, some talented artists that are unknown in China might be neglected.
Furthermore, NCM also fosters EDM talent by hosting dance music competitions.
Finally, based on the information gathered during the interviews, the EDM label
owned by NCM also provides EDM production classes online and offline, which
proves that NCM is dedicated to becoming the leading figure in the market.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Music streaming service', 'uses and gratification', 'EDM', 'Chinese music', 'market', 'NetEase Cloud Music']"
"Pedofiele priesters en ander gespuis op het witte doek
Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar het misbruik binnen de katholieke kerk in films","Wolgen, Timme",2020-06-29,['Kester B.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Waar er vroeger nog veel films verschenen die het geloof op een filosofische manier benaderden, is
dat tegenwoordig wel anders. Nu lijkt de focus vooral te liggen op problemen die wereldreligies met
zich meebrengen. Dit soort films kunnen weer bijdragen aan de maatschappelijke discussie,
aangezien sociale bewegingen vaak ruimte voor debat willen creëren over dingen die zij belangrijk
vinden en film daar een goede vorm voor is. In dit kwalitatieve inhoudsonderzoek is daarom gekeken
naar hoe het misbruik binnen de katholieke kerk en daders en slachtoffers zijn geportretteerd in
films van diverse nationale herkomst. Dat is gedaan aan de hand van een thematische analyse. Om
de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden zijn vijf films geanalyseerd en daaruit kwamen vier thema’s
naar voren. Allereerst bleek dat de kerk een grote rol speelt. Het geloof staat centraal in het leven
van de personages en hier wordt dan ook naar geleefd en gestraft. Verder heeft de kerk veel macht:
zelfs in een film-in-een-film wordt hier rekening mee gehouden. In het thema kerkelijk misbruik komt
de dader (bijna altijd een priester) naar voren, die vaak wordt gezien als vaderfiguur. Door
vertrouwen te winnen worden slachtoffers gemanipuleerd en vindt er misbruik plaats, waar
verschillende motieven aan ten grondslag liggen. Het misbruik is echter niet alleen seksueel: ook
lichamelijk en geestelijk worden slachtoffers misbruikt – van geslagen worden met een riem tot
onophoudelijk pesten. Het misbruik heeft dan ook veel sporen nagelaten bij slachtoffers. Zij hebben
hier jaren later soms nog steeds last, met soms zelfs verslavingen en zelfmoordpogingen tot gevolg.
Desondanks gaan ze niet bij de pakken neerzitten en ondernemen slachtoffers actie. Door zich te
verenigen en media-aandacht te creëren, hopen zij ruchtbaarheid aan hun zaken te geven. Dat is
nodig ook, want het laatste thema laat zien dat de katholieke kerk veelal binnenshuis straft. Priesters
worden naar andere parochies gestuurd – waar het misbruik weer van voren af aan begint – of er
worden schikkingen getroffen met slachtoffers. In het uiterste geval verbreekt de kerk de banden
met een priester en moet deze voor straf naar een opvanghuis in Zuid-Amerika om daar over zijn
zonden na te denken. De reden dat priesters vaak niet via de juridische weg worden aangeklaagd, ligt
aan het gegeven dat veel zaken zijn verjaard. Slachtoffers klappen vaak pas jaren later uit de school
en dan kan er niks meer ondernomen worden. Vandaar dat hun blik niet alleen op het aanpakken
van individuele priesters wordt gericht, maar op het aanpakken van het hele instituut.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Misbruik', 'Katholieke Kerk', 'Films', 'Representatie', 'Schandalen']"
"Moralizing narratives is the new branding
How moral discourses can be translated to and establish common-sense values via
contemporary advertising","Winter, Joyceline",2020-06-29,['Scalvini M.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The increasing importance in the language of advertising and marketing are facing morality
issues. Brands are moving from being exclusive as a marketing strategy to being inclusive, building
and communicating their brand image for every human being. The shift of advertising companies
increasingly offering its narratives as a form of moral guidance is trending, and the moral
characteristics and interplay of advertising and how these moral lessons can be translated and
communicated to consumers in the best way is a new field of research. Different streams of literature
have been investigated for this research, each conceptualizing consumer morality, moral advertising,
ethical consumption and inclusivity in another way. Some relevant clarifications about moral
courage, narrative ethics, moral rationalization and ethical consumption were given and the concepts
of inclusivity and diversity, the trend of inclusive marketing, how inclusivity is communicated and
the trend of changemaking were discussed. The goal of this research was to create a system of
interpretation of moral evaluation to discover how moral discourses can be translated to and establish
common-sense values and mass loyalty at the same time. How ideologies are represented were
examined within specific examples from contemporary advertising, in order to determine how the
system of moral evaluation supports the moralistic shift in advertising and provide a valuable answer
to the research question. By combining semiotics and thematic analysis research methods, and
making use of an interdisciplinary theoretical approach, this thesis empirically investigates how
instances of consumer morality are articulated through discursive practices. Semiotic complemented
the visual thematic analysis of the complete data set of video advertisements, which consisted of fifty
YouTube videos of different brands from different industries. The findings indicate the
communication of inclusivity plays a big role in the overall brand attitude and ethical consumption,
and how brands can connect consumers to and make them aware of the notion of a specific moral
issue. Furthermore, the potential power of moral imagination to enable companies to act ethically in
society, and be able to be both ethical and successful by visualizing alternatives, was confirmed. This
research underlines a new tendency in contemporary advertising, as it seems that there is currently a
notable shift happening toward portraying more realistic perceptions of human beings. Lastly, this
research provides additional evidence of the existence of issues and ambiguity regarding inclusivity,
and enhances understanding of the inclusive advertising trend in response to global moral issues.","['media', 'business', 'moral advertising', 'ethical consumption', 'inclusivity', 'changemaking', 'visual analysis']"
"We need to go deeper:
A visual analysis on how the personal care industry uses sex and sex appeals in advertising
between 2010 – 2019 to attract its audience","Vũ, Khoi",2020-06-29,['Antunes D.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","A question often posed by consumers and marketers is whether sex actually sells in advertising. Sex
appeals have long been used in advertisements, with the personal care industry being one of the
markets that use in the most when trying to attract their audiences. Personal care brands such as
Nivea, Tom Ford, Chanel and Gillette often use sexual appeals to attract its audience. Whether it sells
may no longer be a question, instead it is important to understand how sexual appeals and sex are used
to attract audiences when advertising personal care products especially in this day and age. Moreover,
it is also important to look at how the sex appeals differ in terms of appealing to women and men, as
well as how consumers are then encouraged to buy products of the brands. There has been a shift in
society when it comes to gender ideologies and sex. Therefore, it is important to look at what this shift
in society meant for the personal care advertisements. Through qualitative research in form of a visual
analysis, combined with Burke’s identification, 80 personal care video advertisements between 2010
and 2019 were analyzed. Four main themes were found in regard to personal care brands using sex
appeals and sex in order to attract its audience: overt sexual behaviour, consisting of the themes:
emphasis on the body, explicit displays of sex, sexual desirability and single lifestyle. Second, the
theme of socially acceptable displays of sex, amounting to the themes: the use of humour sexually
suggestive behaviour, reflecting desires and relationship. The third theme was traditional persona’s,
consisting of: masculine behaviour and submissive partner to men. The last theme that derived from
the analysis was that of progressive persona’s, containing the themes: boy-next-door and female
empowerment. The research offers the view that advertisements of their personal care industry have
tried different strategies when using sexual appeals in order to attract its audience. By promoting
identification, advertisements are able to find creative ways to appeal to their audience using sex
appeals. The personal care industry has to mediate its sexual imagery in order to attract audiences who
are attracted by explicit displays of sex, as well as those who are not. Moreover, a variety of different
types of gender role displays were found within the advertisements, which match up with the way
contemporary society views the gender roles of men and women nowadays.","['media', 'business', 'identification', 'sexual appeals', 'gender roles', 'advertising', 'personal care']"
"The role of digital media consumption in
sojourners’ identification and adaptation
abroad","Walhof, Ditte",2020-06-29,['Hofhuis J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The global sojourner population is continuously growing. Previously, this population has been the
focus of primarily adaptation research. However, this body of research leaves many gaps, such as
sojourner identity on a larger scale, and the influence of modern traditional media, being consumed
online. The current thesis aims to explore the relationships between digital media consumption,
different types of identities and adaptation, explored through the following research question: To what
extent does the consumption of digital media affect sojourners’ identities and their psychological and
sociocultural adaptation?
To answer the research question, a survey was distributed online. The gathered data showed
that strong home identities resulted in less psychological adaptation, while strong host identities lead
to more psychological adaptation as well as sociocultural adaptation. Moreover, increased
consumption of digital media from one’s home country encouraged stronger home identification,
international identification, and IWAH. More specifically, the consumption of host entertainment and
news media showed a positive relationship with increasing home identification. Moreover, more
media consumption from one’s host country found an increase in host identification and international
identity. Again, host entertainment and news media consumption specifically were found to correlate
positively to host identification. Meanwhile, host news consumption found a positive relationship with
sojourners’ international identity. Lastly, consuming more global media lead to stronger international
identities and IWAH for sojourners, where global entertainment media consumption showed a positive
relationship with international identity.
The present research contributes to the existing body of literature in various ways. Firstly, it
helps expand the current knowledge regarding two newer identity types: international identity and
IWAH. Moreover, it fills in a research gap regarding media and sojourners, which has previously
disregarded digital media consumption while not focusing on social media. This exploration paves the
way for future research to expand on. contribution Suggestions for future research are proposed,
including an alternative way to measure sojourners’ connection to countries and cultures through
media consumption.","['media', 'business', 'sojourner', 'digital media', 'identity', 'IWAH', 'adaptation']"
"Come Play Along!
An Exploration of How Advertisers are Using Playful Strategies in Print Advertising","Karels, Alysa",2020-06-29,['Hera T. de la'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The fact that people are increasingly eager to seek out playful experiences in their everyday lives is
part of a trend known as the ludification of culture. Scholars find that, in a time characterized by
information overload, consumers are open and drawn to media products that offer entertainment
through playful interaction. Meanwhile, the advertising industry is faced with the quandary of how
to stand out and attract consumers’ fleeting attention in a landscape that has become highly
competitive. Print advertising in particular faces a budget decline and has to compete with digital
advertising forms that know richer affordances to appeal to consumers’ attention. For this reason,
this thesis questions the strategies that print advertising is using in order to stand out from the
crowd and appease the demand to provide entertaining playful interaction for consumers. The
research problem lies in the intersection of the ludification of culture trend and the advertising
industry’s competitive attention economy: research on purely playful forms of communication and
the declining print advertising sector has been minimal. To this end, this bachelor thesis tackles the
following research question: How do advertisers make use of playful communication strategies in
print advertisements to stand out in the contemporary attention economy? To gain a
comprehensive answer to this research question a qualitative approach was taken. First, a review of
applicable research was conducted to ground the study in a theoretical framework of existing
concepts and principles related to play and playfulness. Next, methodological choices were made
that deemed a textual analysis of print advertisements the ideal method for studying the research
question. Using thematic analysis, the units of analysis were analyzed through multiple rounds of
coding that eventually resulted in the emergence of four central themes of playful strategies. The
main findings of this research are that advertisers are able to stand out by ensuring retention
through strategies of pleasurable interactive experiential logic. This is facilitated by the finding that
advertisers are able to stand out by harnessing attention through strategies of playful visual design
that instills a playful mindset. They furthermore stand out by liberating unspoken topics of a dark,
solemn and negative nature in a playful way. And lastly, advertisers are able to stand out by using
playful communication strategies with an adequate awareness of the playful risks involved. The
conclusions and implications drawn from these findings are impactful theoretically and practically.
Regarding the former, contributions to an understanding of interactivity and to negative pleasurable
experiences are made, and a need for further inquiry in playification is identified and encouraged.
Regarding the latter, the benefit for advertisers to use playful print advertising strategies in their
marketing mix is explained and ethical concerns regarding the persuasion of the strategies are
expressed. The thesis closes by pointing out directions for future research.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Playful advertising', 'Print advertising', 'Playful communication', 'Playification', 'Thematic', 'analysis']"
"Positioning the Online Musician
The Development of Self-Identities of Dutch Musicians on Social Media","Wijs, Romy de",2020-06-29,['Horst S.O.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Social media fundamentally alters identity construction by multiplying levels of mediation
and facilitating interaction, understanding the means and affordances of social media for
co-constructing and upholding an identity becomes essential for understanding how
current day musicians construct, revise and alter their identities through identity work.
However, there is a paucity of research concerning the identities specifically created for
online spheres from the musicians’ perspective. Therefore, this research contributes to
filling this gap by focusing on the narration of their online identity over social media. This
research starts from the research question: how do Dutch musicians develop their selfidentity through narrative identity work over social media? Eleven qualitative in-depth
interviews were conducted with various Dutch musicians and two additional interviews
with experts within the field. After performing a thematic content analysis, the results
prove that self-identity depends on and is constructed by a variety of intertwined factors
related to current trends and changes over time. Identities are influenced by and
dependent on events, lifelong experiences, audiences, platforms, and more, within the
personal as well professional spheres. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy, as each
musician needs to find their personal unique selling point. Online self-narratives are
created in order to position their ever-changing identities within a logical,
comprehensive story. However, the pressure to maintain these self-narratives in an
active and successful manner is high. Ultimately, visibility and relevancy are key in
order to survive as a musician, both online and offline, and they beat the difficulties and
pressure of social media. The online self-representation of Dutch musicians and their
narrative identity work are thus in constant motion, brand-dependent and never fixed.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Identity', 'Identity work', 'Narrative identity work', 'Musician', 'Social media']"
"Games of Belonging
Depiction of Athletes of Turkish Descent in German Football
Broadcasts","Münstermann, Florentin",2020-06-29,['Sterkenburg J. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis investigates the depiction of football players of Turkish descent on the very popular
weekly German public TV football broadcasts Sportschau and Aktuelles Sportstudio. The purpose of
this research was to expand on existing research relating to racial discourses in sports. Various
scholars of the field deem an update and extension into the more current theories of cultural, subtle
racism as necessary. This research takes this step in the context of the heavily under researched, but
immensely popular German football broadcasts, with focus on the large minority of Turkish descent
within the country. A combination of thematic analysis and critical discourse analysis of 170
televised football games of the top three German football leagues was employed to trace discourses
employed and circulated by commentators surrounding players of Turkish descent in German
televised football. The analysis gives insights into covert biases, and a dynamic discourse of exclusion
and ‘othering’ through suppression and diversion of attention relating to positive impacts on the
game stemming from players of Turkish origin. These particular biases can in part be explained by
theories of whiteness, reflecting unbalanced power dynamics that reinforce common stereotypes
held about this minority with Turkish roots. As predicted by previous research in the field, obvious
stereotypes did not play a large role in the discussion of players of Turkish origin but diverging
framings of belonging–depending on the contribution to the team–were observed frequently in the
presentation of these players. Success and perceived value to the team seem to be both a
determinant and result of belonging to this majority group. This thesis concludes that it is necessary
to bring the suppressed discourse relating to racism and whiteness back into public sphere in
Germany to fight the false believe of ‘culturally enlightened’ sports reporting. As much as the sport
yields an arena division and negotiation of belonging, as will be highlighted in this thesis, it has the
potential to provide a space for discussions of the underlying problems and bring about change.
Further research is suggested to investigate audience perceptions of the broadcast, as well as
research into the production of the programs. Investigating the increasingly visible Asian ethnic
group in German football is also suggested.","['media', 'creative industries', 'Football', 'Whiteness', 'Racism', 'Germany', 'Media']"
"The Uses and Gratification Theory Applied to Podcasts
How Age and Cultural Background Impact a Person’s Podcast Consumption","Weber, Jessica",2020-06-29,['Hofhuis J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Over the last two decades, podcasts turned into an on-demand audio medium that
is now indispensable within the audio media landscape. With its increasing presence and
importance, researchers started to assess the listening behavior of podcast consumers.
While analyzing podcasts and the consumers, researchers found similarities to traditional
media outlets. In the late 2000s, studies arose about the motivations behind people’s
podcast consumption, which applied the uses and gratification theory that was already
applied to various mass media outlets for around a hundred years. However, not only the
amount of those prior studies are limited, but also their scope and approach. Most of those
studies referred to North-American podcast consumers and the creation of podcast uses and
gratification typologies. Little to no research was done about how personal motivations arise
and how they are influenced by personal traits if people from the same age groups share the
same motivations, or how those could be influenced through other personal traits.
Therefore, this study aimed at finding out to which extent people’s age and cultural
background can influence people’s podcast consumption behavior. Additionally, the
connection between sought uses and gratifications and podcast genres was assessed.
For this research, the approach of a quantitative survey research was chosen,
including the conduction of an online survey, which approached 293 participants, who were
active podcast listeners. Each participant was recruited online and sampled according to
non-probability convenience and quota sampling. After questions about their actual podcast
consumption, participants had to state which genres they prefer, indicate why they are
listening to podcasts and which uses and gratifications they seek to fulfill, and finally provide
insights about their personal profile and cultural background. The analysis of the results
showed that both a person’s age and cultural background are only partly predictors for
people’s podcast consumption. Age was able to predict five out of nine tested preferences
of podcast genres and predicted three out of eleven tested motivations. A person’s cultural
background was able to predict five out of ten podcast genre preferences, and two out of
eight tested motivations. The findings of those study support, challenge, and extend existing
theory on media consumption behavior and provide approaches that can be tied up with
future research.","['media', 'business', 'Podcast(s)', 'uses and gratification theory', 'age', 'cultural background']"
"The Instagram usage of Muslim women in the Netherlands
A qualitative analysis of how young Muslim women from immigrant backgrounds in the
Netherlands experience the popular social network","Mahmudova, Lale",2020-06-29,['Evolvi G.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Young, non-Western, Muslim women who live in Western societies can experience complex realities.
The complexity of such realities can be traced in the contradicting social conditions these women live
through from a young age, consisting of their macro- (school, work, media, friends, mainstream
media) and micro (home, community, Mosque) environment. When the micro- and macro
environment differ, they can both demand diverse expectations from an individual, often requiring
certain skills of adaptation and navigation to satisfy both needs. The social conditions that make up the
realities of young Muslim women in Western societies are conceptualized as their composite habitus.
The habitus influences the responses, decision-making processes, views, and opinions as they navigate
themselves through life (Waltorp, 2015). It is of the interest of this study to understand how the
habitus of young Muslim women in the Netherlands translates to their social media usage. By
selecting the case of one of the most popular social networks amongst young people at the moment,
which is Instagram, this paper aims to comprehend which strategies young Muslim women apply
when they approach such an accessible, easy to use, and highly visual public platform. In order to
provide a representation of real-life experiences, data was gathered by conducting 12 semi-structured
interviews with young Muslim women from an immigrant background who live in the Dutch
Randstad. Using composite habitus as a guiding concept, the interviews focus on the social conditions
of the young women whilst growing up and living in the Netherlands, exploring their meaning-making
and decision-making processes in relation to religion, ethnicity, and Dutch nationality. Grasping these
processes provides a foundation to discover the Instagram usage of the women, understanding their
user motivations, what is and what is not considered appropriate to post, which benefits, and which
setbacks they experience from using the network. Grasping the user approach of the women discloses
the perceived socio-cultural opportunities and constraints of using Instagram, revealing which
strategies are applied to enjoy the former, while avoiding the latter. This allows an understanding of
the way the women strategize their Instagram usage in a way that optimizes their experiences to their
desired outcomes. As such, the data illustrates which strategies young Muslim women in the
Netherlands apply whilst using Instagram.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Composite habitus', 'Muslim women', 'cultural hybridity', 'Social media usage', 'Instagram', 'strategies.']"
Two Sides of the Same Coin: The Duality of Responsible Gaming within the Dutch Gambling Market,"Beem, Anne Floor van",2020-06-29,['Wang Y.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In contemporary society, gambling firms are put under both lawful and societal pressure as they are expected to positively contribute to society, extending beyond focusing on their profit (Carroll, 2015). This growing appeal for corporate social responsibility (CSR) has constituted prominence among organizations and scholars, resulting in an abundance of scrutiny among both parties (Christensen, Morsing & Thyssen, 2013). In the gambling sector, it is argued that CSR refers to the responsibility of diminishing the adverse corporate footprint of gambling products; negative effects which could ultimately lead to gambling addiction. Naturally, the increasing importance of CSR has gone hand in hand with the growing corporate desire to minimize (further) societal harm caused by the gambling sector. The current research aims to explore this explicit sense of corporate responsibility, which is addressed through responsible gaming (RG) strategies. This research contributes to a better understanding of the stakeholder perspective of Responsible Gaming in the context of the Dutch gambling sector. More specifically, a qualitative in-depth interview method is utilized to explore how internal and external stakeholders in the Dutch lottery sector value and regard the concept of Responsible Gaming in relation to CSR. In turn, the research question is explored: ‘How do CSR-based responsible gaming strategies impact the perspective of stakeholders in the Dutch lottery sector?’. Through a thematic analysis, the results suggest that responsible gaming is becoming more important among all stakeholders, yet there is an internal clash between company goals, as making a profit is often a bigger priority. In addition, although internal responsible gaming communication strategies are established, the external communication strategies are marginal and employees are still looking for ways to effectively implement said strategies. Moreover, stakeholders raise conflicting thoughts on the notion of RG as a unique selling point (USP). Finally, the value of responsible gaming in relation to the anticipated liberalization of the Dutch online gambling market, expected in 2021, is growing at a rapid pace. The stakeholders note several anticipated changes for the liberalized
gambling market, being a. an increase in competitive providers, b. a higher total amount of players, c. a higher gambling sensitivity of the product offer, d. an expected growth of gambling addicts in the Dutch market. Altogether, the current research offers a conceptual bridge between what is known about the responsible gaming efforts in the gambling sector, and the lesser-known internal and external stakeholder perspectives toward these efforts.","['media', 'business', 'Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Stakeholder theory', 'Corporate Reputation Management', 'Responsible Gaming', 'Gambling sector']"
POPULIST ZEITGEIST IN NEDERLAND? Een inhoudsanalyse naar populisme in Nederland.,"Duijndam, Jim",2020-06-29,['Ruigrok N.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De afgelopen decennia is het begrip populisme een steeds grotere rol gaan spelen binnen de Nederlandse politiek en de media. Terwijl in de 20e eeuw in Nederland slechts op sporadische basis een populistisch geluid te vernemen was, zoals bij de Boerenpartij van Koekoek, wordt in de 21e eeuw een aanzienlijke hoeveelheid Kamerzetels verdeeld tussen verschillende populistische partijen. Deze ontwikkeling geschiedt op internationale schaal getuige het feit dat verschillende populistische actoren meedingen om regeringsmacht op vrijwel alle continenten van de wereld. Binnen de wetenschap wordt gesproken van een ‘Populist Zeitgeist’. Volgens hen heeft het populisme een besmettende werking, wat leidt tot het feit dat ook establishmentpartijen en media het populistische narratief niet onberoerd laten.
	 In deze scriptie wordt voorgaande bewering langs de meetlat gelegd. Door middel van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse wordt gemeten in hoeverre de zojuist geschetste ‘Populist Zeitgeist’ daadwerkelijk voet aan de grond heeft gekregen in Nederland. Om hierachter te komen worden de publieke uitlatingen van de drie grootste establishmentpartijen van Nederland geanalyseerd en daarenboven wordt gekeken in hoeverre de media een bijdrage leveren aan de ‘Populist Zeitgeist’. Dit geschiedt door het analyseren van de artikelen uit zowel populaire kranten als kwaliteitskranten. Verder wordt ook een bijdrage geleverd aan de definitiediscussie omtrent populisme. Voortbordurend op eerdere literatuur wordt betoogd dat men twee vormen van populisme dient te onderscheiden, namelijk dun en dik populisme.
	Uit de resultaten blijkt geen consequent beeld: terwijl er binnen de media een aanzienlijke representatie is van het populisme, blijkt dat op bepaalde kanalen van establishmentpartijen de aanwezigheid van het populisme bescheiden is. Deze ambiguïteit is tevens zichtbaar bij de aanwezigheid van de verschillende elementen van populisme. Van de vijf elementen van populisme zijn er drie op regelmatige basis aangetroffen, de andere twee waren grotendeels afwezig. Voorgaande leidt tot de conclusie dat de ‘Populist Zeitgeist’ tot op zekere hoogte aanwezig is. Terwijl binnen de media een redelijke hoeveelheid volledig of dik populisme is aangetroffen, tonen de establishmentpartijen vooral tekenen van dun of onvolledig populisme.","['media', 'journalistiek', '‘Populist Zeitgeist’', 'populisme', 'establishmentpartijen', 'Nederlandse dagbladen', 'sociale media', 'partijwebsites']"

"“Van gelukkige leraren, leer je de mooiste dingen”",Fatima Warsame,2020-06-26,"['Dr. R. Moody', 'Prof.dr. M. Fenger']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Ervaren werkdruk is een structureel probleem binnen het primair onderwijs in Nederland (TNO, 2019). Een roep om verandering bereikte vorig jaar een hoogtepunt, toen leraren een landelijke staking organiseerden (NOS, 2019a). Een hoge ervaren werkdruk schaadt de gezondheid van leraren en kan de onderwijskwaliteit verminderen (Bascia & Rottmann, 2011). Verschillende factoren kunnen een invloed hebben op de ervaren werkdruk van leraren. Een eenduidig beeld van deze factoren ontbreekt binnen de literatuur (Bakker, Hakanen, Demerouti & Xanthopoulou, 2007). Daarom is de volgende hoofdvraag onderzocht: “Welke factoren hebben invloed op de ervaren werkdruk van leraren in het primair onderwijs?” In dit verkennend onderzoek stonden de volgende set van factoren centraal: relatie schoolbestuur en leraar, persoonskenmerken, schoolkenmerken en baankenmerken. 		De relatie tussen het schoolbestuur en de leraar is op basis van de theorie omtrent de principaal-agent relatie onderzocht. De principaal-agent relatie is de relatie die ontstaat tussen een werknemer en zijn/haar leidinggevende, doordat taken of bevoegdheden zijn gedelegeerd (Lupia & McCubbins 2000; Martimort, 1997; Waterman & Meier, 1998). De relatie omvat drie vormen van asymmetrie: informatieasymmetrie, verschillende risico voorkeuren en doelconflicten. Deze theorie sluit aan bij de bestuurlijke verhoudingen tussen de twee actoren. Zo is het schoolbestuur formeel verantwoordelijk voor het personeelsbeleid en onderwijskwaliteit (Honingh, Ruiter & Van Tiel, 2017; PO-raad, 2017). Twee beleidsterreinen waar ervaren werkdruk onder valt. De persoonskenmerken betreffen individuele kenmerken van leraren zoals: leeftijd, ervaring, geslacht, opleiding en werkplaats (Antoniou, Polychroni & Vlachakis, 2006; Byrne, 1991). De schoolkenmerken verwijzen naar de verschillen tussen scholen op basis van: totaal aantal leerlingen, grootte schoolbestuur, klassengrootte, schooltype en onderwijstype (Dietvorst & Beukenholdt, 2007; Houtman & Stege, 2015). Tot slot omvatten baankenmerken de volgende zaken: dienstverband, aanstelling, werkuren en reistijd (Bauer Unterbrink, Hack, Pfeifer, Buhl-Grießhaber & Müller et al.,2007).					De invloed van deze factoren is op basis van kwalitatieve en kwantitatieve onderzoeksmethoden onderzocht. Het kwalitatief onderzoek omvatte interviews met leraren in het primair onderwijs. Via enquêtes is kwantitatieve data verzameld omtrent de ervaren werkdruk van leraren in het basisonderwijs. Op basis van de kwalitatieve en kwantitatieve data blijken hidden intention (informatieasymmetrie) en doelconflicten invloed te hebben op de ervaren werkdruk. Leraren stelden dat zij bewust sommige taken niet uitvoeren om de ervaren werkdruk te verlichten. De bestaande autonomie in de klas biedt de mogelijkheid om deze vorm van hidden intention te realiseren. Daarnaast bestaan twee doelconflicten tussen leraren en schoolbesturen. Het eerste doelconflict is een verschil in onderwijsdoelstellingen. Leraren stellen in het onderzoek dat zij vooral de brede ontwikkeling van de leerling beogen. Het schoolbestuur zou vooral de outcomes en targets monitoren, die niet altijd bijdragen aan de brede ontwikkeling van het kind. Het tweede doelconflict betreft een verschil in professionaliseringsdoelstellingen. Academisch opgeleide leraren ervaren weinig mogelijkheden tot verdere ontwikkeling. Leraren die niet een academische pabo hebben afgerond, ervaren voldoende ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden. De twee doelconflicten berusten op een kenniskloof tussen de leraar en het schoolbestuur. De doelconflicten veroorzaken frustraties, die de ervaren werkdruk versterken. De kwalitatieve data toonde verder verbanden tussen hidden knowledge, leeftijd, ervaring, schoolrooster, dienstverband, werkuren en de ervaren werkdruk van leraren. Deze verbanden werden echter niet aangenomen, omdat steun in de kwantitatieve data ontbrak. Dit versterkt de roep om toekomstig wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar de factoren die de ervaren werkdruk beïnvloeden. De resultaten uit dit onderzoek kennen een beperkte generaliseerbaarheid. Dit komt door het ontbreken van een hoog aantal respondenten (N = 100) en random selectie van respondenten.",
Succesvol aan het werk!,Jiske Kiers,2020-06-26,"['Dr. H. Klaassen', 'Dr.P.K. Marks']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht welke factoren invloed hebben op de arbeidsparticipatie van langdurig werklozen. Daartoe wordt de bijstandspopulatie in Delft als onderzoeksobject benut. Er wordt gekeken naar de verschillen tussen alle bijstandsgerechtigden in Delft die de afgelopen vijf jaar aan het werk zijn gegaan en de personen bij wie dat niet (of slechts deels) is gelukt. 
Allereerst is door middel van een systematisch literatuuronderzoek bekeken welke factoren in het werkloosheidsbeleid volgens de literatuur een positieve invloed hebben op de arbeidsparticipatie van langdurig werklozen. Dit heeft geleid tot een conceptueel model met zeven hypothesen, waarin verondersteld wordt dat langdurige werkloosheid een negatief effect heeft op (toekomstige) arbeidsparticipatie en op de deelname aan een programma om weer aan het werk te gaan. Afhankelijk van het soort programma dat wordt ingezet, is de kans op (toekomstige) arbeidsparticipatie groter of juist kleiner voor langdurig werklozen. Volgens de literatuur bieden training en de inzet van financiële instrumenten voor werkgevers (private sector employment) positieve resultaten. Onbetaalde werkervaringsplaatsen (public sector employment) en hulp bij het zoeken naar vacatures (job search assistance) hebben juist een negatief effect op de arbeidsparticipatie van langdurig werklozen. Tot slot heeft empowerment een positief effect op de (toekomstige) arbeidsparticipatie van langdurig werklozen.
	Vervolgens is de casus in Delft onderzocht door gebruik te maken van geanonimiseerde data over 4.927 (voormalig) bijstandsgerechtigden in Delft. Hier is met behulp van SPSS een statistische analyse op toegepast. Om een verdieping te geven aan de resultaten is naast een kwantitatieve analyse ook gebruik gemaakt van een documentanalyse, waarin zowel het landelijke kader (de Participatiewet en de evaluatie hiervan), als de lokale beleidsregels in de gemeente zijn onderzocht. Tot slot is een focusgroep van vijf professionals ondervraagd over de bevindingen uit de kwantitatieve analyse en de documentanalyse. 
Vijf van de zeven hypothesen werden in de kwantitatieve analyse bevestigd en lieten een significante relatie zien. Alleen de hypothese over job search assistance werd niet bevestigd. Deze bleek voor de casus in Delft juist een significant positief effect te hebben op de arbeidsparticipatie van langdurig werklozen. 
De bevindingen uit de documentanalyse laten zien dat de gemeente Delft op verschillende punten afwijkt van de geldende beleidstheorie achter de Participatiewet. Door de beleidsvrijheid die hierin is gelaten aan gemeenten om maatwerk te leveren, is dit ook mogelijk. In Delft heerst allereerst de aanname dat niet iedereen in staat is om betaald aan het werk te gaan. Dat betekent dat er in de praktijk niet één overzichtelijke regeling is voor alle doelgroepen aan de onderkant van de arbeidsmarkt, maar dat er voor verschillende doelgroepen, verschillende instrumenten beschikbaar zijn. Dat betekent verder dat niet alle instrumenten die beschikbaar zijn onder de Participatiewet ook zorgen voor een match tussen vraag en aanbod. In veel gevallen is er veel meer nodig dan bijvoorbeeld alleen een financiële tegemoetkoming voor werkgevers. Het budget dat de Gemeente Delft ter beschikking heeft voor de uitvoering van de Participatiewet, leidt ertoe dat de gemeente meer energie steekt in de bemiddeling van relatief kansrijke kandidaten. Hierdoor worden minder kansrijke kandidaten, onder wie langdurig werklozen, mogelijk minder intensief begeleid. In de beleidsregels van de gemeente Delft komt niet veel terug over de inzet van specifieke instrumenten voor langdurig werklozen. Wel wordt aangegeven dat het niet voor iedereen haalbaar is om betaald aan het werk te gaan en dat er kritisch wordt gekeken naar welk instrument voor welke doelgroep wordt ingezet. Verder wordt er veel ruimte gelaten voor maatwerk door de professionals. 
In de focusgroep wordt bevestigd dat een (klein) deel van de bijstandsgerechtigden geen betaald werk zal kunnen doen. Maatwerk wordt gezien als de cruciale factor om mensen die langdurig werkloos zijn geweest te ondersteunen. De vrijheid om maatwerk te bieden wordt ook door de professionals gevoeld. Het lijkt er op dat door deze vrijheid te laten bij de uitvoering de juiste instrumenten voor de juiste doelgroep kunnen worden ingezet. Mede hierdoor doet Delft het goed in de landelijke benchmark qua uitstroom naar werk. 
De laatste hypothese, waarin wordt verondersteld dat empowerment een positief effect heeft op de (toekomstige) arbeidsparticipatie van langdurig werklozen, kon in de kwantitatieve analyse niet getoetst worden. Deze is voorgelegd aan de focusgroep. De resultaten laten zien dat empowerment van belang is, maar de definitie van empowerment niet voor iedereen hetzelfde is. Bij empowerment moet een goede balans worden gezocht tussen zelfregie en zelfvertrouwen. De regie kan niet volledig bij de kandidaat liggen, omdat er heldere kaders moeten worden gesteld. Het vergroten van het zelfvertrouwen is wel een belangrijk element.
Op basis van de resultaten zijn er vier aanbevelingen voor de gemeente Delft gedefinieerd. De eerste aanbeveling is: Zorg ervoor dat instrumenten voor alle (ook de kansarme) kandidaten beschikbaar zijn, omdat een selectie vooraf kan leiden tot een selffulfilling prophecy. De tweede aanbeveling is om de werkgeversbenadering ook te richten op langdurig werklozen en dan vooral op de groep die nu nog lastig aan betaald werk komt, zoals vrouwen en oudere kandidaten. De derde aanbeveling is om in te zetten op empowerment en daarbij goed te kijken naar welke elementen van empowerment specifiek werken voor langdurig werklozen. Tot slot wordt aanbevolen om in te blijven zetten op maatwerk en voldoende gebruik te maken van intervisie tussen professionals om willekeur of rechtsongelijkheid te voorkomen.",
QUID PRO QUO?,Carol Nader,2020-06-26,['Dr. M.van Ostaijen'],Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"An effective way for policy makers to make their point on highly politicized issues like integration and migration is by framing the issue. In this thesis, three of the four most common frames within the integration debate in the Netherlands, the multicultural, the assimilationist and the universalist frame were discussed, in order to find out which frame dominated in the policies in two of the four largest municipalities in the Netherlands. The choice for municipalities was informed by a recent shift in the academic discussion on integration and migration from a focus on a national approach to a more local approach. This thesis builds on the new focus on local conditions by comparing the frame usage in the labour market integration approaches of status holders of the municipalities of Rotterdam and Utrecht. Therefore, the main research question of this thesis is:
“How can we understand the similarities or differences in the frame usage of the municipalities Rotterdam and Utrecht towards labour market integration of status holders?” 

In order to answer the main research question, the following sub-questions were asked:
-	How does the municipality of Rotterdam frame labour market integration of status holders?
-	How does the municipality of Utrecht frame labour market integration of status holders? 
-	What are the similarities and differences in these frame usages?

This was done on the basis of a qualitative multiple case study, by which policy notes of both municipalities were analysed, in order to find out which reasoning and framing devices were used in the texts. This way, the dominant frame could be derived. More background knowledge on the chosen frame was found by interviewing policy makers of both municipalities about their labour market integration approach. As the political and institutional factor generally play a large role in local integration policy, it was expected beforehand that their frame usage would differ a lot. Based on the political backgrounds of both municipal coalitions, the assumption was that Utrecht would mainly communicate a multiculturalist frame, whereas Rotterdam was assumed to be more assimilationist.

After the desk research it became clear that, despite different political colours in the their executive boards, the municipalities were more alike than what had been expected beforehand. The framing and reasoning devices were very similar and it became clear that in both municipalities the universalist frame is most dominant. Nonetheless, the interviews indicated that they did differ in policy implementation, as it became clear that in Rotterdam, some assimilationist traits are still in place. This mainly showed how there is often a discrepancy between policy formulation and policy implementation. Apparently, both municipalities were mainly influenced by the political factor, which made this discrepancy possible among others. The institutional factor was mainly visible in the way in which the previous, more right-wing coalition of Rotterdam continued to play a large role in the implementation of the labour market integration approach of Rotterdam. The left-wing coalition also had its effects on Utrecht, as it has been willing to invest in status holders for a long time. Other factors also influenced the framing, like for example, populist tensions in society or the national research which showed the detrimental effects of the current labour market approach.

We can thus conclude that while policy formulations and policy framing in municipalities may be very similar, it is necessary to look further into the process to find out the real differences. For further research it is advised to also take the political actors into consideration as respondents, as they could shed more  light on the reasons behind these frame usages. Moreover, it could be interesting to find out the exact extent to which a certain frame dominates in a certain municipality by conducting a quantitative research. It may also be informative for policy makers themselves to find out how status holders themselves frame the policy of which they are the aim, as this could give policy makers important insights in the effectivity of their approach.",
De invloed van de discretionaire ruimte bij subsidieverlening,Ihsane Akka,2020-06-26,"['Dr. J. Grandia', 'Dr. S.van Thiel']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"De doelmatigheid en doeltreffendheid van de subsidieregelingen bij de gemeente Amsterdam zijn de afgelopen jaren onderhevig aan kritiek geweest van de Rekenkamer Metropoolregio Amsterdam. Dit onderzoek focust zich op een aspect van de subsidieverlening waar, in zowel de wetenschappelijk literatuur als in de onderzoeksrapporten, weinig aandacht voor is: de modererende invloed van de discretionaire ruimte van de Street-Level Bureaucraten bij het subsidieverleningsproces. 
	Er is onderzocht hoe de discretionaire ruimte invloed uitoefent op de relatie tussen organisatiedoelstellingen, toetsingskaders en evaluaties en het subsidieverleningsproces. Dit wordt onderzocht in de context van de subsidieregelingen Bewonersinitiatieven en Maatschappelijk Initiatief.  Het doel van dit onderzoek is om inzicht te verkrijgen in de manier waarop de discretionaire ruimte deze relatie beïnvloedt, en zodoende de leemte in de wetenschappelijke literatuur op te vullen. De hoofdvraag die centraal staat in dit onderzoek is de volgende: 

“Hoe is de discretionaire ruimte van Street-Level Bureaucraten van invloed op de organisatiedoelstellingen, toetsingskaders en evaluaties bij het subsidieverleningsproces?”

Deze vraagstelling is onderzocht middels een casestudy, waarbij 17 respondenten zijn geïnterviewd. Er zijn drie deelvragen geformuleerd en drie hypothesen. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de discretionaire ruimte de relatie tussen organisatiedoelstellingen en subsidieverlening negatief beïnvloedt. Ook kan geconcludeerd wordt dat een hogere mate aan discretionaire ruimte tot gevolg heeft dat organisatiedoelstellingen minder prominent terugkomen in de subsidieverlening. De discretionaire ruimte heeft daarnaast tot gevolg dat de toetsingskaders meer op de achtergrond worden gebruikt bij een hoge mate aan discretionaire ruimte, waardoor er een scheve balans kan ontstaan tussen kader en discretionaire ruimte. Tot slot kunnen tweezijdige loops ervoor zorgen dat de discretionaire ruimte van Street-Level Bureaucraten minder ondermijnt wordt door de centrale stad. In de conclusie worden de deelvragen beantwoord en de hypothesen geadresseerd. In de discussie worden de resultaten geïnterpreteerd en  worden er een aantal aanbevelingen gedaan voor vervolgonderzoek en voor in de praktijk.",
"Advertising has come out
The effects of advertising’s portrayal of lesbian, gay, and transgender characters on viewers’
attitudes toward homosexuality and transgender identities","Fried, Mariana",2020-06-26,['Opree S.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study examined the effects of exposure to advertisements featuring lesbian, gay,
and transgender characters on viewers’ attitudes toward homosexuality and transgender
identities. Sexual minorities’ rising inclusion in advertising has attracted scholars’ and the news
media’s attention, especially in Argentina, a country surrounded by more conservative media
environments. Despite scholars’ attribution of cultivating effects to the mass media, research
on LGBT-inclusive advertising has been limited to analyzing the ads’ content and commercial
effectiveness. This study moved beyond the largely commercially-focused research on the
topic, by assessing the extent to which exposure to advertisements portraying LGT characters
change viewers’ attitudes toward these groups, comparing viewers’ attitudes toward ads with
varying degrees of protagonism of LGT characters, and exploring the ways in which viewers
evaluate LGT-inclusive ads and the trend toward LGT-inclusive advertising. By means of a mixed
methods experimental design comprising closed- and open-ended questions, the study found
no significant effect of exposure. Still, the results challenge ideas of advertising as having solely
commercial effects as they reveal participants’ belief that advertising could lead to positive
social changes by normalizing sexual minorities as an everyday reality. The study questions the
explanations of viewers’ preference for ads with non-central LGBT portrayals as their refusal to
be excluded from advertising. Instead, it suggests that this preference relates to viewers’
consideration that unforced representations where inclusion is not over-focused are more
positive for sexual minorities. This study revealed that the emphasis placed on inclusion and
how forced such inclusion results are important factors when evaluating an advertisement,
whereas the specific LGT subgroup portrayed does not determine viewers’ attitudes toward the
ads. By observing the nuances with which viewers evaluate advertising’s inclusive trend, this
study challenges the ideas of advertising featuring sexual minorities as something that viewers
either support or reject. Instead, it calls on both researchers and advertising practitioners to
consider that attending to who is represented is insufficient, since audiences are often critical
of the actual way in which those representations are done.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'Advertising', 'Social Change', 'LGBT Representation', 'Advertisement Attitudes', 'LGBT', 'Attitudes']"
Een blik in de ‘Black Box’ van handhaving binnen de financiële sector,William Slooff,2020-06-25,"['Prof.dr. M. van Twist', 'Prof.dr. M. van der Steen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht hoe er wordt omgegaan met de discretionaire ruimte binnen de specifieke omgeving van het tripartiete overleg tussen het Openbaar Ministerie, de FIOD en de AFM/DNB en welke verklaringen daarvoor zijn. Bij het zoeken naar de verklaringen wordt gebruik gemaakt van de rationaliteitbenadering van  Snellen.
Uit dit eerste explorerende kwalitatieve onderzoek naar het tripartiete overleg blijken enkele
noviteiten ten opzichte van de eerdere juridische publicaties. Het blijkt dat er een aparte versie van
het overleg is met de AFM, OM en FIOD als deelnemers en een aparte versie van het overleg met
DNB, OM en FIOD als deelnemers. Naast het maken van een keuze met betrekking tot de
handhaving, worden er in het TPO ook lopende zaken besproken en worden gemaakte keuzes
sporadisch geëvalueerd. Tevens blijkt dat er naast bestuursrechtelijke- en strafrechtelijke afdoening,
ook wordt gesproken over en gekozen voor tuchtrechtelijke afdoening, aanvullende informatie
verzamelen en de zaak (voorlopig) niet op te pakken.
In dit onderzoek wordt vastgesteld dat er sprake is van een discretionaire ruimte met betrekking tot
het kiezen van een handhavingsoptie. Dit eerste explorerende kwalitatieve onderzoek laat tevens
zien dat de juridische rationaliteit, de bedrijfsmatige rationaliteit en de politieke rationaliteit invloed
uitoefenen bij de invulling van de discretionaire ruimte binnen dit tripartiete overleg. Ondanks dat
deze drie rationaliteiten met elkaar botsen blijkt dat de deelnemende partijen in bijna alle gevallen
op een gelijkwaardige manier met elkaar consensus vinden bij het kiezen van een handhavingsoptie.
In dit onderzoek is binnen het tripartiete overleg geen aanwezigheid vastgesteld van de
wetenschappelijke rationaliteit. De veronachtzaming van de wetenschappelijke rationaliteit kan
leiden tot verlies aan draagvlak voor het overheidsoptreden en/of het niet realiseren van de doelen
van de deelnemende partijen. Het verdient aanbeveling om de wetenschappelijke rationaliteit meer
te verankeren in het tripartiete overleg.",
From Non-Deportability to a Form of ‘Legality’? The Reality of Stratified Access to Labor-Related Regularization for Rejected Asylum Seekers in Germany,"Jonitz, E.",2020-06-21,"['Arjen Leerkes', 'Kim Caarls']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This thesis investigates to what extent regularization serves as a solution to the precarious situation facing ‘non-deportable’ persons in particular and to the issue of non-deportability in Europe more generally. This is especially relevant given the current limitations of the international protection regime and a growing demand for labor in the European Union (EU). Taking the German city Stuttgart as a case study, the thesis looks at factors determining – and limiting – access to labor-related regularization opportunities for ‘tolerated’ rejected asylum seekers. Drawing upon the concept of civic stratification, it explores the ways in which labor-related regularization facilitates status mobility and how opportunities to regularize relate to migrants’ needs and aspirations. In order to analyze these themes, semi-structured interviews with twelve (rejected) asylum seekers and five experts of Stuttgart-based institutions were conducted. These interviews shed light on individual strategies that migrants’ adopt to improve their insecure legal situation, namely through mobilizing different types of resources. Labor-related regularization seems to provide ‘tolerated’ persons with the opportunity to realize their aspiration to secure their stay in Germany. However, it is also demonstrated that access to regularization is highly restricted and thus not (yet) a widely applicable instrument to address neither non-deportability nor the growing skills shortage in the EU.","['civic stratification', 'deportability', 'EU migration policy', 'irregularity', 'migrants’ aspirations', 'regularization']"
When patriarchy is optional. Interrogating the construction of the -white- Dutch identity through the analysis of gendering and degendering processes in policies concerning violence against women.,"Sanchez Cecilia, I.",2020-06-21,"['Maja Hertoghs', 'Willem Schinkel']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,This thesis examines the connection between the degendering process that the concept of violence against women has suffered in the Netherlands over the last three decades and the ‘othering’ process of Muslim ethnic minorities in the Dutch context. The Netherlands is exemplary when it comes to implementing politics of gender and sexuality on national and cultural identity politics. This study analyses the culturist discourse that exists in the institutionalisation of different forms of violence when gender is either addressed or erased from the definition. It goes on to identify gender equality in the Netherlands and how the official discourses are embedded in the social imaginary. It concludes with a discussion of the prominent role that the problematisation of the ‘Others’ occupies in the construction of the white Dutch identity regarding women’s emancipation.,"['Culturism', 'degendering', 'Dutchness', 'gendered violence', 'othering']"
Desirability in the Gay Community: an analysis of Black and Asian navigation through Grindr,"van der Veen, D.",2020-06-21,"['Jess Bier', 'Maja Hertoghs']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Sexual racism in the gay community is still commonly experienced by BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Colour). Previous literature by Han and Choi (2018) have gone more in depth within the BIPOC perspective of sexual racism by explaining how Black, Asian, and Latino users do desirability, a way of making people desire you, within larger racial infrastructures that dominate all gay sexual fields. Focusing just on one gay sexual field, Grindr, we expand on Han and Choi’s research by complexifying race, showing how Black and Asian Grindr users do desirability through different racial performatives. Thus, the research question is; how do Black and Asian Grindr users perform desirability? I argue that Black and Asian Grindr users perform desirability through authenticating alterity, the practice of playing within a racialized assumption, and mimicry, the practice of mimicking Whiteness, and thereby these practices add complexity to racial categories but nonetheless reproduce Whiteness. The methodology includes 10 interviews and a document analysis of Grindr profiles from 5 Asian identifying and 5 Black identifying Grindr users. Here the homonormative model consisting of gendered expression and its link to forming race was looked at to analyse for racial performativity. The analysis shows a Black Grindr user authenticate alterity by playing into masculine gendered expression which makes Black alterity, and Asian Grindr user practice this through playing an effeminate gendered expression which makes Asian alterity. They also perform outside of alterity where a Black Grindr user mimics Whiteness through White femininity and an Asian Grindr user mimics Whiteness through White masculinity. This shows that there are different ways for Black and Asian Grindr users to racially perform themselves, thus, complexifying race as users are able to modify themselves through different racial categories in order to perform desirability. Nonetheless users directly reproduce Whiteness through mimicry and indirectly reproduce Whiteness through authenticating alterity. This allows Whiteness to be reinforced on Grindr.","['desirability', 'Grindr', 'homosexual', 'performativity', 'racism']"
"‘’Flexibel, maar toch loyaal en betrokken?’’ Een onderzoek naar de loyaliteit en betrokkenheid van flexibele werknemers binnen een detacheringsorganisatie.","Koolwijk, D.",2020-06-21,"['Peter Mascini', 'Sjaak Braster']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In dit onderzoek wordt de vraag gesteld of loyaliteit en betrokkenheid binnen een flexibele arbeidsrelatie mogelijk is. Om dit te onderzoeken wordt een casus gebruikt binnen een detacheringsorganisatie. Aan deze flexibele arbeidsrelatie zitten twee factoren verbonden: baanonzekerheid en fysieke afstand tussen werkgever en werknemer. Volgens de huidige literatuur kunnen deze twee factoren de mate van loyaliteit en betrokkenheid bemoeilijken en is het minder vanzelfsprekend. Daarnaast wordt in de bestaande theorie veelal vergelijkingen gemaakt tussen vaste werknemers en de flexibele schil, dit onderzoek focust zich geheel op de flexibele aanstelling. Om dit te onderzoeken zijn er 15 semi-gestructureerde interviews afgenomen. Uiteindelijk blijkt dat in bepaalde opzichten loyaliteit en betrokkenheid mogelijk is. Zo heeft communicatie een essentiële bijdrage, er zal namelijk een goede band moeten worden opgebouwd tussen werkgever en werknemer. De communicatie binnen de flexibele arbeidsrelatie moet wel aan bepaalde condities voldoen. Daarnaast is er een wezenlijk verschil in contractvorm in loyaliteit (transactioneel en relationeel) maar is het wel mogelijk deze te creëren. De mate en vorm van betrokkenheid is anders, maar respondenten zijn wel bereidwillig tot het hebben van betrokkenheid.","['baanonzekerheid', 'betrokkenheid', 'communicatie', 'flexibele arbeidsrelatie', 'fysieke afstand', 'loyaliteit']"

Its interface allows for a reconfiguration of Cairo’s urban landscape into ‘safe’ and ‘unsafe’ neighbourhoods, and raises important questions about the use of georeferencing and mapping technologies in the interest of security. By means of a walkthrough method, this thesis analyses the affordances and material arrangements of HarassMap’s interface to render visible that behind a smooth and calibrated cartographic visualisation lies an abstraction of bodies seamlessly reconfigured into calculable georeferenced targets – giving the impression of totalising and penetrable spaces, disentangled from issues of class, race, gender and power. In contrast, what my reading of HarassMap attempts to demonstrate, grounded in Lefebvre’s work on the production of space and Actor-Network-Theory (ANT), is that whilst digital spatial technologies seemingly produce ‘objective’ realities – space is inextricably gendered, racialised and subject to power relations, affecting those living in it in deeply asymmetrical ways.","['sexual harassment', 'GIS', 'security governance', 'securitised spaces', 'Egypt']"

Saying the quiet part out loud: analyzing rationality and whiteness in the Dutch public sphere through the discussion of cultural marxism,"van Dijk, R.",2020-06-21,"['Willem Schinkel', 'Maja Hertoghs']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Cultural marxism has become subject of debate within the Dutch public sphere. At the same time, western civilization and the public sphere is put at stake in these discussions. Therefore the discussion of cultural marxism is a discussion of the limits to the Dutch public sphere. In this thesis I analyze how the Dutch liberal public sphere is imagined and (re)constructed by and through the discussion of cultural marxism. Habermas imagines the liberal public sphere as a place where well-informed, rational debate takes place about any subject. I show that rationality is still the predominant condition within the Dutch liberal public sphere and I sought to demonstrate that this claim on rationality is one that is characterized and configured by whiteness. Moreover, rationality and whiteness determine the issues discussed within the public sphere, excluding people that do not adhere to the rules of whiteness. Analyzing the discussion of cultural marxism thus helps understand the presuppositions, accessibility and conditions of issue formation in the Dutch public sphere.","['cultural marxism', 'free speech', 'public sphere', 'rationality', 'whiteness']"

In this research, data is used from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 and contains data from 6758 15-year old children in Belgium. A multivariate regression analysis showed that joy in reading is a very important predictive factor of reading scores: girls have more joy in reading, causing them to perform better with reading than boys. We also find that boys and girls use ICT for different purposes, causing different reading scores. Boys perform lower on reading scores than girls, because they make more use of ICT for visual purposes than girls. There is no significant relationship found between ICT for textual purposes and the higher scores for girls on reading, but additional analysis of other countries shows that this relationship does exist in Denmark and Germany. These results tell us that in a more digitalized society chances and challenges arise in reading, ICT-usage and the differences between groups and countries benefiting from it.","['digitalization', 'gender', 'ICT-usage', 'joy in reading', 'reading scores']"

How Binary Gender Norms Create Friction,"Kornmann, S.",2020-06-21,"['Willem Schinkel', 'Samira van Bohemen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The main research question answered within this thesis is: when and how do infrastructures create friction by imposing binary norms of gender? This research question will be answered in two phases, first interviews with transgender and nonconforming gendered individuals will be conducted in order to determine the moments in time and space where friction occurs, the second phase will analyse how within these moments infrastructures can create friction by internalizing and reproducing binary norms of gender. The fields of interest are the passport and the health care system as infrastructures. To understand the blueprint on which these infrastructures were formed, their histories and intended use are elaborated. From this research it can be concluded that friction occurs at moments in which these infrastructures create and initiate barriers and slow movement for transgender and nonconforming gendered individuals, relating to the inherent binary norms of gender with which they were formed.","['binary gender', 'categorization', 'friction', 'infrastructures', 'transgender']"

Jaarlijks vertrekken honderden Curaçaose jongeren na het afronden van hun middelbare school naar Nederland om daar een studie in het hoger onderwijs te volgen. Verklaringen hiervoor zijn het gebrek aan studiekeuze op het eiland en een eenvoudige aansluiting op het Nederlandse onderwijssysteem door het koloniaal verleden. Verschillende onderzoeken zijn gedaan naar de remigratiewens van hoogopgeleide Curaçaoënaars die in Nederland wonen en werken. Uit deze onderzoeken blijkt dat veel van de onderzochte hoogopgeleide Curaçaoënaars niet bereid zijn terug te keren naar hun geboorte-eiland, want in Nederland zijn meer sociale voorzieningen en hogere salarissen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om in kaart te brengen wat de ervaringen van de hoogopgeleide Curaçaoënaars zijn die wel een besluit hebben genomen om te remigreren. Uit verschillende onderzoeken blijkt dat wanneer hoogopgeleide Curaçaoënaars besluiten om te remigreren, ze een toegeschreven identiteit kunnen krijgen, beter bekend als Makamba pretu.

The electoral relevance of female emancipatory values in contemporary Dutch parliamentary elections,"Henneveld, D.",2020-06-21,"['Pearl Dykstra', 'Katrien Helmerhorst']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This research analyses the strategic usage of female emancipatory values in the Dutch parliamentary elections of 2017. In doing so, it tests the remaining electoral relevance of feminism in the politics of the largely egalitarian country of the Netherlands as well. The European Social Survey has been used for conducting the quantitative analysis. Contrary to expectations, findings show that the female electorate is less likely to vote for a party that has implemented female emancipatory values in its program. This voting preference was found not be influenced by experience with gender-discrimination. Also, one’s beliefs in political efficacy did not prove to be of influence either. The analysis introduces an alternative model, in order to determine the predictors for voting preference for a party that has incorporated female emancipatory values. Secularism and gender appear to contribute to an individual’s voting preference for such a party. Implementations of social movements in party programs, here feminism, are argued to be more about party positioning.","['Feminism', 'gender', 'secularism', 'strategic party positioning', 'voting preference']"
Gentrificatie in een betrokken buurt - casus Zeeheldenkwartier in Den Haag,"Jasiak, Z.",2020-06-21,"['Jack Burgers', 'Sjaak Braster']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In een modelvoorbeeld van gentrificatie wordt een arbeiderswijk (vaak opgevat als een achterstandsbuurt) omgevormd tot een middenklassewijk. In dit onderzoek is gekeken hoe gentrificatie in een betrokken wijk wordt ervaren: het Zeeheldenkwartier was vroeger een gemêleerde wijk waar zowel arbeiders als middenstanders woonden, maar uit interviews blijkt vooral dat het nooit als een vergeten wijk werd gezien. Aan de hand van vijftien interviews met leden van de middenklasse, voornamelijk geëngageerde bewoners, is gekeken naar perceptie van fysieke en symbolische verdringing en de rol van de buurtorganisatie (de Groene Eland) bij de ontwikkelingen in de buurt. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat het werk van de Groene Eland eerder als stimulans wordt gezien dan als doelbewuste acties bedoeld om de opwaardering van de wijk te bevorderen. Ook is de ervaring van verdringing, zoals beschreven door Atkinson (2015) niet van toepassing voor de geïnterviewde middenklasse. Fysieke verdringing in de wijk verschijnt voornamelijk in een vorm van uitsluiting, terwijl symbolische verdringing nauwelijks wordt waargenomen.","['Gentrification', 'Displacement', 'Sense of Place', 'Socioeconomic Status']"
"Traditional or egalitarian? Parenthood, gender attitudes, and part-time work among Dutch men","Schut, J.",2020-06-21,"['Gabriele Mari', 'Renske Keizer']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The Netherlands has been described as a part-time economy, but there are few men who choose to work part-time. A male breadwinner-model prevails, yet part-time work among men has become more common the past few decades. Previous research on part-time work has mainly focused on the implications it has for women and the legal status and quality of part-time jobs in the Netherlands. I used data from the 10th wave of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences (LISS) panel to investigate the difference in propensity to work part-time between fathers and childless men, and to examine whether gender attitudes affect working hours. Fathers were found to be more likely to work full-time than childless men. Also, results suggest that men's gender attitudes play no role in accounting for differences in working-time arrangements between men with and without children. Rather than gender attitudes, traditional gender specialization seemed to account for the longer working hours of fathers compared with childless men.","['part-time work', 'fathers', 'childless men', 'gender attitudes', 'traditional gender specialization']"
Inbedding van veiligheidscultuur in de organisatiecultuur. ondertitel: Een onderzoek naar de overeenstemming van veiligheidscultuur binnen teams en hoe deze is ingebed binnen de organisatiecultuur van vertrouwen en hiërarchische afstand,"Mangelmans, M.",2020-06-21,"['Peter Mascini', 'Sjaak Braster']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Het eerste doel van dit kwantitatieve onderzoek is om vast te stellen in hoeverre er sprake is van een gedeelde veiligheidscultuur binnen teams. Middels ANOVA, ICC (1), ICC(2) en Rwg(j) analyses is dit onderzocht. Hieruit blijkt dat er inderdaad sprake is van veiligheidscultuur op teamniveau. Het tweede doel van dit onderzoek is om te kijken hoe deze veiligheidscultuur, bestaande uit formele en informele risicostrategieën, is ingebed in de bredere organisatiecultuur, die is geoperationaliseerd als vertrouwen in en hiërarchische afstand tot het management. Middels een three way moderation analyse is dit onderzocht. Hieruit blijkt dat in een situatie van veel vertrouwen en een kleine hiërarchische afstand, formele en informele risicostrategieën elkaar aanvullen, waardoor minder ongelukken plaatsvinden. Terwijl deze strategieën elkaar tegenwerken in een situatie van weinig vertrouwen en een grote hiërarchische afstand, wat inhoudt dat onder deze condities meer ongelukken plaatsvinden. Dit onderzoek draagt zo bij aan de bestaande literatuur omdat wordt aangetoond dat de complementariteit tussen formele en informele risicostrategieën afhankelijk is van de organisatorische context van vertrouwen en hiërarchische afstand. Veiligheidscultuur is dus ingebed in de bredere organisatiecultuur.","['Hiërarchische afstand', 'organisatiecultuur', 'risicostrategieën', 'veiligheidscultuur', 'vertrouwen']"
"“We just do what we have to” Exploring gender, motherhood and labour pain in the Netherlands","Helmers, H.",2020-06-21,"['Maja Hertoghs', 'Willem Schinkel']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This research aims to explore how gender, motherhood and labour pain are connected in the Netherlands. By taking the unique labour pain culture in the Netherlands as a starting point, the structures that construct gender and motherhood and the ways these are performed are unravelled. Using feminist theories, concepts and methods, the discourse around labour pain is analyzed and interviews were conducted in order to answer the question: How are gender and motherhood performed in the labour pain culture in the Netherlands? The results show that women in the Netherlands face high expectations. In the process of labour, but also during motherhood, her own self ‘vanishes’ and she is expected to sacrifice herself for the sake of her child. In this web of structures and expectations, women don’t question the practice of going through labour without pain relief and believe pain is positive and a necessary part of labour. Thereby, pain plays a role in the performativity of gender and (good) motherhood.","['Childbirth', 'Gender', 'Gender performance', 'Motherhood', 'Labour pain']"
"“After us, the Deluge” - A quantitative analysis of the relationship between Christian denominations and climate change scepticism in the Netherlands","Mijnans, J.",2020-06-21,"['Gijs Custers', 'Godfried Engbersen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Besides the fact that the role of religion in contemporary literature regarding climate change sceptic attitudes is contested, little research has focused on the association between levels of biblical literacy and these sceptic beliefs. Where most research treats religion as a one-dimensional dichotomous variable, this study expands on research conducted by Morrison et al. (2015) and Arbuckle and Konisky (2015) to examine whether levels of biblical literalness of Christian denominations account for variance in climate change sceptic viewpoints. In addition, the effect of moral traditionalism on these denominations is examined to review whether living in highly concentrated Christian environments reaffirms existing environmental beliefs. Using the dataset of the 2016 European Social Study, 406 Dutch adherers of three Christian affiliations (Roman-Catholics, Protestants and Reformed) were examined. The analyses showed that there were no substantial significant differences in climate change sceptic attitudes between the denominations. This absence could be due to the relatively small sample size or the general lack of strong conservative viewpoints among Christian affiliations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, no differences between groups were observed for the interactional effect of moral traditionalism, which indicates that higher levels of moral traditionalism do not account for more climate change sceptic attitudes. Hence, to better understand the connection between moral traditionalism and collective religiosity in certain regions, high-quality area-driven data is needed to provide conclusive evidence concerning this outcome.","['Climate change scepticism', 'Religion', 'Biblical literacy', 'Moral traditionalism']"
Beyond the absent breadwinner: mapping the paternal masculinities of Dutch highly involved fathers,"van de Beek, J.",2020-06-21,"['Renske Keizer', 'Samira van Bohemen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Traditionally, full-time breadwinning was centre stage within dominant notions of paternal masculinities – men’s gendered identities within family life. This material aspect is becoming less self-evident in popular conceptions of what it means to be a good father. The alternative construction of men’s identities when they do not conform to this element of traditional paternal masculinity however remains underexposed. This study thus examines how 12 part-time working Dutch fathers envision their paternal masculinities. It moves beyond previous work on this topic by focusing on a unique group of involved fathers, in a country that in terms of gender norms and policies still centres mothers as primary parents. The tension between this progressive group and traditional setting provides an interesting context for this study. It adds to the field of research on paternal involvement in the Netherlands by centring involved fathers’ own narratives through qualitative interviews. The findings reveal that a majority of respondents constructed a gender-neutral narrative: these ‘new’ fathers rejected gendered notions of parenthood and childcare. This dominant narrative indicates the occurrence of inclusive masculinity within Dutch men’s family lives: an expansion of the range of acceptable heteromasculine behaviour and the fading of boundaries between masculine and feminine behaviours and spheres. The findings underline the importance of taking fathers’ underlying conceptions of paternal masculinities into account when researching and stimulating paternal involvement.","['Childcare', 'fatherhood', 'new father', 'paternal involvement', 'paternal masculinities']"
The Impact of National Welfare State Dissatisfaction and the Type of Welfare Regime on Euroscepticism: A Comparative Analysis,"de Vette, R.",2020-06-21,"['Gijs Custers', 'Ferry Koster']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This paper explores the effect of welfare state dissatisfaction on Euroscepticism by means of European Social Survey data of 2018, focussed on four countries (Norway, Germany, Czech Republic and the United Kingdom). It is believed that citizens tend to ‘blame Europe’ for defaults in their national welfare system and that this results in Eurosceptic attitudes. The data suggest that variations in this relationship can be accounted for the type of welfare regime. Previous literature states that the effect of dissatisfaction on Euroscepticism may be stronger for more protective welfare regimes (socio-democratic, conservative, post-communist) than the liberal regime, as there might be more at stake for these welfare regimes regarding EU unification and integration. Nevertheless, results show that the most protective regimes are less Eurosceptic than the liberal regime. However, the relationship between welfare state dissatisfaction and Euroscepticism is stronger in more protective welfare regimes. The moderating effect of welfare regime can’t be explained by theories about European integration and how generous a welfare regime is. Future research could help clarify these findings.","['Euroscepticism', 'welfare state dissatisfaction', 'welfare regime', 'EU attitudes', 'European integration']"
Educating Normal Sexuality: a discourse analysis of high school sexuality education in the Netherlands,"Muijlwijk, P. van",2020-06-20,"['Samira van Bohemen', 'Willem Schinkel']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The Netherlands is known as an international forerunner when it comes to sexuality education. This fits perfectly in the Dutch self-image as open, progressive and gay-friendly. This image is constructed through a process of othering those who are perceived not to fit in this framework. I have performed a critical discourse analysis to research how in and exclusionary practices are embedded in the discourse of high school books of sexuality education and how this is related to Dutch cultural citizenship. “Normal sexuality” is communicated via white, heterosexual bodies. It is encouraged to be accepting of homosexuality, yet not included as normal sexuality. Disapproving homosexuality, however, is negotiated through religion as deviant, reifying the secular identity of the Netherlands. After concluding how a homonationalist discourse is present throughout educational literature, I finish with some recommendations for improvement and further research.","['homonationalism', 'sexual exceptionalism', 'sexuality education']"
Transnationalisme en eenzaamheid. Een longitudinale studie naar effect van transnational behavior en transnational belonging op het mentale welzijn van Poolse migranten in Nederland,"Engels, L.",2020-06-20,"['Pearl Dykstra', 'Tineke Fokkema']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In dit kwantitatieve onderzoek wordt het effect van transnationale banden op het mentale welzijn van Poolse migranten in Nederland onderzocht. Een onderscheid tussen transnational behavior en transnational belonging wordt hierbij gehanteerd. Er wordt in dit longitudinale onderzoek gebruik gemaakt van de Families of Poles in the Netherlands (FPN) dataset, afgenomen in 2015 en 2018. In totaal zijn er 566 Poolse migranten tussen de 22 en 58 jaar meegenomen in dit onderzoek. Middels verscheidene lineaire regressies is de relatie tussen transnationalisme, eenzaamheid en de twee mediatoren, ervaren discriminatie en positieve sociale vergelijking, onderzocht. Tegen de verwachtingen in tonen de resultaten aan dat zowel ervaren discriminatie als positieve sociale vergelijking de relatie tussen eenzaamheid en transnationalisme niet beïnvloedt. Uit de analyses volgt dat transnational belonging zorgt voor een toename van de eenzaamheid van Poolse migranten in Nederland. Tegengesteld aan voorgaande onderzoeken zorgt transnational behavior juist voor minder eenzaamheid van Poolse migranten in Nederland.","['discriminatie', 'eenzaamheid', 'Poolse migranten', 'sociale vergelijking', 'transnationalisme']"
Interbestuurlijke verhoudingen in de bed-bad-broodcasus. Een lokaal perspectief.,"Bakker, N.",2020-06-20,"['Kim Caarls', 'Arjen Leerkes']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Dit artikel beschrijft de verhouding tussen rijk en gemeenten (i.c. Rotterdam) ten tijde van de bed-bad-broodcrisis van 2015 en de mate waarin deze verhoudingen van invloed zijn geweest op de lokale besluitvorming over deze voorzieningen. De veelgebruikte typering van deze verhouding als een principal agent-relatie, waarbij de rijksoverheid de principal is en de gemeente de agent, biedt veel aanknopingspunten maar schiet uiteindelijk tekort. Daarom wordt dit afgezet tegen de stewardship theorie, waar het uitgangspunt een meer gelijkwaardige en constructieve samenwerking is. Beide theorieën zijn ingepast in een breder model over managementstijlen, waardoor een genuanceerder beeld ontstaat van de samenwerking in het openbaar bestuur. De analyse wordt uitgevoerd aan de hand van een meetinstrument voor beleidsvrijheid, aangezien beleidsvrijheid een goede determinant is voor welke managementstijl er gehanteerd wordt. Het onderzoek wordt gedaan vanuit lokaal perspectief, met nadruk op de positie van raadsleden. Tegenover hen profileert de rijksoverheid zich soms als principal, maar in praktijk weren raadsleden zich hier tegen en draaien ze de verhouding ook wel om en wordt de rijksoverheid evengoed aangesproken op haar rol en verantwoordelijkheid.","['Beleidsvrijheid', 'multilevel governance', 'principal agent theory', 'stewardship theory']"
Het gevoel van presteren. De invloed van het sociaal-emotioneel welbevinden op de leesprestaties van leerlingen met een migratieachtergrond,"Smeenk, A.",2020-06-19,"['Sjaak Braster', 'Jack Burgers']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Abstract Anno 2020 is er nog steeds sprake van een prestatiekloof en kansenongelijkheid in het (voortgezet) onderwijs in Nederland. Leerlingen met een migratieachtergrond presteren systematisch slechter dan leerlingen van Nederlandse komaf. In deze studie worden de relaties tussen het hebben van een migratieachtergrond, de leesprestaties en het sociaal-emotioneel welbevinden onderzocht. De hypothese luidt dat sociaal-emotionele factoren de prestatiekloof gedeeltelijk verklaren. Daarnaast zijn er in het onderzoek twee modererende variabelen meegenomen: ondersteuning van ouders en leerkrachten. Aan de hand van data van PISA 2018 (OECD) wordt het model getoetst door middel van een conditionele mediatie analyse. Ten eerste blijkt uit de resultaten dat leerlingen met een migratieachtergrond slechter presteren op het gebied van taalvaardigheden. Ten tweede blijkt de hypothese te kunnen worden bevestigd: sociaal-emotionele factoren verklaren deze achterblijvende prestaties gedeeltelijk. Ten slotte blijkt dat de rol van leerkrachten en met name de rol van ouders vitaal is voor deze groep leerlingen. Wanneer de leerlingen meer emotionele steun ontvangen, is het sociaal-emotionele welbevinden subjectief hoger. Ten slotte is er een reflectie gegeven op het onderzoek en zijn er aanbevelingen voor vervolgonderzoek gedaan.","['Leerlingen met een migratieachtergrond', 'etnische ongelijkheid', 'prestatiekloof', 'sociaal-emotioneel welbevinden', 'leesvaardigheden', 'ouders', 'leerkrachten']"
Differences in the distribution of childcare tasks among heterogamous and homogamous couples: Is it due to gender role values?,"Heistek, M.",2020-06-19,"['Renske Verweij', 'Renske Keizer']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This study examines differences in distribution of childcare tasks among different types of unions (i.e. homogamous, hypogamous and hypergamous unions) and is motivated by the following question: To what extent can differences in the distribution of childcare tasks among heterogamous and homogamous couples be explained by gender role values? Literature on relative task division has up until now mostly focused on economical and macro-level explanations. Using data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences (LISS), we contribute to previous research by taking into account the gender role values of couples. Moreover, this research’s focus is on the educational level of couples in relation to each other. The findings reveal that hypergamous couples (in which the male is higher educated than the female) have more equal task divisions than hypogamous unions (in which the female is higher educated), despite the fact that the latter group’s gender role values are more equal. As such, the childcare task division of hypergamous and hypogamous couples are not in line with their gender values. The childcare task division of homogamous unions (in which partners have a similar education) is more conforming to their gender role values. Implications of these findings are discussed.","['childcare task division', 'gender role values', 'homogamous union', 'hypergamous union']"
Afstemmen is innoveren? Onderzoek naar de afstemmingen tussen organisatiegrootte en bureaucratie in relatie met innovatie,"Legierse, B.",2020-06-19,"['Ferry Koster', 'Vasco Lub']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In dit onderzoek staat de vraag centraal in hoeverre organisatiegrootte en bureaucratie van invloed zijn op innovatie en of dit verklaard kan worden aan de hand van de structurele contingentietheorie. Organisatiegrootte en bureaucratie hebben geen eenduidige relatie met innovatie. Dit komt mogelijk doordat deze organisatorische variabelen veelal in direct relatie met innovatie worden onderzocht. Aan de hand van de structurele contingentietheorie kan beargumenteerd worden dat mogelijk sprake kan zijn van een afstemming tussen organisatiegrootte en bureaucratie, wat de variëteit in resultaten kan verklaren. Met een binaire logistische regressieanalyse is de relatie tussen organisatiegrootte, bureaucratie en innovatie onderzocht. Hiervoor is gebruik gemaakt van het ECS 2013. Dit onderzoek wijst uit dat afstemming een plausibele verklaring is, aangezien bij de bureaucratische indicatoren hiërarchie en de indeling van afdelingen op basis van functie significante interactie-effecten zijn gevonden met organisatiegrootte ten aanzien van innovatie. Grote organisaties lijken baat te hebben bij minder hiërarchie, terwijl kleine organisaties juist baat lijken te hebben bij meer hiërarchie. Daarnaast lijkt het indelen van afdelingen op basis van functie meer van invloed te zijn op het innovatievermogen van grote organisaties dan die van kleine organisaties. Dit onderzoek draagt bij aan de theorievorming omtrent organisatiestructuren en innovatie, omdat het aantoont dat het nuttig is om organisatiekenmerken in combinatie met elkaar te onderzoeken om zo mogelijke afstemmingen te constateren.","['afstemming', 'bureaucratie', 'contingentietheorie', 'innovatie', 'organisatiegrootte']"
