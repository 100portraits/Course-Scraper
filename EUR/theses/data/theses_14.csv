"Dual-management in art museums - 
Towards an artistic and commercial balance",Teresa Cos Rebollo,2018-06-12,['T. Navarrete'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Art museums are complex cultural organizations in which a duality is always present, the artistic against the commercial vales. As a knowledge-based institution, the museum is expected to deliver a quality program while being economically sustainable. A way of tackling this conflict is by having a dual-management structure: an artistic director in charge of the knowledge-based tasks, and a business director responsible of the economic well-being of the organization (Reid & Karambayya, 2009). This managerial structure has rarely been analysed by scholars in the environment of an art museum, only in performance art organizations where this practiced is much more extended. This thesis aims (1) at exploring the dual-management structure in art museums, while assessing another duality found in managerial theory: managerial orientation, towards learning goals or towards performance goals (Paunova & Svejenova, 2016). And (2) to understand this theory’s contribution to the aforementioned art against commerce duality. This will be analysed by investigating directors and museums with dual-management structure in the Netherlands. The findings suggest that a deeper and more complex analysis should be done to these theories’ applications in museum directors and art museums in order to understand the implications between them.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Dual-management', 'Art museums', 'Art versus commerce', 'Managerial orientation', 'Learning', 'Performance']"
Europa Television: the Forgotten Channel,Saskia Cluistra,2018-06-12,['Hester C. Dibbits'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Armed with the slogan ‘From Europe, for Europe’, the first European television channel went to war against (commercial) American television in 1985. Satellite technology had made it possible for broadcasters to reach audiences beyond national borders. Afraid of losing their hold on their national audiences, European national broadcasters joined forces and founded ‘Europa Television’. Together they set out to bring high quality television to the European people, to counter commercial pulp. Despite the channel’s original optimism, it lost the battle after only thirteen months of broadcasting. Millions in funds were lost and the book on the channel was closed. Yet, over thirty years later, the dream of European television has not died. When the European Commission published ‘Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture’ in November 2017, it had a special role in mind for television. The Commission believed a European television channel could bring Europeans together. With the likelihood of a revival of a European channel, this is a timely investigation into the little researched Europa Television project.
Europa Television was a European broadcasting initiative of the public broadcasters the ARD (Germany), NOS (the Netherlands), RAI (Italy), RTE (Ireland), RTP (Portugal) that aired from October 1st, 1985 until November 27th, 1986. The channel broadcasted from Hilversum, the Netherlands. This master thesis answers the question of how the channel’s identity was shaped through negotiations that helped build and break it. A special emphasis is placed on how the channel tried to create a European identity. Identity is considered as dynamic, the result of construction and as a negotiation between competing narratives of different actors and factors. In order to study these identity negotiations, Dutch newspaper articles, radio and television broadcasts, Europa Television records and, for the first time ever, Europa Television broadcasts were used.
As Europa Television came into being in the midst of the European Economic Communities’ (EEC) attempts at creating a European identity, other studies have emphasized the EEC’s role in the project. This thesis argues that claims of its heavy influence are exaggerated as the EEC had little impact on the project, notwithstanding friendly words of encouragement and a small one-time donation. Instead, it argues that the Dutch government played a crucial role in the channel’s birth and demise, a role which other authors have neglected to
4
acknowledge. Supporting of the channel with millions of guilders, the Dutch government played a fundamental part in the channel’s founding, yet their desire to protect the Dutch television system soon placed Europa Television in a difficult (financial) position.
This thesis shows that Europa Television lacked a clear identity. The channel’s vague, multi-interpretable policy plans lacked direction and caused confusion among staff. Europa Television was a European channel in name but had neither defined what it considered to be European television, nor who their European audience was. The channel tried to create a sense of European identity for its viewers by emphasising a common past and religion, as well as through informing viewers about differences between cultures in Europe. However, claims that describe the channel as propaganda do not correspondent with the results of the channel’s images analysis. Moreover, this analysis showed a mixed representation of positive and negative images on the European Economic Community and European cooperation. This thesis also shows that there was an irreconcilable divide within the Europa Television about the commercial nature of the channel. Some actors wished to reach a niche audience with high culture programming, while other actors wanted to reach larger audiences with more popular programmes. Its mission to fight Americanization was neglected by the channel as much of its programming was American.
Finally, the thesis argues that through Europa Television experienced many setbacks from external factors and actors, the channel was not ruined through negotiations, but doomed from the start due to its flawed set up.","['European television', 'European identity', 'identity negotiation', 'identity dynamics', 'organizational identity', 'Europa-TV', 'transnational television', 'Dutch broadcasting']"
Going to the Museum: A Quantitative Insight into Rotterdam Art Museum Visitors,Ada Maragno,2018-06-12,['Koen van Eijck'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis revolves art museums’ visitors, their characteristics and relation with the specific museums they visit, as well as differences with non-visitors. The theoretical framework presented intends to give an overview on the development of museums approach to their visitors in terms of openness and inclusiveness. Indeed, museums have a reputation of elitism that is believed to have kept lower classes and marginalized groups away from them during history. However, in the last decades, an attempt has been made to attract larger audiences and increase inclusiveness. Marketing strategies have been implemented and museums have largely changed their approach, focusing on the visitor experience. However, relatively few is known about visitors and their characteristics. I also suggest the use of behavioral strategies like nudging and explain their potential usefulness for cultural policies and museums specifically.
Therefore, this thesis attempts to give an insight on visitors and non-visitors of art museums in Rotterdam, namely Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Kunsthal Rotterdam and Witte de Witte Center for Contemporary Art. Through quantitative analysis of a dataset on cultural participation provided by the Municipality of Rotterdam, profiles of visitors and non-visitors of the three museums and of a general “museum variable” are created through the analysis of their socio-demographic characteristics, personality traits and other leisure activities they carry out. Results reveals that Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen’s and general museums’ visitors reflect the expectation of being generally older, richer, white and more highly educated, while Kunsthal and WdW visitors are younger, and WdW visitors are also more ethnically diverse. It is showed that this WdW peculiarity might derive from its location and from lower entrance fees, while the characteristics of Kunsthal visitors might also derive from lower fees compared to Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. Moreover, differences in visitor profiles might derive from the two museums images and “personalities” that are presented here through personal observations. The visitors’ and non-visitors’ profiles based on personality traits reveal that visitors present characteristics that might be explained through their higher level of cultural capital (they perceive themselves as more intelligent and more balanced, for instance). Because profiles of non-visitors correspond to that of less highly educated individuals who perceive themselves as less intelligent than visitors, in addition to being generally less highly educated, the use of nudging techniques are suggested to museum boards and policy makers that might be willing to enlarge their audience. These strategies are indeed suggested in cases where people might face challenging choices. Museum boards and policy makers that are willing to enlarge art museums’ audiences might therefore benefit from the results of this thesis.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Art museums', 'museum visitor and non-visitor', 'quantitative analysis', 'cultural capital', 'inclusiveness', 'Rotterdam']"
"Creativity as a tool for social integration - Case study on Les Grands Voisins, Paris",Joanna Haddad,2018-06-12,['Amanda Brandellero'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Creativity is a notion that has been addressed in academic literature as the formulation of a novel and useful idea. It is an individual capacity that can be more or less fostered by its collective environment: it is context-dependent. Following the industrial crisis of the early 1980s, and the rise of a service-based economy, creativity has been extensively used in policy making as a strategy for economic urban regeneration. This has led to the development of creative cities, in which creative-workers benefit from creativity’s economic potential, and non-creative workers are marginalized, relegated to the state of second-class citizens. In that sense, the creative city has brought new forms of social exclusion. More recently, the academic discourse on creative cities started acknowledging this problem and addressed creativity’s potential for social integration. In particular, creativity has been described as a tool for developing initiatives of social innovation. Cases of creative placemaking has been studied as using creativity to empower marginalized local communities: creativity became a way to develop resilient strategy for addressing a social change. The case of Les Grands Voisins, a creative place that combines shelter housing and creative industries, addresses the problem of social exclusion. In this context, my research aims at understanding the way that Les Grands Voisins’ creative workers perceive creativity as supporting the sheltered residents’ social integration. Hence, this research addresses the change of discourse amongst the creative class, by looking at how specific creative workers perceive creativity as a social tool. I lead a qualitative exploratory case-study and use triangulation of data collection methods, combining semi-guided interviews, on-site observations, and content analysis. The analysis of the data shows that Les Grands Voisins is a case of social innovation, in which creative workers give creativity a double dimension: collective, seeing the space as experimental and supportive of the residents’ participation in governance, and individual, as the development of creative practices with residents fosters their self-expression and empowers them. Meaning, creativity when used to answer a social need, supports the development of social dialog between segregated communities and allows social diversity. In that sense, creativity is perceived by creative workers at Les Grands Voisins as integrating the residents: it allows them to participate in the life of the community. Creative workers explain that this approach on social participation is not reflected in a broader urban context: in that sense, this research shows that creativity can represent a resilient tool for social integration, not anymore being the reason of social exclusion, but the solution to more social dialog between local communities.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'creativity', 'creative workers', 'creative city', 'social intergration', 'social innovation']"
"The Commercial Art Gallery in the Instagram
Era - 
How do commercial art galleries in Amsterdam embed
Instagram as a digital tool in their daily business practice?",Giulia Terzitta,2018-06-12,['N. Komarova'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The contemporary era is characterized by a continuous flux of changes brought by the digital
revolution that is deeply affecting our lives. These radical changes in society have not left the art
market unchanged, as it is a direct product of this world we are living in. In particular the primary art
market, whose protagonists are the art galleries, has renewed its traditional approach by introducing
in their practice the use of social media. Among all the social media, Instagram stands out being
particularly suitable for the art because of its being solely iconic and visual. Hence, it permits
retailer’s businesses to display their products in an aesthetically appealing frame. Despite the
increasing attention that Instagram is obtaining from the art world, there still is a consistent lack in
the researches on the way in which the social media is actually employed by art galleries for
businesses purposes. That is why, this research focuses on investigating how commercial art galleries
in Amsterdam are including Instagram as a digital tool in their daily business practice. The
Amsterdam art market is peculiar for its being the center of the entire Dutch art market as well as for
its art dealers’ highly traditional way of managing their businesses. In this sense, it is expected that
Instagram’s potentialities as a social networking site could challenge the traditional way of operating
of the Amsterdam art galleries. Moreover, it will be looked at how and for which purposes these
galleries are including Instagram in their everyday activities. As results it has been underscored that
the main reason why Instagram has been capitalized by these art galleries is for promotional purposes
while it is not being described as a convenient platform for doing direct sales. Furthermore, the
inclusion of Instagram within the art galleries daily practice has opened new communicational and
relational opportunities worldwide that have challenged the traditional Amsterdam art galleries
reality. In conclusion it was possible to state that since the advent of Instagram within the Amsterdam
art galleries practice some pillars of their institutional practicalities have undergone changes while
some others have remained the same.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Instagram', 'social media', 'digitalization', 'commercial art gallery', 'Amsterdam art market']"
Building Stories in the Songs - Conversations With Blues Musicians in the Low Countries,Jo Alexander,2018-06-12,['Stijn Reijnders'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This qualitative and ethnographically-informed research investigates the presence, perception, and use of music in the lives of blues musicians in the Netherlands. Unstructured interviews were held with blues musicians from different levels and stages of musical careers and data were interpreted through a combination narrative and thematic analysis. Findings reveal a composite ""backbone"" narrative with three main phases, each with specific, dominant thematic content. The identification of these phases, or narrative building blocks, makes an empirical contribution to the narrative research tradition by offering a model that connects narratives in this way without categorizing them. Additionally, the study focuses on a niche music community that is often overlooked in academia but forms a high potential group for the study of music, narrative, and identity work in combination; a focus on this type of population addresses a suggested empirical gap in popular music studies. Theoretically, this research combines music sociology and narrative theories, adding depth to the currently limited academic landscape of similar scholarship which investigates intersection points between them.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'narrative', 'music', 'identity', 'popular music', 'blues']"
"Humanizing Death -  The Fontanelle Cemetery: analyzing tourists’ motivations, experiences and evaluations",Tommaso Battimiello,2018-06-12,['Stijn Reijnders'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Thanatourism refers to the practice of visiting places connected with death, sufferance and grief. Although the label, together with dark tourism, has been strongly questioned because of its implications, it is still recognized as valid not only by academic scholarship but also by its audience. Its popularity is recently connected with the massive presence of death-related contents within mass media and mainstream cultural industry, but it is an ancient phenomenon, which can be traced back to thanatopsis, i.e. the medieval contemplation of death. Consequently, thanatourism is the practice of travelling in order to experience, directly or indirectly, the presence of death. While the explanations of the phenomenon are still at the stage of hypothesis, this field of tourism has recently seen a great increase. Started as niche tourism, it is now sharply increased to significant numbers. Even Naples, an Italian city building its tourist attractiveness on the Mediterranean joie de vivre, is experiencing an increasing number of visits to places such as catacombs, crypts and ossuaries. The Fontanelle Cemetery is one of these Neapolitan sites, a huge ossuary located in Sanità, an urban district unfortunately infamous for a high level of social exclusion and unemployment. The thousands of human remains stored in this cave, turned into an ossuary in the 19th century, became soon objects of faith. The cult of souls of Purgatory, which used to take place until 1969, featured here a specific practice: the adoption of unknown skulls. Nowadays the site is managed as part of Neapolitan cultural heritage and it attracts an increasing number of tourists year after year: what are the motives, experiences and post-visit evaluations of people visiting this site? The research aims to answer these questions through the content analysis of 27 in-depth interviews conducted with tourists of the Fontanelle Cemetery. Both autonomous tourists and tourists who joined a guided tour have been taken into analysis. Additionally, interviews with two guides from two different tours were conducted in order to grasp understanding of how the respondents may be influenced by different approaches. The content analysis suggest that the visits at the Fontanelle Cemetery are perfectly framed into the hypothesis, suggested by Seaton (2009), of dark tourism as a way to face death within a safe tourist experience. The particular atmosphere, different from any catacomb or normal cemetery, together with traditional legends connected to specific skulls, made easier for the respondents to deal with the great amount of human remains. Furthermore, as for noticed for Body Worlds (Lantermann, 2009), tourists were more likely to be reflective and meditative about the issues of human mortality and vulnerability after the visit. To conclude, the research includes suggestions for further inquiries about the role of storytelling practices in facing the fear of death and the agency of contemporary Western people within the paradigm of medicalization.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'dark tourism', 'thanatourism', 'Fontanelle Cemetery', 'Naples', 'storytelling']"
Escaping yourself while embracing yourself - An ethnographic study of the regular visitors of the Performance Bar Rotterdam,Christopher Levin Benedikt Stein,2018-06-12,['EH Bisschop Boele'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This ethnographic study revolves around the motivation, meaning-making and social interactions of regular visitor of the Performance Bar Rotterdam. Findings revealed the visitor’s perception of the Performance Bar (PB) as unique and meaningful and seperated from their “usual reality”, wherefore regulars seem to be particularly attached to the PB as a place. The promise to have a different night out, full of surprises challenges and play seems to resonate with the visitors. For them, the PB stand for a specific kind of humor, entertainment, art practice and audience engagement, which they can not get at any other cultural or nightlife venue.
Through the argumentation of differing values, visitors not only demarcate themselves from “other people”, but also from PB visitors that are not considered to be “PB people”. This indicates towards the idea of a specific core audience that associates themselves with specific values identified as “postmodern”. Regulars claim to be more than average open-minded, curious, open, respectful and “free” than other people. Through the choice for and identification with the PB some visitors argue to express their “unique” and “authentic” personality that they particularly identify with the PB community.
To seemingly fluent switch from role to role as described by postmodern scholars the “protean self” and in the PB, the roles between the performers and visitors appear to be reversed and blurry as regular visitor struggle to distinguish one from the other during a PB evening. The hosts of the Performance Bar encourage every visitor to perform on stage and to be engaged in the evenings activities by designing a play like atmosphere through the methods of improvisational theatre. A so-called “magic circle” is drawn between the PB and the “usual reality”; a spatiotemporal materialized fantasy in the frame of performance art with unclear rules and loose structure, which is “organic but also planned.” Visitors are invited to engage in the preplanned and improvised concepts, games and artistic activities proposed by the PB team and the curated performers of the evening. Social order and normality is constantly questioned, negotiated and transformed through the reoccurring play with social norms, boundaries, and awkwardness. This seems to create a specific social bonding between the visitor that leads to a “careless and free” atmosphere and a strong sense of community.
Results propose that frequent visits and engagement in the proposed play activities enables and triggers transformative learning trajectories as self-reflection and personal development.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Community-building', 'Place attachment', 'Protean self', 'Audience engagement', 'Self-expression', 'Social norms and boundaries']"
"Selecting new artists – 
A qualitative study on the roles of various forms of capital in the selection system within the popular music industry",Nina te Velde,2018-06-12,['Frans Brouwer'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The academic (and popular) literature on the various forms of capital gives a clear message: it requires a combination of cultural, social and symbolic capital to make it through as a new artist in the music industry. However, it remains unclear how these capitals relate to each other in everyday life: the precise reasons why or the circumstances under which the various forms of capital influence career development are still unclear. Besides this, the role of positive psychological capital has been largely ignored. This leads to the following research question: How do the various forms of capital of popular music artists influence the decision-making process of intermediaries in selecting new artists in the Netherlands? Subsequently, this research is a qualitative study in which the process of selection, the decision-making process of industry professionals, has been explored. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with intermediaries active inside the popular music sector in the Netherlands, including booking agencies, artist managers, and record labels, have been conducted to formulate an answer to the research question. To get in touch with these intermediaries, the ‘snowballing’ method has been used to get in contact with these informants who possess specific and relevant information on selection systems within the music industry. The recorded interviews have been transcribed and then a thematic content analysis has been conducted following the central themes – the various forms of capital – through coding and categorisation of the excerpts according to the various themes. When coming across, evaluating and eventually selecting new artists by industry professionals, cultural capital, social capital, and symbolic capital came out to be the most essential assets for an artist during the interviews. (Positive) psychological capital can be regarded as a plus, not as a necessity during the selection process, due to the changing nature of the corresponding states. Including this latter largely ignored capital, this research adds volume to tighten the research gap on the mobilisation and conversion of alternative capitals, the roles and functions of intermediaries in the music industry, and their effects on career development of new popular music artists in the Netherlands. Besides this, this research sheds light on the precise reasons why and the circumstances under which the various forms of capital influence the decision-making process of selecting. In this manner, this research adds volume onto qualitative systematic studies on the demand for artists.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'music industry', 'social capital', 'cultural capital', 'symbolic capital', 'psychological capital', 'selection system']"
"Subsidy as the holy grail?
Private museums challenging the sustainability
of non-subsidized institutions",Ella Kuijpers,2018-06-12,['Filip Vermeylen'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research investigates the role of private museums in the museum sector, which is mostly
populated by public museums, and the possible competition between these two types of organizations.
The research focuses on Dutch and Flemish private museums that exhibit visual arts. This research is
explorative, as it gives an impression of the Dutch and Flemish private museum market, by illustrating
the different actors operating at the private museum market and their diversified business strategies
and motivations to initiate a private museum. It is inductive too, as not much literature on private
museums only exists. The research answers the question whether private museums are differentiated
from public museums and whether they face competition with public museums. The main findings of
the multiple case study, performed by several in-depth interviews with directors of private museums,
are that all museums are initiated by a wealthy person or couple and therefore show a very
personalized way of running their organization. Besides, private museums are diversified
organizations compared to public museums and they do compete on the level of funding and
audiences.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'private museums', 'public museums', 'motivations', 'competition', 'differentiation']"
"Arts participation:
what is the point?",Lenka Havlenová,2018-06-12,['Frans Brouwer'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study examines the current situation concerning arts participation in Dutch visual arts museums. In order to map different perceptions of arts participation, 11 in-depth interviews were conducted. Arts participation is viewed from the perspective of educational departments and, therefore, the interviewees are all involved in educational programs development. The results confirm that there is not one single definition of arts participation and that what is understood under the term differs significantly from one museum to another. However, arts participation is regarded as an important element in museum programming and all selected museums do pay attention to participation, although the extent to which they utilize it varies. Since arts participation can take on different forms, the evident struggle is how to measure the outcomes and how to evaluate its results. Based on the individual perceptions, the study establishes an overarching definition of arts participation in the Netherlands. All in all, the impacts of arts participation are in general perceived as beneficial and they are ascribed highly positive effects.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'museum functions', 'arts participation programs', 'active engagement', 'visual arts museums']"
"THE EMERGENCE OF SOUTH-AFRICAN CONTEMPORARY
ARTISTS IN THE ART WORLD",Coline Deltreil Lacoste,2018-06-12,['Filip R.R. Vermeylen'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","While the interest of experts for the Asian art market seems to be slowing down,
scholars now seek new grounds for thoughts elsewhere. And in this otherworldliness, Africa
seems to be filling the gap left behind by the Asian giants. There is now a real excitement
regarding African Contemporary Art, well encapsulated in the city of Cape Town, South
Africa, thanks to its thriving gallery district Woodstock, annual art fair and, from September
2017, a world-class museum: the Zeitz MOCAA. All this participates in the profound shift
now undergone by South-African Contemporary Art. Yet, even though the interest in South-
African Contemporary Art is growing, with an increasing presence in international art events,
there is no clear evidence that South-African Contemporary Artists are performing better on
the international art market.
On the model of Femke Van Hest’s extensive research on the importance of
territorial factors still in force in a globalising Art World, the aim of this thesis is to analyse
the relevance of certain territorial factors at play in the emergence of South-African
Contemporary Art on the international art scene. Moreover, the subsidiary objective of this
research is to analyse a potential correlation effect that exists between international
visibility of South-African artists in the Art World and better performances on the
international art market. A strong hypothesis is that international visibility of South-African
artists in art events increases their chances to perform better on the international art
market. In addition to testing this hypothesis out, this research gives other insights regarding
South-African Contemporary Art emergence in the Art World and on the international art
market. Indeed, the present thesis compares the situation of already well-established South-
African contemporary artists, who started producing in the Apartheid era, with that of the
new generation of contemporary artists, “born free” after the Apartheid.
This research assessed the close relationship between international visibility and
commercial success of South-African artists, either established or emerging. It took into
account various major international art events at which these artists were present and the
evolution of their price list on the market. South Africa was an interesting case study since it
is globally considered as an emerging power and a leading country on the African continent,
however its contemporary art scene has received very limited attention so far compared to
other emerging countries such as China, India and Brazil.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'CONTEMPORARY ART', 'SOUTH AFRICA', 'GLOBALISATION', 'ART WORLD', 'VISIBILITY', 'COMMERCIAL SUCCESS']"
"Selecting and hosting artists in a globalizing art world - 
Experience of Cultural Programmers in the case of Artistic Residencies in The Netherlands",Nia Konstantinova,2018-06-12,['A. Brandellero'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Main research question of this study is “How do programmers in artistic residencies select and host artists in the context of globalization of the high arts?” In literature concerning high arts globalization the focus had fallen on the art markets, commercial galleries and art fairs. The current research aims to shed light on the previously unknown gatekeeping roles in not for profit organizations in the context of high arts globalization. Further, the research investigates the understudied role of the cultural programmer as an actor in the art world. Finally, this master thesis aims to create new academic insights about how artistic residencies operate. 
Empirically the research is based on nine semi-structured interviews with cultural programmers working in AiRs in The Netherlands. Grounded theory was used as analysis method, the coding took place in Atlas.ti. 
The research has shown that programmers operate in programming committees which are themselves matched to each institution by its directors. The committees are formed based on multiple considerations such as diversity in occupation, diversity in gender, social capital and work experience. Smaller residencies built a committee on national level, while larger residency aim to gather actors on international level. This shows interconnectedness between different regions, but the actors do not operate in one global field, instead each contributes to the committee with local expertise. The key findings show that the two main practices that cultural programmers engage in when selecting and hosting artists involve processes of matching and facilitating. Those practices encounter specific opportunities and constraints and are balancing act between pragmatic requirements and constraints and ideal visions.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen']"
"Gender inequality and the digital arts:
How do sexism and gender biases influence female digital artists.",Niki Georgiou,2018-06-12,['Laura Braden'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Recently, people around the globe are marching against female discriminations with a focus on the Creative and Cultural Industry (CCI) and the STEM – Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. In light of the fact of being in the 21st century while acknowledging the importance of eliminating such inequalities, this study seeks to examine the possible existence of gender inequalities in a somewhat neglected sector, the digital arts field. Digital art constitutes a contemporary art practice and thus it is highly important to examine the enclosure of such injustice behaviours in this field. Hence, by answering the essential question: “Does gender inequality exists in the digital arts scene?”, the present research aims to add in the already existent literature on gender inequality both in the workplace and in the current art world, attempting also to raise awareness on this matter.
By conducting a quantitative research, consisted of a combination of descriptive statistics and an online survey, the presence of female digital/ new media artists in well-known festivals devoted to digital arts is being examined. This research is placed under a theoretical framework pointing out to the existence of female discriminations in the CCI and the STEM, as well as the correlation of digital art with art and technology. The verified underrepresentation of female digital/ new media artists by the statistics along with the personal experiences gathered from the survey, are hinting to the existence of occupational sexism and gender biases in the digital arts field.
The positive outcome of this study in relation to gender inequality is concerning. Further research should be conducted in the digital arts field in order to examine additional types of discrimination, in order to finger to precise sociological issues in an effort to recognize them and thus be able to overcome them. Gender inequality as all types of inequalities and discriminations should be at least occasional situations and not the main pattern in such times.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'digital art', 'new media art', 'gender inequality', 'sexism', 'gender bias']"
What knits a theatre and its volunteers together?,Sue Robinson,2018-06-12,['Evert Bisschop Boele'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Retired people have time to give and seek fulfilling activities providing fun and structure. Volunteering is popular in the United Kingdom and an increasingly ageing population potentially provides a pool of willing support. In some cases, volunteers give immense amounts of time, freely. My research asks what knits together a theatre and its volunteers? Taking an ethnographic approach with a modified grounded theory I conducted interviews with a cohort of retired people who volunteer in a theatre, in a market town in rural northern England. I offer visual metaphors regarding how they navigated their transitions from the world of paid work into a third phase of life, how they made meaning for themselves during that journey and the role a theatre plays in that process. In studying these visual metaphors, I propose that what knits together a theatre and its volunteers is buzz, fun and commitment, created through a relationship by which mutual needs are met and fulfilled.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Volunteering', 'theatre', 'retirement', 'culture', 'England']"
"OUTSIDER ART IN CONTEMPORARY MUSEUMS:
THE CELEBRATION OF POLITICS OR ARTISTRY?",Lara Tanke,2018-06-12,['B. Boross'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Outsider Art is booming in the legitimate, contemporary art world (Tansella, 2007; Chapin, 2009). Contrary to Insider Art -objects that are created by trained artists on the basis of accepted, pre-existing concepts, frameworks or representations-, Outsider Art is made by untrained artists who create for no-one but themselves by reacting to internal, not external, prerequisites. It is their individual quirkiness and idiosyncrasy that stands out and for that reason, Outsider Art is celebrated because of the authentic autobiography of the maker. As Outsider Art is not based on a goldmine of traditions” (Tansella, 2007, p. 134) such as a predetermined vision and a stylistic framework -as it is the case with Insider Art-, gatekeepers want to make sure that audiences are aware of the difference between the oppositional categories: they deconstruct the aesthetic system by justifying the objects on the basis of the artist’s biography.
The art evaluation of audience is affected by the authority that cultural institutions and the cultural elite enjoy when it comes to their legitimizing power to turn objects in to art (Becker, 1982; Bourdieu, 1984). Considering the unconventional way of curating, however, audiences might feel a tension between what art ought to be and the justification of it by the artist’s biography. It is argued that they celebrate the works because of their “unusual quality […] and out of sympathy for the suffering artists” (Polling, 2015, p. 8), however, there is a gap in the literature that points out how audiences experience and reflect on the centralization of the artists’ biography in their evaluation of the Outsider objects being made. Biography and context run to a certain extent always through exhibitions, yet how much biography is needed to consider objects as art? Therefore, the aim of this research is to find out how visitors experience the place and role of Outsider Art exhibitions in contemporary museums and their predominant focus on the artist’s biography?
In total, 11 participants were recruited at the Outsider Art Museum in Amsterdam. The museum run an exhibition in which the biography of the artists was placed in limelight. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted, and the data derived from these was analyzed by using Grounded Theory (GT) in the first round and Thematic Analysis (TA) in the second round. It was found that context about the artist’s biography does matter, yet not solely on the basis of how the dominant, Insider culture these interpreted: a dialogue with the artists themselves is essential to understand who the Outsider is and for what reason(s) they created what is being portrayed on the canvas. This is specifically useful for the emancipation of the artists, yet not really necessary for the appreciation of the art works: these can be presented on their own to be evaluated as ‘good’ art. This suggests that Outsider Art is more than just the biography of the maker.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Outsider Art', 'artist’s biography', 'justification', 'emancipation', 'dialogue']"
"The new kids on the block
Een onderzoek naar de mate van populisme in het taalgebruik van en de berichtgeving over Jesse Klaver en Thierry Baudet",E. Vonk,2018-06-12,['N. Ruigrok'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het aantal populistische partijen in Europa groeit hard, zo ook in Nederland (Rooduijn, 2014). Tijdens de afgelopen Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2017 en de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen van 2018 wordt het populisme in Nederland vooral gekenmerkt door twee ‘new kids on the block’: links-populist Jesse Klaver en rechts-populist Thierry Baudet. Door middel van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse is in dit onderzoek onderscheid gemaakt tussen berichtgeving in aanloop naar de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van maart 2017 en de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen van maart 2018. Er is gekeken naar de mate van populisme in de Facebookberichten van Klaver en Baudet en in de berichtgeving over hen in dagbladen. Klaver uit zich tijdens de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen populistischer dan tijdens de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen en focust voornamelijk op het populistische kenmerk ‘volk’. Baudet daarentegen focust op de kenmerken ‘elite’ en ‘outgroups’. De berichtgeving over Klaver en Baudet is tijdens de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen populistischer dan tijdens de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen en media zijn bovendien populistischer op hun websites dan op hun Facebookpagina’s. Naast de traditionele aspecten van het populistisch frame is er expliciet gekeken naar het gebruik van metaforen. Klaver gebruikt vaker metaforen dan Baudet en ook zijn er verschillen in type metaforen tussen de politici. Daarnaast is berichtgeving waarin het issue ownership van politici tot uitdrukking komt populistischer dan berichtgeving waarin dit niet gebeurt. Tussen de twee type verkiezingscampagnes op de Facebookpagina’s van de politici en in de traditionele media zijn daarnaast geen verschillen gevonden in de mate waarin inhoudelijke onderwerpen aan bod komen, wat gevolgen heeft voor de journalistiek. De resultaten laten zien dat er voor journalisten een rol is weggelegd om meer bewust te zijn van hun waakhondfunctie. Journalisten laten zich in een aantal gevallen leiden door de nieuwswaarden op sociale media, wat tot populisme in berichtgeving kan leiden. Een te grote hoeveelheid populisme kan een gevaar zijn voor de democratie (Muller, 2016) en dit is iets waar journalisten en burgers zich bewust van moeten zijn.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Populisme', 'framing', 'metaforen', 'issue ownership', 'Facebook']"
"Visueel LinkedIn
Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar hoe beeldgebruik gebruikers motiveert zich te verbinden aan
een service georiënteerd merk",C. van den Bor,2018-06-01,['M. Slot'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Binnen de huidige aandachtseconomie wordt het verkrijgen van aandacht in de online
omgeving bemoeilijkt door de enorme stroom aan informatie. Met name sociale mediakanalen laten
een ontwikkeling van informatiesaturatie zien, omdat de inrichting van deze platformen leidt tot het in
hoog tempo kunnen consumeren, produceren en verspreiden van de berichtgeving. Ook LinkedIn laat
een explosieve groei zien van de hoeveelheid content, waardoor bedrijven moeilijkheden ervaren met
het verkrijgen van een verbintenis met de gebruiker. Een toenemend aantal bedrijven tracht zich te
onderscheiden door een service-­‐oriëntatie, waarbij in de communicatie wordt ingespeeld op de
emoties van de ontvanger. Beeld lijkt hiervoor een belangrijk element te zijn, omdat het de sociale
dimensies van het bericht versterkt door het oproepen van emoties. Het zijn namelijk deze emoties,
die de betrokkenheid bij het bericht bevorderen. Desalniettemin blijkt er nog maar beperkte
praktische kennis te zijn over hoe beeld op LinkedIn kan worden ingezet om de mate van engagement
te vergroten.
Dit kwalitatieve onderzoek is middels semigestructureerde face-­‐to-­‐face diepte-­‐interviews
ingegaan op de vraag hoe beeldgebruik op LinkedIn gebruikers motiveert zich te verbinden aan een
service georiënteerd merk zoals de Hartstichting. Hieruit bleek dat de mate van engagement in
verbinding staat met de gebruikersmotivaties van de professional. Het verkrijgen en delen van kennis
is namelijk één van de voornaamste gebruikersmotivaties voor de professional voor het raadplegen
van LinkedIn. Om deze reden wordt er dan ook grote waarde gehecht aan de professionaliteit en
betrouwbaarheid van de visuele berichtgeving. Indien het beeld voldoende informatie overbrengt, zet
dit aan tot een verbintenis met het merk, wat duidt op de cognitieve factor van engagement.
Daarnaast blijkt dat de visuele component van het bericht een aanspraak kan doen op de
emotionele betrokkenheid van de professional middels verhalende aspecten of door persoonlijke
identificatie met het beeld. Dit duidt op de affectieve factor van engagement. Ook blijkt de
weergavetechniek een belangrijke rol te hebben voor het verkrijgen van een verbintenis, omdat
hierdoor gemakkelijk de juiste verwachtingen bij het bericht kunnen worden gevormd. Zo worden
illustraties in verband gebracht met de informatieve laag van het bericht en spelen foto’s in op het
gevoel. Tot slot kan kleur ook bijdragen aan het creëren van de juiste verwachtingen bij het bericht,
omdat het wordt gekoppeld aan het algemene beeld bij de zender ervan. Kleur leidt dus indirect tot
bepaalde associaties bij het merk en begrip betreffende de kwaliteit van het verdere bericht.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Aandachtseconomie', 'service georiënteerd merk', '(media) engagement', 'gebruikersmotivaties', 'LinkedIn', 'beeld']"
Jezelf zijn.,M.S.H. Steegmans,2018-05-29,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Being yourself. A quest for personal identity.
In modern society people care about their ‘self’ or their ‘personal identity’. But what is personal identity? And what is an authentic self as a modern ideal? Jean-Paul Sartre believes in an atheist existentialism causing man to have ‘radical free choice’ and therefore empowering man to design its own ‘essence’. Charles Taylor, however, disagrees and states radical free choice would just be a simple, effortless consideration. He suggests man needs to use strong evaluations of their desires to choose a ‘way of existence’ and subsequently deciding on its personal identity. Jan Bransen partly agrees, but indicates the necessity of a ‘horizon of meaning’ to help man make its decisions and doing so, obtaining authenticity. This thesis discusses these different philosophers’ theories and services as a starting point for everyone interested in the authenticity of the personal identity as a modern ideal.",
"Public transport and media innovation:
a platform perspective",K. Arendsen,2018-05-26,['M. Leenderse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research examines how public transport companies can innovate their business models by
investigating how platform principles could be used to add value to their customers. Platform
principles are basic concepts that explain general characteristics and practices of online platforms.
The increased usage of online platforms has impacted various industries, disrupting existing business
models and market structures. With respect to public transport and mobility in general, online
platform are becoming the main access points to mobility while at the same time they also facilitate
new forms of mobility and integrate these with existing types of transport. Within literature
addressing online platforms, most studies focus on the question how platforms as external parties
enter and affect existing markets. This research seeks to contribute to this literature by adopting the
viewpoint of public transport companies within such existing market. Given the growing importance
of online platforms in today’s society and their potential to rearrange the way mobility is organised, it
is essential for public transport companies to reconsider their strategies. Instead of letting the entrance
of external online platforms happen to them, how can public transport companies in the Netherlands
strategically make use of platform principles to innovate their business models?
To answer this question, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten experts whose field
of expertise relate to strategy in public transport.
The findings reveal that application of platform principles by public transport companies has the
potential to create a significant amount of added benefit for passengers. As public transport generally
operates according to fixed routes and timetables, tailored communication and help on how such
inflexible type of transportation fits one’s personal needs can truly add value. Where public transport
companies typically tended to focus on efficiency of their operations, platform principles provide the
means to shift towards a more passenger centred view and respond to increasing importance of
platforms within the mobility sector. Furthermore, by applying platform principles, public transport
companies can contribute to the organisation of integrated mobility services, which is often referred to
as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS). Within such a system, public transport companies can aim for
different strategic positions. This research identified several factors that are of significance in this
strategic process.","['media', 'cultuur', 'online platforms', 'public transport', 'mobility-as-a-service', 'business model innovation', 'public transport companies']"

globally. These museums are often founded by High Net Worth Individuals and are, as opposed to
traditional museums, not accountable to any external stakeholders. Therefore, their performance
objectives make for an interesting research topic. This study aimed to map out what performance
objectives private contemporary art museums have by, first, developing a Performance Objectives
Framework of Museums, consisting of 5 dimensions, namely Managerial, Commercial, Artistic,
Societal and Reputational Performance. Second, developing a Table of Characteristics of Private
Contemporary Art Museums, consisting of 7 characteristics, namely Content, Size, Age, Institutional
Form, Founder(s), Motivation and Location. After, both were used to create an interview guide to
conduct semi-structured interviews with 7 museum directors and employees of private contemporary art
museums. To create a more representative sample, secondary data was added, namely 9 extra interviews
from an academic and semi-academic source. The transcripts were subsequently coded with an
operationalization derived from the previously developed Performance Objectives Framework of
Museums and Table of Characteristics of Private Contemporary Art Museums. After data analysis the
results were used to create a new framework, namely the Performance Objectives Framework of Private

"A European Culture War?
Understanding Anti-Establishment Politics as Opposi-tion to Cultural Elitism",K. Noordzij,2018-05-07,"['J. van der Waal', 'W. de Koster']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Anti-establishment politics, that is, little support for political institutions and having affinity with far-right parties, is noticeable across European democracies. The rationalist approach has been most dominant for explaining political trust, arguing that differences in political competence and countries’ democratic performance underlie educational disparities in politi-cal trust. Yet, many accounts point to the importance of anti-elitism for understanding anti-establishment politics. In this study, I theorize and test a cultural approach. This approach underlines that the political establishment’s culturally progressive attitudes permeate the in-stitution it represents and that the public, and among it particularly those who have least af-finity with these culturally progressive values, perceives this as cultural superiority signaling by the political elite. They will, in turn, mock and ridicule the political elite for its perceived claims of cultural superiority. As a result, support for anti-establishment politics in Europe can be understood as a deeply-rooted cultural conflict, a European culture war, where the pol-iticians’ cultural progressiveness is perceived as cultural superiority signaling which the less-er-deemed ‘cultural inferiors’ resist. My study fulfills three goals. 1) Most importantly, I in-troduce and empirically test a novel cultural approach to support for anti-establishment poli-tics. 2) At the same time I systematically test the rationalist approach against this novel framework 3) as well as empirically assess its scope by applying it not only to political trust, but far-right affinity as well. To this end I perform multilevel linear and logistic regression analyses using the European Social Survey, enriched with country-level data and expert sur-vey data (Chapel Hill Expert Survey, Eurostat, the World Bank Group, and the Corruption Perceptions Index). The results of my analyses suggest that reasonable evidence for a Euro-pean culture war exists. My study finds more far-right affinity in countries where cultural elitism in party politics is more pertinent as well as little support for political institutions among those with least affinity with the culturally progressive attitude of the elite, especially in countries where party politics is characterized by cultural elitism more strongly. The ra-tionalist approach’s hypotheses are largely corroborated for support for political institutions, while this approach fails to predict far-right affinity. I conclude with recommendations for future studies that should explicate the limitations found for both approaches as well as the extent in which political competence constitutes a mark of elitism itself.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'Support for political institutions', 'far-right politics', 'elite-public linkage', 'cultural elitism', 'cor-ruption.']"

ICT and New business formation in Low and Lower middle-income countries,"Assen, H.F. (hayat)",2018-04-02,['Nagler P. (Paula)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Entrepreneurship is considered as important factor of economic growth and development and has recently gained the attention of politicians and policy makers in developed and developing countries alike. Yet the existing literature of entrepreneurship development is concentrated in developed countries. This study sheds light on what drives entrepreneurial development in the form of new business formation in low and lower middle-income countries.  Investigation of the abilities of individuals to spot entrepreneurial opportunities has been the focus of previous studies of entrepreneurship. Recently, the focus of entrepreneurship studies has shifted towards exploring the role of knowledge spillovers and complementarities in opening entrepreneurial opportunities. ICTs serve as the main tools of knowledge management and diffusion in today’s knowledge based and globalized economies.  The aim of the study is to investigate the role of ICTs in fostering new business creation in the low and lower middleincome countries. It also attempts to identify which forms of ICT are most important to which regions. The role of the institutional factors namely business regulatory frameworks, transparency and accountability of the public sector, cost of start-up procedures, access to finance and time to start a business are analysed.  The study uses the World Bank development indicators and doing business datasets for 42 low and lower middle-income countries. The data is analysed using IV fixed effects and GMM regression techniques.   The study finds that internet, measured by density of fixed broadband subscriptions, has positive effect on new business formation in low and lower middle-income countries. This indicates that entrepreneurial knowledge could be disseminated through usage of ICTs which intern promotes exploitation of new business opportunities. This finding supports the theory of opportunity entrepreneurship. Dissection of the results by region shows that access to internet can foster entrepreneurship in Asia while access to ICT goods is important in Africa. This could be due to relatively more pronounced knowledge spill-over in Asia because of the existence of large modern industries in countries like Japan, Korea and China, while improving data management and communications using computer and cell phone, for example, is more important in Africa.  The result in general supports the entrepreneurship theory of knowledge spill-over, which postulates that knowledge production and spillover creates entrepreneurship opportunities, and that ICTs play important role in the dissemination of entrepreneurial knowledge.  Moreover, ICT could also promote entrepreneurship by enabling better work organization and information communication even in regions, such as Africa, where there is limited possibility for knowledge spillover.","['New business formation', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Information and Communication Technology', 'Knowledge spillover']"
"Niets is leefbaar: Religie, Heroïek en Uitputting",Tim Meeuws,2018-03-19,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"In this thesis I will formulate what finitude means in the work of Kierkegaard, Heidegger and, ultimately and primarily, Beckett. Kierkegaard and Heidegger were the greatest thinkers concerning the notion of death and mortality. However, although Kierkegaard and Heidegger give much attention to despair concerning death in their works and how to overcome this despair, Beckett doesn´t offer the reader a solution. Beckett lets his characters succumb under the pressure of existential despair. All three, Kierkegaard, Heidegger and Beckett show us how despair works, in other words: how to put the experience of existential despair in words. Despite the fact they all write on despair and what happens when one despairs, Beckett is transfixed on despair: despairingly the despaired keep on despairing: there is no way out. What would a way out mean? Is a way out something that we could still discursively substantiate? Instead of offering a way out of our existential despair, Beckett exhausts every way out and leaves us, his readers, exhausted.",

The continuous unrest in the region has transformed and is trans-forming livelihoods of the people living there. Agriculture is the major source of income but insecurity, low earning, labour shortage and aspirations for better living out village is creating disinterest among rural youth. This research paper studies contestations of rural youth migration, stay in the context of conflict in Kurram. For that purpose, research focuses on three aspects of rural youth in-volvement in farming in context of war in a small village in Kurram Agency, FATA. The study explores various factors pushing youth from farming and tying it to rural area. The paper argues that there are various forms of livelihood strat-egies been carried out by combining farm and non-farm activities. Which indi-cates that people are leaving farming but at the same time they are also staying in farming. It is evident that youth has no interest in farming and even those who are farming are in term of waithood, where youth shift roles inside house-hold, cropping patterns are being changed to decrease drudgery but despite of all these strategies and transformation for the moment rural youth in Bilyamin, Kurram are maintaining farming as only alternative.","['Generation', 'Agrarian Change', 'Migration', 'FATA']"

Ethiopia","Legesse, Birhane Hailemichael",2017-12-15,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Human security is a new concept introduced by UNDP in 1994. This concept is sought to address 
security issue by focusing primarily on human individual as a referent of security rather than 
concentrating exclusively on the state security. Individual/people have been forced to flee from 
their home country as a result of conflict, Political instability, economic hardship and human 
rights violation. These people have been looking for safe place to stay and secures their lives. 
Eritrean refugees are among them who are looking for better environment and better survival. The 
study is aimed to answer the following research questions. How the government of Ethiopia, the 
UNHCR and the Eritrean refugees themselves view the refugees’ situation in relation to human 
security? How and to what extent do the government of Ethiopia and UNHCR seek to promote freedom 
from want and freedom from fear of Eritrean refugees? What are Eritrean refugees’ core concerns in 
the camp in relation to their ‘human security’? Do they consider freedom from fear and/or freedom 
from fear as more important? To answer these questions two in-depth interview with protection 
office from the government of Ethiopia and protection officer from UNHCR were conducted. In-depth 
interview with 12 refugees were also employed to understand their perceptional and experiences of 
camp live. Apart from this, secondary data from UNHCR, from the Government of Ethiopia and other 
literatures were used to analyze the data. Based on the finding, the Ethiopian government is 
performing well in protecting the refugees from physical violence. But there are gender based 
sexual violence among the refugees themselves. Nonetheless, in creating job opportunity and 
integrating the refugees with the local communities nothing is done by the Ethiopian government. 
This has caused by the lack of provision of social services in the camp. Shelter, food and 
employment opportunities are the sever problems of Eritrean refugees in the camp. The key 
responsibility of the UNHCR is providing protection and seeking permanent solution for the problems 
of the refugees. However, providing the international protection mainly shelter is insufficient in 
the camp. Moreover, there is very little durable solution of protracted refugees in the camp.","['Human security', 'Refugees', 'protection', 'May-Ayni refugee camp']"

Ghanaian economy is dependent on natural resource exports and its implication for growth as well
as how the production of oil which began in 2010 has affected the economy. Examination of export
composition shows a heavy dependence on natural resource export dominated by gold, cocoa and
recently crude oil which makes the economy vulnerable to price volatility. Reflecting on previous
argument and examination of net barter terms of trade indicates that, as a resource-based commodity
exporting country, the terms of trade has been volatile over the years. Production of crude
oil has been associated with increased economic growth and human capital accumulation while
recent slowdown in growth is attributable to falling crude prices.","['economic growth', 'natural resource dependence', 'resource curse', 'exports', 'terms of trade', 'Ghana', 'crude oil']"

The Positive Sisters program in the Netherlands","Mariga, Amanda",2017-12-15,['Rieger Matthias'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Retention in HIV care is a crucial element in the effectiveness of HIV treatment
and care strategies. Barriers to care exist for various key populations such as sub-
Saharan African migrants in developed countries. Peer support has become an
essential component in bridging the gap between formal health care services and
barriers to HIV care. This research paper studies the role of the Positive Sisters
peer support program in the Netherlands that focuses on migrant women from
sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, in retention in HIV care. The study explores
the behavioural processes that influence decision making of participants
towards retention and adherence outcomes and how the program interacts with
these processes. The study employs a behavioural economics framework and a
qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews with 30 program participants
and 2 key informants. The findings suggest that despite diminishing
utility to program consumption, the positive sisters program helps retain women
in HIV care through a process of various elements. Three behavioural processes that threaten retention to care and adherence outcomes were identified; selfcontrol,
time inconsistency and mental models. In addition, the program is aware
of the behavioural processes and the barriers to care for this key population.
However, lack of adequate financial funding remains a barrier to scaling up the
program and introducing new activities for program participants. Moreover, the
findings of this study remain suggestive due to self-selection bias from program
entry and lack of a control group to compare outcomes.","['HIV', 'peer support', 'retention', 'adherence', 'positive sister', 'match', 'SHivA.']"
"The Impact of Microfinance: 
Evidence from Eritrea",Nemariam Yohanes Mengistu,2017-12-15,['Bedi Arjun'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Since 1996, a saving and Microcredit Program (SMCP), has been operational in Eritrea.
Until now no comprehensive impact assessment has been conducted on the program. The
objectives of this study are to: (a) ascertain the determinants of household decision to
participate early in the program; (b) identify the factors that influence loan size; (c)
determine the impact of SMCP as well as the effect of duration of exposure, loan cycle and
loan size on the welfare of the participating households in terms of income, expenditure,
household asset acquisition, housing improvement and monthly enterprise sales. The study
relies on a cross-sectional household survey that was conducted in 2016.

The findings indicate that age, perception of SMCP timeline on loan disbursement
and formal education positively and significantly affect early participation in SMCP.
Regionally, Anseba region is less likely to influence early participation in SMCP. Tesseney
region, Bilen ethnicity, individual loan, duration of exposure and formal education
appeared to have positive and significant influence on the loan size of SMCP clients.
Furthermore the study confirmed SMCP has a positive and significant impact on
household asset acquisition and housing improvement of its borrowers.

The paper also analysed the effect of duration of exposure in the program, loan
cycle and loan size on the outcome variables. The results show that duration of exposure,
specific year of exposure and specific loan cycle have significant effect on household asset
and housing improvement. Moreover dummy loan cycle and loan size have positive and
significant effect on income. While duration of exposure and loan size have positive and
significant effect on monthly total enterprise sales. However only duration of exposure has
significant effect on monthly household expenditure.","['Household', 'Microfinance', 'MFIs', 'SMCP and outcome variables']"
"Industrialisation and economic growth, a
missing link or a missing point?
Reflections about the Latin American case at the
beginning of the 21st century","Montagu, Haroldo",2017-12-15,['Fischer Andrew'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Echoing recent analyses on deindustrialisation, in this paper I assess the
apparent delink between manufacturing and economic growth for six Latin
American countries during the first decade of the 2000s century. I frame the
analysis in both Post-Keynesian and Structuralist tradition given the paramount
role these schools of thought grant to industrialisation for achieving high economic
growth rates. Findings show, first, that quantitative analysis based on the
study of growth rates and productivities is non-conclusive to understand
whether or not manufacturing kept working as an engine of growth in the region.
Second, beyond the quantitative link, attention needs to be taken in the insertion
of Latin America in the global production networks to understand the role that
industrialisation is playing in economic growth in recent times. While
deindustrialisation only reflects a statistical evolution of manufacturing shares
predicted by both Post-Keynesian and Structuralism, the link between
industrialisation and economic growth in Latin America in the 21st century must
be understood as a new phase of peripherical industrialisation posing new and
old challenges for achieving positive structural change within the region.","['Industrialization', 'Deindustrialization', 'Structural change', 'Economic growth', 'Latin America']"

Why Complain? The Accountability of Public and Private Schools in India,"Dhakal, Sadish",2017-12-15,['Bedi Arjun S.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The accountability of schools in developing countries has captured the attention of researchers. Concurrently, a body of literature has devoted itself to studying the effect of information on accountability in the schooling system, and in other domains of public service. A subset of the studies considering the effect of information proposes that information leads service recipients to complain, which in turn improves outcomes. In this thesis, I ask whether households in India are able to raise the test scores of their children by complaining at schools in a context where households do not have accurate information on their children’s competencies, and where teachers might not find the threat of complaints credible. I find no evidence that complaints raise test scores. However, I find evidence that complaints lead households to perceive improvements in their children’s competencies, even when the improvements did not occur. I conclude that information symmetry and credible threats are both necessary, if not sufficient, for complaints to cause improvements in outcomes.",
"The Contradictions of Capital in Rezoning and
Affordable Housing Policies:
A Case Study of East New York","Garrett, Melinda",2017-12-15,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Between a rapidly growing population and costs of rents rising faster than
income levels, New York City is in the middle of a housing crisis. With a large
amount of its population rent burdened, the city is exploring new ways to
create and preserve affordable housing. This case study examines how the
city’s most recent approach of rezoning has affected the neighborhood of East
New York, its access to affordable housing, and its low-income residents
ability to be able to maintain a space within the neighborhood. By framing this
research within the right to the city and political economy approaches, the
paper explores how social, political, economic, and spatial structures influence
rezoning and affordable housing. It also looks at housing in capitalism, and
how the circulation, social relation, and ideology of capital have guided the
process that the city has engaged in. Specifically looking at the mechanisms
used, with attention paid to a new policy of mandatory inclusionary housing,
and weighing these against the question of who benefits and who is excluded
from the rezoning, shows how the rezoning and preservation of affordable
housing end up in conflict with one another. This paper suggests additional
mechanisms to be able to increase the effectiveness of the policy, as well as a
general reframing of the approach as a more bottom up, inclusive, community
development directed policy that prioritizes the preservation of current
affordability levels, and community development at same level of importance
as new market based development.","['Affordable Housing', 'Rezoning', 'Right to the City', 'Political Economy', 'Gentrification', 'Displacement', 'Capital', 'Urban']"

child-focused policy and indigenous knowledge change will be examined
through three aspects of constructing childhood: children as economic contributors,
the child gendered concepts of “becoming someone,” and the child
as social order agent. This analysis brings into the discourse the childhood narratives
of “being” and “becoming” someone they need to be to navigate market-
tradition aspirations and negotiate the complexity of their community‟s religious

the social life of members in post-genocide society. The focus of this
qualitative study is to understand how marital conflict of survivors and perpetrators
of the genocide against Tutsi in 1994 in Rwanda affects marital identity
of descendants. The study was conducted in two Districts (Muhanga and
Rukindo) and is based on interviews with 20 research participants comprising
of 12 survivor and perpetrator parents and 8 descendants with equal number
of males and females. The study uses psychosocial approaches and gender
theories for data analysis and interpretation. The following are the summarized
findings: The genocide related relational trauma of survivors and perpetrators
limits them to perform their parenthood responsibilities in such a
way that they are biological parents but in far less degree able to be social
parents. Secondly, the marital conflict of parents results in descendants having
an ambivalent attitude towards marital identity. The parents’ marital conflict
as perpetrators or survivors contributes to descendants’ acceptance of
people with different identities which contributes to conflict transformation
and peace-building from family and community level. Thirdly, widows, separated
survivors, or women with husbands in prison learned to live their own
life which increasing self-esteem and ability to use their agency to achieve
their life goals – not as wives but as women in their own right. They are empowered.","['Genocide', 'marital conflict', 'identity theory', 'trauma', 'peace-building', 'empowerment', 'Rwanda']"
Representation of ‘Masculinities’ in Bombay Cinema: Millennial Men.

nationalist identity through the gendered discourse.
The societal shift in masculinities in the 1990s and the 2000s, when compared
to the masculinities in the film, show strong parallels between the reality and
media portrayals of reality. Narratives of the New Man mark the transition
from hegemonic forms of masculinities and nationalisms to diverse and
adaptive embodiment of gender. The nationalist discourse on Indian
masculinities reveal an overlap between the performance of gender and
nationalism with similar historical trajectories. An amalgamation of Indian
masculinities, Indian Nationalism, Bombay cinema and critical film theory has

Representing Sexual Transactions in Times of the 'Cuban Thaw'. The Legitimisation of Sexuality Regulation in Cuba's Anti-Trafficking and HIV Prevention Strategies,"Wagner, Maria",2017-12-15,['Heumann Silke'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In its resistance to colonial/imperial injustices, the Cuban revolutionary government
has appropriated the fight for gender and sexual justice, and ´opened up´
towards feminist concerns, such as gender equality and respect for diverse sexual
orientations. Yet, the states´ ´prostitution politics´ continue to police – often
violently – gendered, sexualised, and racialised bodies under the disguise of ´saving
´ the ´victims´ from ´trafficking´ – whether the persons involved see themselves
as such or not. From a sex-positive, intersectional feminist, and poststructuralist
understanding of gender, sexuality, and the state, this research juxtaposes
the dominant ´prostitution-as-trafficking´ discourse with the seemingly
incompatible, and ´invisibilised´ public health discourse on ´transactional sex´.
Following principles of Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis, I map these discourses
by investigating what ´the problem´ with sexual transactions is represented
to be in Cuba´s contemporary anti-trafficking and HIV-prevention strategies,
which policy ´solutions´ are suggested, and which discursive,
subjectification, and lived effects follow from these representations. This research
allows me to shed light on how the Cuban government navigates contradicting
revolutionary discourses and portrays itself as a legitimate regulator of
sexuality before the international community.","['prostitution', 'sex work', 'Jineterismo', 'transactional sex', 'trafficking', 'HIV', 'AIDS', 'gender', 'sexuality', 'race', 'Cuba', 'state', 'sex-positivity', 'feminism', 'intersectionality']"
Return Migration in Post-Conflict Colombia: Unpacking Government and Media Discourses,"Cardenas Solano, Ivanna",2017-12-15,['Biekart Kees'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In Colombia, a civil conflict enduring for six decades promised to come to an end in 2016 when
the Colombian government and guerrilla party FARC for the first time in the history of the conflict
agreed to negotiate peace. A series of events ensued that promised a long yearned for condition of
peace for Colombia; this included the adoption of a peace agreement and a plebiscite as democratic
tool allowing Colombian citizens to choose to support or oppose the agreement. This period of
political change brought with it concerns about the involvement of Colombians residing abroad
in the peacebuilding process. Focusing on the publications of the Colombian government and
national media during this period of political change, this research captured the first steps in the
peacebuilding process, focusing particularly on the return of nationals living in Ecuador to
Colombia. Bringing together theories on migration, peacebuilding and media representation, the
case study of Colombia allowed for an overview of the end of a long-enduring conflict that had
generated large-scale forced displacement outside and within the Colombian territory. The end of
the conflict through the peace agreement announced the inclusion of emigrants in the
peacebuilding process, particularly through the return of those victims that had left the country
due to the conflict. However, restoring the bond between a sending country and its population
abroad implies systematic efforts to change beliefs related to war that are embedded in the society.
Therefore, the communication of the Colombian government and national media with nationals
residing abroad was explored by means of a discourse analysis focused on the comprehension of
intentions, interpretations and choices of the dialogues between these parties and Colombian
civilians that are victims to the conflict. The findings showed that the discourses of both
government and media sources fluctuated according to three specific events: the signing of the
peace agreement, the plebiscite following the peace agreement, and the granting of the Nobel
Peace Prize to Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. As a result, expected and unexpected
controversies altered the storyline of the peace process.","['Migration', 'Return Migration', 'Victims', 'Peace Agreement', 'Post-Conflict', 'Peacebuilding']"
"The Role of Inequality, Diversity, and Social Capital towards Incidence of Crime and Conflict
Panel Data Analysis from 313 Villages in Indonesia","Setyobudi, Christal Ayu Karuniya",2017-12-15,['Murshed Mansoob S.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Developing countries are often hurdled with conflict or crime that impedes so-cial cohesion and therefore hindering them to grow. Many literatures have dis-cussed its cause but the consensus is yet to be reached. Moreover, numerous studies focus on the economic and diversity aspect but not a lot is paying atten-tion to social capital. This research tries to contribute to the discussion by ana-lysing the causes of conflict and crime from 313 village level data that represents 83% of the population in Indonesia considering three variables: vertical inequal-ity proxied by poverty rate, social diversity in terms of ethnicity and religion, as well as social capital. With panel data regressions, this paper found that income inequality is to certain extent able to explain the increase of the number of inci-dence of theft, robbery, and conflicts in relation to land and building. Further-more, the lack of social capital is shown to be positively correlated with increas-ing incidence of crime such as sexual assault. In contrast, there is no strong evidence that social diversity plays a role in the increasing incidence. While the results are not meant to be generalized, from here one could infer that in order to reduce crime and conflict, it is worth for policy makers to address the root cause of income inequality, try to introduce community-based solution that en-courage social capital, and start seeing diversity as an asset instead of divider that triggers incidence.","['Inequality', 'social capital', 'diversity', 'conflict', 'crime', 'vertical inequality', 'horizontal inequality', 'polarization', 'fractionalization', 'ethnicity', 'religion', 'relative deprivation theory', 'poverty', 'Indonesia', 'resource mobilization theory', 'social control theory', 'expected utility theory', 'heterogeneity', 'panel data', 'social cohesion']"

have faced threats or actual evictions, notably in 2014 in the slums of
Namuwongo and Banda in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. The study suggests
that slum women displaced find themselves more than ever unable to improve
or maintain their own socio-economic status and livelihoods. Fieldwork, based
on almost thirty interviews with a range of stakeholders, revealed the limitations
of available formal and informal income-generating activities for displaced slum
women. Their livelihood options were confined to charcoal selling, local brewing,
vegetable hawking and prostitution, forms of economic activities that do
not necessarily offer the women any way out of their economic and livelihood
insecurity. This study found that poor socio-economic conditions faced in slum
areas worsened for almost all the women, because of the way slum demolitions
were handled. Empirical findings of the study suggest no compensation was provided,
and there was no rehousing. There are now few prospects for legal or
other redress for the women most affected, because they lacked property rights
in slum areas. As a result, their indebted situations have worsened and so have
the coping strategies. In addition to finding the women have been disempowered
in terms of socio-economic status, by the slum demolitions, the study also highlights
the government’s responsibility in relation to poor women, who should
also have a “right to the city”.","['Women', 'Slum', 'Slum Dwellers', 'Livelihoods', 'Sustainable Livelihoods', 'Insecurity', 'Vulnerability', 'Socio-economic', 'Social exclusion', 'Demolition', 'Employment', 'Rights', 'Uganda']"
"The Impact of Basic Infrastructure on Tax Effort: A Case Study of
Municipalities/Regencies in Indonesia","Wardana, Arief Budi",2017-12-15,['Pellegrini Lorenzo'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Discussions of tax morale emerge from the failure of the economic deterrence model to fully
explain the degree of tax compliance. The vital role assigned to tax revenue as a significant
contributor to national government income. Consequently, almost all countries have a serious
concern with increasing their tax performance since more than half of the countries in the
world, more than 80 percent of the government budget is dependent on tax revenue. A fiscalpsychological
model shows how the relationship between tax authorities and taxpayers can
emerge through the provision of a stimulus from tax authorities, so that taxpayers’ attitudes
become more positive, which increases their willingness to pay taxes. Hence, governments
should be aware of the demand for infrastructure, because invrastructure provision can increase
the moral motivation of citizens to pay tax. In this research, more than a half of infrastructure
variables are significant and positively correlated to tax performance indicators. That is a proof
that in general, better quality of infrastructure in particular region lead to better tax
performance. However, the inconsistency of the effect shows that increased quantity (in this
case of infrastructure) should be accompanied by increased quality, and vice versa.","['Tax effort', 'infrastructure', 'tax morale', 'trust', 'fiscal-psychological']"

around 20 interviews, which combined with long-term observation, through the
medium being observed – social media, generated some interesting findings. The
study found that Palestinians pursuing higher education in their media content,
involve three elements: (i) a sense of longing and belonging; (ii) constraints and
restrictions on their movement in and out of Palestine (referred to in this study
as being locked in and locked out) and (iii) the complex virtuality/reality of their

since its peak in 2015. During the last years, migrant, asylum seekers and refugees
are increasingly considered a threat to the countries inside the Schengen area, a
matter of national security, seen as potential terrorist threats to the society, which
view is created in the political arena. This qualitative study focuses explicitly on
unaccompanied migrant, asylum seeker and refugee minors in the European Union
and tries to determine which processes around this security discourse are of
influence to their situations.
An overview of the relevant EU policies is given, together with the techniques
that are used to apply them. A theoretical framework is constructed from the
concepts of securitisation, governmentality and bare-life, used as a lens for analysis.
Empirical data during a case study is gathered from a field visit to the illegal
settlements in Nord-Pas-de-Calais in France to better understand the experience
and influence of policies on unaccompanied minors, through observation, semistructured
interviews and an ethnographic. The observations were analysed with
the help of the theoretical framework, leading to three main topics of discussion,
on the social dynamics in the camp, the activities of humanitarian aid organisations
and the role of the French government. A key finding is that the French
government does not differentiate the treatment towards minors, because they
hinder humanitarian organisations in helping all refugees, including those in the
most vulnerable position. It leads to numerous violations of human rights, like
that of access to sanitation and shelter, being explicitly visible in the emergence
of trench foot disease, which has not been observed since World War II.","['immigration', 'asylum', 'refugee', 'European Union', 'France', 'securitisation', 'bare-life', 'governmentality', 'unaccompanied children']"
"Body Politics and Menstrual Cultures in
Contemporary Spain","Arbeláez Orjuela, Claudia Lucía",2017-12-15,['Harcourt Wendy'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper aims to identify how women in contemporary Spain
are challenging hegemonic ideas on the menstruating body, using their own
embodiment as site of resistance; and how this in turn, is generating a new
menstrual culture and body politics of menstruation.
Through ethnography, netnography and semi-structured interviews, this
research identifies the actions undertaken by groups of women in contemporary
Spain to challenge the menstrual taboo, as it also explores women’s incentives
to engage in these actions and finally, how this is all linked to the broader
feminist movement.
Using Situated Feminist Knowledges (Haraway, 1988) and applying the theories
of Body Politics (Harcourt, 2009) and Corporeal Feminism (Grosz, 1994),
this research explores the importance of having the body (in this case the female menstral body) as a subject of research, in order to challenge and transform

"Growth, Inequality, and Poverty:
An Analysis of Pro-Poor Growth in Indonesia","Permadi, Yudistira Andi",2017-12-15,['Papyrakis Elissaios'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In the concept of pro-poor growth, economic growth accompanied by fair income distribution
will accelerate the rate of poverty reduction. Employing extensive data of household
expenditures and some economic indicators, this study will examine the performance of
economic growth in Indonesia whether it has been pro-poor over the period 2005-2013. We
employ two methods in this article, Growth Incidence Curve (GIC) method, and Pro-Poor
Growth Index (PPGI) method. By applying the GIC method, our empirical results indicate
that economic growth in Indonesia has not been pro-poor during the observation period. The
curve shows that the highest income distribution enjoys increased consumption more than the
lower percentile. Furthermore, PPGI method has revealed that economic growth, inequality,
and an interaction term between economic growth and inequality have been significant to
influence poverty incidence in Indonesia. Our empirical result also reveals that among three
sectors, it was manufacturing industry that significantly reduced the poverty incidence, while
the agriculture unexpectedly had a devastating impact on poverty alleviation efforts. The
services sector, meanwhile, has not contributed to poverty alleviation in Indonesia.
Furthermore, none of the government spending in education and health that significantly
contributes to poverty alleviation.","['Poverty', 'Economic Growth', 'Inequality', 'Pro-Poor Growth']"
Oil Resource Wealth: Analysis of the Impacts on Economic Growth: The Case of Nigeria,Nwaru Chiedozie Kingsley,2017-12-15,['Pellegrini Lorenzo'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The literatures on natural resource abundance has proved that resource rich
countries tend to underperform in terms of economic growth; a paradox known as
the ‘resource curse’. Much of the studies use econometric models to estimate the
economic performance of a cluster of resource rich countries. Therefore, we build
on earlier studies to consider the impacts of resource wealth on Nigeria’s economic
growth as a case study.
We examine the channels through which resource curse perpetuates, and latest
researches that tests for effects in a cross-country setting. Our reflection of earlier
claims and correlation tests shows that oil resource wealth impacts growth
negatively. Using expenditure figures as measure of human capital accumulation, a
downward trend in budgetary allocation is visible compared to administrative
expenditure and debt stock. Secondly, increasing natural resource
contemporaneously attracts more foreign direct investment than traded sectors,
Thirdly, in trade barter terms, commodity exports signifies heavy dependence on
primary commodities (agriculture and fuels) making the economy susceptible to
price fluctuation. We document an unstable real exchange rate (appreciating and
depreciating) when oil price/revenue adjusts. Lastly, we test for institutional analysis and document considerable effectiveness evidenced in recent growth performances.","['Resource wealth', 'Resource curse', 'Dutch disease', 'Economic Growth']"
DeMo by NaMo: Money Burning in India,"Gupta, Niti",2017-12-15,['Bedi Arjun Singh'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Despite the well-documented hardship caused by demonetization policy implemented
on 8th November 2016 in India, the large scale public support and
acceptance of it was puzzling. Was this acceptance a silent protest to punish
those with ill-gotten wealth and an aversion towards the growing inequality in
the country?
Motivated by this ambiguity, this thesis attempts to understand the demonetization
acceptance as being in line with the research in experimental economics
and experimental psychology that argues that notions such as inequity aversion
and fairness drives human behaviour into taking decisions which are not economically
rational. More specifically, the study will examine the role of social
preferences and fairness in an economic agents’ behaviour.
The research paper designs a “money-burning” experiment in a field setting in
India and attempts to mimic the acquisition of money through unfair means
(black money) and thereafter offers participants a chance to punish each other
(reduce each other’s money at a cost to themselves). The study finds a balanced
support for both, self-interest behaviour and fairness preference. Empirically,
the study did not find any link between the burning behaviour and
demonetization acceptance.","['Social preferences', 'money burning', 'fairness', 'procedural fairness', 'experimental economics', 'demonetization', 'India']"

"Las Pluralidades del Pertener:
An Ethnographic Study in Granada an Murcia of
Young Latinas/os Transnationalist Sense of
Belonging","Ormaza Melendro, María José",2017-12-15,['Huijsmans Roy'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Youth is understood as a life phase in which the young person has more freedom
than a child. Although their decision and actions are still influenced by the parent,
as they have less agency than an adult. Nonetheless, this notion does not
reflect the entire reality of a young transmigrant. In the moment a person decides
to migrate, the relationships with the country of origin do not end after moving
abroad; instead, these connections are constantly influencing the life of the transmigrant.
In contrast to an adult trans-migrants, for young transmigrants, the decision
to migrate is done by their parents. Likewise, the parents will influence
the way the young transmigrants get to know the new society. But, once they
start the high school, their experiences will be marked by the physical and cultural
dissimilarities between them and the ‘others’. These experiences will affect
the identity construction, the transnational interactions, and the everyday lives
of the young transmigrant. So, is the sense of belonging is related to the identity
and developed through the social interactions and daily practices that happen in
specific places, for young transmigrants, their belongingness is perceived as plural
rather than fix to a specific group, community, or country.

This paper is the production of an ethnographic research (with complementary
qualitative techniques) in Granada and Murcia (Spain), two cities impacted
by the transnational migration. The paper illustrates the complexities of ten
young Latina/o transmigrants while growing up in a transnational family and
being young transmigrant students in a Spanish high school. These complexities
were due to the cultural and physical differences between Latin-American countries
and Spain. To overcome the difficulties, the young transmigrants came up
with different practices. Some of them made changes in their appearance and
their Spanish accent to diminish the differences in relation to the ‘others’, meanwhile,
other participants embraced some of the customs of their country of
origin to be with ‘their’ people. These practices along with the transnational interactions
impacted in the development of a belonging sense that was expressed
by the young transmigrants as multiple rather than fix to their former or the new
country.","['Belonging', 'Youth', 'Transnational Migration', 'Identity', 'Practices', 'Places', 'Latin-', 'American', 'Spain', 'Ethnography']"
Challenges for DDR in Colombia: Experiences of Former Girl-soldiers.,"Torres Hernández, María José",2017-12-15,['Jayasundara Shyamika'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In the Colombian armed conflict, women represented between 40% and 50% of
guerrilla ranks. Since 1999 until 2017 the DDR program in charge of the rehabilitation
and reintegration for children lead by ICBF has attended around 1720 girls that disengaged
from non-stated armed groups, from which 60% came from FARC. Keeping in
mind that in 2016, the peace agreement between the government of Colombia and
FARC was signed, the analysis of challenges in the reintegration processes of these
girls, obtain relevance.
Considering that the gender inequalities in the Colombian Society represent a
structural violence that in many cases are the root causes that push girls to join the
guerrilla groups, this research addresses to what extent the DDR Program for children
lead by ICBF, managed to break the perpetuation of the sex/gender cultural system,
based on the life trajectories of six former Colombian child combatants that were in
the guerrilla groups and today have finished the ICBF program.
The study will be grounded in ideas of post-conflict peacebuilding and DDR as a
practice tool to peacebuilding. Also, insights of feminist theories such as the sex/gender
system, intersectionality, gender stereotyping among others will be discussed to
delimit the understanding of the structural violence based on gender to analyze the

Differentiating rice farmers’ vulnerability to climate change and adaptability in Bangladesh,"Islam, Zeenatul",2017-12-15,['Bedi A.S. (Arjun)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In the face of frequent and severe vulnerability to climate change, and extreme weather events, rice yield loss has become a burning issue to consider, particularly for developing countries which are the largest rice producers and consumers at the same time. Rice is the mainstay of Bangladesh economy and also is the staple diet for people in the country. Due to increasing change in the pattern of temperature and rainfall, farmers are exposed to both environmental hazards like droughts and floods and also livelihood shocks. However, to combat yield loss farmers adapted to short-term farming strategies which are time and location in-variant. But in vulnerability scholarship it is argued that farmers‘ vulnerability to environmental stress is disaster and individual specific. Likewise, adaptive capacity of farmers is determined by their access to socio-demographic, economic, institutional, knowledge, political resources. This study therefore explores spatial patterns in temperature and rainfall variability which so far have received less attention in the context of Bangladesh. The study also examines whether there is any differentiation across farmers in making adaptation choices and productivity. This study uses monthly time series data of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall for the period 1964-2012 to analyse trend, seasonality and their variability. Survey based farm level secondary data for the production year 2011-2012 have also been employed to gauge farmers‘ perception about temperature and rainfall change and to assess the effect of household characteristics on the choice of adaptations and land productivity of rice.
The study found larger variability in rainfall compared to temperature. Maximum temperature exhibits more increasing trend while rainfall has a more decreasing trend in Rajshahi compared to two other weather stations namely Bogra and Ishurdi. Farmers perceived a gradual increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall both annually and seasonally. Therefore, farmer perception is consistent with national weather variability analysis. Household head‘s age, education and access to agricultural credit, subsidy and electricity for irrigation have statistically significant effect on different adaptation choices and land productivity. However, lack of climate information has appeared as a major adaptation barrier. The negative effect of drought severity and the positive effect of groundwater depletion on land productivity imply more irrigation and consequently increased water stress. Differential land productivity and choice of adaptation strategies across farmers have been observed: probability of choosing water saving non-rice and horticulture crop cultivation is the highest in drought prone areas and also among large or medium farmers in this study. As all farmers extensively used irrigation in rice cultivation, farmer type has no effect on the choice of more irrigation. The findings coupled with vulnerability analysis and existing literature suggest that though scientific research driven adaptation strategies could increase land productivity, it is required to assess pre-existing socio-economic, institutional and knowledge based resource access of farmers in formulating short term adaptation policies. However, in the long run, strong monitoring of agricultural support provisions, farming related education and training, timely & adequate climate information are important in raising land productivity as well as reducing disparities among farmers.","['vulnerability', 'climate variability', 'adaptation strategies', 'land productivity', 'farmer differentiation']"
Ecological and livelihood change in fishing : A study of artisanal capture fisheries and cage-aquaculture on the Volta Lake of Ghana,"Ibrahim, Umar",2017-12-15,['Gerber J.F. (Julien-François)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The focus of this research was to find out the effects of cage-aquaculture on indigenous small-scale artisanal fisher people on portions of the Volta Lake in the Eastern Region of Ghana. This objective was structured into three sub-questions. The first question sought to determine the extent to which the enclosure of space for cage-aquaculture activities conflicted with other users of the Volta lake. The second question also sought to establish the relationship between cage-aquaculture and ecological change. The third question sought an explanation as to whether policy changes for aquaculture development contributes to the sustainability of rural fishing livelihoods.
In order to achieve this objective, qualitative interviews were conducted through a research assistant. The primary data was complemented with secondary data from published documents. A political economy and ecology perspective was used together with the Sustainable Rural Livelihood Framework for analytical purposes. The first findings of the study revealed that the effects of cage-aquaculture activities on other users of the lake extended beyond direct restriction of fishing activities to restructuring economic activities thus making rural people in the community vulnerable to external influence and exploitative relations. The second finding revealed that the relationship between cage-aqua-culture and ecological change was influenced by political factors that established exploitative interactions with ecological systems. Finally, policies for the development of cage-aquaculture was seen to be worsened the structure of distribution of benefits and thus weakened the sustainability of rural fishing livelihoods.","['livelihood', 'ecology', 'capture fisheries', 'cage-aquaculture', 'Ghana']"

Through this political process, food sovereignty is contested by the plural visions which its adherents advance. By examining indigenous peoples of Guatemala and their encounter with food sovereignty as a case study, I
discuss three ‘awkward encounters’ which have shaped, but also enriched, the ideas of and movements for food sovereignty. First, the historical encounters of indigenous peoples and capitalism and how this shapes contemporary understandings and constructions of food sovereignty. Second, encounters of multiple and competing sovereignties as plural expressions of indigenous self-determination. Thirdly, the encounters between indigenous peoples and peasant-centric universals embodied in food sovereignty which continue to reproduce. By using
Anna Tsing’s concept of “friction” in analyzing these three encounters, I problematize romantic notions of indigenous peoples and food sovereignty, revealing challenges and contradictions in the constructions of food sovereignty.","['food sovereignty', 'indigenous peoples', 'universalism', 'friction']"
"The politics of seed: investigating the privatization and promotion of hybrid maize seed and their impacts on small scale maize farmer’s livelihood; the case of Moshi Rural District at Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania","Mariki, Adeline",2017-12-15,['Schneider Mindi'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Seed is considered a centre key issue in agricultural activity as it plays a significant role in the production process. Seed’s accessibility and supply to farmers are crucial, the shortage of seed can cause nationwide hunger and economic downfall. Due to the importance, Tanzania government together with other stakeholders such as private sectors and research institutes play an enormous
role in its promotion.
This study set to explore the politics of seed in Moshi Rural district in Northern Tanzania based on the role of the state in promoting hybrid maize seed in the area. This was done through interviewing essential stakeholders who are farmers, government official, extension officers, seed company representatives and agro-dealers. Also, the investigation of policies and regulation which influence the use, the supply of extension officers who work under the government was done.
The adoption of hybrid maize seeds are influenced by the government through setting up of policy and regulations, seed companies through organising the trade fair and education to extension officers
which in turn go and train agro-dealers and farmers. There is a significant increase in adoption
rate in northern part of the country since the state privatised its seed sector in early 1990, with significant private players being multinational companies such as Monsanto and Pannar. These
companies own the seeds intellectual properties, and hence smallholder farmers are forced to by the seeds from seed companies or their agents every season thus leads to household economy impact on their income and expenditure. Hence, regarding who loses and who gains, the seed companies win, and local farmers lose.","['hybrid maize seeds', 'politics of seed', 'adoption factors', 'privatisation', 'smallholder farmer’s livelihood']"
A study on how the creation of new value chains for Shea butter production influences the livelihood of rural women in a climate change situation in Northern Ghana,"Solomon, Awuviri",2017-12-15,['Visser Oane'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Due to climate change, changes in the weather conditions of the three northern regions of Ghana has led to a decline in food production and worsening of the already precarious situation of these regions there by exacerbating the susceptibility of the already marginalised rural people who in most cases are women and children. Alternative means are therefore sorted for as a means of livelihood and the most reliable and available for women in this area of study is Shea butter production and for that matter their engagement in the Shea value chains.
This study is therefore concerned with the issues surrounding the structure, the dynamics of value chains for Shea butter production in Northern Ghana and the actors involved in this process and how that relationship influences the livelihoods of rural women.
The results showed that the rural women were at the base of the value chain for Shea butter
production although they contributed significantly in the commencement of the value chains, they were not integrated upward apparently because they lacked the capacity to handle issues of logistics. Income generated from Shea however provided women the opportunity to earn wages which projected their status in society leading to a renegotiation of the role of the wife in the house hold and subsequently leading to a change in gender norms and perceptions. In their bid to protect Shea trees for annual assurance of production of Shea butter, they contributed to forest conservation leaving many more trees in the parklands and planting ‘neem’ trees as an alternative source of fuel wood and subsequently contributing to mitigating the impact of climate change unconsciously.
I examined the value chains, who the actors of these chains are, and try to draw the connection
between the new value chains for Shea and the actors involved in the chain and subsequently
showed how such dynamics of inclusion and exclusion of women in such value chains affect rural women’s livelihoods and the extent to which the outcome of that relationship mitigate the impacts of climate change in the area.
I must emphasis that although both sexes use, value and protect Shea trees in the area of study,
finding showed that the Shea industry is a female heritage and it is recognized as such in this area. However the proliferation of industries in the Shea industry may as well seem a threat to women’s position in these chains.","['Shea butter', 'value chains', 'household', 'cooperatives', 'climate change', 'Ghana', 'Sagnerigu district', 'mitigation and adaptation']"
Resisting and creating the state in the Peasant Reserve Zones in Colombia : Exploring a social movement’s dynamic of contention in practice,"Durán Chaparro, Pablo Andrés",2017-12-15,['Borras S.M. (Jun)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Law 160 of 1994 in Colombia marks a point of transit between the sterile attempts for agrarian reform in the 20th century and a series of market based land policies. However, this law also marks the end of a cycle of peasant mobilization, especially in border areas, and with it a partial recognition of the peasant settlers is achieved, through what the law named Peasant Reserve Zones (PRZ). These zones allow basically three main things to the inhabitants of frontier zones: the titling of the land that the settlers have transformed and that they informally possess, the closure of the agricultural frontier through a control of the amount of land that can be owned inside the zone, and the peasant governance of the zone. The peasant governance is manifested through processes of territorial ordering, in which the peasant associations that impulse each zone regulates the social and economic activities of it.
The majority of the academic literature that has analyzed the PRZ in the last 25 years has focused its
attention in particular zones treating them as case studies. Through these cases, this literature has
presented the PRZ as a reaction of the peasant communities to the processes of capital accumulation and capital penetration in the Colombian countryside. Nevertheless, this literature has done this analysis without considering in depth the variation in the strategies the PRZ have used in developing a repertoire of contention against the implementation of land policies before the law 160 was issued and after it, and focusing mainly in the critical geography discussion of the dynamics of territorialization.
Through a sociological and historical analysis, this paper offers an initial exploration of the dynamic
process of formation of a repertoire of contention of the Colombian PRZ. This paper analyzes in a
parallel way the formation of the Colombian state and the formation of a peasant social movement.
It concludes arguing that the PRZ have developed two repertoires of contention through which they
have at the same time resist and create the Colombian state, and 5 strategies that have enabled them a margin of maneuver between the two repertoires.","['state-society relations', 'Peasant Reserve Zones', 'Colombia', 'armed conflict']"
"Investigating the impacts of climate change: vulnerability on livelihoods and the environment; the case of Luangwa district, Zambia.","Mseteka, Handsen",2017-12-15,['Visser Oane'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In Zambia rain fed subsistence agriculture is under serious threat from climate change. In response to the adverse effects of climate change and vulnerability, rural communities tend to diversify their livelihoods, supplementing agriculture with natural resource extraction. Their extraction methods are often times unguided and unsustainable hence these activities have detrimental residual effects on the environment which in-turn exacerbate the problems that led to such practices. This study was aimed at assessing how climate change vulnerability leads to biodiversity loss due to unsustainable livelihood diversification in Luangwa district of Zambia. The study used various qualitative research methods of data collection such as household farmer survey, focus group discussions, fishermen and wildlife camp officers’ interviews, key informant interviews with government heads of departments, and the analysis of secondary meteorological data to address the research objective.
The study established that climate change vulnerability and unsustainable, climate induced livelihood diversification leads to serious environmental threats that can lead to biodiversity loss. Some of the most serious environmental threats that have emerged in Luangwa district due to climate change include; (i) deforestation due to unsustainable charcoal production, this has led to wildlife habitat fragmentation, reduced forest cover undermining the greenhouse gas sequestration potential, and increased anthropogenic climate change, (ii) depletion of fish stocks due to overfishing in both the Zambezi river and the Luangwa river (iii) high levels of wildlife poaching. As vulnerability is highly associated with adaptive capacity, it has been established that once people become vulnerable, their social networks and structures, and their resilience and economic capacity to deal with climate associated problems are weakened, and they usually move towards destitution. This paper advocates that climate change adaptation practices for rural communities be developed to guide and assist sustainable natural resource management through this climate critical period.","['climate change', 'vulnerability', 'adaptation', 'livelihood', 'biodiversity', 'political ecology', 'Luangwa', 'Zambia']"
From the Amazon forest to the world : Gender divisions of labour in an emerging value chain,"Batista Pereira, Luciana",2017-12-15,['Pegler L.J. (Lee)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper aims to study the role and labour of women in the açaí production chain, a native fruit of the Amazon Forest, which recently aroused interest in the national and international market. Denominated as “dark gold” by the extractive people, the açaí is generating income and extra work for the ribeirinhos families besides being the main source of subsistence. The inclusion of this
new commodity in the annual calendar of the Amazonian communities has required a redistribution of tasks and significant women’s efforts to balance subsistence and household activities with the açaí chain. Objectively and subjectively, this research approaches the process of divisions of labour and evaluates the recognition and valorization of women's work in acai production. This new commodity has impacted women’s relationship with their families and communities, as well as brought new actors closer to the reality of the local extractive people. Held in 6 traditional communities located in Marajó Island,
in the Northern region of Brazil, this study presents reflections about a new value chain, which has the first stage based in a place where the culture is focused on the decisions of men. On the one hand, the açaí has become the main source of income for the families that approached social-environmental projects and courses developed for the local population. On the other hand, the invisibility of women's labour in this chain and the challenges faced by women in reconciling activities are emerging issues, especially in dialogues between
mothers and daughters.","['gender', 'labour divisions', 'women', 'açaí production chain', 'sustainable rural livelihoods', 'Amazon Forest']"

The research findings indicates that informal waste pickers are pivotal in the recovery of recyclable materials in the waste management front in the Tamale Metropolis. They constitute the source of raw materials to recycling industries. By so doing, they reduce the quantum of waste both on the streets and at landfill site. Whiles earning a livelihood, they contribute to urban ecological sustainability and resilience.
The study further pointed out that informal waste pickers are socially marginalized and politically excluded despite their significant contribution in the waste management front. The numerous challenges they face is attributed to policy neglect. Though the thematic concern of the thesis is informal waste pickers, the study has delve into metabolism of waste and how it generates conflicts due to unequal distribution of environmental goods and bad.

Conservative farmers movements and right-wing populism in contemporary India,"Jain, Divya",2017-12-15,['Borras S.M. (Jun)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper argues that Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), a conservative farmers’ movement, although has managed to maintain an overall agenda of ‘majoritarian cultural nationalism,’ there are fault lines seen between them and the right-wing Modi government. This can be seen partly in the increasing strength of BKS’s demands such as higher minimum support price for farm produce, ban of genetically modified seeds, lower interest rates on loans, better health and education facilities and so on. These rising demands stand in direct opposition to the policies of the Modi government, a regime that BKS is generally ideologically aligned with. Right-wing populist
governments in various parts of the world have important social base in the countryside, such as
Trump and rural America. India has a similar situation, with Modi and the Indian countryside, in
the form of powerful conservative farmers’ movements like BKS. But my study will show that
there are fundamental tensions and contradictions between the Modi authoritarian populist regime
and its rural social base. What these are, and how these get played out are the key inquiry of this study.","['right-wing/conservative farmers’ movements', 'authoritarian populism', 'India']"
Amidst mass tourism : Tri Hita Karana and conflict of valuation languages,"Adityanandana, M.",2017-12-15,['Gerber J.F. (Julien-François)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study looks at an environmental conflict over a tourism development project in Benoa Bay, which has emerged as one of the most contentious issues in Bali, Indonesia. The central question lies in exploring the mobilisation of the tri hita karana (hereafter THK) philosophy by different actors who all seek to advance their political goals in the conflict.
Using a case study methodology with an ethnographic orientation, the paper finds that a seemingly similar language of valuation – here the language of THK – can lead to very different consequences and visions of development. Accordingly, the study suggests that what could be referred to as post-growth thinking is not automatically reflected in a specific language of valuation. Ideas beyond growth potentially emanate and flourish only when actors use languages expressing incommensurability of values in their substantive use. These actors band together in environmental justice movement.","['environmental conflict', 'environmental justice', 'languages of valuation', 'postgrowth', 'tourism development', 'tri hita karana', 'Bali', 'Benoa Bay']"

The investigation uses a combination of research methods to produce the information for the analysis. Argument policy analysis provides the identification of two different narratives from one public policy under the same institutional framework. The survey experiment identifies attitudes of public-sector employees
evaluating attribute framing effects and motivated reasoning. The survey experiment provides information that supports one of the narratives of the public policy. The analysis describes how attitudes of the public-sector employees and their interaction with clashing frames could lead to different results under conflicting policy-making decisions.","['public servants', 'frames', 'narratives', 'decision-making', 'survey experiment', 'mental models']"
Do intermediaries sweeten the deal? An inquiry into the activities of intermediaries and their effect on small and medium producers within the Cocoa Value Chain in Ecuador,"Zea Vallejo, Daniel Arturo",2017-12-15,['Goméz G.M. (Georgina)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper looks at the Global Value Chain of Cocoa in Ecuador and the relationships that exist between its actors. This study focuses on the role that intermediaries have within the Cocoa Value Chain in Ecuador and the effect that their actions have on the cocoa production of small and medium producers. The interest of this research is to identify how such actions enable or limit opportunities for the development of small and medium cocoa producers in Ecuador. The Transaction Cost Economics theory is the main analytical tool used for the analysis of the transactions that take place between intermediaries and cocoa producers. Since intermediaries are identified as the main buyers of cocoa in Ecuador, an analysis for this phenomenon is also performed during this project. Also taken into consideration is the power and information asymmetries that exist in the Cocoa Value Chain in Ecuador and the reasons for this situation. To this end, this research paper aims to better inform policy makers, as well as, to formulate academic knowledge on the rationale of middlemen and, small and medium cocoa producers regarding the relationships and transactions that exist
between them.","['global value chains', 'intermediaries', 'middlemen', 'cocoa producers', 'development opportunities', 'long-term relationships', 'transaction cost economics', 'Ecuador']"
“Players Make the Rules as Referee Plays It Cool” : A research on the role of regulatory instruments on competition in the Philippine telecommunications industry from 1996 to 2016,"De Guzman, J.",2017-12-15,['Berner G.E. (Erhard)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Telecommunication, in the form of short messaging service (SMS), call or online chat and video messaging, is a crucial part of most Filipinos’ lives. While the industry has been in the forefront of technological advancements and service innovations, there is still clamour for better and more affordable services as the quality and rates of telecommunication services trail behind developing countries in Asia Pacific and worldwide. Lack of competition, as evident in the absence of worthy challengers to the current “telco duopoly” in the country, leaves consumers with no choice and puts no pressure to incumbents to improve. The passage of Public Telecommunications Act of the Philippines in 1996 opened the industry and welcomed numerous players thereafter. However, two decades after, the industry turned into an unshakeable, impenetrable duopoly composed of PLDT and Globe Telecom. This research examines the role of regulatory instrumentalities in the government’s failure to veer the industry toward a more competitive environment in the long term. By combining theories derived from competition and regulation literature with best practices in the European Union, the United States and ASEAN, the author juxtaposed theories with realities to identify hits and misses in the regulatory environment. After doing so, the study found out that timing was a key issue. While the government set the principal rules of the game, it fell short in firing up the institutions to keep up with the rapid technological developments and the aggressive race between the industry players. Regulators remained cool in overseeing a roused industry.","['competition', 'regulation', 'telecommunications']"
Understanding collaborative governance in practice: the case of the capital cities agreement for implementing Victim’s and Land Restitution Law Colombia,"Silva Díaz, Diana Carolina",2017-12-15,['Gomez G.M. (Georgina)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research emerged out from gap between the value added to collaborative governance and the empirical evidence of such benefits in Colombian. Despite the fact that there is not monitoring indicators that clearly illustrate how collaboration improves the implementation of complex public policies, national government has been promoting this strategy, ignoring the disparities among
local and regional government, thus actual outcomes of multi-level governance.
In particular, the paper looks at the case of capital cities agreement for implementing Victim’s and Land Restitution law, as the more tangible case of a collaborative initiative boosted by local entities.
Particularly, the research seeks to explain in what ways policy approach with respect to collaborative governance influence local government’s cooperation initiatives. Beyond the traditional input-output analysis, the paper explores into drivers, motivations and organizational dynamics among cities. The theoretical lenses used are the ones of Network governance and collaborative public management theories.
The study findings suggest that the speech of collaboration has progressed faster than the institutional mechanisms for doing so. The vagueness means for acting collectively blurs how collaboration can clearly contribute to improve local governments tasks when it comes to social policies. Findings also identify and explain how exchanges took place in the case of capital cities agreement, illustrating the impact of power imbalances and motivations when conducting a collaboration.","['collaborative governance', 'network governance', 'institutional collective action', 'collaborative public management', 'motivations', 'power imbalances', 'relational content']"

However, the implementation of forest conservation program frequently affected the life of the villagers that lived inside and/or around the area of the forest. While the most common forest conservation program only involved the role of government and the local community, this research shows the existence of other actors that also support the government in their implementation of the forest conservation program. Having an awareness that the implementation of the forest conservation program will not able to successfully implemented without considering the local community that dependent to the forest as their source of livelihood, make the role of the social entrepreneur is not only helping the government in the implementation of the forest conservation program, but also supporting the local community to find an alternative source of livelihood. Using the case of Kampong Saronggge in Indonesia, this research explains the role of a social entrepreneur
through his social enterprise named Green Radio/Green Initiative Foundation in supporting the local community.
This research argues that social entrepreneur could support the local community that was affected by the forest preservation program implemented by the government. Using some concept as the analytical framework, this research explained the process that done by the social entrepreneur in the implementation of every program to support the local community with the alternative source of livelihood. Moreover, this study also finds that the role that could play by the social entrepreneur in the local community that was affected by the forest preservation program is not only about providing them with the alternative source of income, but also increase the capacity, capacity, and quality from the local community itself. Some problems were faced by the social entrepreneur. However, this does not affect the positive results that felt by the local community from the community development program that was implemented by the social entrepreneur through his social enterprise.","['social entrepreneur', 'social enterprise', 'kampong', 'local community', 'community development', 'alternative source of income']"
From reservation to public service provision: impact of reservations for women in government on maternal health,"Mathur, Saumya",2017-12-15,['Kurian R. (Rachel)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Political reservation for women has been seen to improve different policy outcomes. This paper examines the impact of political reservation for women for the seat of village head and woman’s descriptive representation in the local government on improving provision of and accessing maternal health services. The paper uses the Indian Human development survey collected in 2011 to analyse the research objectives. The paper also make use of qualitative interviews conducted in Assam, India to understand the challenges that female village leaders might face in effectively participating in the decision-making process. This paper is going to depart from the existing literature on three accounts, firstly the paper will focus on actual policy outcomes namely maternal health outcomes, secondly, apart from focussing just on the impact of reservations for the village head position the paper will also be looking at the impact of an increase in women village council members and finally the paper used the Indian Human Development Survey data collected on 2011 to analyse this research topic. The paper finds that women in reserved villages are more likely to get better maternal health care as compared women residing in villages with a male head. Another interesting finding is that villages with a female head who has not been elected on a seat reserved for women outperform villages reserved for women. The paper also observes that an increase in the number of women in the village council either do not impact or negatively impact the provision of or access to maternal health services. The paper concludes that reservation alone cannot impact policy outcomes, it is only when the female policy makers are empowered both by structural and social changes can there be an actual change in maternal health outcomes.","['political reservation', 'woman empowerment', 'substantive representation']"

Public sector inter-organizational challenges and strategies to address cross-cutting policy issues : The case of Brazil Without Extreme Poverty Plan,"Maduro Alves De Lima, Luciano",2017-12-15,['Tankha S. (Sunil)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Inter-organizational coordination in the public sector has become a central concern for scholars and practitioners as governments are increasingly demanded to address complex and cross-cutting issues, such as poverty. From 2011 to 2014, the Brazilian government implemented an ambitious initiative to overcome ex-treme poverty in the country, Brazil without Extreme Poverty Plan. It sought to go beyond the income dimension of poverty to tackle non-monetary deprivations experienced by the poor, specifically lack of access to public services and lack of productive inclusive opportunities. In spite of its daring objectives and challenges, and unlike previous attempts to address multidimensional poverty in the Brazilian context, the initiative yielded a high level of output delivery. This research assesses how coordination among public sector organizations was produced within the initiative, by using three alternative theoretical modes of explanation of coordination processes - hierarchy, network and market. It also seeks to identify the incentives and the coordination instruments put in place to enable collaborative behaviour. To uncover these elements, an analysis of qualitative data collected through interviewees with key informants of the initiative’s leading organization and informants of partner organizations was undertaken, in addition of an extensive review of the policy’s secondary data. In doing so, the research reveals a complex interplay of sources of coordination capacity, in which authority, negotiation and trust played a pivotal role.","['inter-organizational coordination', 'public policy', 'governance', 'policy coherence', 'multi-dimensional poverty']"
The effects of local taxes and charges assignment policy on the local governments’ fiscal autonomy and local economy in Indonesia,"Santoso, Purwandi",2017-12-15,['Bergh S.I. (Sylvia)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Since several decades, decentralization has been implemented in many countries including Indonesia. Not only devolving expenditure-related authorities, but Indonesia also devolved some revenue collection authorities. By using Law 28/2009 regarding local taxes and charges, central government wants to enhance local fiscal autonomy without burdening local economy excessively. The central government believes that local taxes and charges assignment policy is needed to achieve the purpose of the decentralization system, i.e., the prosperity of the people. As stated in its general elucidation, this policy is crucial in providing the local governments ability to manage and match their budgets and public goods/services provision choices. Furthermore, this law claimed that this policy can increase the accountability due to the closer link between revenues collection and its benefits to the people.
After seven years, an evaluation of the implementation of Law 28/2009 is imperative. Therefore, this study tries to evaluate its basic objective achievement, i.e. enhancing local fiscal autonomy without harming the local economy. This study utilizes a mixed method through combining qualitative interview, statistics descriptive, and panel data regression. This study finds that this policy has increased local fiscal autonomy across government levels and regions. Furthermore, this study reveals three findings regarding the qualitative aspects of local fiscal autonomy after the implementation of Law 28/2009. Firstly, there is a wider disparity/gap between government levels and regions than before. Secondly, there is evidence on how conscious provincial governments have tried to utilize their tax/charge rates discretion as a manifestation of fiscal decentralization. Lastly, there are some “classics problems” that affected the performance of local revenue collections in the interviewed local governments, i.e. human resources, the quality of regulations, and public awareness. On the quantitative analysis, the result of regression shows that the local fiscal autonomy produced by Law 28/2009 has significant positive effect on local economic growth. In conclusion, although there are some deficiencies, this paper reveals that this law has achieved its main objective to increase the local fiscal autonomy and prevent the negative effects on the local economy.","['decentralization', 'fiscal decentralization', 'local taxes and charges assignment policy', 'local fiscal autonomy', 'local economy', 'Indonesia']"
Invisibility of women’s productive work in labour statistics – special reference to Pakistan,"Nazir, Muhammad Adnan",2017-12-15,['Siegmann K.A. (Karin Astrid)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Gender distinction in statistics, particularly labour statistics have real impact in formulating policies and programs for steering market towards economic as well as social development. True labour statistics are supposed to reflect dynamics of each individual participant in the labour force and their work situation irrespective of its gender / sex. However, studies reveal that official labour statistics don’t provide real picture of women’s paid economic activities, particularly in third world countries. The invisibility of women’s work prevails due to perception about women’s role confined to be housewife only. This perception stemmed from patriarchal gender roles and society norms. Improper field work survey of collection labour statistics also aggravates the invisibility. Enumerator and respondent are two main actors of field work of national survey and their being male with biased perception cause invisibility.
Though it is not easy to suggest remedial measures for addressing enumerator’s or respondent’s biases that shaped by culture and society norms, an attempt can be made to sensitize and address the problem. This paper suggests that Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) to have more female enumerators to seek out women respondents, can still reduce invisibility. As a result, PBS may consider labour force survey as more focused and important assignment being prime input for policy making, rather than routine official duty of collecting numbers and figures only. For the purpose, a policy measure has to be taken not only for capacity building for enumerators but also for review of questionnaire and time spent on each household. Without proper training and instructions, enumerator’s own perception can influence their performance in collecting real labour force statistics which could lead to ineffective policy formulation and implementation.","['invisibility', 'labour statistics', 'women’s productive economic activity', 'statistical bias', 'policy measures', 'Pakistan']"

Joining Forces with Businesses while Holding onto the Force of Culture: How the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision can enhance its Legitimacy through Culture and Business Partnerships,"Aller, V.E. van",2017-12-14,['Hitters H.J.C.J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Being commissioned by the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (B&G), this study explores how the Institute can engage in culture and business partnerships in order to enhance its legitimacy. The national media archive is a hybrid organization that combines features of a library, archive, and a museum. Making it a prominent LAM within the Dutch cultural sector. The exceptionally fast growth of digital media has however proven to be challenge for B&G at times. In order to adapt to a rapidly evolving external landscape, B&G has also attempted to restructure its own organization. Today B&G feels the need to stay relevant and in order to enhance its legitimacy, plans to partner up with businesses. Considering the size of this challenge and the Institute’s inexperience with the practice concerned, this study provides answers regarding the potential for B&G (and similar organizations in the Dutch cultural sector) to engage in partnerships with businesses in order to enhance its legitimacy. A case study research design forms the study’s basis, whereby it focuses on B&G and its existential context. By taking advantage of the Institute’s network, nineteen internal- and external knowledgeable professionals in the field were approached. The method of expert interviewing was used to uncover their perspectives on the relationship between B&G’s engagement in culture and business partnerships and their legitimacy, as well as their management of partnerships with businesses. A thematic analysis led to the discovery that B&G’s employees are confident about B&G repositioning and optimistic about the Institute engaging in partnerships with businesses, yet on the other hand speak negatively about B&G’s management of culture and business partnership and express hope in cultural entrepreneurship. Which led to the conclusion that culture and business partnerships can enhance the legitimacy of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision if the business in question supports the Institute developing and implementing a new positioning that is expected to gain legitimacy in the Netherlands. In order to increase its chance of success, the Institute should professionalize and increase its organizational capacity in order to act like a true cultural entrepreneur.","['media', 'business', 'Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision', 'Legitimacy', 'Culture and Business Partnerships', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship']"
"Negotiating Recognition of “Indigenous Peoples” in Tanzania: Development, Conflict and Rights Struggles","Muganyizi, Fadhili Ferdinand",2017-12-05,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study is about negotiation for recognition of indigenous peoples (IPs) in
Tanzania. It analyses the conflictual relationship over recognition and equitable
sharing of natural resources between the Tanzanian state and indigenous peoples,
from the early years of independence, and especially in the past decade or
so. As indigenous struggles for recognition have become more organised politically,
the NGO sector has engaged in advocacy for recognition of indigenous
peoples. This notion of ‘indigenous peoples’ is strongly contested by the Tanzanian
state, resulting in formal non-recognition of the indigenous communities
by the government. There have been numerous violations of indigenous peoples’
basic rights and fundamental freedoms. For their part, indigenous peoples
have struggled to gain formal recognition and to enjoy their rights, whilst preserving
their traditional ways of life. Applying Nancy Fraser’s framework for
analysing persistent social injustices, two elements of her analysis are applied to
the conflict between the state and indigenous peoples: recognition and redistribution.
Drawing on fieldwork and secondary sources, this study found that, despite
not being formally identified in national policies and in legislations, including
in the National Constitution (1977, as amended from time to time),
indigenous peoples do exist in Tanzania. Land is central to their conflicts with
the state. The role of private investors is also explored through case studies including
the ‘Loliondo case.’ Overall the study is intended to help inform policy
makers about recognition as the basis for respecting diversity and overcoming
historical marginalisation for indigenous communities in Tanzania.","['Indigenous peoples (IPs)', 'recognition', 'redistribution', 'worldviews', 'conflict', 'social justice', 'development', 'human rights']"

Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In deze thesis staat het politieke en publieke migratiedebat in Nederland centraal. Om hier een goed beeld van te krijgen, is gekozen voor een langere onderzoeksperiode dan in het meeste voorgaande onderzoek. Hierbij wordt vooral stilgestaan bij drie belangrijke aspecten van het debat: de hoeveelheid aandacht, de aangehaalde politieke bronnen en de toon van het debat. Voor het publieke debat werd gekeken naar krantenartikelen, terwijl bij de analyse van het politieke debat gebruik werd gemaakt van de kamerhandelingen.
Door middel van een automatische inhoudsanalyse is gekeken naar de hoeveelheid aandacht voor migratie in de periode 1995 – 2015, in zowel de dagbladen als het politieke debat. Het publieke debat in de media is verder onderzocht door te kijken naar het brongebruik door media in twee onderzoeksperiodes: 1995 – 1998 en 2012 – 2015. De politici werden ingedeeld op hun politieke richting (links, centrum of rechts) en de rol die zij spelen in de politieke arena (issue-owner, oppositie of machthebber). De toon van het debat in de media en het politieke debat is tevens door middel van een handmatige inhoudsanalyse onderzocht in de twee onderzoeksperiodes. Om de toon in het migratiedebat te achterhalen is het gebruik van frames in zowel het publieke als politieke debat gemeten. Deze frames zijn ingedeeld in zowel linkse en rechtse frames, als diagnostic en prognostic frames. 
Uit de resultaten bleek dat er geen overeenkomst is tussen het politieke en publieke migratiedebat. Zowel de hoeveelheid aandacht, als het gebruik van frames bleek in beide debatten te verschillen. Er lijkt alleen op korte termijn sprake te zijn van enige beïnvloeding in de hoeveelheid aandacht. Verder bleek dat linkse politici het debat domineerden in de jaren 90, terwijl dat gebeurde door rechtse politici in de jaren 10. Politici van regerende partijen werden het meest aangehaald door journalisten, terwijl de extreemrechtse issue-owner terrein blijkt te hebben gewonnen in de jaren 10. Daarnaast is er een duidelijke toename in het gebruik van rechtse frames te zien. De belangrijkste bevinding in dit onderzoek is de grote invloed van extreemrechtse politieke partijen. In de toekomst moet daarom meer onderzoek worden gedaan naar de invloed van deze partijen op het migratiedebat.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'migratie', 'nieuwswaarden', 'issue-owner', 'indexing', 'framing', 'publiek en politiek debat', 'Nederland', 'journalistiek']"

The Impact of Foreign Direct Investment on Inequality,"Wibawa Junardy, K.B. (Kenji Bisma)",2017-11-01,"['Fransen J. (Jan)', 'Kaur R. (Rupinder)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Income inequality has always been a problem, especially in Southeast Asia. It
is vulnerable to create a disparity and unjust feeling among the society which could
potentially raise a social and political conflict within a country. On the other hand,
nowadays FDI has been sought by countries in this globalization era in order to
sought economic development, income growth and employment absorption. Southeast
Asia has been known for its developing attraction for hosting foreign investment. The
region has always taken part in attracting attention, particularly in the theme of
potential market, resources and investment environment. However, there are still only
several studies that explain the relationship of FDI as the economic integration
instrument towards income inequality. These studies also present contradicting results
in explaining the FDI-income inequality nexus. Therefore, this research aims to to
compare and explain the impact of sectoral foreign direct investment towards income
inequality in the region of Southeast Asia. It also aims to provide results with the
presence of country’s capability in explaining the relationship between FDI per
sectors and income inequality, which derived from the capability approach. Lastly, it
also aims to provide evidence and suggestion on factors from county’s set of
capabilities that significantly affecting FDI and income inequality relationship.
On that regards, this research confirms the non-linear relationship between the
three major FDI sectors towards gini index of income inequality. Furthermore, results
also confirm the significance of capability approach concept in determining the
relationship of FDI and income inequality. The presence of three country’s
capabilities, namely, human, infrastructure, and government capability are significant
in providing instantaneous effect towards FDI in effecting income inequality.
However, the significant level only appears in service and manufacturing sectors.
Agriculture sector, on the other hand, does not appear to be significant, even in the
presence of capability approach. From this result, human capability is arguably the
most important capability in determining the impact of FDI towards income
inequality as in often appear to be a significant mediating variable. Their indicators of
Gross National Income (GNI) and tertiary enrollment rates are mostly significant in
all final regression models in each FDI sectors. Some indicators from infrastructure
and government capability are also appear to be significant at times with mobile

Inward FDI and innovation in Asian countries,"Wardhani, D.A. (Dewanti)",2017-11-01,['Burger M. (Martijn)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"In many countries, FDI is considered an important component of development, therefore many
developing countries have sought investment and designed policies to attract FDI. Countries
seek FDI with the expectation that MNEs would bring new technology and know-how to their
economy or spillovers. Evidence of this in existing research is contradictory; while some
studies have proven the existence of positive spillovers, others have found no trace of such
effects in the host country of FDI. Positive spillovers can be seen in, among others, technology
and knowledge spillover in the form of innovation activities. Fagerberg et al (2010) suggest
that innovation is not limited to high-tech activities; is an aspect in all aspects of economic
activities, not only new products and process but also improvements in logistics and
distribution, for example. Simple innovations in these areas may have large-scale economic
effects. Therefore, innovation is important for developing countries, including the developing
Asia. The present research aims to explain the relationship of FDI and innovation in selected
Asian countries, and identify the condition in which FDI can have a positive effect on
innovation activities.
Using the absorptive capacity theory with moderating variables human capacity, infrastructure
and institutional environment, the result of statistical analysis is that evidence of this
relationship exists, although it is rare and inconsistent across models. The relationship between
FDI and innovation depends on the moderating variables and the type of investment. It is found
that human capital positively determines the relationship between FDI and innovation. This
finding is in line with previous research in this subject. For example, Hall and Mairesse (2006)
found that firms with a greater share of highly educated employees are more likely to innovate.
Education is necessary for the host country in order to absorb and internalize knowledge from
foreign firms and apply it locally. Additionally, investment in the services sector is positive for
innovation activities compared to investment sectors such as manufacturing and natural
resources. FDI in the service sector may have a positive relationship with innovation activities
because much of nature of the investment in this sector is high-tech.","['Foreign direct investment', 'greenfield', 'innovation', 'absorptive capacity', 'human capital', 'institutional environment', 'infrastructure', 'service sector', 'manufacturing sector', 'natural', 'resources sector']"
Classifying Urban Living Labs,"Fiúza, M.C.M. (Mariana Costa Marques)",2017-11-01,['Ruijsink S. (Saskia)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This thesis focuses on Urban Living Labs, a young phenomenon that has gained importance in
recent years due to the potential it has shown to solve urban challenges in an innovative way.
Because of its novelty, the characteristics and outcomes of Urban Living Labs are difficult to
study, both theoretically and empirically. The purpose of this research is to increase the
knowledge about Urban Living Lab by exploring the relationship between their characteristics
and types (concerning the kind of solutions that they propose to urban challenges). In order to
help achieve this purpose, the main research question is divided into five sub-questions, two of
them to be answered through theoretical research and three to be covered by empirical analysis:
What is the relationship between the characteristics and the types (concerning the kind of
solutions that they propose to urban challenges) of different Urban Living Labs and how can
Urban Living Labs be classified based upon those?
The exploratory approach is the best suit for this study, due to the scarcity of academic
discussion regarding this subject. The methodology of this research is mainly qualitative;
however, it includes the first attempt towards a quantitative analysis, that should be improved
in future research. Two types of research design are combined to achieve the research objective.
The first one is Systematic Literature Review, to cover the existing academic literature
regarding Urban Living Lab. Throughout the Academic Literature Review, it was identified a
segmentation in the academic discussion about Urban Living Labs concerning the type of
solution that they propose to urban challenges. The three types resulting from this segmentation
are technology-driven, transition-driven and citizen-driven. The second type of research design
is Case Study, and six projects are analysed to compare how the characteristics are present in
different types of Urban Living Labs. The six cases studied in the thesis are The Green Village
(NL), Stratumseind 2.0 (NL), ZOHO (NL), Circular Buiksloterham (NL), Living Lab Habitat
(BR) and Vrijburcht Community (NL). To study the cases, the methods of research used are
interviews with experts and desk research until a saturation point was reached. Each case study
resulted in a table compiling a description of characteristics. This table was used to create a
definition per type of Urban Living Lab based on the empirical findings.
Comparing the case studies and the theory, the main finding regarding the three types of Urban
Living Lab concerns the existence of overlaps between them, meaning that one case can be
classified in more than one type. It happens because the characteristics, when applied in reallife,
are not mutually exclusive and a case can have features from more than one case. This
finding is significant because it shows that reality is more complex than the theory suggests,
and it creates a path to be explored in future research regarding hybrid-types of Urban Living
Labs and how they can be better implemented in practice to achieve the most that this method
has to offer in terms of urban innovation to solve current urban challenges.","['Urban Experimentation', 'Urban Living Lab', 'Technology-driven', 'Transition-driven', 'Citizendriven']"
Determinants of pro-environmental behavior in a circular program for plastic packaging,"Bellacosa, L. (Lucianna)",2017-11-01,['Skinner J.M. (Julia)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"In order to make a more effective use of resources in the Netherlands, the Dutch Government created Plastic Heroes, a national program for collection and recycling of plastic packaging that focuses on avoiding plastic to get lost in the chain (Rijksoverheid, 2016). The program differs from other plastic recycling schemes because it is financed by the packaging industry (Plastic Heroes, 2017a), which indirectly incentives the manufacturers to optimise plastic packaging as they pay taxes according to the weight of packages commercialised.
In Amsterdam, Plastic Heroes was fully implemented in 2013 but after two years of operation, the seven districts of the city had different results from the project. The best results were found in Zuid, where 11% of plastic packaging was recycled, while in Zuidoost only 2%, the worst scenario among all districts (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2015). Therefore, this research intended to explain the factors that led Zuid and Zuidoost to have such different results for the same program.
The research strategy used was case study, which describes and explains the problem in a real-life context, usually by combining qualitative and quantitative data. In this research, data was collected through secondary sources, observations, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Through the literature review, three main concepts were investigated regarding their influence in pro-environmental behaviour: psychological factors, awareness of circular economy and situational factors. Demographic characteristics such as age, gender, nationality, migration background, education level and income were also included as control variables.
The psychological factors were based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, which involves three variables: attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. Awareness of circular economy was examined based on the understanding of the concept. Additionally, situational factors were analysed by the infrastructure provision and information about the program.
The statistical analysis was based on independent t-tests and binary logistic regressions. The former was used to compare the means of Zuid and Zuidoost, from which the variables age, gender, migration background, income, education and understanding of circular economy were the only significant ones. The latter was useful to investigate what variables were significantly predicting recycling of plastic packaging and explaining differences between the two settlements. From all models analysed, the only variables that were found to be positively influencing in the behaviour were having Dutch background, being female and being well-informed about the program. Education was also significant, however, there was a negative relationship between having primary education and recycling plastic packaging with Plastic Heroes.
Several recommendations were made addressing new ways of improving the program in the context of Zuid and Zuidoost. It was suggested for the municipality to develop new communication tools such as using social media. It could also be effective to update and improve the already existing information in the website and in the containers. Additionally, it was recommended to engage community centres in raising awareness.","['Plastic', 'packaging', 'pro-environmental behaviour', 'circular economy', 'recycling']"
How to move the young audience for modern dance?,L.L. Schreijer,2017-10-27,"['T. Navarrete Hernandez', 'A. Mignosa']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The appreciation of modern dance requires a developed taste.  Youth modern dance companies apply different audience development strategies in order to cultivate the taste of the young audience. According to the theory on taste formation, both habit formation theory and learning by consuming theory imply a cultivation of taste, each with a different approach. Where habit formation indicates a routinized development, learning by consuming suggests that the marginal utility increases during the cultivation process. This research relates taste formation theory to the practical application of audience development. 
Successful audience development consists of both the missionary approach, to reach a new audience, and the mainstream approach, to maintain the relationship with the existing audience. The missionary approach is aligned with habit formation and the mainstream approach with learning by consuming. This theoretical framework is applied to the Dutch youth modern dance sector with the following research question: ‘How do Dutch youth dance companies implement audience development strategies? And how does their audience development strategy relate to taste formation theory?’
With the use of semi-structured interviews, this research scrutinized the implementation of young audience development from the marketing, education and programming departments of four Dutch youth modern dance companies. The first main findings is that (1) the companies primarily apply the missionary approach. The programming, marketing and education activities aim at new audiences and in addition, the organizations are involved with short-term projects. The companies are prevented from long-term thinking and from applying a more mainstream approach by the cultural policy requirement to find new and diverse audiences. In addition, time; money; and manpower constraints determine the prevalence of the missionary approach. In relation with taste formation theory.
The second main finding is that (2) the activities of the youth modern dance centers imply habit formation. The companies should invest in engagement activities; the monitoring of the audience’s experience and utility; and adapt to the changing wants and needs of the existing audience, in order to align the audience development strategies better with learning by consuming theory. 
The third finding is that (3) a general, strategic organizational plan is missing that accordingly contributes to both theories on taste formation. A coherent long-term plan for the entire organization is required for effective audience development that entails both the mainstream and the missionary approach.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Young audience development', 'youth modern dance companies', 'habit formation', 'learning by consuming', 'missionary approach', 'mainstream approach', 'total experience', 'marketing', 'education', 'programming']"
Music Students’ Bohemian and Entrepreneurial Career Identities,L.J.K. Schediwy,2017-10-27,"['P.V. Bhansing', 'F.J.C. Brouwer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Entrepreneurship in the arts has started to gain attention from scholars as well as arts
educators and policy makers in recent years. Advocates suggest that entrepreneurship curricula in
art schools can help to prepare students for the tough conditions they will face on the arts labor
market after graduating. However, this opinion faces resistance by some academics, arts educators
and especially students themselves. The opposing view is that entrepreneurship does not cohere
with artists’ often strongly pronounced bohemian identity. This thesis investigates music students’
bohemian as well as entrepreneurial career identities and whether they influence students’ attitude
towards entrepreneurship education. It adopts a quantitative approach and samples 146 music
students from two Dutch music schools. First, a factor analysis is applied to find out if and how
bohemian and entrepreneurial career identity items group together or are mutually exclusive.
Then, with a multiple linear regression analysis, the relationship between the career identity
factors and students’ perceived need for entrepreneurship education (PNEE) is measured. The level
of students’ PNEE is assumed to reflect their attitude on entrepreneurship education. This variable
is operationalized according to Bridgstock’s (2013) definitional classification of arts
entrepreneurship education and is tested by means of a second factor analysis. Results reveal that
(1) parts of students’ bohemian and entrepreneurial career identities do cohere, (2) the three
stances on arts entrepreneurship suggested by Bridgstock (2013) are reflected in music students’
PNEE, and (3) the career identity factor related to “Open-mindedness” has a significant, positive
effect on students’ PNEE.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Arts Entrepreneurship', 'Arts Education', 'Career Identity', 'Bohemian', 'Music students']"

in the creative business sector in Rotterdam. The result of this thesis can provide useful policy
recommendations, since it has become evident that the Rotterdam municipality wants to make Rotterdam
appealing in various factors, and especially change the image of the harbour city to one of a creative city.
Creativity and the creative class are important factors for a thriving economy. In the Netherlands,
entrepreneurs and companies working in the creative industry are divided into three groups: arts, media and
publishing and the creative business sector. These creative industries are mostly situated in cities, creative
cities. This creative city can be the breeding ground for creativity. However, to become a s uccessful creative
city it is necessary to attract the creative class. You can do this with marketing and municipal pull-factors. The
existing literature in this field will be used to predict what pull-factors are important for the creative class in
Rotterdam. However, it was not feasible to research all Rotterdam creatives, so the sample had to be adjusted.
It was chosen to research what people working in the creative business sector, in a company founded between
2000-2015 found most important in Rotterdam. The respondents were gathered from the database of the
Chamber of Commerce, selected by SBI number. The survey questions are based on existing theory on pullfactors
for creatives. The results of the survey show that there are a lot of entrepreneurs working in the design
sector. The most common pull-factors identified by the sample were cultural diversity, authenticity and
affordable rents in Rotterdam.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Creative entrepreneurs', 'creative city', 'Rotterdam', 'creative industry', 'creative business sectors', 'pullfactors']"

onderzoeksperioden bestaan uit de maand voorafgaand aan de Nederlandse parlementsverkiezingen van
1994 en één maand voorafgaand aan de Nederlandse parlementsverkiezingen van september 2012.
Binnen deze onderzoeksperioden worden artikelen uit een kwaliteitskrant vergeleken met een populaire
krant om te bezien of er verschillen bestaan in het gebruik van medialogica over tijd en tussen typen
kranten. Het is van maatschappelijk belang dat de burger zo correct, transparant en vooral objectief
mogelijk geïnformeerd wordt door de media, met name in het huidige tijdperk waarin onze werkelijkheid
(deels) wordt bepaald door wat media schrijven of laten zien, ook wel bekend als mediatisering. Als deze
informatie bijvoorbeeld wordt beperkt door de inhoudelijk ‘feitelijke’ focus te verplaatsen naar een meer
entertainment gerichte berichtgeving, kan dit afbreuk doen aan de inhoud en uiteindelijk aan de
controlerende functie van de journalistiek voor de democratie. Deze verschuiving in berichtgeving kan
voorkomen, doordat media steeds meer vanuit de wensen van hun eindgebruikers denken bij het
produceren van hun inhoud, ook wel medialogica genaamd. Dit gebeurt vooral door de toenemende
concurrentie en commercialisatie van de media, hetgeen ervoor zorgt dat media steeds meer
‘martkconform’ moeten schrijven zodat ze een zo groot mogelijk bereik kunnen genereren. Medialogica in
politieke berichtgeving rondom politici komt tot uiting in het gebruik van verschillende frames, waarbij
dit onderzoek zich richt op het gebruik van het conflictframe, horse race frame en personalisering. Deze
thesis biedt een antwoord op de vraag of er over tijd meer medialogica terug te zien is binnen politieke
berichtgeving. Tevens wordt er gekeken naar twee verschillende typen kranten om te achterhalen of de
verschillende focus van deze dagbladen ook tot uiting komt in het gebruik van medialogica. Hiertoe wordt
een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse toegepast op 1175 artikelen afkomstig van LexisNexis en AmCat. De
resultaten tonen aan dat er geen zichtbaar bewijs is voor verschillen in het gebruik van medialogica over

Public-private collaboration in climate adaptation to rainproof,"Visser, M. (Maartje)",2017-10-27,['Edelenbos J. (Jurian)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The effects of climate change are becoming increasingly visible. Extreme precipitation events which result in sewage overflow and combined urban flooding nuisance (revised Waterplan 2, 2013), alternate with effects of drought and heat. These effects are magnified within the urban conditions and may result in traffic disruption, flooding damage, pollution and overall economic loss. Therefore, Rotterdam has, like other cities, a major task to deal with Climate Adaptation.
Problems with flooding due to heavy rainfall are getting more urgent within Rotterdam. There is an urgency to scale up the implementation making use of integration opportunities that benefit a wider urban perspective and avoid future costs outweigh the current investments to rainproof Rotterdam. Rotterdam has a front-runner’s role in climate adaption, showcasing internationally appreciated innovative solutions. Nevertheless, to live up to the implementation challenge and precede in this role, new innovations focussed on up-scaling and governance are desired.
The objective of this research is to contribute to a comprehensive governance approach for public private collaboration (PPC) and up-scaling the implementation process to ‘rainproof’ Rotterdam. Therefore, this research aims to explain and assess why and which different factors in public private collaboration influence the success of implementing climate adaptation.
A combination of academic literature, empirical findings and reviews of CA policy, regulation and PPC approaches in Rotterdam’s context, generate theoretical findings and practical advice for governance opportunities. This qualitative research with a multiple case study strategy, is a deliberate choice to study a large number of variables within different types of urban development projects. Data collection through interviews with involved public, private and social parties, result in a rich understanding of the situation.
The outcome of this research elaborates on specific points of attention towards influential factors, explains the most successful approaches and PPC models and eventually describes which conditions generate most success. In brief, the main findings are that connective public leadership is exclusively important to deploy the adaptive capacity which is potentially present within society. The municipality has best comparative advantage to perform this connective leadership role, due to its extensive knowledge of the urban fabric, urban goals, stakeholders, implementation processes, and the total water system. Mainstreaming CA generates most opportunities for public private collaboration, as added value for collaborative stakeholders is then at large and mainstreaming generates interdependence which is an important driver.
The majority of respondents specify the tactical level is little exposed in Rotterdam’s policy cycle in general and in CA specifically. To accomplish that mainstreaming can indeed lead to up-scaling of the CA, interventions need focus onto this tactical level, through elaboration of specific CA policy and a comprehensive CA program. Joint elaboration of a CA program will increase receptivity, which is besides interdependence, another important driver for collaboration. CA policy can provide a structured framework for translation of strategic visions into better operational projects outcomes, allow mainstreaming and other actors, public, private and social, to initiate and perform projects which can immensely increase CA capacity. This demands less time-consuming municipal interference in the actual operationalization of individual CA projects, which enlarges feasibility of up-scaling, especially considering the current scarce municipal human resources.
Public private collaboration based on the alliance model, in which the municipality performs a public connective leadership role and empowers other stakeholders to perform CA action, has most potential for long term collaboration and repeated performance of networks. In this alliance, the social stakeholders have an important role which often shows under-appreciated. Specifically, the group of social entrepreneurs, a group which recently raised in bottom-up self-organisation, showed to perform an important and successful ‘brokerage role’, which relate to competences of boundary spanning. Ultimately, boundary spanning capacity is the utmost important prerequisite for different conditions in the collaborative process which needs attention for overall success of the implementation of CA through public private collaboration.","['Climate change', 'Adaptation', 'Public private collaboration', 'PPP', 'governance']"

Social Entrepreneurship: Challenges in the Implementation of Educational Technology Innovation to Address Literacy: Comparative Study Among Social Entrepreneurs in Prize-based Competitions,S. Andikko,2017-10-23,"['P. Arora', 'J.R. Ward']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","One of the leading causes of educational inequality persists because the lack of support from
national governments has resulted in a disproportionate opportunity to learn and gain benefit from
education. Thus, many children still lack basic skills, such as literacy. There is a growing hype in
the discussion of information and communication technology-based literacy applications as a
solution to chronic problems in the world of education. To date, substantive technology-based
learning has emerged to the forefront of the debate to enrich conducive learning environments.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of empirical studies in providing a deeper understanding of the
prospective role of technology-based learning platforms. Therefore, this thesis investigates
challenges in implementing the educational technology innovations generated by 12 social
entrepreneurs and takes into account social entrepreneurship’s intermediary namely prize-based
competitions. Additionally, this thesis also sheds some light on target audiences, types of digital
innovation produced, and the motivations of social entrepreneurs to enter a prize-based
competition. Through qualitative methods, namely content analysis and in-depth interviews, this
thesis provides insight into the key challenges encountered by social enterprises that have
emerged in the execution of technology on an educational scope. The findings indicated that
challenges involved in the process of implementation and production are: location and cultural
sensitivity (i.e. lack of qualified teachers, lack of supporting infrastructures, market
characteristics), practical usability (i.e. software and device compatibility, data analytics, and
feedback mechanisms), theoretical practicability (personalized and generic content), economic
scalability (i.e. monetization, credibility of innovation), viable scalability, and strategic alliance
establishment. The incorporation of technology in improving education can serve as a tutor, a
teaching aid, or even as a cognitive learning tool. The target audience of the innovations can be
classified into two categories: business-to-business and business-to-customers. Meanwhile, the
motivations for entering a prize-based competition included: social motives, recognition of
innovation, interconnected network, and guidance for improvement. Furthermore, the study
makes new recommendations for the organizers of prize-based competitions in order to be more
valuable for social entrepreneurs.","['media', 'business', 'technology', 'educational inequalities', 'innovation', 'social entrepreneurs', 'prize-based', 'competition', 'qualitative methods', 'content analysis', 'in-depth interviews']"
The Role of Facebook Use With Home and Host Country Relations in Sojourner’s and Expatriate’s Adaptation to the Netherlands,F.E. Lutz,2017-10-23,"['J. Hofhuis', 'P. Arora']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Over the years, a lot of research has been done in the field of intercultural or cross-cultural adaptation, especially in relation to sojourners or expatriates. In fact, various studies focused on a variety of factors relating to sojourners’/ expatriates’ well-being and well-doing in life in regard to work and business assignments/ study or exchange program. The more recent studies in this field also took into account the internet and social media, that offers certain opportunities for acculturating and adapting to a new country, for instance, by making it easier to stay in touch with family and friends from home or build new relationships in the new environment. The present study picks up on that by researching the question whether Facebook use is helping or hindering the process of acculturation/ adaptation that sojourners and expatriates have to get through. In fact, it digs deeper by dividing Facebook use into two categories. One being Facebook use with home country relations and the other Facebook use with host country relations.
The study was executed in form of a survey with 147 non-Dutch respondents who either work or study in the Netherlands. On the basis of this quantitative approach, data was collected and then analyzed with IBM SPSS 24. Bridging the existing knowledge gap between intercultural adaptation studies and social media studies, this study’s findings were able to provide new insights. The results, for instance, indicate that Facebook use with host country relations in particular does have a significant relation with other factors of acculturation and adaption, such as contact and participation and psychological adaptation. Furthermore, it has been found that the emotional well-being of sojourners/ expatriates does have a significance relation to adaptive outcomes such as satisfaction with life, satisfaction with job/ study and intention to leave.","['media', 'business', 'Intercultural adaptation', 'sojourner adjustment', 'expatriate failure', 'Facebook use', 'social networking sites', 'cultural maintenance', 'contact and participation', 'psychological adjustment', 'sociocultural adjustment', 'satisfaction with study/ job', 'satisfaction with life', 'intention to leave']"
Crowdsourcing Tools for Worker and Brand Dialog,L.H. Thompson,2017-10-23,"['P. Arora', 'J. Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Globalization has made it possible to source products like clothes and footwear from all over the world. Complex supply chains have made it difficult to know what is really going on in factories, especially in developing countries set far away from the brands themselves. However, the world is drawn closer together with the emergence of new media technology such as the Web 2.0, social media, and mobile internet. This new media technology is becoming accessible for people all over the world. With the emergence of this new technology, crowdsourcing has developed as a method to gather the voices of the people for various projects. Crowdsourcing has previously been researched as methods for businesses to gain ideas for innovations, NGOs for social developments, and for governments to develop policies. This research focuses on three cases of crowdsourcing that has not yet been researched. 

A multiple-case study has been conducted of the three crowdsourcing tools provided by QuizRR, LaborVoices and Better Factories Cambodia’s project Outstanding Worker. In-depth interviews, product demonstrations, articles, video clips and reports were analyzed. These three cases represent how crowdsourcing can be used to gather the voices of factory workers, especially in developing countries. This study looks into how crowdsourcing can be used to increase the collective agency of workers by collecting information directly from workers, as a counter to existing monitoring practices like factory audits. The study focuses particularly on design of the tools, participation incentives, which issues are communicated and how the systems can make possible exploitation of workers visible. 

The three cases differ in the mentioned aspects. However, the findings suggest that firstly, sharing information with workers so that they can use this information to solve local problems themselves is central to increase the collective agency of workers. Further, the findings suggest that design, transparency, meaning how the collected data is used, influences the tools’ ability to empower workers and improve working conditions. This study presents a model of the main elements which represent the dynamics in crowdsourcing tools for worker-brand dialog. While the model’s elements suggest how crowdsourcing can be used to give workers a voice and create dialog, it is argued that a communication tool cannot alone solve issues of exploitation. Rather, new communication methods like these are reliant on functioning enforcement mechanisms such as local labor laws, and regulations for ethical production.","['media', 'business', 'Crowdsourcing', 'outsourced labor', 'new media technology', 'ethical production', 'transparency', 'technology for change']"

Competing Enterprises for a Better World,N. Kotterik,2017-10-23,"['P. Arora', 'J.S. Lee']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Media platforms and applications are becoming increasingly important in the current society. At the same time, there is a gradually increasing number of entrepreneurs focusing on social value due to the increasing need for social contribution instead of economical value. This research examines how social entrepreneurships involving media platforms or applications develop after having won in a start-up competition. Start-up competitions are an increasingly more common phenomenon, which aim to aid the further development of new ventures. This study focuses on start-up competitions in the social field, for new ventures that have developed a media platform or application. Runners in these start-up competitions receive benefits such as exposure, funding and guidance. This research builds upon previous studies on start-up development, as it focuses on social new ventures in a specific market: the media platform and application economy. When looking at research conducted in the field of start-up development, an abundance of research on entrepreneurship in the app economy can be identified. With that a research gap was discovered in the area of business development of social start-ups in the field of the media platform market, leading to the need for more insight on the matter. Additionally, it shows the outcome of winning a competition and how this has influenced business development. As there is an increasing amount of start-up competitions on the market this is an important area of research, upon which needs to be further elaborated. In order to create a compelling dataset this research uses a case study approach of six winners of three different social start-up competitions, combining a content analysis of a total of six company descriptions and five interviews with the founders of the companies. Results indicate that winners of a start-up competition go through a phase of growth and eventually move into a stage of expansion after the competition. Three kinds of resources are of great importance: social capital, financial resources and human resources. The development is mainly fueled by the importance of social contribution and the need for mission accomplishment. This research has given insight on the major obstacles the companies had overcome to in order to develop.  Moreover, the results provide insight into the experience of start-ups with the competitions. This research outlines the need for validation and recognition of the companies by the competitions, due to the volatile factor of innovation on the media platform market.","['media', 'business', 'competitions', 'social entrepreneurships', 'media platforms and applications', 'start-ups', 'business lifecycle', 'new venture development', 'resources', 'case study', 'content analysis', 'interviews']"
Tracking	Spirituality	through	Digital	Applications,M. Tuk,2017-10-23,"['J.H. Pridmore', 'J.S. Lee']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Many scholars have looked into the usage of self-monitoring applications and its relation to health and well being. However, the field of spirituality was yet almost untouched. This is remarkable, as spirituality has a large part in today’s society. Therefore, this research aims to look into the usage and effects of spiritual self-monitoring applications. While there is limited research on the effect of the usage of self-monitoring applications on a user’s health, it is deemed significant to look into the effects of Christian applications on perceived spiritual growth and the practice of spiritual disciplines. Technologies of the self, a concept coined by Michel Foucault, and the quantification of the self theory is employed as a theoretical framework for this research. This study has looked at to what extent the frequency of Christian application usage influences the practice of spiritual disciplines, with perceived spiritual growth as a mediator. 
	Through a quantitative survey with 501 respondents, Christian application users were asked to rate their digital application usage, their practice of spiritual disciplines, the perceived value of Christian applications and the perceived spiritual growth through Christian applications. The results suggest that the usage of worship and Bible reading applications has a significant effect on perceived spiritual growth through these applications. Furthermore, applications of all spiritual disciplines except for attending church have a significant effect on the practice of spiritual disciplines. However, the results also suggested that the practice of spiritual disciplines could not be explained by perceived spiritual growth. 
	Hence, spiritual growth did not mediate the relationship between the frequency Christian applications were used and the practice of spiritual disciplines. Application builders and church or denominational leaders could use this research in their advantage, incorporating behaviour change theories in Christian applications in order to motivate more users to transform their behaviour and motivate churchgoers or other members of the congregation to use these applications in order to perceive more spiritual growth or practice the spiritual disciplines more often. This would be of advantage to churchgoers, as the respondents of the survey deemed the applications as very valuable.","['media', 'business', 'Technologies of self', 'quantification of self', 'smartphone applications', 'Christianity', 'spirituality', 'self-monitoring', 'spiritual growth']"
Integration of relationship marketing on social media by sports brands,Z. Walczak,2017-10-23,"['Y. Wang', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This paper aims at exploring relationship marketing on social media by sports brands. While more and more brands establish their presence on social media, it is important to know what kind of strategies they implement in order to meet their goals. Sports brands advertise mainly through athletes who wear their clothes and shoes while they compete, that is why this study aims to see whether the relationship with the athletes is being capitalized on by connecting them to their fans. Establishing what strategies of integrating relationship marketing by sports brands has been accomplished through studying tweets of Adidas Tennis and Nike Tennis accounts. Tennis has been chosen as a single sport to study, as it allows to have a greater look at individual tennis player relationship with a brand and through the brand with their fans. This study has taken a qualitative approach and has involved creating initial and final coding categories of the tweets. In total 400 tweets were selected to analyze as a grounded theory research. 
Conclusions have been reached that certain facets of relationship marketing are being utilized as marketing strategies, such as trust, engagement, commitment. Additionally, it became clear that using celebrity athletes for creating trust and engagement are a focal point of relationship marketing strategy on Twitter, and also what fans are coming to social media for.","['media', 'business', 'Relationship marketing', 'Twitter', 'social media', 'sports', 'sports marketing', 'tennis', 'Nike', 'Adidas', 'marketing']"
Are you being influenced?,M. Prionidi,2017-10-23,"['A.C. Uribe Sandoval', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Influencer marketing has recently become a mainstream strategy in public relations
and marketing. This exploratory study focuses on the Austrian fashion and lifestyle
sector and investigates the nature and the components of the collaborations between
bloggers and brands. Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with
fashion/lifestyle bloggers and communication professionals working in public
relations agencies. As a lot of companies do not maintain an in-house marketing
department dedicated to influencer marketing and blogger relations, agencies often
take the role of consultants and collaboration managers. Therefore, they are
considered highly experienced when it comes to influencer marketing strategies. The
findings of the research indicate that fashion and lifestyle blogs can no longer be
perceived solely as user generated content, as they have matured into professional
advertising platforms used for marketing and public relations purposes. The
distinctive characteristics and assets that were detected in blogs and serve for
influencer marketing purposes are authenticity, transparency, storytelling and cocreation.
These components are usually encountered among collaborations for
maximizing the effects of influencer marketing strategies. Creative freedom and
personal contact also seem to be crucial for a collaboration’s success. In reference to
the Austrian industry, influencer marketing does not seem to have reached its peak yet
and is still conforming to foreign examples. Lastly, within this Master Thesis,
implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.","['media', 'business', 'Influencer marketing', 'brand communication', 'public relations', 'blogs', 'influencers', 'Austria']"
Co-creating innovation,I. Severi,2017-10-23,"['P.M. Leendertse', 'P. Arora']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The rise of a consistent number of new cultural institutions in the last two decades, coupled
by the arrival of new form of entertainment and other leisure spaces, have put museums in a
very competitive environment. For museums to stand out among this crowd has become
increasingly challenging. In addition, museums have to face other important issues such as the
reduction of governmental funds, the continuous change in people’s tastes and the
development of new technologies. In consequence of this, and in order to keep accomplishing
their role of culture bearers and education providers, museums have understood the need to
take on a more innovative approach. However, due to their non-profit nature, being innovative
could be very risky. That is why, it is necessary for them to establish strategic partnerships
with external partners. The creation of such partnerships seems to be the solution for
museums to accomplish their social role and to face the current challenges proposed by the
market. Together with their partners, museums will be able to co-create innovative
educational products that will reach and educate the desired target audience. Although
existing literature has already studied the formation of cross-sector partnerships, this does not
apply to alliances regarding museums and business. In addition, there is an evident gap in
literature with regard to innovation processes when these are brought about by organizations
together. Hence, by carrying out a qualitative research based on fourteen semi-structured
expert interviews, this paper tries to answer the question on how museums can co-create
innovative educational products with external partners. The results derived from the
interviews show that the bases to build a strategic alliance between museum and businesses
are shared goals and values and that a fundamental element to maintain it is communication.
Other factors such as mutual benefits and a balanced collaboration were also considered very
important. Noteworthy, the management of informal relations was considered as the most
important element when establishing and, particularly, maintaining a successful partnership.
In addition, what characterized the innovation process carried out by the partners was an open
innovation attitude and a design thinking approach. By adopting the first, museums and
partners are able to reach out and exchange resources as well as to establish unexpected and
less common alliances. By applying the second, namely by listening to the target audience’s
real needs and desires, experts affirmed it is possible to create successful and outstanding
innovative educational products.","['media', 'business', 'museums', 'strategic partnerships', 'innovation', 'co-creation', 'education']"

However, little research has been done on how public-sector organisations such as hospitals perceive this changed communication landscape and how social media use is of relevance when it comes to reputation management. Therefore, this study aims to answer the research question: how do healthcare organisations perceive the importance of social media for reputation in the healthcare sector? To answer this research question, insights into the opportunities and challenge of using social media by healthcare organisation and how possible reputation risks can be mitigated is also investigated. 
Given the research aim of this study, a qualitative research approach was chosen.
More specifically, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 communication professionals associated with social media use by healthcare organisations or working in communications as ‘webcare’ team or online communication advisor of eight different hospitals in the Netherlands. 											Findings show that social media use was perceived as one relevant aspect within the overall communications by the hospital and as part of reputation management in terms of being able to monitor what is being said about the hospital by people online and branding purposes. Most of the hospitals participating in this study recognised the importance of having a social media policy and employee guidelines for social media use to mitigate possible reputational threats it is recommended by reputation literature. 
	However, findings also show that several hospitals have yet to fully understand the possible reputation risks involved with using social media. Furthermore, hospitals remain behind in the developments when it comes to using social media more strategically for communication purposes. Overall, this study complements reputation management research by providing insights into a lesser explored industry, namely healthcare, and social media research by focusing on the influence of organisational social media use on reputation.","['media', 'business', 'Consumer Online Engagement', 'Corporate Reputation', 'Employee Engagement', 'Healthcare Sector', 'Hospitals', 'Reputation Management', 'Reputation Risk', 'Social Media Communications', 'Social Media Policy and Guidelines']"
The effectiveness of direct comparative advertisements for supermarkets and brands in a Facebook setting,E.H.A. Verdiesen,2017-10-23,"['S.J. Opree', 'J.S. Lee']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The present research examines the effectiveness of comparative advertisements for different type of segment supermarkets and brands in a social media setting. The hierarchy-of-effects model was used in this research to define the concept of effectiveness. According to this model effectiveness can be measured as increased awareness, knowledge, liking, preference, conviction, and/or purchase intention. In this research, purchase intention was excluded because the actual buying of a product was not measurable. In terms of methodology, an 2-by-2 between subjects online experiment was conducted. The effectiveness of comparative advertisements from high and low segment supermarkets (i.e., Albert Heijn and Aldi) with high and low segment brands (i.e., Calvé and own label) were compared to each other. The statistical population included a total of 131 respondents, consisting of 41 men with an average age of 35.49 and 90 women with an average age of 31.09 years old. The data was analyzed by using SPSS24, conducting chi-square tests for independence (with Yates’ Continuity Correction) and one-way between-groups analyses of variance with Tukey HSD and post-hoc comparisons (ANOVAs). The results of the research showed that there was little evidence for a difference in effectiveness in the combinations of high or low segment stores and high or low segment brands using direct comparative advertising in a social media setting. For the components awareness, knowledge, advertisement likeability, store likeability and conviction there was no difference found. However, a difference was found for brand likeability and preference. The respondents’ likeability of the brand was higher for the high segment brand than for the low segment brand. Lastly, respondents preferred the high segment store and the high segment brand over the low segment store and the low segment brand. The findings of this research can give an insight in the field of comparative advertisement in the Netherlands in a social media context. More specifically, these findings can advise both high and low segment supermarkets on what type of segment brand they can use best in a comparative advertisement on social media.","['media', 'business', 'Direct comparative advertisement', 'Social media', 'Low vs. High segment supermarket', 'Low vs. high segment brand', 'Effectiveness', 'Hierarchy-of-effects model']"
Dance and Business,"Verbij, J.",2017-10-23,['Dr. P.V. Bhansing'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This qualitative research aims to investigate the interaction between artistic and managerial directors in dual leadership structures within Dutch dance companies and its effect on the assessment of organizational performance. The interaction between the dual leaders is defined in terms of shared values, discussion/conversation, division of tasks and contribution to each other’s field of work. This interaction is related to the assessment of organizational performance. It was investigated how tensions between the artistic and managerial director can be decreased and how this can influence the definition of organizational performance. The actual research question is How does the interaction between the artistic director and the managerial director in Dutch dance companies influence their definition of organizational performance? Five Dutch dance companies were used as case studies for this research: Dutch National Ballet, Scapino Ballet Rotterdam, Introdans, Conny Janssen Danst and NB Projects. The research results were found by obtaining in-depth interviews with the artistic and managerial directors and by researching the website and year reports of the companies. The results of this study indicate a hierarchy between the dual leaders. Arts is considered as the leading factor of the organization, which makes the artistic leader the most influential director. The management and the managerial director play a supportive and condition-creating role. Although the companies daily struggle with tensions between the artistic ambitions and the financial limitations, there are no tensions indicated between the artistic and managerial directors. Tensions between the two directors are diminished by three success factors: shared values, a personal connection and mutual understanding. These factors also cause that the dual leaders assess the organizational performance in the same way, which will decrease tensions regarding this subject. This research is relevant for dance companies and other cultural organizations because it shows the factors that are needed to succeed within a dual leadership structure. Furthermore, this research is scientifically relevant because it adds understanding on dual leadership structures and it contributes to the previous studies into this topic, which were all done in a quantitative way.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'dual leadership', 'dance companies', 'artistic business', 'interaction', 'organizational performance']"
The world of beauty vloggers on YouTube,E.P. Sokol,2017-10-20,"['J.S. Lee', 'J. Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","A new phenomenon of beauty vloggers on YouTube has exploded and exceeded the viewership of many
forms of traditional media. These beauty gurus on the platform are in most cases entrepreneurial women
in their twenties, who are trying to get in the beauty genre of new media. Due to their large subscriber’s
base and millions of views, it becomes increasingly interesting for corporate beauty brands to partner up
with beauty vloggers to promote their products. This level of influence is comparable to those of
celebrities and these vloggers are considered to be opinion leaders. Furthermore, product placements in
advertising keep evolving due to technological developments and expansion across media outlets. It is
valuable for marketers to understand how the level of prominence in product placement effects the
overall brand attitude.
A multitude of scientific research has been done on the type of endorsers in advertising. There is,
however, still some disagreement and discussion about the exact role that celebrity and expert endorsers
have on perceived credibility. Furthermore, the comparison between the two types of endorsers in an
online context has never been examined yet. Also, little research has been conducted on the effectives of
the level of prominence in product placements in vlogs. Drawing on previous literature, a quantitative
method using an experimental design with a pre-stimulus and post-stimulus questionnaire was used. The
four experimental conditions contained of existing beauty vlogs on YouTube. In the pre-stimulus
questionnaire, the level of involvement explained by the elaboration likelihood model was measured.
Furthermore, the perceived credibility, overall brand attitude and purchase intention were measured in the
post-stimulus questionnaire. In total, 240 female respondents aged 18 to 54 that are interested in beauty
participated in the experiment.
The findings of this study indicated that both expert and celebrity endorsers have a high
perceived credibility. However, when comparing the two types of endorsers, expert endorsers have a
significantly higher perceived credibility as opposed to celebrity endorsers across high and low
involvement categories. A lower level of prominence in product placement has a significantly more
positive effect on brand attitude, as opposed to explicit endorsement for both high and low involvement
groups. Furthermore, the findings illustrated that perceived credibility has a negative effect on the
purchase intention and the overall brand attitude has a positive effect. The results of this study can serve
as a foundation for future studies that aim to research the effectiveness of the type of endorser and the
level of prominence in beauty vlogs on YouTube.","['media', 'business', 'endorsement', 'product placement', 'credibility', 'brand attitude', 'purchase intention', 'elaboration likelihood model', 'beauty vlogger']"
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actors,E. Tankovski,2017-10-20,"['V. Chaudhri', 'J. Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Although there is growing recognition that NGOs play a crucial role in driving the CSR agenda of business and in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, academic literature on how NGOs impact the formulation and implementation of CSR or corporate codes remains limited. As Switzerland is home to a high number of both national and international NGOs, the Swiss NGO landscape is particularly interesting for researching the role of the not-for-profit sector in furthering sustainable development. More precisely, the research examines how Swiss NGOs perceive their roles in influencing the CSR or sustainability agendas of corporations and what kinds of influence strategies they apply within this attempt. Furthermore, possible challenges that can pose threats to the legitimacy of NGOs or that can occur during the process of impacting the CSR of firms are depicted.
Assuming that NGOs can influence corporate decision-making regarding CSR via various influence strategies, and that the definition of NGOs as secondary stakeholders is no longer adequate, this study applies a qualitative approach through conducting fourteen in-depth expert interviews with fourteen professionals from NGOs, representing Swiss-based NGOs with both social and environmental sustainability missions. 
The research contributes to a growing body of scholarship that underlines the importance of NGOs as crucial actors in influencing managerial decision making (Frooman & Murrell, 2005; Yaziji & Doh, 2009; Zietsma & Winn, 2008) by demonstrating, firstly, the wide set of strategies that NGOs employ to influence the CSR agenda of firms. Moreover, it can be said that attitudes toward CSR do affect how NGOs perceive their roles in influencing the CSR agenda of corporations, as they can predict the selection of certain influence strategies. More specifically, coercive strategies such as the implementation of manifestations or the execution of a social media campaign against irresponsible corporations are mainly used by NGOs who possess a critical attitude towards CSR, while collaborative strategies such as cross-sector partnerships or discussion round tables are mainly applied by NGOs who are less critical of CSR. Furthermore, differences between the two different camps of NGOs (critical vs. in favor of CSR) can be detected in the usage of pathway strategies or, in other words, the inclusion of allies such as the government or ordinary citizens. Overall, the results show that both forms of strategies can impact the sustainability agendas of businesses. 
Although Swiss NGOs prove to be vital actors in driving sustainability agendas, it has to be noted that contextual constraints as well as factors referring to the organizational structure of a firm can impede the ability of NGOs to effectively impact CSR. In addition to these challenges, NGOs who apply collaborative strategies face the risks of being co-opted by the business sector. Being aware of such challenges and knowing how to manage potential risks, allows NGOs to maintain legitimacy. 
Last but not least, limitations of the study and implications for future research are highlighted.","['media', 'business', 'Business', 'Coercive strategies', 'Collaborative strategies', 'Constraints', 'Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)', 'Cross-sector alliances', 'CSR actors', 'CSR attitudes', 'Non-government organizations (NGOs)', 'NGO impact', 'Sustainability agenda']"

What motivates influencers to work with brands and how do influencers construct their impressions through personal and sponsored posts? In line with Leary and Kowalski’s (1990) two-component model, the purpose of this study is to uncover what the impression management practices are of lifestyle influencers on Instagram. Specifically, this research aims to understand the impression motivation and construction processes that an influencer goes through on Instagram. Furthermore, this study seeks to answer how influencers utilize authenticity, self-disclosure and intimacy in their impression management practices. A total number of 11 semi-structured interviews were conducted via Skype with Dutch and international influencers in May 2017. Through the qualitative approach of interviews, an in-depth understanding was outlined to how influencers are motivated and how influencers construct their impressions through Instagram. Through the application of thematic analysis, there results indicated main themes from the data to explain from the influencer’s perspective how they construct their impressions on Instagram. Influencers manage their impressions on Instagram based on five themes: genuineness, apt brand-fit, personal vs. online self, varying affinity and storytelling. These five themes illustrate how influencers are motivated to appear authentic, the extent to which they self-disclose, and the degree to which they form intimate impressions. The results conclude with a conceptual model, in which it emerges that the three guiding concepts are to a certain extent relatable to one another. The paper concludes on its main findings, and includes a critical assessment on its limitations, providing suggestions for future research in this scope.","['media', 'business', 'Impression management', 'Influencer marketing', 'Self-presentation', 'Mobile technology', 'Instagram']"
How Do We Talk to the Public?,J.T. Lutje Schipholt,2017-10-20,"['Y. Wang', 'J. Jansz']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Despite extensive research on crisis communication, companies still face troubles in correctly
applying crisis communication strategies in practice. With a business transition where brands
are ought to become more personal as well as make use of new media channels,
communication managers must develop their strategy accordingly. To give guidance to these
developments, the current study aimed to uncover useful handholds for communication
managers who are concerned with creating crisis communication strategies. To lead this
research, the main question was focused on what the effects of emotion, medium, and
company sector used in crisis communication, are on the public response. The study followed
an experimental research design, which was executed through a survey. A sample of 299
respondents gave useful insights concerning their preferences on company’s communication
tactics in times of a crisis. The sample contained a nearly equal gender representation and
largely consisted of young adults (19-29 years old) with a Dutch nationality and an education
background of a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree. The outcome of the study revealed that the
conditions of (emotional) message framing and industry are intertwined in their effect on
secondary crisis communication and secondary crisis reaction: a company that falls within
the hospitality industry (emotional-driven sector) benefits from an emotional approach,
whereas a company that falls within the financial industry (rational-driven sector) benefits
from a rational approach. Thus, we proclaim that a company’s industry is an important
indicator for what type of message framing is desired in crisis communication. Also, results
showed that the public prefers to be approached via an online newspaper rather than via
Facebook in times of a crisis. However, as the latter was only an implication based on a weak
result, this area could benefit from more extensive investigation. This study expands both on
the situational crisis communication theory and social-mediated crisis communication model
and gives practical handholds to communication managers predominantly by giving insights
on the use of emotion in crisis communication.","['media', 'business', 'Crisis Communication', 'Emotion', 'Medium', 'Industry', 'Secondary Crisis Response']"

By means of conducting fifteen semi-structured in-depth interviews, several views and implications on careers in music in 2017 have emerged. This study adds up-to-date information to the ongoing debate between scholars whether digitization has caused disintermediation or reintermediation. Results show that the possibilities the online sphere has to offer, are frequently viewed as a new way to establish a career in music, as amounts of clicks, plays and views can feign popularity that might attract fans. However, live performances cannot falter, nor did respondents of this study know how to actually establish that online popularity they spoke off. Furthermore, the Dutch music industry is considered a secluded place, where traditional gatekeepers (i.e. radio-DJs and television producers) decide who gets the chance to stand on the national stage of traditional channels. Besides traditional gatekeepers, new gatekeepers have emerged with the rise of popular internet platforms like Spotify and Facebook. Digital playlist curators and algorithms call the shots in the online sphere. As a result of this complex partly digitized, partly still offline landscape, musicians still extensively use intermediaries during their careers. The DIY-career model is outdated, as no musician likes to do everything themselves, because they feel like they still need networks and skills of established industry professionals. On the other hand, artists like to stay independent and in control of their own career. Therefore, a new business model (The DIY Entrepreneur) has emerged, in which musicians ‘cherry pick’ whom they want to work with, how they want to work with them, and on what basis they want to work with them (i.e. based on Bourdieu’s alternative capital).","['media', 'business', 'Dutch music industry', 'DIY', 'Cultural Entrepreneur', 'Intermediation', 'Alternative capital']"

It aims to fill a gap in branding literature investigating the importance of brands in the video game industry. The video game industry is characterized by an oligopolistic structure with Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft remaining as the three main video game console manufacturers in the contemporary market. The present study investigated to what extent the target demographic perceives the three brands as differentiated and to what extent this influences their loyalty towards these brands. A quantitative method was used employing a questionnaire in order to assess participants’ opinions about the brands. Statistical analysis allowed for investigating the linear relationship between perceived brand differentiation and brand loyalty. Results show that there is a relationship between the two concepts, meaning that when a participant scores higher on the differentiation scale indicating more differentiation of the brand, it is likely that participants score higher on the loyalty scale. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the strength of the perceived brand differentiation score could account for nearly 50 percent of the score of brand loyalty for all three brands, indicating a high degree of relatedness between the two concepts. The results also stress that there is a certain causality among brand sources that compose brand equity, implying that marketers can focus their attention on multiple steps in gradually building brand equity. 
	For firms operating in the video game industry, it turns out to be viable to focus on differentiating a brand from the competition in terms of software offered on the console and offering advantages that competing brands do not offer.

The breadth of research on the topic has adopted the representational perspective, focusing on socialization and informal exchanges of knowledge as key to creative clustering. However, this study makes use of the non-representational perspective that sees the physical environment as essential to understanding creative clustering. By combining non-representational clustering literature with branding literature, this thesis investigates the role of place as a branding device for creative clusters located in post-industrial buildings and explores the relationship between the perceptions of individual entrepreneurs about place, the perceptions of the cluster and its branding processes. More specifically, it focuses on relevant elements of the built form that play a role in creative production, reputation-making and, ultimately, branding. The research was conducted via social media content analysis and qualitative interviews with micro-cluster managers and creative entrepreneurs located within. Results suggest the existence of complex dynamics between the physical location of a micro-cluster, the stakeholders involved and the branding processes of such organizations. Place is an active and recognised source of inspiration and reputation for the workers within it; consequently, creative clusters indeed actively make use of the locational behaviour of creative entrepreneurs in their branding. The research concludes that place is a central element of the branding of post-industrial micro-clusters and proceeds to presenting the most popular place branding strategies that were found.","['media', 'business', 'creative clusters', 'location factors', 'creative entrepreneurs', 'built form', 'non-representational perspective', 'place branding']"

Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Digitalization makes it impossible to exclude the Internet in finding experiences and opinions of other consumers. Therefore, the Internet adds a new phenomenon to word-of-mouth (face-to-face communication): electronic word-of-mouth. This creates new forms of cultural criticism. For example, consumers can review an artist’s new album online. Those who convey this information to others are called ‘mavens’: they always are the first in collecting new information and discovering new trends. Mavens can thus greatly influence the consumers’ choices. Relativity little research has been done on how people get influenced in music. This leads to the research question: 

What role do mavens and new media have in finding new music and influencing music lovers?

An existing dataset representing the Dutch population has been used to answer this research question. The dataset has been analysed using the statistical computer program SPSS, with statistical tests like cross tables, ANOVA tests and regression analysis. Main findings are that new media are important in finding (new) music. However, this doesn’t mean new media is more relevant than traditional media. Lots of music lovers still find new music by listening to the radio or watching television. Also, there are differences in generations in using new media: while younger people tend to discover new music through social media and YouTube, older people (66+) mostly use traditional media. In addition to this, music lovers discover new music through conversations with their friends too. This concludes that mavenism not only takes place in online- and traditional media, but also through face-to-face communication with friends. Future research is needed to analyse mavenism in a more specific way, and to find out if the generation gap in using new media to find new music is actually fading away.","['media', 'cultuur', 'new media', 'word-of-mouth', 'electronic word-of-mouth', 'mavens', 'music influence.']"
Sexting via Snapchat; snap jij het?,I. Gouweloos,2017-10-17,"['J. Jansz', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Dit onderzoek had als doel om de sociale normen ten aanzien van sexting via Snapchat te
onderzoeken, waarbij er een vergelijking is gedaan tussen mannelijke en vrouwelijke studenten.
Sexting is een veelbesproken onderwerp in de media en er is de laatste jaren relatief veel onderzoek
gedaan naar sexting. Er is evenwel weinig kwalitatief onderzoek gedaan naar de sociale normen met
betrekking tot sexting. Dit onderzoek biedt enkele nieuwe inzichten. Het onderzoek is ook een
aanvulling op de bestaande literatuur waarvan de meeste onderzoeken afkomstig zijn uit de
Verenigde Staten, terwijl seks in de media in de VS anders wordt geïnterpreteerd dan in Nederland.
De focus ligt op het sociale medium Snapchat, omdat vanuit de bestaande literatuur dit het meest
geschikte medium lijkt om aan sexting te doen. De onderzoeksvraag luidt: Welke sociale normen
hanteren mannelijke studenten van 18 tot 24 jaar in een romantische relatie ten aanzien van sexting
via Snapchat in vergelijking met vrouwelijke studenten?
De Social Norm Theory van Berkowitz en Perkins (1986) en de waargenomen, voorspellende
en beschrijvende normen van Lapinski en Rimal (2005) zijn gebruikt om de sociale normen die
jongeren hanteren te onderzoeken. Sociale normen bepalen het sociaal wenselijk gedrag in een
sociale groep in een bepaalde situatie (Berkowitz, 2005), waarbij het opvallend is dat dit voornamelijk
in groepen plaatsvindt, terwijl sexting iets is dat tussen twee personen gebeurt. Deze theorieën zijn
vervolgens van belang met het oog op de dominante normen die in een vriendengroep spelen en het
gedrag dat kan worden aangepast naar de normen in deze groep. Volgens diverse onderzoekers zijn
jongeren snel beïnvloedbaar met betrekking tot seksuele media, waarbij voornamelijk vrienden een
grote rol spelen (Nikken & De Graaf, 2012; Van Oosten, Vandenbosch & Peter, 2017).
In dit onderzoek zijn er 16 participanten tussen 18 en 24 jaar geïnterviewd door middel van
semigestructureerde interviews. Kwalitatieve interviews leken de beste methode in dit onderzoek
vanwege de mogelijkheid om een fenomeen als sexting in de diepte te onderzoeken, waarbij er ruimte
is om een zo persoonlijk mogelijk gesprek te voeren en door te vragen. Omdat sexting een gevoelig
onderwerp lijkt te zijn, wordt er ook gebruik gemaakt van de vignette methode waarin scenario’s zijn
gebruikt over een hypothetisch persoon in een specifieke omgeving, ook wel een derde
persoonsperspectief (Hantrais & Mangen, 1996).
De resultaten van dit onderzoek laten zien dat sexting inderdaad een rol speelt onder de
doelgroep en er geen taboe heerst omtrent sexting. Participanten vinden sexting normaal en baseren
dit voornamelijk op de (veronderstelde) norm dat iedereen het zou doen, terwijl er niet over sexting
wordt gepraat met vrienden. De verschillen tussen mannen en vrouwen met betrekking tot het
hanteren van deze sociale normen zijn minimaal. Vrouwen zouden sneller beïnvloedbaar zijn en
mannen negatiever ten opzichte van het verspreiden en laten zien van foto’s. Dit onderzoek wordt tot
slot afgesloten met de beperkingen van dit onderzoek en de aanbevelingen voor volgend onderzoek.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Sexting', 'sociale normen', 'jongeren', 'Snapchat']"
‘Hoe zit het met mijn online privacy?’,J.M. Snel,2017-10-17,"['M. Willekens', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het internet en sociale media bieden internetgebruikers de mogelijkheid om online te interacteren en
content te delen. Vooral jongeren maken hier op actieve wijze gebruik van. De vormgeving en de aard
van sociale media moedigen gebruikers aan om grote hoeveelheden persoonlijke gegevens weer te
geven en te delen. Dit brengt echter ook privacyrisico’s met zich mee, dankzij het surveillance
mechanisme waarop sociale media draaien. Sociale media en andere partijen gebruiken namelijk deze
gegevens om winst te maken, maar ook om individueel gedrag te voorspellen, te beïnvloeden en zelfs
te bepalen. Het behoud van (online) privacy is echter een probleem dat door velen wordt genegeerd.
Men vindt privacy over het algemeen wel belangrijk, maar handelt hier nauwelijks naar, wat de
privacy paradox heet. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor onder jongeren is onwetendheid; jongeren zijn
zich vaak onbewust van de bewustzijnsexploitatie gedaan door bedrijven en missen digitale
geletterdheid om zich hier beter tegen te beschermen. Dit onderzoek richt zich op in hoeverre het
privacybewustzijn, bestaande uit de perceptie, aandacht en kennis wat betreft online privacy-kwesties,
reikt onder Nederlandse jongeren vanaf 16 tot en met 29 jaar die gebruikmaken van sociale media.
Via een online enquête is er data verzameld van 260 respondenten. Bevindingen toonden aan dat
actief sociale mediagebruik en deels het opleidingsniveau van invloed bleken te zijn op de
privacyperceptie en geslacht op de privacykennis. Leeftijd en privacykennis bleken van invloed te zijn
op de kans dat respondenten van plan waren bewuste actie te ondernemen om de online privacy beter
te beschermen. Aan de hand van de resultaten wordt geconcludeerd dat ook onder de onderzochte
jongeren de privacy paradox aanwezig is, maar dat er een nuance noodzakelijk is, omdat de privacy
paradox gedeeltelijk wordt tegengesproken; respondenten die op actievere wijze gebruikmaken van
sociale media maakten zich namelijk minder zorgen over hun online privacy dan respondenten die op
minder actieve wijze gebruikmaken van sociale media. Daarnaast wordt geconcludeerd dat het gebrek
aan privacykennis onder de respondenten niet sociaal is gestructureerd, sinds leeftijd en
opleidingsniveau hier niet van invloed op bleken te zijn. Tot slot wordt geconcludeerd dat dit
onderzoek deels heeft bijgedragen aan het bijbrengen van reflectie, kennis en een kritischer bewustzijn
over online privacy onder de respondenten, waarmee zij op bewustere wijze om kunnen gaan met het
delen van persoonlijke gegevens op het internet en sociale media.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Online privacy', 'internet', 'sociale media', 'privacy paradox', 'privacybewustzijn']"

wetenschap als politiek (O’Connor, 2004, Florida, 2002 & Charles Landry, 2006). Vanuit
beleidsoogpunt is er onder andere veel aandacht voor de positieve effecten die een creatief cluster kan
hebben op de omgeving (Ministerie van OCW, 2009). Daarnaast wordt ook de innovatieve kracht van
zo’n cluster benadrukt. De co-locatie van creatieve ondernemers zorgt voor meer innovatie en een
sterkere sector, zo is de gedachte (Phan, Siegel & Wright, 2005). Een cluster heeft het potentieel om
een grote kennisrijkdom in zich te verzamelen, wat de creatieve innovatie ten goede komt (Cohendet
& Simon, 2008). In vorige onderzoeken naar de rol van kennis werd er vooral op de formele
uitwisselingen binnen en rond een cluster gefocust. De interne processen die creatieve clusters juist
onderscheiden van andere clusters worden hierdoor onderbelicht gelaten (Hitters, 2009; Pratt, &
Jeffcutt 2009). Het doel van dit onderzoek is om juist op de interne kennisuitwisseling in te gaan en
aan de hand van de casus van het Schieblock inzichten te verkrijgen in het proces wat aan de
uitwisselingen ten grondslag ligt.De hoofdvraag van het onderzoek luidt: Hoe ontstaat informele
kennisuitwisseling binnen het Schieblock en wat is de toegevoegde waarde ervan voor de
ondernemers?
Door interviews en aanvullende participerende observatie is er in het cluster van het
Schieblock in Rotterdam onderzocht wat de ervaringen zijn van de ondernemers met betrekking tot de
hoofdvraag. Uit de resultaten van de kwalitatieve analyse blijkt dat er vier voorwaarden te
identificeren zijn die het proces van informele kennisuitwisseling faciliteren: Nabijheid, Beheer en
locatie, Vertrouwen en Buzz. De meerwaarde van de informele uitwisseling wordt door de
ondernemers in veel mindere mate aan formele voordelen gekoppeld, maar zit juist in het sfeer dat het
lokale netwerk geeft als context voor de dagelijkse gang van zaken. Daarnaast is er een grote variatie
in kaart gebracht van de ervaringen. De ervaringen hebben allemaal gemeen dat het hebben van de
mogelijkheid tot interactie veel belangrijker blijkt te zijn, dan de daadwerkelijke activiteit.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Creatieve clusters', 'informele kennisuitwisseling', 'buzz', 'tacit knowledge', 'Schieblock']"
Rotterdam als koploper,M. Voogd,2017-10-17,"['A.J.C. van der Hoeven', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Omdat er binnen het onderzoeksveld rond citybranding tot nu toe weinig aandacht is
geweest voor publieksperceptie, is ervoor gekozen om hier in dit onderzoek op te focussen.
Wanneer media positieve boodschappen uit de citybranding-campagnes overnemen, heeft
dit mogelijk positieve mediaberichtgeving over een stad als gevolg. Dit kan leiden tot een
groei aan nieuwe bezoekers en bedrijven, wat stimulerend werkt voor de economie van een
stad (Braun, 2012; Burd, 2008; Kavaratzis, 2004). De huidige ontwikkeling in Rotterdam is
hier een goed voorbeeld van en wordt daarom middels deze studie onderzocht. Het doel van
dit onderzoek is om meer te weten te komen over hoe de inwoners van Rotterdam de
citybranding en de daaropvolgende positieve mediaberichtgeving over de stad beschouwen.
De onderzoeksvraag luidt als volgt: Hoe geven de inwoners van Rotterdam betekenis aan
enerzijds de citybranding en anderzijds de positieve mediaberichtgeving over de stad?
Met behulp van semigestructureerde diepte-interviews onder de inwoners van de
binnenstad, is antwoord gegeven op de onderzoeksvraag. Om de meningen van deze
Rotterdammers zo goed mogelijk in kaart te brengen, was het relevant om binnen de groep
respondenten variatie aan te brengen, waaronder in leeftijd, geslacht, opleidingsniveau,
migratieachtergrond en periode dat zij woonachtig in Rotterdam zijn.
Op basis van de resultaten uit de interviews worden de volgende conclusies
getrokken. Ten eerste herkennen de respondenten de manier waarop Rotterdam in de
citybranding-campagne wordt gerepresenteerd. Daarbij vinden zij het een realistische
weergave van de stad. Ten tweede geeft het merendeel van de respondenten hun voorkeur
aan bottom-up citybranding, waarbij zij inspraak krijgen in het proces. Opvallend is dat enkel
hoogopgeleide blanke respondenten voorkeur aan top-down citybranding geven. Hierbij
wordt de invulling van de campagne overgelaten aan bijvoorbeeld de gemeente. Ten derde
zijn alle respondenten positief over de huidige ontwikkelingen en ervaren nog meer het
gevoel van trots. Respondenten die al langer woonachtig zijn in de stad, geven aan dat
Rotterdam deze positieve weergave verdient. Voor respondenten die recentelijk naar
Rotterdam zijn verhuisd, geldt de mediaberichtgeving als bevestiging van een goede keuze.
Zo stond Rotterdam bekend als een onbegrepen en gevaarlijke stad en de positieve
mediaberichtgeving wordt door de respondenten als bewijsvoering gebruikt om het tegendeel
te bewijzen. Ten vierde blijkt echter dat de respondenten vinden dat de stad eenzijdig wordt 
3
gerepresenteerd. Zo zien respondenten liever minder focus op iconische gebouwen, maar
meer op de sfeer, (multiculturele) inwoners en wijken. Met name respondenten met een
migrantenachtergrond geven hun voorkeur aan meer aandacht voor de culturele diversiteit.
Ten slotte geven de respondenten toename aan toerisme, gentrificatie en de verandering
van de oorspronkelijke identiteit als gevolg. Deze consequenties worden door de
respondenten zowel op een positieve als negatieve wijze belicht. Zo kijkt het merendeel van
de respondenten op een negatieve manier naar gentrificatie en alleen hoogopgeleide
respondenten op een positieve manier. Al met al geven de resultaten uit dit onderzoek
inzicht in hoeverre Rotterdammers zich met de stad en de weergaven hiervan identificeren.
Naast dat dit een aanvulling is voor het onderzoeksveld rond citybranding, zou Gemeente
Rotterdam met behulp van deze informatie hun citybranding-strategieën kunnen bijsturen en
nog meer betrokkenheid en draagvlak bij de inwoners kunnen creëren.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Rotterdam', 'top-down citybranding', 'bottom-up citybranding', 'mediaberichtgeving', 'identiteit', 'gentrificatie', 'publieksperceptie']"
Van sociale mediagebruiker naar fanatieke museumbezoeker?,R.S.F. Nederveen,2017-10-17,"['M. Willekens', 'J. Jansz']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The use of social media is broadly accepted, by cultural organizations, as a marketing tool to expand their audience reach. Theorized by Bourdieu, economic and cultural capital are seen to be the characteristics of the visitors who visit museums the most frequently. Bourdieu states within his reproduction these, that cultural participation, as in visiting a museum, is socially constructed, which means that the cultural participation of an individual is determined by income, level of education and their previous cultural participation pattern. Nevertheless, cultural organisations are convinced that social media usage is less socially constructed. But little is known about the construction of social media usage among museum visitors and therefore the efficiency of social media as a marketing tool for cultural organizations to renew and expand their audience. 
 	The aim of this research was to fill this research gap by testing if the economic and cultural capital influences the social media usage of the visitors. Based on the reproductionthese of Bourdieu, cultural participation, income and level of education were presumed to be determinants of the way visitors use social media. In total, 264 visitors of Museum Rotterdam (N = 264) participated in a survey, identifying their social demographic, social economic values and social media usage. Using logistic regressions and multinomial regression, results showed that the age of the visitors predicts the social media usage. However, age, level of education and income predict the frequency of the social media usage among the visitors in a limited extend. The specific media usage among visitors, remarkably showed no relation with social demographic and social economic characteristics of the visitors. 
 	The results from the three regression models were implemented as acceptance of the assumption, that social media usage among visitors is not that socially constructed as their cultural participation is. And therefore, could be an efficient tool for cultural organisations to expand their audience. Moreover, the conclusion showed that the reproductionthese of Bourdieu is not applicable on the social media usage. On the contrary, the individualisation theory of Ulrich Beck could provide a possible explanation why social media usage among museum visitors is not fully determined by their income and level of education, and therefore is differently structured than cultural participation. The results of this research contribute to a better understanding of the way social media usage is structured by the visitors and supports the vision of cultural organizations on social media. Further research should be focused on the way cultural participation is linked to social media.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Sociale media', 'Culturele Reproductie', 'Cultuurparticipatie', 'Economisch kapitaal', 'Cultureel kapitaal', 'Sociale constructie', 'Museumbezoekers']"
Coworking Spaces,F.S. Jubitana,2017-10-17,"['H.J.C.J. Hitters', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Within recent years an increasing amount of knowledge workers that are (mostly) active in the field of the creative industries and new media have been starting to make use of shared urban office environments known as coworking spaces. While essentially these coworking spaces can simply be conceived of as places where urban knowledge workers can rent a desk and work alongside each other, these environments are increasingly being associated with high expectations concerning the future of knowledge work as they intend to foster interactive dynamics among individual and local communities of entrepreneurs, freelancers and startups that make use of these spaces. The local concentration of these knowledge workers within coworking spaces has in particularly been suggested to be beneficial for knowledge creation, which involves the process by which new ideas, products and services are being developed, given that coworking spaces facilitate the physical platforms for these knowledge workers to identify new opportunities through networking practices, which consequently could lead to knowledge creation through the combination of the skills and talents of these coworkers.
As a result of these assumed benefits for knowledge creation, coworking spaces have been conceptualized as microclusters in analogy to clusters which can be understood as “geographic concentrations of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers, service providers, firms from related industries, and associated institutions”, and which facilitate similar knowledge dynamics albeit on a different scale. Evidence of such dynamics however appeared to be lacking, which is why scholars started to cast their doubts on whether coworking spaces can actually redeem their promise of becoming promising platforms for knowledge creation. Moreover, despite that previous studies provided some useful indications of factors that could provoke knowledge creation dynamics among coworkers, none of these studies qualitatively assessed which of these factors are actually considered effective by the main actors related to coworking spaces. In order to address this gap in the literature, a qualitative inquiry by the means of eleven in-depth interviews was conducted with both coworkers and staff related to the management of seven Amsterdam-based coworking spaces, in order to find an answer to the following research question: “How can coworking spaces effectively foster knowledge creation?”
Cluster theory was first consulted in order to assess whether similar factors are of influence on knowledge creation dynamics within coworking spaces as the conceptualization of these environments as microclusters seems to suggest. The results of the thematic data analysis indicated four main factors that were considered as effective in their ability to foster knowledge creation dynamics within coworking spaces: Selection, Connecting, Interactive Design and Educating. The relevance of these factors however seemed to differ between coworking spaces that were either larger, or smaller in terms of size and populations. Consequently, these differences make it questionable whether the microcluster conceptualization of coworking spaces will remain sustainable as it only seems to cover one particular configuration of coworking.","['media', 'business', 'Coworking Spaces', 'Knowledge Creation', 'Creative Knowledge Workers', 'Clusters', 'Microclusters.']"
From Inclusion to Indifference,K. Klijnhout,2017-10-17,"['M.S.S.E. Janssen', 'C.J.M. van Eijck']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This paper studies cultural openness as a cultural resource of Dutch urban youth. Young urban inhabitants
navigate encounters with diversity on a daily basis, and often have a multicultural background themselves. This
research consists of 20 in-depth interviews with urbanites aged 18 to 20 years old, using a topic list, dilemmas,
and a newly developed visual method. Building on research on cosmopolitanism, boundary making, and city
culture, it develops its own framework of situational forms of cultural openness. Interaction with otherness is
found to be at the core of cultural openness. The way young people experience otherness is addressed by
uncovering social and symbolic boundaries between friends and school groups, and in the public sphere.
The findings show cultural openness as a layered urban repertoire that can take the form of inclusion,
acceptance and respect, or indifference. These forms of openness differ in their handling of boundaries:
indifference ignores boundaries, acceptance and respect acknowledge boundaries, and inclusion stretches
boundaries. This repertoire of cultural openness fits an urban environment where a highly diverse and dense
public space is combined with private niches of similar people. In the public realm indifference gives others
space and avoids cultural conflict, while in more personal encounters inclusion bridges differences.
Urban youth experiences boundaries differently in various layers of social organisation: the private, parochial
and public realm. Relationships between social and symbolic boundaries are suggested to often be implicit, with
unconscious connections between social categories and symbolic boundaries. The interviews display how the
visceral part of detecting boundaries is easier for respondents than the literal part of explaining them. They
display cosmopolitan actions and preferences without the reflexive capacity to explain them, or the moral
discursive resources to express them in cosmopolitan ideals. Respondents in this research use both emotional
and rational arguments in their reasoning about cultural openness. The latter is slightly more frequently used by
youth with a migrant background and by female respondents. These findings ask for caution with research on
cosmopolitanism based on argumentation, and for more attention to practise- oriented research, the visceral
experience of boundaries, and different forms of reasoning behind cultural openness.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'cultural openness', 'ordinary cosmopolitanism', 'boundaries', 'cultural diversity', 'city culture', 'youth']"
Fiction Based Religions and their Multiple Functions,"Dou, N.

Schaap, J.C.F",2017-10-14,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Fiction based religions are the product of fan communities that creatively rework narratives of popular culture and formulate them as a pseudo-religious structure (Cusack, 2010). Some of these fiction based religions are Jediism which is based on Star Wars, Matrixism which is based on the Matrix movies, and the Churches of Helix and Dome which are based on Twitch Plays Pokémon. The unique context of the social and spiritual formulation of fiction based religions leads to the investigation of their function, and what they bring to the people participating in their creation, development and use for community and narrative purposes. The framing they receive within the literature can fall under different categorizations which offer different understanding of their function and use. These categorizations come in the form of invented religions (Cusack, 2010), hyper-real religions (Schorey, 2016; Possamai, 2012), New Age or spiritual supermarket (Aupers & Houtman, 2010; Hanegraaff, 2000; O’Leary, 1996), Folklore (Hansen, 2009; Gillis, 2011), or even civil religions (Simpson, 1984). Each of these categories offers a different take on the phenomenon. This consideration of the literature raised the following question: To what extent do these fiction based religion fulfill a spiritual function of believing or a social function of belonging? In this research, a qualitative approach was opted for in order to investigate the specific case of the Twitch Plays Pokémon religions. The aim of the research was to define the perspective of participants on the function of the fiction based religion that they are part of, either religious and spiritual, or social and creative. This approach enabled a general classification of the participants that was developed into a more fleshed out typology with the following main categories: Religious convergence, Religious separatism, Non-religious relatability, and Non-religious detachment. These categories best describe the attitudes of the participants towards the religious nature of their fiction based religions, and also showcases the different alternative functions attached to them.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Fiction Based Religions', 'Spirituality', 'In-group Sociality', 'Narrative Construction', 'Cyberspace']"
Vocational education revisited: the potential value of cultural education in post-secondary schooling: A quantitative analysis of the perceived value of (cultural) education by students engaged in Dutch vocational education,A.E.

Stocco Ferreira']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","A substantial amount of studies have researched the value of culture or the potential value of cultural education within the social or educational environment. In general, these studies are focused on the more pedagogical and social implications of cultural education when implemented in primary and secondary education, and seem to neglect the relevance of cultural education in post-secondary schooling. As a result of future technological developments, our fast changing society will have a great influence on the future labour market, involving severe implications for the occupational future of students engaged in postsecondary vocational education. This is why the changes that will occur on the job market have reopened the educational debate on the content of the curriculum and on the way of measuring competencies in vocational education; over the past years, a whole new approach to vocational education is being considered by several agencies. This study extents previous research and the on-going educational and cultural dialogue by investigating the perception of students engaged in vocational education in Rotterdam.
	The purpose in this study is to find out how students of vocational education assess the value of cultural education and how they perceive its meaning within their social and educational environment, taking their future job opportunities into account. A quantitative strategy was chosen to measure students’ cultural self-awareness and examine the perception of their education, their future job opportunities and the potential value of cultural education.
Data was gathered at the Port and Logistics department of the Shipping and Transportation
School, where 74 students were asked to fill in a questionnaire. 
	Results show that the more culturally active students hold a more pessimistic view of their future job perspective, but also seem to be more satisfied with their education oriented on or set against future employment. Moreover, the more culturally active students perceive their educational environment as more supportive and think of their social environment as being more influential than students who are less culturally active. At the end of this study, the theoretical implications, as well as restrictions and directions for future research are offered.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'cultural education', 'vocational education', 'perception', 'students', 'future labour market']"
Post-feminism in media culture,S. Alessandrini,2017-10-09,"['S.L. Bolderman', 'N. van Poecke']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The last few years have been characterized by a new resurgence of attention in feminism across the media. While some critics welcome enthusiastically this phenomenon, others like R. Gill and A. McRobbie see contemporary media culture as still animated by a post-feminist sensibility. In particular, celebrity culture depoliticizes feminist issues such as choice, freedom and autonomy by expressing neoliberal discourses of personal empowerment and success without considering the socio-political context one operates in. While little audience research has been done in order to evaluate how media consumers negotiate those representations of gender, fan studies produced a body of work focused on people’s media practices. Thus my research aims at filling this gap in previous feminist and celebrity research by shifting the attention to the opinions of media consumers. In particular I will evaluate what role post-feminism plays in Beyoncé fandom, given the fact that she is one of the most famous celebrities worldwide who recently “came out” as a feminist. In my research I made use of 10 semi-structured interviews of men and women aged between 18 and 26 years old with diverse nationalities. Through discourse analysis of participants’ answers I could evaluate how they confront wider forms of discourses related to gender. In particular, I explored how they perceive Beyoncé as a female celebrity, how they respond to the feminism brought forward by her and what are their opinions on feminism more generally. My analysis shows how the main notions of post-feminism as theorized by Gill and McRobbie inform the understanding of the interviewees with respect to women and women issues, although interviewees did not adhere fully to the post-feminist sensibility and in some case they were able to produce resistant readings. Post-feminist discourses of individual empowerment, choice and freedom were much present in interviewees’ answers: women are seen as autonomous agents who can achieve what they want if they work hard on themselves. Socio-political issues related to women were under-discussed. They generally endorse the concept of female sexual freedom which is not considered critically in relation to the sexualized way celebrities present themselves. Moreover, the way they perceive Beyoncé- as someone in control of her persona- points to discourses of self-discipline and surveillance. However, many of the interviewees were able to articulate socio-political concerns in relation to race discrimination. Ultimately, interviewees walk a thin line between expressing a post-feminist viewpoint (feminism as no longer much useful) and positions related to the more politically engaged third wave of feminism which takes into account discrimination related to race and sexuality along with gender. My research contributed also to the field of audience research since it showed how fans can act in accordance with dominant ideologies of post-feminism and neoliberalism, but they can also produce alternative readings.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Post-feminism', 'celebrity culture', 'media culture', 'feminism', 'fandom']"
How Do Contemporary Critics in Hong Kong and Taiwan Incorporate high aesthetics and popular aesthetics When Evaluating Korean Queer Movies?,Y. Yin,2017-10-09,"['D. Stocco Ferreira', 'L.E. Braden']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Although not all films are art, it is argued that it can be. In the art world of films, there are various cultural intermediaries working for the legitimation of film as an art form. Here, as one of the intermediaries, critics play an important role in disseminating the legitimating ideology of films. In the contemporary context, in recent years, there has been an interesting phenomenon that Korean queer movies have enjoyed growing recognition and popularity across Asia, especially in Hong Kong and Taiwan. However, the study on Korean queer movies has been comparatively small-scaled Therefore, this study is about the film discourse of Korean queer movies in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Specifically, the research is interested in how contemporary criticism in these two discourses incorporate reviewing elements associated with high aesthetics and popular aesthetics. To do this, this study has conducted a content analysis on 40 film reviews on Korean queer movies. These 40 reviews were first separated into three types—reviews with a critical tone, reviews with a popular tone, and reviews with both critical tone and popular tones, the last of which is based on the fact that some Korean queer movies are celebrated both critically and commercially.  Then, the study used Baumann (2006)’s theory on how art worlds are like social movements to analyze them. In the research, 13 themes have been generated from the data set and then grouped into the three main concepts from Baumann (2006)— ‘Opportunity Space’, ‘Resources’, and ‘Framing’. Specifically, the study examined how exactly they have been mobilized by critics to support their claims as well as the differences in terms of their usages across film review types. In a nutshell, the study finds that Baumann (2006)’s three concepts work for all the three types of reviews, however, the ways they have been mobilized by the critics are different, which are closely related to the type of each review. Particularly, the concept ‘Framing’ is used most frequently by critics to support their claims—be that critical or popular. In terms of reviews that have both critical and popular tones, the research finds that it is more of the incorporation and combination of different themes instead of the dominance of one single theme that help push critics’ acclaims on Korean queer movies further.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Korean queer movies', 'film discourse', 'criticism', 'aesthetics systems', 'Baumann']"

ideology called cultural racism, which is utilized to explain social status differences between White and non-White
people a product of cultural deficiencies rather than a product of White discrimination. Since cultural racism finds
its legitimization on stereotyped ideas of what the essence of a culture is, the act of harmfully appropriating other
cultures – that is representing them or using their elements improperly – becomes extremely relevant. Contemporary
popular American cinema still tends to represent almost exclusively White perspective, without taking into account
other cultures’ experiences or representing them problematically. Hollywood productions, like other media,
contributed profoundly to spread simplified notions of race and stereotypes and in representing minorities and such
misrepresentation and exploitations of minority groups’ cultures keep happening in Hollywood. A Qualitative
Content Analysis and Foucaultian Discourse Analysis were conducted on 54 movie reviews to answer the research
question how are cultural racism and cultural appropriation discussed and defined in American newspapers,

Persia: The Sands of Time; Exodus: Gods and Kings; Pan; Doctor Strange; Ghost in the Shell) that were released
between 2010 and 2017? The results showed that references and discussions over issues related to cultural racism
and cultural appropriation are not the primary focus of the articles, but are indeed present. Such discussions showed
consciousness towards cultural racism and in some cases an open acknowledgment of the racial politics still being
perpetuated in certain fields. Nevertheless, such acknowledgment is often expressed implicitly, in some cases
followed by justifications or counterbalanced by positive reviews. The study also showed that the concept of culture
is not brought forward often, while, on the contrary, there is higher presence of framing the discourses related to
issues like misrepresentation and cultural racism in terms of race.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'New racism', 'Cultural racism', 'Color-blind ideology', 'Cultural appropriation', 'Representation in', 'media', 'Representation in Hollywood']"
Social Privacy on Facebook,M. Yazici,2017-10-09,"['J.S. Lee', 'D.D. Dumitrica']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Social privacy originates from the user’s knowledge and strategies to control their
personal information shared on social network sites. Social network sites have changed
the patterns of disclosure and dissemination practices of personal information. Being
aware of social privacy is a condition that has became significant in our lives, along with
the ubiquitous presence of social network sites. Social privacy consists of any set of
circumstances involving the control of personal information disclosed on social network
sites over exercises of surveillance happening between individuals. Recent studies
illustrate that social privacy is a great concern for the majority of social network site
users. The aim of this thesis is to examine the extent of social privacy awareness among
university students in the Netherlands, along with the questions of what students disclose
on their Facebook profiles and to which audience they disclose. The use of personal
information disclosure and visibility strategies has been examined in detail using a
quantitative approach. A cross-sectional survey is conducted through random sampling of
the students studying in the Netherlands (N = 176). The results showed that social privacy
awareness has a strong association with negative social network site experiences and a
less strong association with the use of technological privacy tools and intensity of
Facebook use. Contrary to general expectations, undesired visibility and surveillance are
a great privacy concern for most students. After all, the university students in the
Netherlands are aware of social privacy to various extents, depending on other variables;
the associations with default privacy settings and negative experiences are found to be
substantial. Future research is recommended to assess the in-depth relationship between
personal information disclosure and social surveillance by way of individualized items

What is love?,C.M.L. Noordam,2017-10-09,"['M.C.M. Sommier', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Love is a very important part of our lives. We encounter it in both our social, and cultural sphere. Love is a favoured subject in media. The media constantly reminds us of love, and portrays how one should love and be loved. It makes one wonder what the influence of these media portrayals can be on individuals. The romantic-comedy film genre is especially notorious for its portrayal of an idealized version of love. This is a popular genre among women, and it is not inconceivable that some women may view this idealized portrayal of love as true. Therefore, the aim of this study is to research how women construct love, and how they relate this to popular romantic-comedy films. To answer this the following research question was formed: How do four generations of women talk about love? Qualitative methods were used to answer this question. Twelve in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted. The respondents were twelve Dutch women from four different generations. Thematic network analysis was used to analyse the interviews. The women of this study described love either as something that was an intense and passionate feeling or as it was described by the Bible. The respondents argued that their construction of love was not influenced by romantic-comedies. Although, the answers given by the women suggested that romantic-comedies could have influenced their definition of love when they were younger, and inexperienced in love. However, the women believed that their social network influenced their construction of love more than romantic-comedies. Specifically, the parents were considered to be the most important source of influence. Overall the accounts of the women were quite similar across generations. However, there were two salient factors that caused differences in the responses of the women. These two factors were religion and the quality of the relationship with the social network of the women. It seems that generational differences did not affect the accounts of the women. The similarities between the accounts of the women can possibly be explained because they share the same interpretive community, and therefore can have similar horizons of expectations. This study concludes that love is both a social and a cultural concept. People base their construction of love on their own social and cultural experiences. If one is inexperienced in love one can base their conception of love on examples found in both cultural products, and in their social network.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Love', 'Women', 'Romantic-Comedies', 'Meaning-making', 'Generations']"
We are All Equal in the Gaming World,M.L. Monko,2017-10-09,"['J. Jansz', 'D.D. Dumitrica']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Localisation is a complicated process involving cultural, technical and linguistic alterations of a source product. Video games are not “translated” as literary works are, for instance, but localised – this process includes adapting them to a new locale so that they can be successfully sold, marketed and enjoyed there. When it is done inaccurately, localisation prevents players from playing a video game to the fullest, as it obstructs interaction. Furthermore, this issue often extends to communication between individual players engaged in online multiplayer. Given that localisation is highly overlooked in academics, this study aims to answer the following research question: how do video game players identify localisation in online multiplayer titles? Additionally, it also proposes a sub-research question: how do players motivate their preference for localised video games manufactured in countries other than their own? To answer these two questions, the project made use of participant observation combined with semi-structured interviews, during which selected small teams of gamers played chosen online multiplayer games (of different genres, e.g. multiplayer online battle arena and first-person shooter). The data gathered was subsequently subjected to thematic analysis. It was discovered that players have expectations of localisation strategies used in their played video games, regardless of making a distinction between “translation” and “localisation” procedures. Participants assessed them based on the general quality, faithfulness towards the original, and regularly mentioned an authentic “feeling” of the source being present or absent in the target product. Participants exposed to negative experiences with localisation preferred not to launch games in their native languages; others found reasons for doing so, such as being incapable of understanding the game entirely. Yet, the online gaming community was described to be internationalised and reliant on languages dominant in certain regions, such as English for Europe and North America. The all-embracing conclusion was that localisation provides gamers with options of playing in their preferred languages and thus it is a strategy of rendering them more accessible to everyone.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Localisation', 'video games', 'online multiplayer', 'communication', 'gaming community']"
Intercultural Learning and Jazz Practice,B.C.W. Low,2017-10-09,"['C.J.M van Eijck', 'S.L.

This is achieved through the ethnographic observation of digitally mediated interaction between tertiary-level jazz students in Singapore and Rotterdam. In asking “how is intercultural learning related to cultural dispositions?”, this thesis explores how jazz students navigate the uncertainty of interacting with unfamiliar people within a peer-to-peer learning environment in which intercultural learning occurs over time with the sharing of musical content and mutual criticism thereover. Through a multi-layered analysis of interaction in such a setting, this thesis traces the process of intercultural learning in jazz by couching jazz improvisation and social interaction as a function of cultural familiarity and socialisation.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'jazz practice', 'education', 'structural agency', 'improvisation', 'intercultural learning', 'socialisation']"
Between the white cube and the grey cubicle,T.C.M. Neeleman,2017-10-09,"['D. Stocco Ferreira', 'C.J.M. van Eijck']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Job vacancies, popular management books, and contemporary DIY literature show that in today’s labour market people have to be creative and live a creative life. Yet, creativity appears easier labelled than explained. The importance of stimulating creativity in the workplace in management studies has been recognised as self-evident. Contrastingly, voices from the art world have predominantly criticised the appearance of creativity outside of their field. It therefore appears we are dealing with competing values between different groups of actors. 
	Within creativity studies, this research aimed to fill a knowledge gap in between these two opposites by taking enough critical stance to challenge the idea of a by definition virtuous creativity, but simultaneously also not attempt to assess the value of creativity at the workplace. Creativity was limited to a utilitarian definition, considering that using creativity at work relates to obtaining the largest degree of happiness (i.e., large turnover). Accountants and artists were chosen as the two professions at opposite ends dealing with creativity at work. Challenging the normative conceptions society upholds on these two lines of work, the first were referred to as covertly and the second as overtly creatives in this research. Using Boltanski and Thévenot’s orders of worth, this study aimed to understand how these actors legitimise their use of creativity at work. Interviews were conducted with five actors from each profession to have them share their thoughts, opinions, and concerns on the topic, whilst participant observations were used to cover the non-verbal creative moments. Upon examination, it appears that the two seemingly opposite worlds actually think congruently to each other. Participants identified creativity as something to solve everyday problems and make things easier, but additionally recognised an unexpected form of creativity at work in the sense that it is also used to obstruct productivity. Through this, this study highlights how researching creativity demands reflexivity and an openness to differing outcomes. However, accountants and artists did disagree with each other in showing how they value creativity through different orders of worth. Whereas accountants approved of a growing presence of creativity in the labour market through the order of fame, the artists used the logic of the order of inspiration and found alternative interpretations of creativity by others wanting. A reason for this could be that the covert creatives yet struggle with obtaining the recognition they arguably deserve, whereas the overt creatives defend their territory. Additionally, a créativité pour créativité was considered undesirable by both groups as it obstructs the production process. Thus concluding, they appeared to agree on the values of one dominant order: the industrial order. And yet, creativity did not allow itself to be restricted. Each time participants came down to a certain vision, they disrupted it again. And there you have it: creativity in action.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Accountants', 'Artists', 'Creativity', 'Orders of worth', 'Pragmatic Sociology']"
Connected health,B.C.G. Guigui,2017-10-09,"['A. Paz Alencar', 'D.D. Dumitrica']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the last couple of years, Europe has witnessed one of the biggest refugee crises since World War II, a phenomenon that has fostered important debates amongst politicians, journalists and ordinary citizens. Since 2015, thousands of people, prominently originating from Syria, have been seeking asylum in Europe, which posed important questions and worries concerning the integration of these new populations. Such mass exodus has particularly brought numerous challenges in the healthcare sector, which has simultaneously affected the displaced individuals and the host countries as they struggle to provide healthcare services to support refugees’ specific needs. Although often disregarded as a factor of integration, health constitutes a crucial marker for supporting newcomers’ assimilation processes. Moreover, due to the specific mental stressors associated with the process of migration and resettlement, there is a serious need to provide refugees with cultural sensitive and adequate healthcare support. 
In recent years, technology has been increasingly considered to provide solutions to several obstacles affecting refugees’ lives. The current European refugee crisis brought about a new paradigm of migration where internet technologies have proven to be vital and transformative tools. The use of digital technologies for health has been increasingly adopted by health providers and patients, a phenomenon which is generally referred to as connected health. However, there is an overall lack of information about the potential of social media to support health integration among refugees. While the rapid development and adoption of ICTs tools have triggered the development of research on new communication uses and implications, there has been limited examination of the use of Internet based platforms by populations in extreme circumstances.
By means of in-depth qualitative interviews and explorative methods of research, the present study aims at investigating how social media can positively impact refugees’ health integration in the Netherlands. The qualitative method of conducting in-depth interviews was considered the most appropriate and effective to address the research questions as it provided an insight as to participants’ opinions and experiences by means of comprehensive speech interaction. The research data will be drawn from 10 in-depth interviews of asylum seekers in the Netherlands.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'refugee crisis', 'refugee experience', 'integration', 'health integration', 'social media']"

Furthermore, this research stresses the importance of the mediating elements in the process of transferring knowledge and the values being mobilized in art at a classroom level. To do so, a high-school student group, from 16 to 18 years old, at the Rotterdam International Secondary School was investigated. Using an ethnomethodological approach, the data collected through documental analysis, participant observation and interviews revealed there is a considerable gap between what is proposed by art education theorists, the theoretical framework guiding the school and how art education is performed in its practice. In addition, the findings demonstrate the great importance the mediator carries in the process of approximating students to art, being able to influence the way they perceive, engage in and relate to the subject.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Mediation', 'Art', 'Education', 'Ethnomethodology', 'Art Education']"

Ward']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research is examining the relation between cultural identification with movies and cultural negotiation. The topic is inspired by our globalizing world, where an increasing number of immigrants are relocating, while the media products available for consumption are more than ever. When discussing cultural globalization, the notion of culture and cultural negotiation should not be ignored, since the latter term deals with the possible outcomes the contact with multiple diverse cultural elements might have. Understanding cultural negotiation, could provide information in the academic world to further research how media products could contribute in the best possible acculturation outcomes. However, it is essential to break away from the static notion of culture utilized in intercultural negotiation studies and adopt a more liquid approach, the one of the critical intercultural communication studies. Thus, the main research question of this thesis is “How do immigrants and ex-immigrants of the millennial generation living in the Netherlands, reflect upon cultural negotiation when discussing cultural identification and their movie consumption?” To answer the research questions, ten (10) semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with current immigrants and Dutch ex-immigrants, residing in the Netherlands. The data collected from the interviews, were analyzed with the method of thematic analysis. Eventually, three (3) main themes emerged; change as an agent, culture as an outcome, and identification as a reflector. The themes illustrated that change is a major experience in current and ex-immigrants’ lives, which, eventually, altered the notion of culture in these individuals’ minds. It was found that due to their experience with cultural negotiation processes, which is part of the change, it is hard to feel belonging to a certain group. Thus, immigrants, become culturally very open and flexible identifying solely with their experience of change. Identification with movies reflects this entire process, since immigrants (would like to) identify with learning, part of cultural negotiation, and openness when consuming movie, due their altered personal cultures.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Immigrants', 'Culture', 'Identification', 'Movies', 'the Netherlands']"

More especially, how they selected sites for their sightseeing lists and choose to illustrate these lists. Major findings include evidence of the influence of mediatisation processes on the selection of sites for sightseeing lists. Mediatisation processes influenced the creating and the display of visuals in sightseeing lists for particular purposes. Moreover, there is evidence of the influence of mediatisation processes on the characteristics of visuals such as recognisability of the selected sites. The illustration of these sites need to be of high-quality and selected with care; evidence of a controlled balance in the selection of touristic icons and hidden gems with on the one end, icons aimed at seducing potential readers and on the other hand hidden local gems aiming at playing the surprise element. However, the influence of mediatisation processes on the selection of sites for sightseeing lists is limited as it appears, that a great majority of criteria weighting in for the selection of sites are not related to mediatisation processes. Criteria such as the ability to provide additional value such as being informative, differentiating the list, being able to experience, or tell a story influence the selection of a site. Another criteria which weights in the selection of a site is the gut feeling of the authors of the sightseeing lists, the belief that their appreciation for a site will transfer to their readers and that they will thereby be able to share their love for the site. This research opens a path for further research in the form of comparative research, mixed methods research or a focus on tourism practices in relation to social imagery platform Instagram.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Mediatisation', 'sightseeing list', 'visuals', 'selection', 'Rotterdam']"
Humans of Yoga,R.A. Trouwee,2017-10-06,"['M. Willekens', 'N. Komarova']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This Master Thesis research explores the modern postural yoga practice
from the unique perspective of yoga practitioners in Amsterdam. Yoga evolved around 150 years
ago during the interaction of Western individuals interested in Eastern, i.c. Indian religions. Western
individuals (re)formed the spiritual almost God-like yoga practice into a reflexive practice to calm
your so-called ‘monkey mind’ through a mind-body-spirit paradigm. 20th century sociologists such
as Simmel, Weber, Bourdieu & Giddens analyzed increasing rationality within new modernity. This
increase of rationalization caused a new mode of thinking, social constructions and individual
choices versus chances. According to multiple scholars, in times of increasing rationalism and
calculation, yoga became a great tool for reason, functioning as a mirror for the self, managing the
body, where the individual becomes a reflexive project. Yoga revealed itself to be a powerful toolkit
for a mindful and ascetic lifestyle, connecting the body to the mind through the dance of asanas and
breathing techniques, promoting health and cope with disease which caused the immense popularity
in scholarly study and the promotion of living a yogic healthy lifestyle. Due to its popularity in
urban milieus world-wide, it became a multi-billion dollar industry where a self-identity could be
consumed. About 1.6 million people are practicing yoga in The Netherlands today where yoga is
being studied for physical exploration and relaxation. So why did we start practicing yoga in the
first place? Why are we all hooked to this popular practice? And what does it offer us as Western
individuals and us as a society today? In this Master Thesis research we will explore these questions
through the sampling quota method searching for different types of yoga practitioners. During our
quantitative phase we created ideal types. We explored our ideal types in order to collect a small
group of representative profiles. We finally interviewed 9 out of the 21 yoga practitioners (sampling
quota: yoga teachers) during our qualitative research phase. From the semi-structured interviews we
could develop a framework in which different types of yoga practitioners are positioned within the
theoretical concepts of spirituality, functionality, reflexive project and yogic capital. Through
lifestyle research we tried to capture a sociological perspective on the yoga scene in Amsterdam,
framing it in modernity theory where the individual is its own motive for practicing yoga, though
influenced by social factors such as social positioning, education, financial circumstances and yogic
interest.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Spirituality', 'Monkey Mind', 'Mind-Body-Spirit Paradigm', 'Reflexive Project', 'Mirror for the Self', 'Body Management', 'Functionality', 'Yoga Toolkit', 'Yogic Capital', 'Lifestyle', 'Self Identity Consumerism', 'Quota Sampling', 'Semi-Structured Interviewing', 'Ideal Types', '20th century sociologists']"
Engineering a place for women,E.L. Hopkins,2017-10-06,"['P.P.L. Berkers', 'J.C.F. Schaap']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Women’s participation in music technology education has been described as a ‘leaky pipeline’, analogous to the drop-off rates from women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, maths) subjects. From one educational level to the next, music technology courses see the number of participating women decline. As a result, university level music technology degrees witness a gender imbalance of up to 90% men to 10% women. Unsurprisingly, figures estimate that 95% of music producers are men. 
This paper explores the complex intersections of gender, technology, music and education. First, its research question asks what the classroom experiences of women in music production and sound engineering courses are in relation to gender. Second, this research understands music education as an important precursor to artistic careers, and this approach seeks to primarily provide an understanding of women’s experiences of music technology courses, and to secondarily understand how those experiences compare with post-educational ones. Therefore, this paper also addresses the relationship between their experiences in these courses and experiences within the field afterwards. 
These questions were addressed by conducting semi-structured interviews in Manchester, UK and Berlin, Germany, with women who studying for, or had completed courses in music production and sound engineering. Interviews focused on (i) classroom experiences, experiences of classmates (ii) experiences with teachers and, (iii) how experiences within the educational setting compared to those in the field.
This research found that respondents experience the music technology classroom as a male space, and that teachers, while not immune from inserting their own gender biases into their evaluations and interactions with students, do make efforts to be more inclusive of female students. Comparisons between educational experiences and workplace experience were mixed, but provided further support for suggestions of the maleness of the music technology sphere.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'gender', 'music', 'education', 'technology', 'music producers']"

Because it is a relatively new discipline most research conducted on music therapy addresses the complexity of the new field and its relation to medical and art fields. In the prevailing scientific society, the field is challenged by the notions of legitimisation within the frame of other medical fields. Hence, the history and the current state of the music therapy field influence the professional identity construction of music therapists. This research aims to look into the relationship between the present state of the music therapy field in Lithuania and the Netherlands and overview professional identity development in educational institutions. Hence, the main research question is as follows: To what extent does the current state of music therapy field influence the development of a music therapists’ professional identity? In order to answer the research question a method of constructivist grounded theory was used. In addition, a hybrid utilisation of constructivist GT together with Bourdieu’s field theory as a theoretical framework was adopted to answer the research question. The data was collected through nine semi-structured in-depth interviews, five days of participant observation and document analysis. Initial and focused coding of data with additional information from research memos was used to conceptualise findings into the theoretical themes of studied phenomena. The study showed that professional identity development is influenced by context specific medical paradigm that music therapy follows. The upcoming therapists in both countries reflected on external pressures on the field. The main struggles of the field were identified as political and economic changes, scientification and clinification of the field(s), and split inside the therapist community. Hence, based on the external pressures, field(s) seek(s) to identify themselves with more established medical fields to gain a better public image, influence policies in relation to job opportunities, and feel equal to members in the healthcare system. Consequently, the professional identity development is affected by a focus on science-based research and the scientification of the field. It implies that the primary purpose shifts from the ground values and purpose of the profession to the process of legitimisation.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Music therapy', 'Bourdieu’s field theory', 'Constructivist grounded theory', 'Legitimization', 'Professional identity']"

Who Gets to Take Home That Shiny Symbol of Prestige at the International Film Festival,P.T.M.I van Ree,2017-10-06,"['M.J. Berghman', 'S.L. Reijnders']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Audiences are important in the success of films, they can make or break a film. However, audiences differ in their levels of cultural capital, and consequentially in their position within the fields of cultural production, tastes, habitus, judgements standards and legitimacy. They assign different kinds of recognition (popular, professional, and critical) and add different kinds of value (economic or symbolic capital) to filmmakers and their films. The interest of this thesis is the assigning of professional recognition through prestigious prizes at international film festivals, and researching what attributes these award winning films possess. This research then contributes to filling up a gap left in previous studies, and gaining a better understanding of professional recognition, international film festivals and prestige. The aim of this research resulted in the following research question: Looking at several international film festivals—their award winners and nominees—from 1996 to 2016, how do cast and content related attributes influence or contribute to the chances of winning the award for best film at these prestigious cultural events? A quantitative approach was used to study the award winners and nominees over a period of twenty years at the three most prestigious international film festivals: Berlin, Cannes and Venice. The theoretical background already provided some research expectations, based on (logics of) the field of films and the position film festivals take therein. Film festivals position themselves as (crucial) authoritative institution within the field of films as art, which assigns (symbolic) value to films and filmmakers. Therefore, the award winning attributes should match with the characteristics that make an art film. The data was gathered using online databases, and analysed in SPSS. The results showed that juries of professional recognition indeed use aesthetic judgements standards that fit with the logics of the field of art films. Directors who (co)wrote the script and the artistic reputations of the directors and writers had a positive effect on the odds of winning. Only actors seemed excluded from these logics, where their star power and name recognition through economic reputations have more effect on the odds of winning. Experience also had either no effect or a negative effect on the odds of winning, reflecting that status does take precedence. In relation to content, dramas, R-ratings, and true stories had a positive effect on the odds of winning. Whereas adaptations, runtime, and budget had no effect on the odds of winning. Overall, attributes that fit with the concept of the auteur, artistic reputations, and attributes that signal artistic, unique, novel, innovative, meaningful and significant content have a positive effect on the odds of winning. These finding then implicate that film festivals are indeed positioned in the (autonomous) field of restricted production, focussing on films as art, symbolic capital and recognizing artistic achievements. Consequently, they are crucial institutions, contributing to maintaining the cultural position of art films, and the valorisation and consecration of films and filmmakers. They are a gateway to cultural legitimization.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Prestige', 'international film festivals', 'professional recognition', 'prizes', 'artistic attributes']"
The effects of autonomy on museums,S. Bertolini,2017-10-02,"['A. Mignosa', 'T. Navarrete Hernandez']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis will analyze the case of twenty Italian museums that became
autonomous after the promulgation of a new law in 2014 to investigate the effects of
autonomy on cultural institutions. The research was inspired by a series of interviews with
the directors of these institutions published in an Italian magazine (Nastro, 2016a; 2016b)
and is based on ten interviews made in the months of March, April and May, 2017. The
work started with an analysis of the most relevant literature on the broad topic of cultural
policies and management, followed by researches focused on museums and autonomy.
Papers and publications about the Italian case were also studied, but it must be said that is
a topic that needs further research, and this work hopes to be a small step forward in this
direction. A format for semi-structured interviews was created, based on the most
significant findings of the literature analysis, and all the autonomous museums (20) were
invited to participate in the research, with the idea to create a sample of around 10, that
was defined after the first positive responses using a number of criteria (number of visitors,
location, background of director…). Most of the interviews have been with museums’
directors, when this was not the case or when the interview was considered too short or
incomplete other sources, like press releases and material provided by the museum’s
personnel, where used as an addition. The analysis compares the theory drawn from the
literature with the findings of the interviews, and both the similarities and the differences
are pointed out; the latter are particularly interesting, as they show the peculiarities of the
Italian case and open up the discussion of what might be the causes of the discrepancies
between theory and practice. The findings are in line with the expectations, and show a
widespread growth in both visitor numbers and revenues, as well as a number of new
initiatives and projects starting. The main issue remains the lack of control over the
museum personnel, still managed by the Ministry, and the resistance to innovation that
comes from some people that see the reform as a threat to conservation and that do not
like the idea of a museum run by a manager - even though, as the research shows, most
of the director do not have this kind of background.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'institutional change', 'autonomy', 'museums', 'Italy']"
Internships as contingent workforce,R. Skujina,2017-10-02,"['E.M.M.P. Loots', 'A. Klamer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Internships is an increasingly popular form of work-based learning, which is becoming
the ‘rite de passage’ towards the labour market, especially in the most competitive sectors. Initially
promoted and strongly encouraged, more recently research papers and popular publications have
started discussing problematic aspects of the internship phenomenon. The term ‘intern
economy’ is introduced and possible negative social implications are mentioned.
The main purpose of the thesis is to inform various stakeholders about the complex role
of internships, especially their increasing role in the labour market, and thus to contribute to a
balanced and critical discussion. The second objective is to empirically verify to what extent
within the current Belgian French speaking cultural labour market internships are similar to
regular work positions. Third, methodological tools for processing big amounts of quantitative
and qualitative data of a whole population were tested, combining analysis using Atlas.ti 8.0,
Microsoft Excel and SPSS.
The main focus of this paper is on the perspective of the employer – the cultural
organisation. Existing research is used to highlight key issues and identify propositions for
empirical testing. In order to compare job requirements of interns versus employees, the author
analyses 905 internship and job advertisements published on the main website for the French
speaking cultural sector in Belgium in 2015. The results test existing theories about internships
and many assumptions, as defined by the literature review.
Some interesting conclusions are reached, confirming that the most popular question of
payment is only one of several concerns related to this phenomenon. It is concluded that
internship use by cultural organisations depend on their strategy, as not all cultural sectors seek
to recruit interns evenly. At the current state, most of interns in Belgian French speaking cultural
sector have full-time working weeks similar to regular employees, but their contracts have an
average duration of 4 months. Interns also seem to be more used to enhance the communication
and promotion of the organisation.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Labour market', 'internships', 'intern economy', 'cultural organisations', 'Belgium']"

practices regarding outsourcing different functions related to their music. Digitization has
transformed the music industry at large mainly by impacting the traditional value chain of
music production, distribution and promotion. In theory, musicians without major label
support are now able to enter the market freely and take advantage of digital tools to cut out
intermediaries and professionals. By asking how digitization has changed the functions
related to music production, distribution and promotion for independent musicians, this thesis
attempts to establish which functions remain outsourced at this point in time. Testing
hypotheses based on existing literature about independent musicians, the results indicate that
outsourcing remains to be associated with higher levels of activity and success and that
musicians still mainly outsource tasks related to the production of their core product, the
recorded music. The results also indicate that DIY practices are still associated with smallscale
music production. An online survey of 120 independent musicians formed the basis of
these findings.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'independent musicians', 'work practices', 'division of labor', 'DIY music', 'digital music']"
Freeports as ecosystems for the preservation of fine art value and the acceleration of related businesses,F.A. Loos,2017-10-02,"['F.R.R. Vermeylen', 'S. Jacobs']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis investigated the ecosystems of freeports. Freeports are specialized warehouses for
the storage of fine art and collectibles, for both individuals and cultural institutions. Being
discrete and confidential in their nature, the role of freeports in the growing contemporary art
market is rather unexplored. However, their role becomes increasingly crucial in the growing
international art market. Art is more and more perceived as an alternative for financial
investment, which further stimulates the international art trade activity. Due to high
transaction costs and differences in jurisdictions and rules concerning taxes per country, the
physical location of the art transaction is crucial. This thesis aimed to investigate which
factors in the art market and related markets drive the emergence and existence of freeports.
To obtain an in-depth understanding on freeports and their operations, this thesis applied a
contextual approach. First, an extensive literature review was done. Hereafter, interviews, a
case study and a site visit were conducted and organized around four themes: the context, the
business model, the operations and the impact of freeports. The outcomes revealed that there
is no evidence that freeports are unregulated and used for money laundering practices.
Further, it can be concluded from this research that freeports are predominantly used for
secured preservation of valuable objects. In addition to safe storage warehouses, freeports
also facilitate international art trade as they offer tax-free zones and a broad range of art
related services. Finally, it can be concluded that freeports are integral nodes in an
international network of art collectors, museums and other cultural institutions. As such,
freeports serve as ecosystems for the preservation of fine art value and the acceleration of
related businesses.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'freeports', 'fine art storage', 'transaction costs', 'art as investment', 'international', 'art trade']"
Rethinking cultural heritage,P. Dal Bello,2017-10-02,"['A. Mignosa', 'E.

This argument has been acknowledged in the academia for many years. However, the increasing number of listed heritage sites, combined with a decrease of public funds, highlights the necessity to find sustainable management practices for heritage. So far, the discussion on heritage management is not quite satisfactory. Too often the economic perspective differs from the one of historians, archeologists, art historians and all those people involved in heritage conservation; it seems difficult to find a balance among the many values related to heritage. In this context, adaptive reuse seems a valuable and sustainable strategy able to give new use to heritage while conserving its cultural value. Yet, in order to do so, it should consider not only economic returns but also heritage intrinsic values. This research introduces three specific cultural heritage sites in which adaptive reuse was done through cultural or creative projects. By means of a qualitative research, this study aims to understand which values push managers of cultural and creative projects to start their activity inside cultural heritage sites and how these values are realized. The aim is to understand if creative and cultural entrepreneurs can have a role in heritage regeneration and to what extent the analyzed projects are sustainable both from an economic and social perspective. Through a value based approach, this study concludes that rethinking heritage with cultural and creative projects can be a valuable way to respect and, in some cases, enhance heritage cultural capital. It also looks at heritage social sustainability as a significant factor for social, societal and cultural development for people involved in the reuse process.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'cultural heritage', 'adaptive reuse', 'cultural and creative projects', 'values', 'sustainability']"
The Voice of the Invisible Cities.,C. Ferretti,2017-10-02,"['A. Klamer', 'M. Lavanga']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Within contemporary debate, there is much dialogue about the revitalization of rural areas and small cities, where larger agglomerations seem to be the magnets for cultural and creative resources. Previous works and reports addressed the difficulties that marginal areas are encountering. The current economic contingency enhances the accumulation of resources and the formation of agglomerative phenomenon. Megalopolises are going to attract more and more capitals to the detriment of small centres and rural areas unable to propose competitive alternatives. It provokes the centralization of institutions, wealth, social capitals, and labour forces, leaving peripheries culturally, socially and economically starving.
A number of academic works within and outside the cultural economic field research the impact of culture on these realities, trying to understand how the cultural sector and the touristic industry can be relevant solutions, especially for those regions with high cultural impact, as in the South of Italy. Despite the relevance of these studies, many of them approach the topic instrumentally. Indeed, most of these areas are trying to apply the right cultural strategy to stabilize the local economy. Culture and creativity seems to be powerful criteria for promoting endogenous processes of economic development and urban revitalization. However, they are often instrumental quantitative approaches, as much as best practices and models, unable to understand local dynamics and valorise local cultural and social qualities. The risk is eroding even more local cultural and social capitals, creating artificial areas instead of a stable creative environment.
This study would like to introduce a qualitative point of view to the topic. Retracing the path marked by philosophers, economists and sociologists as Putnam, Klamer, Aristotle, Nussbaum, and McCloskey. This thesis tries to make the reader aware of the importance of speaking in terms of qualities and values, instead of instrumental goals. This approach is therefore applied to the stabilization of rural areas, explaining the importance of the cultural, social and civic capital into an urban economy, and so investigating those political and bottom-up processes that contribute to establish a creative environment.
The research takes into account the case of Matera, a rural city in southern Italy, which achieved the important European Capital of Culture award.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Rural Areas Development', 'Cultural Capital', 'Social Capital', 'Local Development', 'Creative Environment', 'Participative Processes', 'Social Innovation']"
Performing Abroad,R.D. Howell,2017-10-02,"['F.J.C. Brouwer', 'F.R.R. Vermeylen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The market for small-scale theatrical performing arts in the UK is large. By number of stages
serving less than 200 people and by number of performances, it far outweighs the mid and largescale
market yet it is poorly documented in academic research. An ecosystem exists consisting of
small-scale venues, companies producing theatrical work and funders. Audiences play a secondary
role, as funders and venue bookers act as gatekeepers, controlling what is made available to them. It
is a buyers’ market with the number of available performance dates from companies far exceeding the
capacity of the venues. This paper studies this ecosystem and the way that companies create work
within it. It also considers the literature on international entrepreneurship for small businesses and
asks if international touring is a viable means for companies to extend their reach. Does the
ecosystem in which small-scale theatrical products are created inhibit or enhance the export potential
of UK performing arts and what effect does the experience of international touring have on the artistic
and business practice?
Using a brand-new dataset of 164 active, UK based companies producing and touring work
for small-scale touring venues, insights into the market for small-scale performing arts have been
possible. A representative sample with some experience of international touring was identified,
studied, and subjected to semi structured interviews.
The research briefly concludes that the ecosystem protects and directs the way that
companies operate and the type of product that produced, as it provides a framework for creating
work and touring. Relationships within the ecosystem are not equal. Conventions within the wider
industry and criteria imposed by venues and funders stifle innovation. Companies are neither
entrepreneurial nor strategic and pursue artistic priorities ahead of economic or management ones in
planning or creating work. The contractual implications of a horizontally structured workforce of
freelance performers inhibits the longevity of productions, making solo shows and those involving
company members more economically viable. As within the UK market, the ecosystem does not
encourage companies to find new international markets outside those it recognises and promotes.
International touring for micro-businesses is challenging and the costs are high.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Performing arts', 'cultural ecosystem', 'touring', 'export', 'entrepreneurship']"

The research shows that in the absence of formal institutions, amidst uncertainties, firm-owners rely on social trust and social institutions to manage production process and dissuade delegation problem. Further, the study demonstrates that the existence of fraternal bonds is the most pertinent feature accounting for how production is organised.

The Impact of Cultural Globalization on International Contemporary Art Fairs (ICAFs),L. Krapkova,2017-10-02,"['F.R.R. Vermeylen', 'P.V. Bhansing']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Even though globalization used to be associated with various domains and not that
much with arts, there is a growing number of research activities which allowed new concepts
of cultural globalization to arise. As the world has been experiencing increasing
interconnectedness between countries, it even more boosted the international trade volumes.
In fields such as science and trade, it led to the creation of standards which are useful for
facilitating a seamless transmission of data, knowledge, industrial parts and goods. However,
taking another point of view, standards can also be perceived as a loss of uniqueness and
diversity. These represent two sides of the same coin and they happen to be particularly
interesting when they are applied to high arts. Culture in general is celebrated for its
heterogeneity, thus any sign of emerging pattern in both production and consumption would
be a sign of deterioration. Nevertheless, with an uprising popularity of platforms like
international contemporary art fairs or biennials, it seems right to question the quality of
artworks offered at these fairs in terms of their diversity. Therefore, despite the previous note
about art and finance being two different worlds, art fairs in fact resemble physical places
where commerce and art meet so they face the same challenge with regard to formation of
standards. The research aims to reveal to what extent is art at international art fairs around the
world reflecting the diversity of cultures. Such a question implies a qualitative method yet the
thesis includes also quantitative approach to overcome drawbacks associated with each
method when they are used exclusively. The use of content analysis of 12 international
contemporary art fairs (ICAFs) together with email interviews conducted with art galleries’
directors was further enriched by employing multidimensional framework as a tool for
researching cultural diversity. Such a combination of methods allowed to draw complex
conclusions and to enhance validity of the research. As followed from the data analysis, the
process of standardization is not affecting the diversity of ICAFs significantly even though
they are becoming more alike from the organizational point of view.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Contemporary art fair', 'globalization', 'cultural diversity', 'art markets', 'degree of', 'internationalization', 'multidimensional framework']"

Loots']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This exploratory study examines the relationship between performing arts entrepreneurs’
personal values and organizational cultures, and their ways of transforming values into
enterprises. To do so, mixed research methods were developed and conducted through
two surveys with 44 Taiwanese performing arts entrepreneurs, and one semi-structured
interview with 4 Taiwanese performing arts entrepreneurs. Based on four categories of
Schwartz’s portrait values theory, the research finds that self-transcendence and
openness to change are two dominant values among participants. With Cameron and
Quinn’s competing values framework with four types of organizational culture, the
research identifies collaborative and creative cultures as the two most common
organizational cultures of performing arts enterprises. Also, a positive and moderate
relationship between leaders’ personal values and internal cultures may work best for
creating a sustaining achievement. The relationship models can be practiced through
both direct and indirect way of transformation, and the latter requires two facilitators;
one is a relevance between the dominant and second dominant relationship models,
another one is the commonality between dominant and second dominant value as well
as the commodity between dominant and second dominant culture. The research also
considers a well-developed emotional intelligence to be important and suggests
applying visionary style as a main approach to establish the relationship. Apart from
that, the ability to implement affiliative, coaching, pacesetting and democratic styles for
dealing with different circumstances has determinant influence for a performing arts
leader to build the relationship model.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Leadership', 'Personal value', 'Organizational culture', 'Performing arts entrepreneur']"
"Heritage for whom? Assessing the influence of decision-making processes on the revitalization plans of heritage neighbourhood Las Cruces, centre of Bogotá.","Tromp, C.J. (Caspar José)",2017-10-02,['d’Alençon P.A. (Paola Alfaro)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This thesis intends to provide a deeper understanding in how decision-making processes influence the construction of urban revitalization plans in the marginalized heritage neighbourhood of Las Cruces in Bogotá, Colombia. Latin American cities across the continent have increasingly undergone large scale urban renovation projects in recent decades. In many cases, revitalization strategies instigated by the local government have often resulted in a pressure to leave, especially for local lower-income groups. Decision-making processes among policy makers and the extent to which local communities are involved influence how revitalization plans shape and ultimately impact locally. Based on the literature on gentrification in Latin America and co-production, this research assumes that if locals are excluded from the decision-making process or when involvement is inadequate, gentrification or displacement is likely to occur, while when co-production strategies are applied, revitalization might lead to the improvement of local livelihoods and to urban inclusion.
The research questions of this thesis are: how did decision-making processes influence the design of the current revitalization projects of the Las Cruces neighbourhood, in the Centro Tradicional of Bogotá? Who were the main stakeholders in the decision-making process within the revitalization projects in Las Cruces? What was the process of decision-making and the role of local involvement? To what extent do the visions of policy makers and local communities align and diverge?
The methods applied in this thesis were: 1) semi-structured interviews, 2) action research and 3) content analysis. The interviewees consisted of policy-makers and academics in the areas of urban planning, revitalization and heritage; and of local community activists. Participants of the action plan workshops were a diversity of local inhabitants of Las Cruces and local community leaders.
The results of this research suggest that decision-making processes in projects concerning Las Cruces are characterized by an overrepresentation of the public sector as key and primary actors, and by an absence of adequate civic sector involvement. Changes in the city’s administration also prevented the implementation of a long-term vision for Las Cruces and the continuation of previous projects. At the time of the fieldwork, plans for Las Cruces were designed rather through top-down land-based planning strategies while local participation was mostly limited to consultation. The vision for Las Cruces diverged between policy makers and local inhabitants, with the former favouring new real estate developments for higher income groups, while the latter was rather concerned with solving social issues such as youth unemployment, lack of social cohesion and community pride.
This thesis concludes that, even though at the time of this research few regeneration projects were planned and gentrification had not yet taken place, preliminary plans and visions suggested that future processes of gentrification are a possibility. The design of the new master plan of the city for the next 12 years might facilitate real estate development for higher-income groups, possibly resulting in the spatial reconfiguration of Las Cruces and local displacement.","['heritage', 'strategic planning', 'co-production', 'urban revitalization', 'rights to the city', 'gentrification']"

This explorative and interpretative paper aims at trying to understand the complex population of art collectors and see if their behaviour in the market, the ways they access art is different than the previous generations of collectors. It is framed on the contemporary art market, and solely on the primary market. The data collected comes from a series of 14 interviews with collectors, galleries, advisors, platforms and other professionals and experts of the art market to have a multidimensional and international perspective and combine different points of view on the topic. The findings suggest that the population of collectors is highly educated and in many cases comes from a family of collectors, implying that they are continuing a family tradition albeit modernizing it. Globalization and digitalization have greatly impacted the market and democratized access to art and collecting, reducing information asymmetry and empowering collectors.  The multiplication of association and clubs of collectors combined with the rising role of the Internet and social media have brought many new opportunities but also a new set of risks linked to an excess of supply and information. The conclusions of the research have highlighted some patterns and trends that could be the basis for future research.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Art collectors', 'contemporary art market', 'globalization', 'digitalization', 'taste development', 'family tradition', 'motivation and role.']"

By evaluating existing literature on possible criteria for assessing quality in the performing arts, such as reviews, awards or benefits to the art form, a framework of analysis is developed. This framework is applied to documents from the Rotterdamse Raad voor Kunst en Cultuur and the municipality of Rotterdam in the analysis, to provide an insight in which criteria are used most. It becomes clear that reputation is a very important factor, as it can help members of committees to indicate the quality of upcoming projects. However, in the case of the RRKC benefits to society are taken into consideration as well, since the spending of public money on structural subsidies means the city of Rotterdam and its inhabitants must have a certain return on their investment. Furthermore the importance of the overlooked criterion of audience experience is stressed, as incorporating this criterion in an assessment beforehand can be beneficial for both performing arts organisations as well as for funding bodies.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Performing arts', 'cultural policy', 'subsidy', 'funding bodies', 'artistic quality', 'applications']"

Deze verkiezingen werden gekenmerkt door deelname van een groot aantal nieuwe partijen. Van deze nieuwe partijen behaalden alleen Forum voor Democratie(FvD) en DENK voldoende zetels om in de Tweede Kamer terecht te komen. Media spelen een belangrijke informatieve rol tijdens verkiezingen, omdat ze de burger informeren waar ze op kunnen stemmen. Media-aandacht gedurende de verkiezingscampagne wordt dan ook gezien als een belangrijke pijler van electoraal succes. Volgens de klassieke democratische visie zouden alle deelnemende partijen in gelijke mate belicht moeten worden, zodat de kiezer een goede afweging kan maken bij de stembus. Daarom is het relevant om inzicht te krijgen in de mate van aandacht die deze nieuwe partijen hebben gekregen van de grote media tijdens de campagneperiode. Deze studie onderzoekt door middel van een kwantitatieve analyse de hoeveelheid media-aandacht die nieuwe partijen kregen tijdens de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 15 maart 2017. Daarnaast wordt via kwalitatieve interviews inzicht gegeven in het perspectief van de journalist. De studie richt zich zowel op media-aandacht voor de partij als voor de partijleider.  
	Uit de resultaten van deze studie kan de conclusie worden getrokken dat ook bij nieuwe politieke partijen de campagneberichtgeving zich toespitst op een selecte groep van partijen en dat media sommige lijsttrekkers interessanter vinden dan de partij erachter. Opvallend is dat nieuwe partijen die als afsplitsing in de Kamer zitten een voorsprong hebben op de rest van de partijen zoals bij deze verkiezingen het geval was met DENK, de partij die verreweg de meeste aandacht heeft ontvangen. De manier echter waarop partijen en lijsttrekkers zichzelf vervolgens presenteren in de campagne, kan volgens journalisten elke partij maken of breken.

Media spelen hier een belangrijke rol in en daarom is het proces omtrent nieuwsproductie over dit onderwerp in Nederlandse kwaliteitskranten en populaire kranten geanalyseerd. Nieuwsproductie bestaat uit drie niveaus: selectie van het nieuws, selectie van bronnen en framing. Door middel van kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyses, zowel handmatig als automatisch, zijn deze aspecten onderzocht in Nederlandse kranten. 
	Hieruit kwam naar voren dat kwaliteitskranten over het algemeen meer aandacht aan renewable energy besteden dan populaire kranten. Bij beide typen kranten is echter wel een stijging zichtbaar in de mate van aandacht. Verschillen zijn er ook: zo wordt de houding van het publiek meer bericht in populaire kranten, gaat het in kwaliteitskranten meer om economische aspecten van renewable energy en bleken “green issues”, voor beide typen kranten even nieuwswaardig. Deze laatste nieuwswaarde omvatte allerhande berichten met betrekking tot het klimaat en het bleek dat de beide soorten kranten dit op hun eigen manier verwerken. Een belangrijke bijdrage van dit onderzoek was een nieuwe kijk op de issue ownership theorie. Dit onderzoek heeft namelijk laten zien dat bij een nieuwe issue, de selectie van de bronnen niet uniform is voor de kranten. Derhalve is het beter om van meerdere issue-aandeelhouders te spreken dan van één issue owner. Tot slot is de framing onderzocht. Hieruit kwamen ook enkele verschillen naar voren: zo bleek het maatschappijframe vaker voor te komen in populaire kranten en kwam het milieuframe vaker voor in kwaliteitskranten. Ondanks het ontbreken van significante verschillen, is er wel een trend gevonden naar meer gebruik van het economische frame in kwaliteitskranten. Het ontbreken van significante verschillen is toegeschreven aan de diversiteit van dit frame. Economie kan gaan over bedrijven en politici, hetgeen men vaak terugziet in kwaliteitskranten, maar ook over huishoudens en particulieren, hetgeen meer bij populaire kranten past. Door middel van onderzoek naar de context van de gebruikte frames, is de toon van het nieuws omtrent renewable energy in beeld gebracht. Hieruit bleek dat Nederlandse kranten gemiddeld positief schrijven over het onderwerp. Dit geeft aan dat er consensus is in de media over het onderwerp. Tevens is dit van groot belang voor het creëren van draagvlak, omdat het betekent dat het publiek hoofdzakelijk positief nieuws over renewable energy leest.
	Dit onderzoek biedt een aantal mogelijkheden voor vervolgonderzoeken. Allereerst kan het uitsplitsen van de nieuwswaarde “green issues” en het economische frame tot meer inzicht leiden in de aandacht voor bepaalde aspecten van deze twee concepten in bepaalde typen kranten. Daarnaast kan men de invloed van de nieuwswaarden en de frames op het publiek onderzoeken door middel van interviews of experimenten. Hieruit kan het effect van deze concepten op draagvlak onder het publiek onderzocht worden. Tot slot is verder onderzoek naar meerdere issue-aandeelhouders bij andere issues van belang. Hierdoor wordt inzicht verkregen in de manier waarop issue ownership overgaat van meerdere issue-aandeelhouders naar één issue owner.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'renewable energy', 'issue ownership', 'nieuwswaarden', 'framing', 'populaire kranten', 'kwaliteitskranten']"
Bladeren of swipen door een tijdschrift?,E.H. Barends,2017-09-25,"['J. de Haan', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In de afgelopen jaren zijn veel tijdschriften opgeheven, verkocht of daalden de oplages. Hierbij valt op dat hoewel steeds minder Nederlanders een papieren tijdschrift lezen, de digitale tijdschriften niet in dezelfde mate toenemen. Om te voorkomen dat tijdschriften verdwijnen uit het medialandschap zal de tijdschriftenbranche zich beter moeten aansluiten op de behoeften van mensen. Dit onderzoek focust zich daarom als eerste op de motieven en ervaringen van lezers bij hun besluit om voor een papieren of digitaal tijdschrift te kiezen. Daarnaast wordt onderzocht of deze motieven en ervaringen bij meerdere bevolkingsgroepen overeenkomen of verschillen. Uit diverse onderzoeken naar het mediagebruik bij verschillende bevolkingsgroepen blijkt namelijk dat jongeren en mannen voorlopers zijn in het gebruik van nieuwe media en technologieën, die de plaats innemen van papier en vaste apparatuur. Voor vrouwen en ouderen is dit precies omgekeerd; zij houden zich langer vast aan traditionele media en lezen het liefst vanaf papier. Om de overkoepelende onderzoeksvraag, “Wat doet de lezers van LINDA, Glamour, Men’s Health en Voetbal International beslissen om het tijdschrift van papier te lezen of via een digitaal medium”, te kunnen beantwoorden is gebruik gemaakt van kwalitatieve diepte-interviews. In totaal zijn zestien tijdschriftlezers ondervraagd, waaronder acht vrouwen en acht mannen: vier lezers bij elk tijdschrift, telkens twee jonge en twee oude lezers. Een eerste bevinding betrof de keuze voor het medium waarop een tijdschrift gelezen wordt, die bij elke respondent papier is. Slechts twee mannelijke respondenten hebben een digitaal tijdschrift gelezen, en ook zij geven de voorkeur aan de papieren editie. Dit wijst erop dat voor iedereen een tijdschrift vanaf papier nog altijd favoriet is, en dat veel respondenten een papieren tijdschrift kiezen met dezelfde motivatie. Het gebruiksgemak, de fysieke eigenschappen, de gewoonte, de urgentie, het leesgedrag en de scheiding van werk en privé bij een papieren tijdschrift spelen hierbij een grote rol. Daarnaast blijkt dat de karakteristieken kenmerken van een digitaal tijdschrift niet aansluiten bij de behoeften van tijdschriftlezers. Een tijdschrift wordt gezien als een ontspannend tijdverdrijf, waar rustig doorheen wordt gebladerd en een ontsnapping biedt uit dynamische digitale wereld. Het digitale tijdschrift associëren zij met vluchtig swipen, scannend en oppervlakkig lezen en met veel storende prikkels van video’s, extra informatie of inkomende berichten, waarbij hun behoefte om te ontspannen en te ontsnappen uit de dagelijkse sleur niet worden bevredigd. De oorzaak van de dalende oplages van papieren tijdschriften lijkt niet te liggen aan de vorm van het medium: deze is nog altijd favoriet onder lezers.

Ongeveer één derde van het nieuws afkomstig van traditionele media wordt tevens gepubliceerd via sociale media (Pew Research Center, 2010). Hermans, Hietbrink, Kik & Landman (2015) baseren hun onderzoek op het Amerikaanse onderzoek en brengen de regionale nieuwsvoorziening van Nederland in beeld. Maar het gebruik van sociale media door lokale redacties wordt niet meegenomen in het onderzoek. Overige internationale onderzoeken gerelateerd aan lokaal nieuws zijn ook niet gericht op sociale media (Barnett & Townend, 2014; Castelló, 2010; Nielsen, 2015). Dit onderzoek is daarom een aanvulling op eerdere onderzoeken. In dit onderzoek staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: In welke mate en hoe zetten de Rotterdamse en Amsterdamse nieuwsredacties sociale media in? De vergelijking tussen de twee grootste steden van Nederland, Rotterdam en Amsterdam, is interessant aangezien zij normaliter op veel gebieden van elkaar verschillen. Op het gebied van het gebruik van sociale media op lokaal niveau is aangetoond dat Amsterdam meer gebruik maakt van sociale media dan Rotterdam. Sociale media worden op vier manieren door de lokale nieuwsredacties ingezet: strategisch, functioneel, interactief en dynamisch. De thema’s strategie, functies, interactie en dynamiek zijn voortgekomen uit interviews met de Rotterdamse en Amsterdamse redacteuren die het sociale mediabeleid bepalen van hun lokale nieuwsredactie. De manier waarop zij nieuws maken en verspreiden wordt aan de hand van de thema’s uiteengezet. Tot slot is uit de interviews gebleken dat algoritmes een grote invloed hebben op het gebruik van sociale media door de Rotterdamse en Amsterdamse redacties. Het 24/7 element en breaking news zijn onderdelen in het journalistieke proces die zijn veranderd door algoritmes, omdat niet duidelijk is wanneer het publiek het nieuwsbericht te lezen krijgt. Deze twee onderdelen zijn sterk afhankelijk van snel nieuws brengen dat wordt vestoord door algoritmes.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'lokale nieuwsredacties', 'sociale media', 'Rotterdam', 'Amsterdam', 'interviews.']"

H.J.C.J. Hitters",2017-09-25,['B.C.M. Kester'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het stond voor velen al vast: Hillary Clinton zou de eerste vrouwelijke president van Amerika worden en het glazen plafond breken. In aanloop naar de verkiezingen voorspelden de peilingen een ruime overwinning op rivaal Trump en dagbladen in de VS, maar ook in Nederland steunden Clinton publiekelijk. Verschillende Nederlandse media hadden in aanloop naar de verkiezingen speciale items waar de Amerikaanse verkiezingen dagelijks werden besproken, de Amerikaanse verkiezingen werd nauw gevolgd door het Nederlandse publiek. En toen op 9 november de verkiezingsuitslag bekend werd, en Donald Trump de verkiezingen won was de verslagenheid groot. Al snel kwam men tot de conclusie dat de media toe was aan zelfreflectie, want hoe kon men er zo naast zitten?
Clinton werd als feministisch boegbeeld gepresenteerd, zij zou de stem zijn voor alle vrouwen van de wereld en eigenhandig het glazen plafond breken. Dit was nodig, in Amerika zijn vrouwen nog steeds ondervertegenwoordigd in de politiek. En niet alleen in Amerika is beeldvorming rondom vrouwen een belangrijk onderwerp, ook in Nederland houdt het de maatschappij bezig.
Clinton geliefd en tegelijkertijd gehaat door velen leek de ideale kandidaat om het op te nemen tegen de onervaren Donald Trump. Niets bleek minder waar. In dit onderzoek is de beeldvorming rondom Hillary Clinton in de vijf meest gelezen Nederlandse dagbladen onderzocht. Hierbij is niet alleen gekeken naar de beeldvorming rondom Hillary Clinton, maar ook naar de mate van zelfreflectie van de journalistiek in de zoektocht naar een oorzaak voor de inschattingsfouten die gemaakt zijn, maar ook medialogica en nieuwswaarden. Uit een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse is gebleken dat de beeldvorming rondom Hillary Clinton in de Nederlandse dagbladen op een stereotyperende manier heeft plaatsgevonden. Er werd veelvuldig gerefereerd aan het uiterlijk van Hillary Clinton en zij werd geassocieerd met haar man Bill Clinton. Bovendien kwam naar voren dat Clinton gehaat werd. De thema’s die naar voren zijn gekomen vatten deze patronen samen in het Clintonisme, het feministische falen en de journalistieke bubbel. Uit de analyse kan men concluderen dat er nog een lange weg te gaan is als het om beeldvorming rondom machtige vrouwen in de (Nederlandse) media aankomt.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Beeldvorming', 'journalistieke zelfreflectie', 'Amerikaanse politiek', 'gender', 'nieuwswaarden', 'medialogica', 'personalisering']"
Lokale politiek in de media,M. Slingerland,2017-09-25,"['C.E. Aalberts', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Met de aanzienlijke uitbreiding van beleidstaken van gemeenten is het belang van lokaal politieke berichtgeving toegenomen. Burgers zijn namelijk grotendeels afhankelijk van de berichtgeving van lokale journalisten om goed geïnformeerd te worden over politieke zaken. Van oudsher handelen journalisten naar traditionele journalistieke waarden als: onpartijdig, objectief en eerlijk berichten, waarbij journalisten onafhankelijk en ethisch handelen en werken op basis van actualiteit en snelheid. Deze waarden zijn nauw verbonden met ontwikkelingen in de maatschappij en onderhevig aan veranderingen. Journalisten gebruiken de waarden om hun positie in de samenleving te legitimeren. Door het toegenomen belang van lokale journalistiek is het interessant te onderzoeken welke journalistieke waarden de journalisten drijven in het berichten over lokale politiek. Aan de hand van interviews zijn de perspectieven van lokale journalisten die berichten over de politiek geanalyseerd. 
	Uit de resultaten van de analyse kan geconcludeerd worden dat de lokale journalisten idealiter handelen naar de traditionele journalistieke waarden. Het naleven van deze journalistieke waarden wordt echter bemoeilijkt. De journalisten maken doorgaans keuzes die gedreven zijn door motieven die voortvloeien uit marktwerking of afhankelijkheidsrelaties, in plaats van keuzes die gedreven zijn door de journalistieke waarden. Commerciële belangen spelen een grotere rol dan het selecteren van onderwerpen die relevant of belangrijk zijn voor het goed informeren van de burger. Ook het onderhouden van een noodzakelijke relatie met gemeenteraadsleden, college van burgemeester en wethouder(s) en ambtenaren krijgt voorrang op het controleren van deze machthebbers. Deze noodzakelijke afhankelijkheidsrelatie is een nieuw inzicht dat een toevoeging is aan de literatuur. 
Een andere bevinding is dat een onderscheid gemaakt kan worden tussen typen lokale journalisten. Zo blijkt dat onderscheid gemaakt kan worden op basis van soort nieuwsorganisatie, hoe de nieuwsorganisatie gefinancierd wordt en het dienstverband van de journalist. Deze journalisten maken verschillende afwegingen en op basis van verschillende motieven worden keuzes gemaakt. Door de verschillende afwegingen ten opzichte van de journalistieke waarden komt andere berichtgeving tot stand. Kortom, op lokaal niveau wordt veel belang gehecht aan de traditionele journalistieke waarden, maar de journalisten worden meestal door andere motieven gedreven in het berichten over lokale politiek.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Lokale journalist', 'journalistieke waarden', 'lokale politiek', 'lokale media', 'journalistiek proces']"

Pioneers of racial development or proponents of subjugation?,C. Jones,2017-09-22,"['F.M.M. de Goey', 'G. Oonk']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis attempted to analyse The Journal of Race Development 1910-1919, a relatively obscure journal that discussed the means, methods and desirability of the elevation of so-called ‘lesser races.’ The journal was founded out of Clark University by George Hubbard Blakeslee and Granville Stanley Hall and it has received little scholarly attention, despite being an important piece of academic history. The goal of this analysis was to ascertain what the journal contributed to the debate pertaining to race and racial development, but also to identify the viewpoints of the authors contained within, as the journal itself was simply a forum. A further goal was to fit the journal and the concept of race within the discourse of international relations. The conventional narrative of IR stipulates that it was created in 1919, which would exclude this journal. Furthermore, the concept of race is notably absent from the discipline of IR. Investigation and conclusion will seek to explain why this was the case.
 This has been achieved by quantitatively analysing the number of times an author contributed, what regions were most discussed and what topics were most prevalent. To do this, the journal has been divided into two periods: 1910-1914 (early) and 1915-1919 (late). Selecting two periods for comparison allows for the identification of changes or continuity. The authors to be scrutinised were selected based on the number of their contributions. This was to ensure an impartial selection and that there would be adequate material for analysis. A random sampling was considered, but this could become problematic due to either a lack of material or an unrepresentative sampling. Once the authors for consideration have been identified with this method, the analysis will look at the implications of article titles, the content of the article itself and briefly at other publications by the authors.
 This approach has made it clear that there was a wide range of authors with countless different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds. The analysis identified some consistency in how the journal perceived colonial situations, as well as members of other races. Despite this, there is some dissent present in both periods of analysis, but there are also divergences across geographic regions discussed, which can potentially be attributed to the outbreak of WW1. This analysis was by no means exhaustive and due to the constraints related to the size of the thesis, certain information or documents have had to remain absent for the sake of concision. It is the opinion of the author that this topic and subject are still relatively undocumented and it would be of significant academic importance for this work to be continued further.","['Race', 'Development', 'Clark University', 'White Man’s Burden', 'Spanish-American War', 'USA', 'Empire', 'Colonialism', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'Latin America', 'Twentieth Century']"
'Die onbeschrijfelijke wereldstad',D. Varekamp,2017-09-22,"['J.A. Baggerman', 'E. Jacobs']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In deze thesis staan de ervaringen van Nederlandse reizigers die Londen bezochten tussen 1860 en 1890 centraal. Eerder onderzoek naar de periode rond het midden van de negentiende eeuw toonde aan dat Nederlanders positiever waren over de Britse hoofdstad – voor veel Europeanen de belichaming van de industrialisatie – dan veel andere Europese reizigers. Met het onderzoek in deze scriptie is het trekken van een conclusie over een langere termijn mogelijk gemaakt. De hoofdvraag is dan ook hoe de perceptie van Londen bij Nederlandse reizigers in deze periode veranderde en hoe deze veranderingen of het gebrek daaraan kunnen worden verklaard. In de scriptie worden tien reisverslagen van zes verschillende auteurs geanalyseerd met behulp van een waarnemingsinstrument. Om de bevindingen te verhelderen en beter in context te kunnen plaatsen, is gebruik gemaakt van een uitgebreid theoretisch kader. Bij het zoeken naar verklaringen voor de bevindingen wordt onder andere gebruik gemaakt van Dean MacCannells theorie over markers en John Urry’s idee van de tourist gaze. Het plaatsen van de bevindingen in hun historische context wordt gedaan met behulp van Ferdinand Tönnies concepten Gemeinschaft en Gesellschaft en met Reinhart Kosellecks idee van een veranderend tijdsbesef. Na een inleidend hoofdstuk en een hoofdstuk waarin de politieke, economische en culturele situatie in zowel Nederland als Engeland in de tweede helft van de negentiende eeuw uitgebreid wordt besproken, volgt de analyse van de reisverslagen. Deze is thematisch ingedeeld, waardoor verschuivingen eenvoudiger zijn waar te nemen. Er is gekeken naar wat de auteurs schrijven over transport, verkeer en openbaar vervoer, industrialisatie, architectuur, het Britse volk en de Britse cultuur en bezienswaardigheden. Aan de hand van deze analyse wordt duidelijk dat wat Nederlandse reizigers als bijzonder of vermeldenswaardig beschouwen in de loop van de onderzochte periode verandert. In de jaren 1860 wordt uitgebreid en in extreme bewoordingen geschreven over het Londense verkeer. In de decennia die daarop volgen neemt de aandacht hiervoor af, wellicht omdat in die tijd ook in Nederland de transportrevolutie op gang was gekomen en het verkeer in Londen daardoor als minder bijzonder werd ervaren. De aandacht voor de armoede en sociale onrusten die het gevolg waren van de snelle industrialisatie neemt daarentegen juist toe. Ook dit kan verklaard worden door wat er op dat moment in Nederland speelde: tegen het einde van de negentiende eeuw namen ook in Nederland de sociale onrusten toe, waardoor het voor Nederlanders interessanter werd om te zien hoe in Londen, waar men al enkele decennia eerder met dezelfde problemen te kampen had gehad, hiermee werd omgegaan.","['reisgeschiedenis', 'reisverslagen', 'Londen', 'negentiende eeuw', 'industrialisatie', 'transportrevolutie', 'markers', 'tourist gaze']"
Misdaad in de regio,R.C. Korver,2017-09-22,"['B.C.M. Kester', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Wie denkt dat regionale- en lokale omroepen aan populariteit verliezen, heeft het mis. Voor Amsterdam en Rotterdam geldt dat het grootste gedeelte van de burgers het nieuws over hun stad volgt via AT5 (Amsterdam) en RTV Rijnmond (Rotterdam). Voornamelijk nieuws over misdaad en rechtspraak zijn populaire onderwerpen voor de regionale- en lokale media. Een reden hiervoor is dat berichtgeving over criminaliteit de nadruk legt op de nabijheid ervan, wat weer een belangrijk aspect is van regionaal- en lokaal nieuws. Media-aandacht voor criminaliteit en misdaad kan van grote invloed zijn op de attituden en het gedrag van het publiek. Om te onderzoeken op welke wijze twee belangrijke, Nederlandse steden berichten over misdaad in hun stad is de volgende vraag beantwoord: “Op welke wijze berichten AT5 en RTV Rijnmond over  criminaliteit en misdaad in hun stad via  traditionele offline- en online sociale mediakanalen?”. Door middel van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse is antwoord gegeven op deze vraag. Hierbij werden veertig nieuwsuitzendingen van AT5 en RTV Rijnmond uit verschillende weken van het jaar 2016 geanalyseerd. Daarnaast werden de daarbij behorende Facebookposts uit die weken geanalyseerd. Deze analyse heeft vijf thema’s opgeleverd die de wijze van berichten en de verschillen en overeenkomsten tussen de omroepen goed weergeven. AT5 lijkt voornamelijk het marktmodel te hanteren waarbij aantrekkelijkheid, toegankelijkheid en actualiteit prominente kwaliteitskenmerken zijn. Dit uit zich in een spannende wijze van berichtgeving die duidelijk maakt dat iedereen een potentieel slachtoffer zou kunnen zijn. Anderzijds leggen zij de focus op de controle die wordt uitgeoefend door de politie en burgemeester. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat AT5 twee verschillende boodschappen overbrengt. Dit geldt niet voor RTV Rijnmond. Deze omroep lijkt een combinatie van het professie- en burgermodel te hanteren waarbij de focus ligt op hard  nieuws uit, bijvoorbeeld de economische sector. Daarnaast worden deze modellen niet gekenmerkt door nieuwswaarden als actualiteit. RTV Rijnmond schetst een afstand tussen de burgers en criminaliteit door voornamelijk aandacht te besteden aan witteboordencriminaliteit en de focus te leggen op de autoritaire rol van de politie en burgemeester.  Dit laatste gegeven is kenmerkend voor beide omroepen wat zou kunnen betekenen dat zij de burgers van Amsterdam en Rotterdam een veilig gevoel willen geven.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Regiojournalistiek', 'AT5', 'RTV Rijnmond', 'offline-/online media', 'misdaadverslaggeving', 'markt-/professie-/burgermodel']"

Grever']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Op 22 april 1961 probeerde een deel van het Franse leger, onder leiding van de generaals Challe, Salan, Jouhaud en Zeller, middels een putsch president de Gaulle onder druk te zetten Frans-Algerije als Franse kolonie te behouden. Na zijn installatie als president van de Franse Vijfde Republiek was De Gaulle een verzelfstandigingsproces gestart voor Frans-Algerije, waarbij hij op veel weerstand vanuit onder andere het Franse leger stuitte. Zij zagen de totstandkoming van een onafhankelijk Algerije en de verdere dekolonisatie van het Franse Rijk als een aantasting van hun bestaansrecht. 
Getekend door de koloniale- en oorlogservaringen in Frans-Indochina, waarbij het leger de strijd verloor en het land uiteindelijk verzelfstandigd werd, wilde men er alles aan doen om een herhaling van deze gang van zaken te voorkomen. In een ultieme poging het dekolonisatieproces te stoppen en zo Algerije als Frans grondgebied te behouden, besloot een deel van het Franse leger zich te verenigen en zich tegen de president te keren. Het was voor de eerste maal dat het Franse leger zo een actieve politieke rol innam en het beleid van Frankrijk probeerde te beïnvloeden. 
Binnen deze scriptie wordt er gekeken naar de motieven voor de putsch, met een specifieke focus op de beweegredenen van generaal Raoul Salan en majoor Helié Denoix de Saint Marc. Daarnaast wordt er gekeken naar de oorlog in Indochina en het verloop van de gebeurtenissen in Frans-Algerije met de putsch als climax. 
Op basis van het bestuderen van de memoires van Salan en Saint Marc, de verslagen van de rechtszaken na de putsch, biografieën van Salan en Saint Marc en bronnen over de oorlog in Indochina, de situatie in Frans-Algerije en de putsch, wordt er binnen de scriptie een antwoord gegeven op de hoofdvraag wat was de invloed van de oorlogs- en koloniale ervaring in Indochina op de motieven voor de putsch in Frans-Algerije in 1961.","['Putsch', 'Frans-Algerije', 'Indochina', 'Raoul Salan', 'Helié Denoix de Saint Marc', 'Charles de Gaulle', 'Dekolonisatieproces', 'Franse kolonie', 'Franse leger', 'Motieven']"
'Waar zo veele slagtoffers der revolutie gezugt hebben',M.L.J. Schoolenberg,2017-09-22,"['A.J. Baggerman', 'E. Jacobs']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De beelden van zeven Nederlandse reizigers over Parijs, 1800-1808
De Franse Revolutie (1789) vormde een keerpunt in de geschiedenis. Met de opstand tegen het Ancien Régime van koning, kerk en adel werd de standensamenleving definitief doorbroken. De huidige invulling van democratie, gelijkheid en de scheiding van kerk en staat stammen uit deze periode. Niet voor niets zijn onder meer de Franse nationale feestdag, het volkslied en de vlag gebaseerd op de Revolutie. Ook in de Nederlandse Republiek vormde het revolutietijdperk een belangrijk moment. De huidige eenheidsstaat kreeg vorm in deze periode en de tegenwoordige grondwet is nog altijd gebaseerd op die uit 1798. Toch is dit tijdperk lang verzwegen in de Nederlandse geschiedenis. De Nederlandse patriotten hadden bij hun revolutie tegen de stadhouder in 1795 namelijk de hulp ingeroepen van de Fransen, maar die ontpopten zich tot 1813 als ‘bezetters’.							Hoe reageerden tijdgenoten op deze ingrijpende gebeurtenissen? Dat is de belangrijkste vraag in deze scriptie. Er is onderzoek gedaan naar de beelden van zeven Nederlandse reizigers in acht handgeschreven verslagen over Parijs tussen 1800 en 1808. Nederlandse reizigers kijken geëmotioneerd en met afkeer terug op het revolutionaire geweld en storen zich aan de Franse invloed in Nederland. In deze scriptie staat echter niet alleen de reflectie op deze gebeurtenissen centraal, maar is er ook aandacht voor de implicaties hiervan voor stereotyperingen van Parijzenaren en percepties van de orde in de stad. Zo blijkt dat in sommige gevallen eigentijdse Parijzenaren de schuld krijgen van het revolutionaire geweld in het verleden en ze als gewelddadig worden beschouwd. Paradoxaal genoeg wordt de stad wel weer als relatief ordentelijk bestempeld. Tot slot komen thema’s van moderniteit aan bod. Negatieve beelden over de Revolutie en ‘oppervlakkige’ Parijzenaren gaan bijvoorbeeld wel gepaard met positieve opmerkingen over de kunst en wetenschap in de Franse hoofdstad. Ook hebben de reizigers bewondering voor de moderne gebouwen.				Terwijl er al veel bekend is over de diplomatieke, politieke en economische dimensies van de Revolutie, zijn de persoonlijke reacties van Nederlandse reizigers op de gebeurtenissen nooit eerder systematisch onderzocht. Met deze scriptie is een bijdrage geleverd aan een history from below, waarbij de geschiedenis vanuit het perspectief van de tijdgenoten zelf bezien wordt. Reisverslagen konden bovendien een belangrijke rol spelen in de beeldvorming over plaatsen, aangezien negentiende-eeuwse reizigers overwegend uit hogere klassen afkomstig waren en zodoende meer invloed hadden. Ook op theoretisch gebied levert deze scriptie een bijdrage. Concepten als othering, tourist gaze en lieu-de-mémoire vormen een integraal element van de analyse. De beelden van Nederlandse reizigers kunnen dan ook verklaard worden uit een wens de identiteit af te bakenen, een zucht naar het vreemde en de ‘trigger-functie’ van revolutionaire herinneringsplaatsen.						Er ligt nog voldoende onderzoeksterrein open. Een systematische vergelijking met Nederlandse reizigers vóór 1789 in Parijs kan de vraag beantwoorden of de beelden radicaal veranderden door de Franse Revolutie, wat mijn bevindingen wel suggereren. En in hoeverre spelen de gebeurtenissen een rol in latere reisverslagen, tot en met het heden? Bezoeken tegenwoordige toeristen in Parijs nog revolutionaire lieux-de-mémoire? Hopelijk vormt deze scriptie een aanzet tot meer onderzoek.","['Frankrijk', 'Lieu-de-mémoire', 'Moderniteit', 'Nederland', 'Negentiende eeuw', 'Othering', 'Parijs', 'Reizigers', 'Revolutie', 'Tourist gaze']"
The Conservation of a Cartel Paradise,A. Groenheijde,2017-09-22,"['B. Wubs', 'F.M.M. de Goey']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Between 1890 and the start of World War II the United States developed a strong federal antitrust legislation with the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act. In Europe on the other hand cartels thrived and were even stimulated by national governments. World trade was dominated by Europe with a share of 70%, of this share a minimum of 40% was controlled by international cartels. Leading firms in those cartels were European, mostly German. Those cartels harmed US interests and impeded the US war effort in anticipation of World War II. After the war, the US used their gained influence to try spreading their view on antitrust to the rest of the World via the Havana Charter and the European Recovery Program (more commonly known as the Marshall Plan). 
The main question of this thesis is to what extend the US influenced antitrust legislation in the Netherlands between 1948 and 1958, the period from the start of the European Recovery Program and the implementation of the Dutch Economic Competition Act. The research is based on American archival sources from the Roosevelt Study Center in Middelburg about the Dutch ECA mission and the archives of the Dutch Economics- and Foreign Department available in at the Dutch National archives. This thesis shows that the American attempt to influence antitrust policy in the Netherlands was not a success at all. The reasons for this were twofold. First, although the implementation of a form of antitrust legislation by the Netherlands was a condition of the ERP, it never had any real priority for American officials. The emphasis of US policy in the Netherlands was on the recovery of Dutch economy after the war, increasing its economic efficiency and productivity, and building up a military apparatus. Second, the government of the Netherlands rejected the American vision on antitrust, believing that the benefits of cartels: distribution of unused production capacity among participating companies; stabilisation of prices on a reasonable level; levelling off cyclical fluctuations; distribution of technology and patents among participants; and not hindering innovation and efficiency were significantly greater than the disadvantages.
With the creation of the Economic Competition Act in 1958 it looked like the Netherlands did fulfill the conditions of the ERP and the Havana Charter, but in fact the Netherlands remained a cartel paradise. This cartel paradise was conserved well into the 1990s, when the formation of the European Union began and antitrust was back on the agenda.","['Antitrust', 'Cartels', 'Concentration', 'Big Businesses', 'Restrictive Business Practices.

AFCENT in the mining region,E. Schippers,2017-09-18,"['B. Wubs', 'M. Straver']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis endeavors to document the first fifteen years of AFCENT, a NATO headquarters
commanding forces in the central region of Western Europe, when it was moved from
France to the former mining-town of Brunssum in Limburg, a province in the southern tip of
the Netherlands. The thesis investigates the public debate in anticipation of AFCENT’s
arrival, and the subsequent physical (including economic) and social consequences, thereby
helping to gain a better understanding of what kind of influences a NATO military base has
on its surrounding community.
Due to a dearth of secondary material about this base the thesis is very heavily
slanted towards the use of primary sources, particularly newspapers from the research
period, backed up by municipal archive material and interviews. By means of framing theory
and oral history the author seeks to map out the public debate, perceptions and bias
surrounding AFCENT, through analysis of framing in the media and during interviews. Many
of the interviewees, both Dutch and Americans, used to be employed at the base, and were
old enough to have consciously experienced its arrival, and these interviews were
supplemented with shorter conversations with locals in Brunssum.
Primarily by means of newspapers two opposing sides are identified vying to control
the public debate. On the one hand communists, assorted left-wing groups and students
protested against the base and NATO in general, while on the other a conservative and
catholic press and public was generally supportive of the base, with a clear eye to its
potential for job creation. The next section investigates the physical and economic
consequences of the base, juxtapositioning the economic injection with rising housing prices
caused by the presence of base personnel, the transfer of municipal and community
resources to accommodate the base, and the strains on municipal budgets. Archival
material plays a role in particular here. The final section, guided by the interviews,
documents much of the socio-cultural impact of AFCENT, through the base and its
personnel’s participation in local social life, transfers of foreign festivities and sports, the
role of race, and the base’s impact on local identity. All of these influences radiated
outwards, particularly the markers of American culture.
Throughout this study is highlighted the importance of the regional mining history to
the narrative of AFCENT. The mining industry was the economic lifeblood of the region, as
well as a cornerstone of the local collective identity, but the mines were closing just before
AFCENT arrived, and so the base partially filled that void through its economic and
socio-cultural footprint, as well as helping Brunssum to recast its identity as international
and metropolitan instead of as a mining-town. The backdrop of the mine closures is the
determinative factor of how AFCENT influenced the local community in most respects.","['NATO', 'military bases', 'AFCENT', 'Limburg', 'Brunssum', '1960s', '1970s', 'Cold War', 'protests', 'Kielmansegg', 'cultural transfer', 'mining industry', 'framing', 'oral history', 'international', 'relations', 'transatlanticism', 'Americanization', 'collective identity']"

Post-war Germany and the birth of a bipolar world,G. Wegter,2017-09-18,"['M. Lak', 'B. Wubs']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Extensive research has been done throughout the years on the Cold War. The study of this conflict, however, remains relevant to study. Because of the discovery of new archive materials and the introduction of new approaches in studying the Cold War, its historiography has developed throughout the years. The end of the Cold War and the end of the Soviet Union opened new archives, and that gave the study of the topic a boost. The world nowadays still is heavily influenced by the United States and Russia. To understand the current tensions and diplomacy between these two powers, the Cold War is important to understand.
	After Germany had been defeated in May 1945, its future was discussed at Potsdam. During the Potsdam talks, a policy was formulated for the future of Germany. Present at Potsdam were delegations of the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union. It was at Potsdam that these Allies agreed to divide Germany into four zones of occupation, each ruled by an Allied commander. Furthermore, the country had to be denazified and the economy had to be partly dismantled in order to prevent Germany from rising as a military power again.. Each Ally was granted his own zone. Even though France had not been present at the Potsdam talks, they were granted their own zone of occupation. The goal that was formulated for post-war Germany was clear: Germany had to be unified economically as soon as possible.
	The government of Germany as a whole was the responsibility of the Allied Control Council. This Council consisted of the commanders of each of the zones. Problematic to the character of this Council was that decisions that influenced the whole of Germany had to be made unanimously. This meant that, in effect, each of the occupying powers had a veto. On top of that, the rule of each separate zone was autarkic, since each of the commanders was allowed to set up his zone to his own discretion. From the start of the occupation on, this meant that the character of each zone was very different. The ideological agendas of each Ally, as well as the economic interests, made that each zone was ruled differently. The differences between the Allies became apparent on several occasions. 
	The difficulties of the inter-Allied cooperation became too important to overcome, which led to the end of Allied cooperation and the foundation of two separate German states in 1949: the German Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic. An important aspect of the end of the Allied cooperation was mutual distrust between the Soviet Union and the United States. This thesis considers the role of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in shaping the image the Americans had of the Soviets. Through considering several reports, this thesis analyses the way in which the CIA wrongly interpreted several Soviet actions, which led to a firmer American policy with regard to the German Question and communism in general.","['Cold War', 'occupied Germany', 'German Question', 'Allies', 'CIA', 'Allied Control Council', 'Potsdam treaty', 'post war Europe', 'Soviet Union', 'United States']"
The war for supremacy of the jihadist movement,J. Seijbel,2017-09-18,"['D. Douwes', 'G. Oonk']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Syria today is torn by a major civil war and does not yet have the prospect of peaceful
solution. The Syrian civil war is an offshoot of the Arab Spring, the widespread protests
which began in Tunisia in 2010 and spread across the region. The civil war in Syria proved to
be the right circumstances for several jihadist movements, and they have been able to
establish themselves in the country. This research focuses on intra-movement rivalry and
framing between ISIS, al-Qaeda and Jabhat al-Nusra during the ongoing civil war in Syria. The
main research question is: What discourse have al-Qaeda, ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra adopted
in their media expressions in order to legitimize jihadist differentiation and the use of
violence, both symbolic and real, against their jihadist competitors? The main conclusion is
that jihadist use a defectional discourse in order to legitimize jihadist differentiation and the
use of violence against their jihadist competitors. ISIS, al-Qaeda and Jabhat al-Nusra have
adopted and developed a radical discourse, which I have called the defectional discourse.
They make use of the notion of takfir to legitimize violence, claiming the ‘other’ is not a
pious Muslim. This defectional discourse interacts with a political and religious salafist
discourse, drawing on early Islamic history and early Islamic religious texts.","['intra-movement rivalry', 'Syria', 'civil war', 'Iraq', 'framing', 'sectarianism', 'ISIS', 'Jabhat alNusra', 'al-Qaeda', 'jihadism', 'salafism', 'discourse']"
"The Open Door Policy and Geopolitics, 1890-1910",E. Nilsson,2017-09-18,"['F. de Goey', 'G. Oonk']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The Open-Door policy in China during the turn of the nineteenth century was a cornerstone moment for United States foreign policy in Asia, and several scholars have cited economic and political reasons for its adoption. Little has been written concerning the role of geopolitics in this respect, offering a new perspective on Sino-US relations which could help explain some of the activities occurring today, e.g. the One Belt One Road policy, the creation of artificial islands in the South China Sea, and Chinese efforts to claim the Spratly Islands.
The main purpose of this thesis was to establish a connection between the new geopolitical ideas that emerged in the 1890’s, US foreign policy and the Open-Door policy. It also mapped three key developments in US foreign policy in Asia from ca. 1776 to 1890, and identified the main geopolitical ideas that were popular during the early nineteenth century. 
To prove this connection, two main sets of qualitative data were analysed, these being the Foreign Relations of the United States papers and the Presidential papers. Furthermore, the operationalization of the definition of geopolitics by Saul Bernard Cohen was used to establish this connection.  A qualitative content analysis of the sources was made, paying attention to any mention of how geopolitics and how geography was influencing the US foreign political process. In addition to this, the sources were analysed to establish a connection between the geopolitical ideas present at the time and US foreign policy.

There were roughly three periods concerning American foreign policy in Asia, these being from ca. 1776 to 1850 which sought to establish trade in Asia and more specifically China. The second period was from ca. 1850-1860 with focus on Japan. The final period sought to expand trade with Asia and to create an informal empire in the region. The main geopolitical ideas relevant at the time came from Admiral A. T. Mahan and his ideas on naval power and H. J. Mackinder’s ideas on land power, as well as ideas under the so-called “New Manifest Destiny.”
 	The sources showed that there was no explicit connection between the newly published geopolitical ideas, US foreign policy and the adoption of the Open-Door. While these results showed a negative correlation, they did display elements of geopolitics under Cohen’s definition. On several occasions did Chinese geography and the control of it influence the foreign political process in the United States. Not only that, there were four distinct categories where there was a clear connection between geopolitics and US foreign policy. These categories being; railroads, trade, naval power and missionary activity.
These results have shed late on the debate around the Open-Door policy and analysed it in a new perspective, hopefully prompting further research into the vast yet lightly explored realm of geopolitics and foreign policy in a historical context.","['Open-Door Policy', 'Geopolitics', 'US foreign policy', 'Trade', 'Asia', 'China', 'Alfred Thayer Mahan', 'Halford John Mackinder', 'Imperialism', 'Manifest Destiny']"
A Soldiers’ truth,J. Reidy,2017-09-18,"['M. Lak', 'D. Douwes']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The title of the dissertation is “a soldiers’ truth: a comprehensive analyses of soldiers’ lives
through diary narratives. This dissertation is about soldier’s experience in the Middle Eastern
theatre, during the First World War. Soldier diaries can be seen as the leading source of
understanding how the common man experienced the war and the brutal conditions he
encountered while serving his country. However, soldier diaries may not provide an accurate
account on the war, as a soldier’s mind can be influenced through anger, fear, tiredness or
illness. Forty diaries were examined and theoretical frameworks were applied in understanding
how a soldier composed his thoughts into a diary.
The thesis is structured into three chapters, focusing on three distinctive topics. Chapter one
focused on propaganda within the British Empire and examined the methods and theoretical
concepts of how the common man was swayed with a pro-war stance and enlisted in the British
army. The goal here is to understand how effective propaganda was on soldiers’ and did it
affect their opinion of the war from the knowledge of their diaries in later chapters.
Chapter two examined the diaries of the soldiers’. The chapter begins with possible
ethnic diversity in soldiers’ diaries between the British and commonwealth soldiers. The
chapter moves on to the soldier experience at Gallipoli and Kut and researched the conditions
they encountered, such as the threat of the enemy, ethnic diversity, lack of supplies and risk of
diseases. The chapter concludes on analysing the optimistic moments from a soldier diary and
the reasons why.
Chapter three questioned how the British media perceived Gallipoli and Kut and if they
did provide an accurate account of both campaigns. Newspapers were assessed from Britain,
the Dominion states and from the enemy (Ottoman and German) in order to compare and
comprehend the differences in regards to coverage between newspapers and soldier diaries.
Furthermore, the chapter implemented theoretical concepts about newspapers and diaries to
develop a clear understanding of how they were composed and why there was a sense of
inaccuracy within them. For newspapers, theories such as censorship, propaganda were used,
while theory of emotion, collective memory and the timing narrative were utilised in
understanding soldier diaries.
The results from the dissertation indicated that soldier diaries and newspapers differed in
regards of how the war was perceived. The British public received a different outlook, whereas
the soldiers’ witnessed the full extent of the brutality of the war front in the Middle Eastern 
theatre. However, the use of the theories suggest that an individual soldier’s emotional state
can lead to a different perception of war, while other soldiers’ may have another outlook",

Examining the influence of multiple boundary spanning agents on slum upgrading outcomes,"Waithira Kamweru, A. (Anne)",2017-09-01,['Meerkerk I. van (Ingmar)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Adequate housing is a chronic headache for most of Kenyans and more so the urban poor. Both the private sector and the government acting singularly have been unable to address this problem satisfactorily and provide sufficient and adequate housing stock for all socio-economic groups. This was the basis for the formation of Slum Dwellers Federation Muungano Wa Wanavijiji a vehicle with which the urban poor communally sought solutions to their shared housing problems. One of the redressal solutions pursued by Muungano Federation for its members is the bottom-up approach of ‘community-led settlement improvement’ in Huruma.
Realization of such a settlement upgrading is by no means an easy feat considering the community limitations in resources, ability to negotiate for required support from external partners and organizations, the gaping diversities in needs and interests among the community members as well as the hardship in aligning their community interests with the environment other intervening factors arising from the political and policy dynamics in Kenya.
This research was therefore instigated by the interest in the strategies the representative community agents applied in bridging these diversities of groups and the extents to which the abilities and competencies of these community agents in applying those strategies impacted the settlement upgrading outcomes realized from a boundary spanning perspective.
Theoretical review divulged the essential tasks that these agents must undertake in traversing these barriers to realize a fulfilment of the involved partner’s needs. These are Establishing connections and linkages among parties, engaging in informational exchange between separate groups, and facilitating cooperation of all parties to ensure the realization of a co-joint objective. This research undertook and explanatory case study with three embedded units in Huruma. It followed a mixed method approach where in-depth semi-structured interviews with respondents directly involved in leadership positions in the Huruma upgrading project. Questionnaires were issued to the beneficiary community as well as content analysis of the reports made of the upgrading process to measure the success of the project outcomes as well as provide insight into the activities of the community agents and the limits to which they fulfilled their roles.
The research established that informational exchange was the task that had the most impact on the upgrading outcomes realized. The community response and decisions were strongly based on information available and thus participation was limited to the extents to which relevant information on the upgrading was received. Secondly, due to the long-term nature of an incremental settlement upgrading project, it was found that multiple connective agents are necessary to muster and maintain positive involvement of vital partners from the household levels in the community to the organizational levels of external supporting bodies. Community agents bearing different characteristics are required to leverage their strengths where they complement each other’s skills and competencies by focussing on the areas of their core competencies and leaving others to do the same. It also found that the legitimation processes had impact on the extents to which the community agents fulfilled their roles, consequently community agents are required to achieve both vertical and horizontal legitimation and where impossible then a mix of community agents deriving different legitimation sources is necessitated to create sufficient connections between their constituency and the external supporting organizations.
For future studies, I recommend a similar research but focussing rather on the boundary spanning agents located externally to the community but involved in this project to find out the extents to which they impacted the project.","['Boundary Spanning', 'Legitimation Sources', 'Huruma Settlement Upgrading', 'Settlement Upgrading Outcomes', 'Slum Dweller Federations']"
Children Domain in the Public Realm,"Widowati, M. (Marini)",2017-09-01,['Ginting N. (Natalia)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This research aim to foresee the relationship between children domain in the public realm and subjective wellbeing in Rotterdam. Children domain in the public realm can be defined as children destination in the public space as the core elements of the neighborhood planning. Based on the theoretical background, the children domain in the public realm comprises of the school domain, the route domain, and the public amenities domain. Subjective wellbeing derived by questioning individual how satisfy are you as whole. Currently, the subjective wellbeing is commonly used as a tool to see social progress of a neighborhood, a city, and a nation. The research is deductive thus it is expected that the outcome can be generalized. It employs a mix method strategy in which an existing quantitative data analysis, spatial analysis and primary qualitative data analysis are able to perform triangulation to elevate the reliability and validity of the research. The findings from a series of cross sectional inferential analysis show that there is significant relationship between children domain in the public realm and subjective wellbeing. The relationship can be found in two ways. First, a direct relationship without any intermediary and second, an indirect relationship through the mediation of domain satisfaction. It can be explained in the three children domains in the public realm.
First, in the school domain, the availability and accessibility of the primary school within walking distance or <500m significantly influence the subjective wellbeing - life satisfaction in positive direction indirectly through the mediating variable, the school domain satisfaction. The school domain satisfaction including satisfaction of the residents on the availability of preschool, primary school, and secondary school.
Second, in the route domain, safety route regarding traffic safety, safety route regarding social safety and the availability of pedestrian pathway significantly affect the subjective wellbeing - life satisfaction in positive way, without any intermediary.
Third, in the public amenities domain, the availability and accessibility of park and playground within walking distance or <500m affects subjective wellbeing significantly in negative sign. The availability and accessibility of health care within walking distance or <500m also significantly affects subjective wellbeing in negative sign. The availability and accessibility of sport, culture, and recreation facilities within walking distance or <500m significantly influence subjective wellbeing - life satisfaction directly. Moreover, other factors are elaborated to figure out why child-friendliness and subjective wellbeing differs among neighborhoods based on the findings from existing quantitative analysis, primary qualitative analysis conducted through an in depth interviews with the key actors, and literature study. Some indicators also recommended to elevate the child-friendliness of the city based on the findings in this research. Furthermore, the research comes out with policy recommendation in the field of child friendly city and subjective wellbeing, in which the local government may consider in prioritizing their program and plan.","['Children domain in the public domain', 'Child-friendly city', 'Subjective wellbeing', 'Life satisfaction', 'Child’s Right Convention', 'Children wellbeing', 'Neighbourhood planning', 'Child oriented development']"
The influence of operational efficiency and water tariffs on cost recovery in the water sector,"Ng’andu, N. (Nangoma)",2017-09-01,['Brilhante O. (Ogenis)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The majority of Governments in emerging economies contend with scarce financial resources needed for the expansion of strategic infrastructure which is vital for the improvement of the social and economic wellbeing of societies. This is due to high budgetary shortfalls and inadequate domestic capital financing alternatives. Although the debate on the best way forward is not conclusive, commercialisation of the water industry rather than full privatisation seems to be the most favoured in the developing nations. This was the premise on which the Zambian water sector was restructured. Commercialisation for the water industry in Zambia was established on seven tenets as specified in the National Water Policy(NWP) (Schwartz, 2008). The third (3rd) NRW principle devolved authority to Water Utilities to function on commercial principles. The expectation under this principle was gradual achievement of full cost recovery by the established water utilities (Republic of Zambia, 1994). Full cost recovery in this case denoted covering of operations and maintenance costs, finance costs, depreciation and any allowed provisions(NWASCO, 2016). However, achievement of this goal has not been easy for most of the utilities in Zambia. A case of Lukanga Water and Sewerage Company (LgWSC) was selected to establish the factors responsible for the failure to attain the expected target of cost recovery in most of the Zambian water utilities.
The theoretical context for the study was anchored on two main theories; the water pricing theory and the modern management theory approach on the efficiency and effectiveness of organizations. The main concept of study ‘cost recovery’ is founded on the principle that service providers should recover cost related to the provision of the services. The study was mainly explanatory and took a qualitative approach. Two main data collection tools were employed to obtain the primary data for the study; semi-structured interviews and closed questionnaires. The main supposition of taking this type of inquiry was that the blend of interviews and questionnaires would offer a much more complete understanding of the study problem than either research tool could provide (Creswell, 2013). Secondary data from existing literature and legislation was used to augment the primary data collected.
From the findings of the study, it can be conclusively said that operational inefficiencies and low water tariffs have significantly contributed to the failure of the water utility to attain the expected target of cost recovery. The study has shown that operational inefficiencies denoted as water losses, bill collections and staff productivity combined with the effects of the low water tariffs, explained the failure to recover costs. Operational inefficiencies both on the cost side and the revenue side of operations have been adversely influencing the utility’s ability to achieve the targeted cost recovery. Furthermore, the situation was exacerbated by the fact that LgWSC had the lowest tariff in the sector. A unit of water tariff per cubic meter was therefore not able to cover a unit O&M cost per cubic meter. Additionally, the high operational costs coupled with low collections further restricted business growth. Even though operational improvements were visible from the time the water utility was commercialised, the lack of investment in business growth threatened the sustained capacity of the operational improvements so far achieved in the water utility.
This study supports the view that substantial revenue potential is possible for service providers by merely putting in place effective measures to increase operational efficiency without necessarily raising water tariff rates (Gupta 2011). Therefore, by having operational efficiency in management of water losses, in bill collections and labour productivity small ‘quick wins’, in revenue would be achieved. Focusing on the water pricing policy alone will not yield the desired outcomes for the sector. The study has recommended more applied research that quantifies in monetary terms the operational gains that would accrue to water utilities in the developing countries to aid utility managers and policy makers make more focused decisions for the sustained growth of the water sector in developing countries.","['Cost recovery', 'water tariff', 'operational efficiency', 'water losses', 'bill collections', 'staff productivity']"
The Effect of Involuntary Resettlement to Place Attachment of the Resettled Community towards the New Settlement in Rent-Flat Housing in Jakarta,Mahargarani,2017-09-01,['Zuijderwijk L. (Linda)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Cities are growing and rapid urbanisation increase multiple challenges, especially for developing countries. In Jakarta, Indonesia, informal settlement also grows as an impact of rapid urbanisation and lack of sufficient housing. Some of the informal settlements are located in the riverbank. However, there was a regulation that was established in 2011 about the riverbanks that should be free from any kind of buildings. This condition constitutes resettlement of the people who initially resides on the riverbank in Jakarta. The urgency for the resettlement was also driven by the threat of flooding in Jakarta. The government then planned to hold a program that can turn the function of the river in Jakarta back to normal. However, the impacted community who are displaced from their previous location usually experience drastic changes in their new settlement, which in this case, the resettlement site is in a form of rent-flat housing. Place attachment is one of many theories worth to explore to improve the resettlement process that occurs, because place attachment involves in many important processes that can make adaptation phase smoother.
The main objective of this research is to explain the effect of involuntary resettlement to place attachment of the residents in rent-flat housing in Jakarta. This research will also explain the intermediate variables that influence the effect of involuntary resettlement to place attachment, namely perceived consent, predictability of the new environment, control of the impacted community in the new settlement and familiarity of the new settlement. By focusing on Jatinegara Barat rent-flat housing and Rawa Bebek rent-flat housing as the study case about rent-flat housing in Jakarta, the research could answer the research question in the context of resettlement in Jakarta based on the respondents’ experiences.
The aim of this research is to understand how something happen, so the methodology used is a qualitative study, using case study as the research strategy. Case study is a strategy that examines one or several situations in real-life setting. The data collection methods used were in-depth interview, observation, mental map drawing, and secondary data, such as maps, and planning document.
During the empirical study period, interviews were conducted with different respondents from both rent-flat housing, in Jatinegara Barat and in Rawa Bebek. From the interviews, it was understood that perceived consent in the resettlement process different in each individual. Control in new settlement and familiarity of the new settlement also play important role in building the place attachment in the new settlement. However, the role of predictability was not really seen for the specific cases used in this research. Besides the variables that is mentioned in the literature review, the empirical study showed findings that was not covered in the literature, which are status of ownership and the people’s feeling after the relocation. Some people feel perforce, some people feel thrown away, and their status changes from owner of a house to renting a residential unit.
Based on the empirical study conducted in Jatinegara Barat rent-flat housing and Rawa Bebek rent-flat housing, it showed that involuntary resettlement gave negative impact to place attachment of the residents in their new settlement. Overall, the effect of involuntary resettlement to place attachment occurs differently for each individual, and it is what makes it interesting and important to explore more, in order to accommodate the future resettled community in adapting to their new environment. Therefore, further studies about involuntary resettlement and place attachment are encouraged, especially using different approach and different method to enrich the findings and conclusion. For practical purpose, it is

recommended to give thorough and deep socialization to the accurate impacted community that can really represent the community. It is also important to give informed consent and actually reach agreement that show the willingness of the impacted people to be relocated. In addition, conducting study about the life of the impacted community to be adopted to the resettlement planning is recommended to help the impacted community build the place attachment to the new settlement.","['involuntary resettlement', 'place attachment', 'rent-flat housing', 'displacement', 'relocation']"
Regional transport infrastructure integration and its contribution to Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) flow within Africa,"Wanjiru Kieha, C. (Caroline)",2017-09-01,['Alade T. (Taslim)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Economic competitiveness, trade and integration initiatives realised through favourable cross-border movement of people and their activities between regions and countries; are greatly rooted in an integrated transport infrastructure system. Previous researches have recognised that investments in transport infrastructure among countries advances the productivity and foreign investment potential of a region; as functional transport infrastructure enhances connectivity, and promotes ease of movement while lowering trade costs. In addition, several authors propound that economically competitive regions attribute their success to regional connectivity since it boosts transfer of FDI. This study therefore attempts to explain how regional transport infrastructure integration influences the flow of FDI within regional geographical blocs in Africa. The research quests to highlight how the four modes of transport infrastructure (road, rail, air and water) compare and contribute to the competitiveness of East, West, North and Southern geographical blocs; and to identify the shortcomings within the continent regarding cross-border infrastructure integration that slow economic development.
To tackle the request, four different panel regression analyses for the period between 2006 and 2016 were carried out to analyse the effect of each transport mode on FDI over the 11-year time interval. Apart from the twelve pillars of competitiveness, review of literature identified the implementation of liberalised transport policies; socio-political stability; transport infrastructure investments and availability and extent of transport infrastructure as some of the enabling factors that influence the development of transport infrastructure. The aforementioned factors form the conceptual framework of this research.
From the study, it emerged that economic competitiveness of regional blocs in Africa is indeed founded on well-integrated transport infrastructure that connects a bloc’s member countries; as those that ranked highly on the different modes of transport over the years, recorded improvements in their inward FDI. This however was not the case for North Africa, as the trend of FDI development for the region dropped from the years 2007 to 2016 with minimal improvements; but still managed to be the best performing region in terms of transport infrastructure development throughout the years. This is because North Africa as identified from the literatures of the African Development Bank (AfDB, 2010, AfDB, 2016) ranked first among the regional blocs in Africa in transport development; as almost all the countries in the bloc have made tremendous initiatives to upgrade their transport infrastructure network. Also, as observed from this research, the region is seen to demonstrate average to great performances in just about all four transport modes under study. It follows that some of the shortcomings regarding transport infrastructure integration in Africa that were identified from this study include low density and connectivity of roads; insufficient regional railway network; inequality in air transport growth and weak cooperation between air carriers; and underdeveloped inland water and sea port transportation.
This research therefore argues that besides focussing on the best performing transport mode in a region, there should be a balanced development of all four modes of transport considered in this study in order to bring harmony and complementarity of cross-border infrastructure development that enhances transfer of FDI and economic competitiveness of the blocs.","['Foreign Direct Investments', 'transport infrastructure development', 'economic competitiveness', 'regional integration', 'African geographical blocs']"
Migration from developing economies and Greenfield Investment in European regions,"Kumah Tsriku, B.K. (Bright Kosi)",2017-09-01,['Stavropoulos S. (Spyridon)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The reduction in transportation and communication cost coupled with contemporary policy in conformity with global economic trends have led to geographic increases in the movement of people, goods, capital and knowledge across international boundaries. This has led to an increasing number of goods and services the world over. Existing literature indicates that there is a strong positive relationship between migration and FDI investment in the sense that, migrants in destination regions are able to use their networks to influence MNCs to invest in their home countries. This notwithstanding, the migratory rate is increasing steadily while FDI flows into Africa is stable and most often below the rate of migration. African governments have also not been able to place the necessary economic indicators to attracted the needed FDI into specific and most needed sectors of the economy. Migratory policies of most countries in Europe are friendly and welcoming to refugees and other vulnerable groups in society hence the increasing rate.
Other factors such as structural differences, poverty and wage differences were identified as the major factors urging people to migrate. The main research question is to determine the extent immigrates from African countries in Europe use their network to influence greenfield investments in Africa? To this, the research used data from the UN Population Division, World Bank and FDI markets to analyze the data with the help of statistical softwares such as GIS, Excel, and STATA for the analysis.
The research among other things concluded that immigrants from African countries in Europe use their network to influence greenfield investments in their originating countries. The results, however, suggest that, the correlation effect of migration on FDI is positive and that the effect remains significantly positive when adding GDP, total population, number of startup procedures, tax on export goods, cellular usage, inflation on consumer goods, and internet connective. However, this effect disappears when controlling for a number of taxes, days to import goods, forest rents, unemployment, infrastructure index and jobs created.
In conclusion, therefore, the results suggest that, although there some mediating variables that influence migration and FDI, the general relationship between migration and FDI is significant.","['Theories of Migration', 'Migrant Networks', 'Drivers of FDI', 'Drivers of Migration', 'Effects of Migration on FDI']"
"The influence of technical and behaviour factors on prepaid water meter system on revenue collection, a case of Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company, Kafue district.","Bwalya Lesa, F. (Faith)",2017-09-01,['Brilhante O. (Ogenis)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The Prepaid water meter technology is growing at a faster rate especially utilities in Africa who desire to handle challenges of debt recovery and non-payment for the services offered by the utility and ultimately improve the collection of revenue. LusakaWater and Sewerage Company (LWSC) is a state-owned company which oversees provision of water and sewer services to the entire province of Lusaka. The utility was commercialised, to be able to generate revenues to support its operations through user fees as the main source of revenue. However, under the post-paid billing system (fixed and metered), non-payments and debt had increased therefore, the company embarked on Pre-paid Water Meters (PWMs) to improve the revenue collection. The system was implemented in selected residential areas around Lusaka and two districts, namely Chongwe and Kafue, while the rest of the city remained on the Post-payment system. The focal point of this study was Kafue since it had the highest number of PWM consumers. In 2013, the PWMs were installed covering 95% of the total connection of the branch. Some properties which were on fixed charge were captured and 40% of every credit purchase was dedicated to servicing the debt. An improvement in revenue collection was noticed, however collections started dropping since 2015. Some of the challenges revealed were faulty valves, software errors, resulting into meter not shutting once units are depleted, or shutting down completely even with units in the meter, several stuck meters, apparent sales reduction on some properties, intermittent water supply, and customers engaged in meter tampering and vandalism. These factors have adversely affected the operations of the utility. Both technical and behaviour factors help explain the influence of the reduction of revenues collections of the utility.
Based on the challenges afore mentioned, the main objective of this research was to explain the extent to which technical and behaviour factors related to PWM system have influenced the reduction of revenue collection of LWSC in Kafue district. There are many other factors which influence revenue collections, like: tariff, water production capacity. However, the study focused on technical factors which include; valve failures and low pressure in the distribution network while behaviour factors include consumption efficiency and meter tampering. This study is relevant as it informs the decision makers to develop or put in place strategic interventions with a focus on how these factors can be managed to achieve the goal of 100% guarantee of revenue collection. Both equity and planned behaviour theories were used to fully understand how and why the technical and behaviour factors influence revenue.
The study adopted a case study strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative data was collected through primary data using two data instruments interviews and questionnaires. The interviews were semi structured and were administered to representatives from within LWSC who are the experts. While semi closed questionnaires were issued to the water users on PWMs for triangulation. Secondary data was also used for reliability and validity of the research. Purposive sampling and stratified random sampling approach were used in this research. The sample size for questionnaires was not a representative sample size because of time limitations however, the interviews supported the findings. For the interviews, data collected was transcribed and analysed using Atlas. Ti program while for the questionnaires, data was analysed using frequencies of (SPSS) and applied Pearson correlation test and a multiple regression.
According to the main findings; 70% of the valve meters have failed, some customers stopped buying units and become relaxed, some major customers have moved to alternative water source, huge negative balances are abandoned in preference to buying cheap water from neighbours. Reasons found for the failures include; frequent burst pipes, leakages and intermittent water supply. From the findings, these challenges are centred on the dilapidated

water supply infrastructure of the district. Furthermore, inadequacy of technical know-how by prepaid department in the branch, no mechanism to quickly check on the computer to identify the meters dispensing water, lack of materials and poor response to customer complaint are among the reasons of high failure rates of meters . Low water pressure has reduced revenue through valve getting stuck and customers stay for longer hours without consuming especially when burst pipes are being worked on. Lastly, the hours of supply schedule had reduced in some areas. Under behaviour factor, spending and expenditure reduced, however illegalities are high both from internal staff and customers. Illegalities are occurring because of lack of inspection from the utility.
In conclusion, both technical and behaviour factors have strongly influenced the revenue collection. However, technical factors have influence more than behaviour factors. This study recommends LWSC to budget and work on the district water network and intensify physical inspections.","['Prepaid water meters', 'Technical factors', 'Behaviour factors', 'Revenue collection']"
"The Bus Rapid Transit Project in Accra, Ghana","Teko, E. (Edmund)",2017-09-01,['Lah O. (Oliver)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Rapid motorization and growing vehicle ownership are increasingly becoming major contributory factors to traffic congestion experienced in cities around the world, especially in developing countries. This phenomenon has necessitated the need for innovative sustainable solutions that promote public transportation in urban areas. One of such innovations is the development of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems which has gained popularity over the years particularly in Latin America, Asia and gradually in Africa. Whilst some city authorities have been successful in its implementation, others have failed due to financial, political, regulatory and institutional challenges, the latter being the less discussed in literature. In a bid to improve urban mobility in Accra, city authorities in the year 2008, embarked on a BRT Project which was expected to be deployed by 2012. However, almost a decade after its commencement, the project could not be realized as planned; but was launched in 2016 as a Quality Bus Service (QBS) without dedicated bus lanes.
It is against this backdrop that this research sought to explain the institutional factors which affected the implementation of the BRT project in Accra. A qualitative research approach was adopted with a total of 17 interviews conducted with key actors from stakeholder institutions which participated during the implementation of the project. Findings from the study were triangulated with project evaluation reports and scientific articles with theoretical support of the institutional thickness framework. Institutional thickness as employed in this study, comprises of and was measured by the following institutional factors under which the project was implemented: institutional presence, level of interactions, power relations and sense of common agenda. The study made two comparisons; the first was made between a prototype institutional thickness situation developed in this study and institutional conditions that existed during the original phase (2008-2012) and the pilot phase (2013-2016) of implementation. The second compared the state of implementation between the two phases allowing for the explanation of how changes in institutional thickness factors accounted for varying states of implementation.
The study revealed that the institutional thickness during the original phase of the project was relatively lower than in the pilot phase; though the situation in both periods fell short of the proposed model. This research proved that the improved institutional thickness over time accounted for the improved state of implementation in the pilot phase. The study found that the following factors hindered implementation during the original phase of the project: the non-existence of a cross-jurisdictional authority to oversee the urban passenger transport sector in the project area; the lack of ownership arrangements for existing bus operators in the city to belong to the proposed BRT scheme; the distrust among transport operators towards project implementers; and the inadequate capacity of stakeholders in BRT. The improvements made in these aforementioned factors over the periods accounted for the positive progress in implementation during the pilot phase. Considering that all external factors employed in this study remained comparatively similar for both periods, the eventual piloting of the QBS in Accra was therefore possible with the combined effects of enhanced institutional presence, increased level of interactions, improved power relations and a well-sustained sense of common agenda among stakeholders.
The Accra case as revealed in this study showed that executing BRT concurrently with institutional reforms proved to be a risky task; as the distrust among existing transport operators led to a prolonged resistance and opposition to sector reorganization initiatives; hence jeopardized the chances of successful implementation. It is recommended that subsequent BRT initiatives in any city in Ghana should proceed after the reform of the city’s transport sector taking particular interest in establishing a cross-jurisdictional authority if the BRT is to operate across more than one jurisdiction; ensuring part or full ownership of BRT scheme by existing transport operators; building stakeholders’ capacity in BRT prior to actual implementation; and enacting and enforcing urban transport by-laws.","['Bus Rapid Transit', 'Institutional factors', 'Institutional thickness', 'Urban Passenger Transport', 'BRT implementation']"
Environmental assessment of Human Well-being in South Asian and Southeast Asian Countries,"Noor, A. (Ayesha)",2017-09-01,['Stavropoulos S. (Spiros)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Human relationship with their living environment has been major focus of several researchers, government institutions, and individuals. Different disciplines have expressed their solidarity in assessing this relationship through the notion of human well-being. An understanding of well-being of human life has numerous benefits and it is important for developing sustainable environmental policy as ‘’ensuring well-being at all ages’’ is the third goal of sustainable development. Many global institutions developed standard measurement approach to comprehend the well-being-environment relation in context of sustainable development.
The main objective of well-being measurement is to provide objective information about requirements of having satisfied life and how it is affected by availability of financial resources, human-environment congruence, and evaluation of humankind. Therefore, this study measures the relationship among environmental quality indicators, and well-being in SA and SEA for 10 years, from 2006 to 2016. Four major dimensions of environmental quality have been used for this study, which are: environmentally responsible behaviour, rebuilt natural capital, quality of physical environment, and environmental services consumption. The subjective perception of human well-being is developed from satisfaction to life surveyed by GALLUP. Moreover, this research also includes some control variable derived from demographic, economic and social dimensions.
The results showed that dimensions of environmental quality affect well-being only to some extent; being the major outcomes concerning its association are fish consumption and well-being depending on rebuilt natural capital, environmentally responsible human behaviour, and air quality. In particular, the indicator “rebuilt natural capital” (described by the reforested amount of lands), has remained positively significant to the well-being. It infers that if people are aware of their living environment, the responsible human actions towards environment will increase. Also, environmentally responsible human behaviour (described by the use of clean cooking fuel) remained significant with well-being since it contributes to good quality of air. The quality of physical environment was also indicated by air quality, which remains significant to well-being because of the potential reduction of pollutant intake to river water, consequently improving quality of water that contributes to well-being. This air- water quality nexus is explained by acid rain which causes absorption of toxic air pollutant into the soil which then finally drain into the water bodies.
Finally, environmental services consumption was indicated by consumption of fresh fish, was significant as higher consumption of fresh fish can increase human well-being, although it can contribute to ecosystems degradation. However, some adaptive measures and policies taken to protect fish species in several countries of SA and SEA are found to be effective towards minimizing the adverse effect on ecosystem. These adaptation actions including increase in terrestrial protected area, mangrove reforestation, aquaculture are protecting fish species and ensure sustainable consumption of fish and thereby contribute to human well-being.

In summary, the overall findings indicate that interrelationship among environmental quality indicators can improve well-being of human life. In terms of significance, the relationship is well expressed within the nexus linking reforested area, improving quality of air, which significantly impact the accessibility of clean water eventually contributing to human well- being.
The research proposed collaboration among governments of the respective countries of the study area to increase reforested area as well as to encourage use of clean cooking fuel, municipal waste recycling activities, and rooftop rain water harvesting. Furthermore, the study also recommended to mainstreaming the concept of well-being into the national development strategy for achieving ecologically sustainable development since it proved to have impact on countries well-being.","['Environmentally responsible human behaviour', 'Environmental Quality', 'Environmental Services Consumption', 'Human Well-being', 'atmospheric teleconnection']"

"The influence of human and financial resources on the operation and maintenance of storm water drainage systems for reduction of localized urban floods in Nairobi, Kenya","Atieno Osiro, F. (Fiona)",2017-09-01,['Brilhante O. (Ogenis)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Proper management of storm water drainage systems enhance the benefits of flood protection, pollution control and social and environmental protection particularly in urban areas where the community served by the system is larger. This thesis presents the findings on the influence of human and financial resources for operation and maintenance of the storm water drainage system for the reduction of localized urban floods in Nairobi, Kenya. The operation and maintenance of the storm water drainage system in Nairobi lies under the mandate of the Department of Roads, Public Works and Transport and has recently been facing challenges in execution of these duties. This Department falls within the Nairobi City County Government, following devolution of the county governments in Kenya in 2010, and has had challenges pertaining to both human and financial resources to deliver services.
The main aim of the study was to establish how human and financial resources influence operation and maintenance of storm water drainage systems in Nairobi to reduce localized urban flooding. In order to fulfil this, the study was undertaken as a single holistic case study within Nairobi with a focus on two selected areas, that is, Madaraka Estate and Mbagathi/Lang’ata intersection. The study is explanatory in nature and has made use of qualitative data collection and analysis methods in order to give an in-depth understanding of the relationships presented in its objective. 13 questionnaires were administered to staff within the responsible department as a pre-test, which was then followed by 9 interviews to department heads, experts in the fields and employees within disaster response units in order to triangulate the responses given. Furthermore, some of the information collected was verified through review of secondary data in the form of official Department records and documents.
The responses received revealed major shortcomings pertaining to allocation and availability of finances for operation and maintenance of the storm drains as well as a lack of support of the staff in terms of adequacy of staff numbers, skill development and performance monitoring. These are major factors that have affected the efficient performance of the department with respect to management of the storm water drainage system and have resulted in failure of the drainage system to perform adequately from poor maintenance. Further to this, corruption and a slow adjustment to the devolution of government functions has crippled execution of duties.
This research revealed that the lack of financial resources and human resources has affected the successful operation and maintenance of the storm water drainage system in Nairobi and this has exacerbated the problem of localized urban flooding in the Capital City of Kenya.","['Human Resource', 'Financial Resource', 'Operation and Maintenance', 'Reduction of Localized Urban Floods']"
Impact of Urban Design features on Happiness in Rotterdam,"Awadhesh Kumar, A. (Anamika)",2017-09-01,['D’Acci L. (Luca)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This study explains the impact of urban design features on happiness of residents in the neighbourhoods of Rotterdam, on account of subjective and objective measures, and associations with health and social ties. Looking at necessity to understand factors affecting well-being as well as to establish relationship between ‘importance of place and concept of happiness’, the study has intended to recognize remarkable urban design features that help in promoting happiness. The concept of happiness used in the research is self-reported individual ‘overall happiness’ which is combination of ‘how well one feels generally’ (aspect) and ‘how favourable one compares with various standards of success’ (appraisal).
Five urban design features- urban facilities, greenery, public space, transport nodes and mixed use were selected to analyse the relationship with self-reported happiness of the residents. Additionally, objective measures for selected urban design features were taken for all neighbourhoods of Rotterdam from municipality of Rotterdam that is a reliable source while subjective measures were collected only from two neighbourhoods- Cool and Terbregge, of Rotterdam because of constraints on time and resources. Selection of neighbourhood was done on the greater variance in urban design features of the two neighbourhoods. Cool is characterized as mixed land use and presence of physical infrastructure while Terbregge can be termed as sub-urban with abundance of natural elements.
Ordered probit model was used to examine association of urban design features with self- reported happiness. Both, objective and subjective, measures of urban design features were analysed separately to find their significance with happiness. Additionally, Big seven factors for happiness given by Richard Layard were taken as control variables in the modelling. Research statistics showed significance of objective measures of greenery and land use mix with happiness while on account of subjective measures, availability of daily need shops, public spaces and land use mix were relevantly associated with happiness. However, presence of transport nodes in the neighbourhood demonstrated non-significance with happiness on account of both the measures.
The research concluded the importance of urban design features for happiness. The way neighbourhoods are planned and built have relevant impact on well-being of the residents. However, on implications and applicability of specific features of urban design, it demands further investigations and suggests future guidelines for research because of the several limitations of the current study. The study findings also exhibited significance of both the measures of urban design for happiness. Happiness depends on perception as well as real qualities. Moreover, with the exhibition of importance of urban design for happiness, the research corroborated ongoing trend of inclusion of non-pecuniary measures, more specific physical environment, while assessing well-being.","['Happiness', 'Urban Design', 'Land Use Mix', 'Urban Facility', 'Greenery', 'Public Space', 'Transport Nodes']"

Identity Politics in Contested Urban Spaces,"Rajab, L. (Line)",2017-09-01,['Jachnow A. (Alexander)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"In light of the polarisation of international political powers, and with the simultaneous instability this has caused within the context of Lebanese politics, the area of Bab el Tebbaneh and Jabal Mohsen in Tripoli, Lebanon, has witnessed a series of events that have altered its urban fabric, hence shaping its current socio-spatial dynamics. Poverty and tension reign over the neighbourhoods, trapping the residents in a vicious cycle of marginalisation. Identity and historical pasts seem to highly influence the perceptual filter through which the residents of the area view themselves and the world around them, especially through the symbolic projections visible in the urban landscape.
The objective of this research is to deconstruct the elements that justify the existing fractured socio-spatial dynamics, and that are intensifying the tensions on the ground. The aim is to single out the variables that come into play when analysing the interaction between the residents and the space they inhabit. The research therefore questions how identity politics in the area is impacting collective memory and consequently socio-spatial dynamics in Bab el tebbaneh and Jabal Mohsen.
My hypothesis claims that Identity politics (independent variable) is influencing collective memory (dependent variable) through the use of symbolism (intermediate variable), hence affecting socio-spatial dynamics (outcome). A list of indicators and values was respectively developed for each variable in order to filter and analyse the collected data gathered during fieldwork. This research was based solely on the collection and analysis of primary and secondary qualitative data for the sake on analysing this case-study. The fieldwork period consisted of a desk review, mapping and personal observations of the case-study area, and semi-structured interviews with residents, NGO representatives, and Urban extract. The desk research aimed at collecting secondary data from newspaper articles in order to frame the chronological outline of my findings. Personal observations and semi-structured interviews were used to analyse the current socio-spatial dynamics to test the validity of my hypothesis.
Following the data analysis and after evaluating the significance of the variables on the ground, the conclusions that were drawn signalled that identity politics has historically actively participated in shaping collectively memory using symbolism as a main tool. Nonetheless, the direction of my hypothesis was interrupted following the implementation of the security plan in 2014, because residents of both neighbourhoods have broken ties with the influencers of identity politics. Following years of formation, collective memory is now acting as a significant independent variable that is shaping the individual identities of the residents.
The concluding remarks have identified the underlying factors that have enabled my hypothesis to be expressed in space. In fact, poverty, the foreign-backed Lebanese sectarian system, and the regional political history of Lebanon, have provided a nurturing ground for identity conflict in Bab el Tebbaneh and Jabal Mohsen.","['Identity politics', 'symbolism', 'collective memory', 'post-conflict urbanism', 'reconciliation']"
Analysis of resident’s behavior intention of Municipal Solid Waste,"Yuan, H. (Handi)",2017-09-01,['Skinner J. (Julia)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"With the rapid urbanization in China, the municipal solid waste (MSW) in cities has become one of the most important problems needed to be resolved from the city development point of view. Although MSW classification is considered a critical process in waste management, it is not easy to implement it and bring satisfactory performance.
As the main action body of MSW classification, the residents’ participation is significant. Although their environmental attitude and value could not affect the environmental behavior directly, it could put influence on the behavior through the environmental behavior intention. In other words, the behavior intention is an important factor of the behavior. As a result, to improve the resident’s enthusiasm of participating in classification, it is important to dig deep into the main factors that influence people’s MSW classification behavior intention, the effect degree of each factor, and how they put influence on people’s classification behavior intention at household level.
With the residents in Beijing as research targets, this thesis analyzes and identifies factors impacting residents’ behavior intention of MSW classification behavior. The strength of those factors on the behavior intention is also studied, and a theoretical framework about resident’s behavior intention of MSW classification is developed. Based on these analyses and finding, some suggestions are provided for municipal governments to understand the status quo and influencing factors of resident’s behavior intention of MSW classification in Beijing. The main contents and results of this study are as follows:
1. Based on the literature review, considering the reality of Beijing, this thesis develops a theoretical framework of residents’ behavior intention for MSW classification in Beijing with the Theory of Planned Behavior, Infrastructure-Service-Behavior model as well as Environmental Behavior theory as theoretical basis. According to the theoretical framework, those factors, as main research variables are identified that have close relationship with residents’ behavior of MSW classification, that is, phycological variables, situational factors and environmental factors.
2. Based on the theoretical framework of residents’ behavior of MSW classification in Beijing, this thesis develops a questionnaire which includes all the variables mentioned above. By the means of random sampling, this thesis tests the reliability and validity of the questionnaire which confirm that the data are suitable for statistic analysis.
3. This thesis analyzes the relationships between behavior intention and the relevant factors systematically by means of the empirical research method. Statistic results show that the psychological and situational variables have influence on behavior intention, well the environmental variables have no influence on it.
This thesis reveals the relationship between residents’ behavior intention of MSW classification in Beijing and it relevant factors, which provides an analysis tool and

"The Influence of place attachment to the
mobility patterns of urban island communities
in the context of climate change","Macalandag, E.V. (Edeliza Velasco)",2017-09-01,['Eerd M. van (Maartje)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The need for better understanding of the mobility characteristics of climate-sensitive populations comes with the growing shift in the treatment of human movement not just as an inevitability driven by climate change vulnerability but as a climate adaptation strategy.
This study deviates from the go-to economic factors in both adaptation and mobility, instead examines an emotional mobility driver – place attachment, or the bond of people to a place of meaning, utility and familial connection (Altman & Low 1992; Hidalgo & Hernandez 2001). Often exhibited in a person’s preference to be in or near a place of affinity and affection, the presence of place attachment is extracted and measured in this study by way of its three dimensions of symbolism (place identity), functionality (place dependence), and temporality (place rootedness) – and see if this has any influence in the mobility patterns of small urban island communities exposed to climate change.
Inspired from the adaptive mobility actions set by tiny atoll communities in the Pacific, the most climate-vulnerable communities in the world yet among the most proactive climate adaptors, this study looks into the similar climate-sensitive and development-marginalized low-lying densely populated small island urban and peri-urban island communities in the Danajon Bank in central Philippines, and examines the influence of place attachment to their mobility patterns.
Ultimately, this study – in seeking to determine the influence of place attachment to human mobility in the light of its recent prescription as an adaptive response to climate change – extracts for immobility tendencies in vulnerable communities which could lead to maladaptive mobility choices.
The research locale is Pangan-an Island (population: 2,070, as of 2015), an urban island barangay belonging to the highly urbanized city (HUC) of Lapu-Lapu (population: 408,112, as of 2015), Cebu province, in the Philippines.
Using the survey research design, the survey questionnaire was the primary quantitative data collection methodology, supported by qualitative semi-structured interviews with experts and key informants from the community. The research sought to independently determine the level of place attachment, mobility characteristics, climate change risk perception among the study sample and then test for the statistical influence of place attachment to the mobility patterns of Pangan-an residents. The cofounding impact of climate change risk perception to the two key concepts is also examined.
The findings of the study reveal that the people of Pangan-an is brimming with moderately strong place attachment. Among the three place attachment dimensions, place rootedness is the strongest. Place identity was professed to be strong but was not matched with strong place care practices. Their utilitarian satisfaction to place, is found to be moderate, corresponding to the moderate level of social satisfaction. Their strong residential satisfaction despite the absence of most public utilities while an aberration is corroborated with other studies which found high satisfaction even in deprived neighborhoods.
As for their mobility characteristics, they lean towards immobility, as derived from their low movement cycles, lack of desire for resettlement, as well as their low capacity for movement. Further, the immobile among their population are more attached to the place. Their place

attachment – formed by strong familial roots to place, and their middling self-identification and sense of contentment towards their community – tested as a negative influence to their mobility.
However, the climate change risk perception among the Pangan-an Island residents resulted in negligible effect size on both the place attachment and mobility patterns of the Pangan-an community. But despite that, plus the weak effect size of place attachment to mobility, still, these emotional and psychological traits in individuals and communities should be considered alongside the other mainstream factors in community-based climate change adaption and mitigation (CCAM) policy and actions.
The Pangan-an Island residents may be deprived and underprivileged but they are well-adjusted and fairly satisfied, and have little capacity nor the desire to move – and this propensity for immobility, as revealed in this study, is also spurred by their deep affections for their close-knit island culture, people and place – these are all admirable qualities of a community setting their own course, a romantic notion of self-determination. But, in the light of increasing climate change impacts particular to low-lying small islands such as coastal erosion and inundation, deep anchorage, is cause for alarm.
There are non-economic intangible psychosocial and place-based aspects in a community’s mobility choices and these factors must be weighed in and integrated into the national, local and community-based climate adaptive mobility policy, planning and action.","['place attachment', 'climate displacement', 'climate mobility', 'trapped populations', 'urban islands']"

"Factors influencing land circulation in urban villages, through the cases of Beijing",,2017-09-01,,Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"There are many urban villages in Beijing, which disorders the planning of the whole city and the construction of infrastructure. The government is studying on how to implement different policies to redevelop them, and the land circulation is closely relative to the mode of redevelopment. The main objective of the research is to test whether land circulation is more widespread in urban villages in the centre of city than those in the suburbs. This research chooses the combination strategy of survey and case study. Questionnaires and interviews are done in an urban village in the centre of city and one in the suburb. T-test is used to analyse the difference in land circulation in these two villages, and logistic model is used to explore the relationship between urban village and land circulation. Conclusions are drawn as follows. Firstly, villagers in Huairou Town (in the suburb) may depend more on agriculture, and their income is less than income in Xibeiwang (in the centre of city) Town. At the same time, their comprehension and acceptance of policy are similar. Secondly, area of land flowing out and the percentage of people who have transferred their land under use rights in Xibeiwang Town is more than those in Huairou Town. Thirdly, men, elderly people, villagers with higher education level and income may be more active and willing to participate in land circulation. Age, education level, part-time job and insurance seem to have a positive relationship with the area of land flowing out. The effects on inflow of land are in reverse. However, the influence of another variable perception is confusing. The acceptance of laws/regulation tends to have the negative effects, while the effect of comprehension of policy, acceptance of pricing mechanism and management of transaction is positive. At last, cases from interviews are clarified into six types. Three reasons for inflow are low price of land use right, help of government and economies of scales, and three reasons for outflow are benefits from transfer, lack of labours in household and higher income of other jobs.","['Urban village', 'land circulation', 'land use right', 'logistic model', 'willingness']"
Road Safety in Prishtina,Yulia,2017-09-01,['Zuijderwijk L. (Linda)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Prishtina is the capital city of Kosovo, the youngest country in Europe, who declared its independence in 2008. Before its independence, Kosovo is an autonomous province under Serbia, which was part of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). Kosovo has a long history of conflicts since the occupation of Turkish Ottoman Empire in Balkan Peninsula area until the recent one was the Kosova War in 1998 – 1999. As a post-conflict society, Prishtina is suffering from several urban challenges. One of these challenges is road safety issue indicated by increasing the number of traffic accidents in Prishtina and even nationwide. National government considered this situation as unusual for European countries.
This study aimed to answer a research question on how the road safety is perceived from two main perspectives, which are road users (pedestrians and cyclists) and stakeholders in the producer’s level of road safety strategy in Prishtina. This study was conducted in urban zone of Prishtina, which is also the case study, with the regards to the increasing number of traffic accidents, which involve pedestrians and cyclists, as the vulnerable road users. Moreover, this research is driven from the importance of taking road users’ perspective, especially their everyday experiences, into account in planning, designing, and implementing a road safety strategy towards the effort to reduce the number of traffic accidents in Prishtina and in Kosovo in general. Road users’ everyday experiences are important to acknowledge in order to get a comprehensive understanding of what actually happened on the ground in term of road safety issues. This perspective, even tough is important, is often neglected by stakeholders in producer’s level, especially in the context of post-conflict society, like Kosovo, where a strategy appear to be an utopia because it does not touch the real problem.
This thesis is used case study as the research strategy and rapid ethnographic assessment as the research methodology. Through a thick description as main characteristic of this study, it can be learned that road safety is perceived in almost a similar manner by road users and producers. This fact is on the contrary with academic literatures, which mentioned that road users and producers perceive road safety in various way, especially road users due to their diverse characteristics, such as age, gender, disability or handicap, companions, and education level. Findings show that young and adult pedestrians perceive road safety in slightly similar manner, except for elderly pedestrians. Both producers and road users perceive behaviour of other road users, with emphasise on car drivers’ behaviours, as the main element that influence their road safety perception. In addition, probability of traffic accident occurrences dominates how road users and producers measure road safety. However, among all similarities between road users’ and producers’ perspective upon road safety. How the road safety perception is developed highlights a difference between these two perspectives. Producers use quantitative statistic data as a basis of their road safety perception development, meanwhile social value that lives among the society serves as the foundation of road users’ road safety perception. In conclusion, this case study gives a remark that behaviours of traffic is driven from road safety perception, which depends on other road users’ behaviours on traffic.","['Road safety', 'Prishtina', 'Kosova', 'Perception of road safety', 'User’s perspective', 'Stakeholder’s perspective', 'Pedestrians and cyclists', 'Urban mobility', 'Urban everyday life']"
"The potential of youth participation in Pristina, Kosovo","Ton le, H. (Hoang)",2017-09-01,['Zuijderwijk L. (Linda)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"It is increasingly recognizing youth as a primary stakeholder group in the planning field and the topic of young people participation has become common during last decades. There is a number of studies providing the contribution of young people and requiring the engagement of them in the urban planning process. However, the understanding of youth participation is still limited in practice and the traditional planning has neglected the role of young people as an essential part of its process. As a result, it remains the challenge to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical approaches.
The study endeavors explaining the impact of young people on participatory activities in the community development at the neighborhood level in Pristina, Kosovo. The central purpose of the study is to recognize the potential of youth participation in the decision-making process, particularly in public spaces projects. The main motivator to choose Pristina is because of the reconstruction process with an emergent acting from the whole population in which the proportion of young people is the highest in Kosovo. Moreover, the paper aims to pave the way for building a study regarding the practice of youth participation and focusing on the impacts of them on the community development in Pristina.
The research carried out two homogenous case studies of public space projects in Pristina with the qualitative methodology. In those cases, it investigated young participants aged 7-18 by applying three methods: interview, observation, and secondary analysis in order to collect qualitative data from interactions with youth. The fieldwork lasted more than one month from July to August 2017 in Pristina, Kosovo.
The result of the research provided the explanations how youth participation affects the public space projects via internal and external factors. Analysis indicated that the internal factor combined capacities of young people that the planning process requires: having interest in participating, technical skills, and communicative skills.

FDI and Rising Inequality,"Tamang, T. (Tenzin)",2017-09-01,['Kaur R. (Rupinder)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Globalisation facilitated economic integration of countries across borders to devise means and sources to fund activities to realize economic growth. And with the free flow of investments in the last decade, developing regions like South Asia displayed a consistent economic performance with substantial progress on the economic front. But despite South Asia’s rapid economic growth, issues of inequality has become a top concern for the region. Studies have highlighted the occurrence of huge gaps between the wealthy and the poor in this region. Also, inequality in wealth distribution is one dimension of the inequality concern in South Asia. Other issues of disparity relating to gender are on the rise likewise. Many research claims that globalisation and its key components like FDI might have fuelled income inequality and have also affected men and women differently creating gender imbalances in the labour market for employment, wage and other opportunities.
As the countries in South Asia continue to liberalise policies to attract more and more FDI for economic gains, it was felt essential to study the relationship between FDI and inequality both from an academic and policy perspective. Many researchers have studied the impacts of FDI on inequality but the studies are mostly focused on the inequality of outcomes like income or wage inequality. The findings of the FDI and income inequality relationship is heterogeneous with diverse results in different locations and the link between FDI and inequality of opportunity is little explored. As growing inequality may also lead to reduced growth, political instability and social disharmony. The research aims to evaluate the impacts of FDI inflow on both income inequality (inequality of outcome) and gender inequality (inequality of opportunity) to explain the relationship between FDI inflow and inequality as a whole in South Asia (2005-2015).
The research studied the impacts of FDI and income inequality at a country level using Gini index and UNDP’s inequality in income (%) as a measure of income inequality. The FDI and gender inequality (in employment) were deliberated at a country and a sectoral level (agriculture, industry, and service). A set of panel regressions with and without interaction terms were performed to evaluate the relationship. The outcome indicated that both the FDI-income and FDI-gender inequality relationship is a moderated causal relationship. The results suggested that the impacts of FDI on income inequality in South Asia were significant only when moderated by human capital. The moderating factors of the FDI inflow and gender inequality relationship were found to be varying across sectors.
The research also finds that the income inequality situation in South Asia remains varied in the period with some countries have experienced a drop in income inequality and others have witnessed a rise. The findings of the gender inequality situation in South Asia is shocking. It discloses that the female employment in South Asia experienced a moderate drop in the period indicating that despite South Asia’s economic growth, gender inequality is gradually escalating in the labour market. A sectoral shift in female employment is observed with the agriculture sector witnessed a drop in female employment and the industry and service sector have experienced a gradual growth. But all the three sectors (Agriculture, industry, and service) in South Asia have experienced a rise in men employment (%) and a fall in the female employment (%) in the period (2005 to 2015). From the findings of the study, it appears that globalisation might have marginalized the role of women in the labour market.","['Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)', 'income inequality', 'gender inequality', 'moderating factor', 'absorption capacity', 'moderated causal relationship']"

The effectiveness of direct comparative advertisements for supermarkets and brands in a Facebook setting,"Verdiesen, E.",2017-08-30,['Opree S.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The present research examines the effectiveness of comparative advertisements for different type of segment supermarkets and brands in a social media setting. The hierarchy-of-effects model was used in this research to define the concept of effectiveness. According to this model effectiveness can be measured as increased awareness, knowledge, liking, preference, conviction, and/or purchase intention. In this research, purchase intention was excluded because the actual buying of a product was not measurable. In terms of methodology, an 2-by-2 between subjects online experiment was conducted. The effectiveness of comparative advertisements from high and low segment supermarkets (i.e., Albert Heijn and Aldi) with high and low segment brands (i.e., Calvé and own label) were compared to each other. The statistical population included a total of 131 respondents, consisting of 41 men with an average age of 35.49 and 90 women with an average age of 31.09 years old. The data was analyzed by using SPSS24, conducting chi-square tests for independence (with Yates’ Continuity Correction) and one-way between-groups analyses of variance with Tukey HSD and post-hoc comparisons (ANOVAs). The results of the research showed that there was little evidence for a difference in effectiveness in the combinations of high or low segment stores and high or low segment brands using direct comparative advertising in a social media setting. For the components awareness, knowledge, advertisement likeability, store likeability and conviction there was no difference found. However, a difference was found for brand likeability and preference. The respondents’ likeability of the brand was higher for the high segment brand than for the low segment brand. Lastly, respondents preferred the high segment store and the high segment brand over the low segment store and the low segment brand. The findings of this research can give an insight in the field of comparative
advertisement in the Netherlands in a social media context. More specifically, these findings can advise both high and low segment supermarkets on what type of segment brand they can use best in a comparative advertisement on social media.","['media', 'business', 'Direct comparative advertisement', 'Social media', 'Low vs. High segment supermarket', 'Low vs. high segment brand', 'Effectiveness', 'Hierarchy-of-effects model']"
"“De poortwachters van het partijkartel”
Een studie naar de media-aandacht voor nieuwe politieke
partijen tijdens de verkiezingscampagne van 2017",T. de Peuter,2017-08-28,['C. Aalberts'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Op 15 maart 2017 hebben de Nederlandse kiezers een gang naar de stembus gemaakt voor de
Tweede Kamerverkiezingen. Deze verkiezingen werden gekenmerkt door deelname van een groot
aantal nieuwe partijen. Van deze nieuwe partijen behaalden alleen Forum voor Democratie(FvD) en
DENK voldoende zetels om in de Tweede Kamer terecht te komen. Media spelen een belangrijke
informatieve rol tijdens verkiezingen, omdat ze de burger informeren waar ze op kunnen stemmen.
Media-aandacht gedurende de verkiezingscampagne wordt dan ook gezien als een belangrijke pijler
van electoraal succes. Volgens de klassieke democratische visie zouden alle deelnemende partijen in
gelijke mate belicht moeten worden, zodat de kiezer een goede afweging kan maken bij de stembus.
Daarom is het relevant om inzicht te krijgen in de mate van aandacht die deze nieuwe partijen
hebben gekregen van de grote media tijdens de campagneperiode. Deze studie onderzoekt door
middel van een kwantitatieve analyse de hoeveelheid media-aandacht die nieuwe partijen kregen
tijdens de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 15 maart 2017. Daarnaast wordt via kwalitatieve interviews
inzicht gegeven in het perspectief van de journalist. De studie richt zich zowel op media-aandacht
voor de partij als voor de partijleider.
Uit de resultaten van deze studie kan de conclusie worden getrokken dat ook bij nieuwe
politieke partijen de campagneberichtgeving zich toespitst op een selecte groep van partijen en dat
media sommige lijsttrekkers interessanter vinden dan de partij erachter. Opvallend is dat nieuwe
partijen die als afsplitsing in de Kamer zitten een voorsprong hebben op de rest van de partijen zoals
bij deze verkiezingen het geval was met DENK, de partij die verreweg de meeste aandacht heeft
ontvangen. De manier echter waarop partijen en lijsttrekkers zichzelf vervolgens presenteren in de
campagne, kan volgens journalisten elke partij maken of breken. Daarbij gaat de minste aandacht uit
naar de politiek-inhoudelijke aspecten van de partijen. Journalisten herkennen zich niet in deze
constatering en volgens hen is dit zowel vanuit de politiek als vanuit de media bezien een van de
inhoudelijkste verkiezingscampagnes die er de afgelopen jaren is geweest. Tot slot geven journalisten
aan dat het ze er weleens naast zitten in hun selectiecriteria en dat de opkomst van een partij als FvD
een totale verrassing was. Daarmee roept dit onderzoek niet alleen de vraag op of journalisten
überhaupt capabel zijn om het kiezerspotentieel van partijen in te schatten maar ook of de
traditionele media nog wel de belangrijkste bemiddelaar zijn tussen politici en de burger.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'nieuwe partijen', 'media-aandacht', 'kleine partijen', 'verkiezingen', 'nieuwswaarden']"

Of met andere woorden: is het mogelijk om als architect moreel verantwoordelijk te handelen, terwijl misschien de processen die door dat handelen op gang worden gebracht, contingent zijn? Aan de hand van het gedachtegoed van Bruno Latour probeer ik dichter bij de kern van deze vraag te komen. Als socioloog-filosoof is Latour een pionier (geweest) in het beschrijven van en gewicht geven aan de dingen, bijvoorbeeld aan de zielloze apparaten van onze tijd. Hij laat ons daarbij zien dat je de kluwens van de complexe processen of problemen kunt ontrafelen en kunt beschrijven aan de hand van de actor-netwerk theorie.

Ethical Know-How and the Ethical World,Thijs Heijmeskamp,2017-08-12,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Morality pervades the entirety of human life, by structuring our thoughts, feelings and behaviour. It is a subject that has occupied philosophers since the days of classical antiquity. Currently, ethics captures the interests of not only the philosophers, but also scientists working within the cognitive sciences. This has led to a fruitful and interesting dialogue between disciplines. Traditionally, a moral agent is generally understood as someone who acts on the basis of moral reasons and is in conscious control of his action. However, those working the cognitive have challenged this traditional view on moral agency. The subject of this thesis concerns how we should understand moral agency in light of these challenges. In this thesis, I show that underlying this traditional view are certain assumptions that are not supported by evidence form moral psychology and the neurosciences. Furthermore, I argue that an alternative conception of moral agency is possible. I try to show this by sketching an embodied, situated account of moral agency, based on insights form the enactivist approach. In this view ethics should be conceptualised as a skilful interaction and the application of ethical know-how.",
Expending the social scope of Project Portfolio-Management.,"Latuheru, R.",2017-08-07,"['prof.dr. F Koster', 'prof.dr. RJ van der Veen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This paper aims at expanding the scope on the implementation of project portfolio-management (PPM) in organizations by taking into account social factors that enable projects to escalate in terms of time and resources. Previous studies tend to focus on the rational and systematic aspects of implementing PPM. The social aspects that influence this process are underrepresented. This research is contributing to the current debate by elaborating on the social mechanisms and factors that contribute to the implementation of PPM. Factors that contribute to the failure of PPM are derived from the escalation of commitment mechanisms and include issues as unconscious denial, sunk costs and self-justification. Concurrently, the factors that contribute to the success of PPM are mechanisms derived from escalation prevention potential mechanisms, like stating clear goals, have a clear process and the right ability. Using a qualitative approach, 39 respondents were interviewed from 13 organizations in the Netherlands. The analysis showed that a distinction should be made between public and private organizations. Public organizations that are implementing PPM experience more escalating projects compared to private organizations. We argue that without stating clear organizational goals, the process and the ability will have an unstable foundation and the organization and its projects will be more prone to escalation.","['project portfolio-management', 'escalation of commitment', 'escalation prevention potential', 'PPM']"
Gezond door vrijwilligerswerk?,"Joosse, R.",2017-08-07,"['prof.dr. PA Dykstra', 'prof.dr. R Keizer']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Vrijwilligerswerk kan maatschappelijke problemen in de samenleving verminderen maar ook gezondheidsvoordeel voor de vrijwilliger zelf opleveren. Door middel van kwalitatief onderzoek in de vorm van diepte-interviews is onderzocht in hoeverre de vrijwilligers van Resto VanHarte een bijdrage van vrijwilligerswerk aan hun psychosociale gezondheid ervaren en welke mechanismen hieraan ten grondslag liggen. Uit de bevindingen komen drie patronen naar voren hoe respondenten zelf hun psychosociale gezondheid ervaren als gevolg van vrijwilligerswerk: positieve verandering, geen verandering en een negatieve verandering. Ondanks dat niet alle respondenten zelf de bijdrage van vrijwilligerswerk op hun gezondheid lijken te herkennen benoemen zij wel allemaal gezondheidsbevorderende ervaringen. Deze ervaringen zijn deels te plaatsen binnen de mechanismen die uit de literatuur naar voren komen, namelijk ‘sociale bronnen’ en ‘rolidentiteit’. Daarnaast komt naar voren dat ‘afleiding’ en ‘toename van zelfvertrouwen’ ook ten grondslag zouden kunnen liggen aan de relatie tussen vrijwilligerswerk en de psychosociale gezondheid. Meer onderzoek naar deze twee potentiële mechanismen is nodig in de toekomst. De bevindingen van dit onderzoek moeten worden bekeken in het licht van selectie. De respondenten zijn een selecte groep die veel overeenkomstige kenmerken vertonen (alleenstaand, werkloos, laagopgeleid en gezondheidsklachten).

Etnische diversiteit en mentaal welzijn,"Meer, L. van der",2017-08-07,"['JJ ten Kate', 'dr. J van der Waal']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The relationship between ethnic diversity on context level and mental well-being has so far been scarcely studied. Even when it has been studied, no effect is found. Two reasons can be suggested for the lack of an effect: ethnic diversity can be subdivided into several aspects and the relationships between ethnic diversity and mental well-being works differently for social groups in the society. This study takes these two factors into account. Based on a multilevel regression analysis of ESS- and OECD-data, the effect of ethnic diversity on mental well-being is studied in 16 countries (N = 5409). Two perspectives of ethnic diversity are being explored: the economic and cultural perspective. Based on the percentage of lower educated migrants or the percentage of non-Western migrants in a country, it is assessed whether there is a negative effect on mental well-being. In addition, it is examined whether the level of education effects this connection. Explanations for a possible negative interaction effect of education are sought in the degree of job insecurity or ethnocentrism of an individual. Contrary to the expectations, the results make it clear that individuals with a higher educational level have a more negative mental well-being when a country is ethnically more diverse. One explanation for this may be that individuals with a higher educational level are less in contact with migrants. Future research can emphasize neighborhood-level diversity to see how much group contact there is between natives and migrants.","['ethnic diversity', 'mental well-being', 'social groups', 'education', 'job security', 'ethnocentrism', 'economic context', 'cultural context']"

PM Karré']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In de gemeente Den Haag is inductief onderzoek gedaan naar motieven en perspectieven om vrijwillig actief te worden op het gebied van integratie van statushouders. Beleidsmedewerkers zijn geïnterviewd voor achtergrondinformatie. Door middel van interviews met vrijwilligers van twee vrijwilligersinitiatieven binnen de gemeente Den Haag, zijn twee verschillende handelingsperspectieven zichtbaar geworden die diversiteit in hulp aan statushouders belichten. Ten eerste, het empowermentperspectief, waarbij vrijwilligers statushouders onvoorwaardelijk onafhankelijk willen maken. Bij dit handelingsperspectief wordt zo snel mogelijk zelfstandigheid gecreëerd in de, voor statushouders, nieuwe samenleving. Dit perspectief sluit aan op de beleidsvoering van de gemeente Den Haag om te streven naar zelfstandigheid. Ten tweede, het voorwaardelijkheidsperspectief, waarbij vrijwilligers bereid zijn statushouders bij te staan, maar daarvoor iets terug verwachten. Een voorbeeld hiervan is dat de statushouder zich volledig toewijdt aan de integratie. Vrijwilligers die vanuit dit perspectief opereren zijn kritisch ten aanzien van het gevoerde beleid, vanwege de prioritering van de gemeente om eerst statushouders te helpen en daarna pas de autochtone burgers. Op basis van dit onderzoek wordt geconcludeerd dat beide handelingsperspectieven het product zijn van standpunten, ervaringen en processen op verschillende gebieden. Vrijwilligers zijn gedreven in hun werk vanuit een combinatie van verschillende motieven, namelijk als tegenbeweging van de negatieve beeldvorming ten aanzien van statushouders, ervaring met het wonen in het buitenland en persoonlijke doelstellingen. Zelfs wanneer men negatieve en/of bedreigende reacties ervaart naar aanleiding van het vrijwilligerswerk, wordt men niet weerhouden van de ondersteuning van statushouders in Den Haag. Het gebrek aan kennis in beleidskringen over ervaringen van vrijwilligers in de praktijk is onwenselijk, daarom volgt als aanbeveling onderzoek te doen naar de manier waarop overheden vrijwilligers kunnen stimuleren voor het doen van vrijwilligerswerk om zo toekomstige problemen en uitdagingen voor te zijn.","['Den Haag', 'Integratieproces', 'Statushouders', 'Vrijwilligers(initiatieven)', 'Vrijwilligerswerk']"

De analyse van dit onderzoek heeft zich conform de theorie van framing gericht op taal, hetgeen bijdraagt aan het creëren van een ‘werkelijkheid’. Allereerst zijn van de geselecteerde media de beschikbare data gecodeerd en getranscribeerd. Deze is vervolgens in categorieën uiteengezet, om op een inductieve manier achter frames te komen. Uit de analyse van data zijn drie frames gekomen. Allereerst is dit het frame culturele polarisatie, waarin een gepolariseerde samenleving nadrukkelijk in groepen uiteen wordt gezet. De tweede frame onafhankelijke machten in gevaar uit zich in de discussie over een politiek proces en de rechtmatigheid van het proces. Daarnaast komt dit frame ook tot uiting in de rol die media als actor spelen door politici te bevragen over de rechtszaak. Het derde frame botsende grondrechten vloeit voort uit de discussie over de reikwijdte van vrijheid van meningsuiting en wanneer er sprake is van discriminatie. Deze studie concludeert dat alle drie de frames direct bijdragen aan populisme voor de media en indirect bijdragen aan populisme door de media.","['framing', 'traditionele media', 'culturele polarisatie', 'botsende grondrechten', 'onafhankelijkheid van machten']"

Collectivist cultures are on the other hand characterized by strong social bonds between people, which is a reason to expect the mental health gap to be smaller in these countries. Using the sixth and seventh round of the European Social Survey (n = 64547, nested in 21 countries) and separate data from Eurostat and Hofstede, multilevel analysis were conducted.

Poolse migranten zijn momenteel de grootste groep nieuwkomers in Nederland en hebben vanuit hun thuisland sterke normen aangaande verplichtingen naar ouders. Om te toetsen of deze normen van Poolse migranten verschillen met inwoners van Polen en Nederland is een vergelijking gemaakt tussen het Gender and Generation survey (GGS) in Polen en Nederland en het Families of Poles in the Netherlands survey (FPN). Middels een multivariate regressieanalyse zijn deze datasets vergeleken, daarnaast is getoetst hoe migratie gerelateerde factoren een mogelijke verklaring geven voor de verwachte verschillen in normen. Vanuit de resultaten komt naar voren dat normen aangaande verplichtingen naar ouders van Poolse migranten minder sterk zijn, dan de normen van inwoners van Polen en sterker zijn dan de normen van inwoners van Nederland. Echter, komen de normen van Poolse migranten meer overeen met de Poolse dan met de Nederlandse normen aangaande verplichtingen naar ouders. Met betrekking tot de rol van de migratie gerelateerde factoren laten de resultaten zien dat hoe beter de Poolse migranten de Nederlandse taal spreken, hoe minder sterk hun normen aangaande verplichtingen naar ouders zijn. Daarnaast is de nationaliteit van de partner van invloed: Poolse migranten met een Nederlandse partner hebben minder sterke normen aangaande verplichtingen naar ouders, dan personen met een Poolse partner.","['migratie gerelateerde factoren', 'multivariate analyse', 'Nederland', 'normen aangaande verplichtingen naar ouders', 'Poolse migranten']"

Enerzijds blijken de belemmeringen te maken te hebben met individuele factoren. Zo beschikken de studenten over een minder effectief netwerk en kampen zij met een taalachterstand. Daarbij hebben zij tevens het gevoel gestereotypeerd te worden vanwege hun etniciteit. Echter, blijkt dat studenten ook enigszins onderscheid maken op basis van etniciteit. Anderzijds blijkt dat studenten ervaren dat er onvoldoende rekening gehouden wordt met diversiteit. Dit ervaren zij bijvoorbeeld in het docentenbestand en de wijze waarop docenten hen benaderen, maar ook in de studieverenigingen. Het gaat dus om een samenspel van individuele en institutionele factoren. Daarom trachten diversiteitsmedewerkers bewustwording omtrent diversiteit te creëren en om succesvolle initiatieven die studenten met een niet-westerse migratieachtergrond helpen hun studieprestaties te verbeteren, te bestuderen. Dit blijkt van essentieel belang, aangezien blijkt dat de huidige initiatieven niet helemaal aansluiten op de studiebehoeften van deze studenten.

Uit de analyse blijkt dat er een significant verschil is tussen mannelijke en vrouwelijke leden van de raad van bestuur op de eerste dimensionele as. De vrouwelijke leden van de raad van bestuur beschikken gemiddeld over meer opleidingskapitaal, meer carrièrekapitaal en meer sociaal kapitaal dan de mannelijke leden. Dit suggereert dat vrouwen over een bovengemiddelde mate van kapitaal moeten beschikken in vergelijking met hun mannelijke concurrenten, om voor  eenzelfde bestuursfunctie in aanmerking te komen.

Beide groepen komen in het dagelijks leven nauwelijks met elkaar in contact. Toch moeten deze groepen op de arbeidsmarkt soms samenwerken, bijvoorbeeld binnen gemixte teams. In dit onderzoek wordt de beleving van deze samenwerking binnen dergelijke gemixte teams onderzocht. De onderzoekssetting is het bedrijf FinancePoint, waar veel gemixte teams werkzaam zijn. De beleving van samenwerking kan worden geëvalueerd op basis van enkele factoren. Deze factoren kunnen tevens een rol spelen in het contact dat hoog- en laagopgeleiden, zowel binnen als buiten de werktijden, met elkaar hebben. De aanwezigheid van deze factoren wordt onderzocht met behulp van enquêtes en semigestructureerde interviews. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de samenwerking binnen de gemixte teams van FinancePoint als succesvol wordt ervaren, mits aan de voorwaarden van Allport (1954) wordt voldaan, en men ook een gemeenschappelijke groepsidentiteit ervaart.

Dit laatste speelt mogelijk een rol bij het ontstaan van een gemixte sociale kring.","['Arbeidsmarkt', 'Contact', 'Gemeenschappelijke Groepsidentiteit', 'Opleidingsniveau', 'Samenwerking']"
De Zinledigheid van de Moderne Mens,Joy Dijksman,2017-08-03,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Depressie lijkt de belangrijkste paradox van de moderne tijd: de westerse mens heeft het nog nooit zo goed gehad maar toch verliest hij zich in negatieve gevoelens van pijn, verlies en angst. Dit gevoel van zinledigheid wordt vaak onderzocht als een individueel, psychologisch kenmerk en is de laatste decennia vooral een medische aandoening geworden. In deze these wordt de moderne depressie benaderd vanuit een cultuurfilosofisch perspectief. Er wordt gezocht naar de historische en filosofische context die vormend is geweest voor het onvermogen van de moderne mens om betekenis te verlenen aan de wereld om hem heen. Een onderzoeking van de ideeëngeschiedenis van Charles Taylor; het verband tussen identiteit, zingeving en het goede; en het neoliberalisme, zal aantonen wat de moderne mens ervan weerhoudt een zinvol leven te leiden.",
Omvormingen van het sociaal contract,Rosalie Ekstein,2017-08-02,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"During history, multiple techniques for social control have been deployed. These techniques were often pragmatic in character. Hobbes wrote in his Leviathan that a society without such control was doomed to result in ‘a war of all against all’ (Hobbes, 2010). Foucault later showed how surveillance techniques discipline society increasingly, in the process transforming individuals into objects of research, which then can be compared with a societal norm (Foucault, 2010). Today, a similar case can be recognised in the process of the re-examination of the ‘Wajonger’. These individuals either have physical and/or mental disabilities and must find new ways to comply to new standards regarding participation in society. The Dutch Social Security Agency (UWV) deploys new surveillance techniques in order to discipline these individuals and hence reduces them to objects of research.",

"Media Habits of Immigrants:
TV Viewing Habits of Immigrants in Rotterdam",S. Gitman,2017-07-09,['J. Spence'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Rotterdam is one of the most multicultural cities of the Netherlands. People from 175
nationalities live in this city (City of Rotterdam, 2016). Immigrants form a substantial part of the
population in Rotterdam (CBS, 2017). Within the media field, immigrants are a large consumer
group (Bink, 2002; CBS, 2017; Butter and Önce, 2010). However, the media needs of
immigrants can vary significantly: Because of their diverse cultural backgrounds what
immigrants expect from media can differ from the expectations of local people (Anjum &
Michele, 2014; Bakoy, 2006; Bink, 2002; Butter and Önce, 2010; Sun & Sinclair, 2014).
Therefore, to provide appropriate media content, it is important to understand the media
consumption of immigrants more deeply. Additionally, studies on media habits can help form an
understanding of the dynamics of acculturation and assist with the integration process into
society (Walker, 1999; Reichenberg, 2016).
This thesis aims to investigate the media consumption of immigrants living in Rotterdam,
to be precise, their TV viewing habits. The research question set for this study is as follows:
What are the media consumption habits of immigrants in Rotterdam while watching television
via cable, IP-TV, satellite and the Internet?
Moreover, there are two main directions for this research. The first one seeks to
understand what the devices are mainly used by immigrants living in Rotterdam to access TV
content. The second direction aims to investigate what the main goals pursued by immigrants
living in Rotterdam when watching Dutch TV content and TV content produced in their country
of origin. In order to gather the information needed, a survey was conducted (n=570). The
analysis of the data was performed by means of frequency tables. The study considered a subset
of six ethnic groups living in the Rotterdam: African, Asian, Eastern European, EU, Islamic and
Latin American immigrants (n=494). Each of these ethnic group includes first-, second- and
third- generation immigrants.
The results of this study show that the dominant means used to access TV content are
laptop/ notebook/ netbook (for Asian, Eastern European and EU immigrants), cell phone/
iPhone (for Islamic and Latin American immigrants) and cable subscription (for African
immigrants). Furthermore, the dominant goal of immigrants when watching TV content
produced in their country of origin is obtaining news (for African, Asian, Eastern European and
3
EU immigrants) and finding a basis for conversation and social interaction (for Islamic and
Latin American immigrants). Last but not least, the dominant goal for all ethnic groups
considered when watching Dutch TV is obtaining news.","['media', 'business', 'immigrants', 'Rotterdam', 'TV viewing habits', 'frequency tables', 'survey']"

A critical analysis on Korean Agricultural Official Development Assistance (ODA),"Lee, Suk-yeong",2017-06-30,['Tankha Sunil'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Despite vast research on Korea’s Official Development Assistance (ODA), little is known about Korean agricultural ODA. However, considering the more influential global status of Korean ODA after its entrance to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1996 and rising importance of agricultural issues, the research on Korean agricultural ODA based on the theoretical framework and factual data set is important and research worthy. Therefore, throughout this research paper, I study Korean agricultural ODA by applying the theoretical framework of donor interest and recipient need model, using secondary data analysis. Through these theoretical reviews and data analysis, this research paper aims to see if Korean agricultural ODA gears towards a certain type of theoretical model. To this end, this research paper sets a time frame from 2005 when Korean agricultural ODA started getting significant attention domestically and internationally up to the current date with a target of sixteen main partner countries for Korean agricultural ODA. As a result, I came to a conclusion that Korean agricultural ODA features the characters for both models but it leans more towards donor interest model than recipient need model, demonstrating agricultural ODA trend changes with relation to its national interests such as their need for solving domestic food security issues and expanding overseas agricultural markets. Moreover, the research paper recovers that most of Korea’s commitment on agricultural ODA has been focused on specific countries and cooperative areas mostly coupled with its economic interest. Therefore, the result implies the need for Korean agricultural ODA to incorporate recipient needs more considering the ultimate goals of ODA that are economic development and social welfare of developing countries.","['Official Development Assistance (ODA', 'Korea', 'Agricultural ODA', 'Agricultural field', 'Donor Interest', 'Recipient Need', 'Ministry of Agriculture', 'Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA)', 'Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA', 'Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF)']"
"De man-vrouwrelatie in 10 jaar LINDA. 
Een inhoudsanalyse van 2008-2017",M. Snellink,2017-06-29,['B. Kester'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het onderzoek naar specifiek vrouwentijdschriften heeft pas de laatste vijftien à twintig jaar aan aandacht gewonnen. Sindsdien is er vooral historisch onderzoek of onderzoek naar de respons van vrouwen op vrouwentijdschriften gepubliceerd. Slechts enkele auteurs hebben zich gericht op de man-vrouwrelatie in vrouwentijdschriften. LINDA. is als één van de grootste vrouwentijdschriften van Nederland een interessant onderzoeksobject. Niet alleen door haar taboedoorbrekende artikelen, maar ook vanwege het grote lezerspubliek, waaronder veel mannen. In dit onderzoek is een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse naar 68 artikelen tussen 2008 en 2017 uitgevoerd om te onderzoeken hoe LINDA. man-vrouwrelaties interpreteert, becommentarieert en bekritiseert. Hierbij is gekeken op welke domeinen LINDA. relaties positioneert en in welke termen LINDA. over deze relaties schrijft. LINDA. positioneert relaties in de domeinen ‘liefde en seksualiteit’, ‘huwelijk en scheiding’, ‘werk-zorgverdeling’ ‘afscheid nemen en de dood’. In alle domeinen, behalve deze laatste, is er sprake van paradoxen. Hierbij ligt telkens de focus op de tegenstelling van traditioneel en niet-traditioneel. 
Onder het domein ‘liefde en seksualiteit’ vallen vier verschillende thema’s: ‘seksualiteit tussen vrouwen’, ‘vrije seksuele moraal’, ‘traditionele opvatting over seks’ en ‘liefde genoemd in relatie’. Tevens is het kopje ‘overspel’ aan dit domein toegevoegd. Hieronder vallen de thema’s ‘normalisering overspel’ en ‘trouw zijn in relatie is de norm’. Seksualiteit komt meer voor dan liefde in LINDA. Een vrijere seksuele moraal wordt gepromoot, maar uiteindelijk is de vaste (monogame) relatie de norm. 
Binnen het domein ‘huwelijk en scheiding’ onderscheiden we de thema’s: ‘huwelijk als traditioneel instituut’, ‘huwelijk als niet-traditioneel instituut’, ‘vechten voor huwelijk’ en ‘scheiden is reële optie’. Hierbij is duidelijk de paradox te zien tussen traditie en emancipatie. 
Onder het domein werk-zorgverdeling vallen de volgende thema’s: ‘Traditionele opvatting over relatie’, ‘niet-traditionele opvatting van relatie’, ‘benoemen van traditionele mannen- of vrouwenrol’ en ‘benoemen van niet-traditionele mannen of vrouwenrol’. Onder het traditionele thema kwam nog het volgende thema naar voren: ‘vrouw geeft leven op voor man’. De aanwezigheid van zowel niet-traditionele als traditionele opvattingen bemoeilijkt het om een conclusie vormen over de algehele opvattingen van relaties. 

Onder het kopje ‘mannelijke- en vrouwelijke rollen’ vallen de volgende gevonden thema’s: ‘vrouw is sterk’, ‘vrouw is slachtoffer’, ‘dominante man negatief’ en ‘dominante man positief’. De dominante man wordt veel genoemd, en opvallend genoeg vaak in positieve zin.
Tot slot, op gebied van harmonie en conflict zijn de volgende thema’s gevonden: ‘huiselijk geweld’, ‘problemen relatie’ en ‘kenmerken goede relatie’. Als subthema’s onder dit laatste kopje worden ‘ruimte voor jezelf/de ander’, ‘wederkerig begrip & respect’, ‘begrip en tolerantie’ en ‘seks is belangrijk’ geschaard. LINDA. schrijft iets vaker over conflict dan harmonie. De kenmerken van een goede relatie komen overeen met de literatuur.
LINDA. houdt geen strakke interpretatie aan van het woord ‘relatie’, maar noemt wel het verschil tussen vriendschap en een liefdesrelatie. De teksten uit LINDA. leveren weinig commentaar op hoe relaties er uit (zouden moeten) zien, maar wel op het gedrag van mannen en vrouwen. Hierin worden vrouwen vaak opgeroepen om zelfstandig en geëmancipeerd te zijn. Tot slot bekritiseert LINDA. relaties door het noemen van normen en waarden van relaties, of deze juist kritisch te bekijken.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Vrouwentijdschrift', 'emancipatie', 'feminisme', 'LINDA', 'relaties']"

Eén, wanneer netwerkactoren van mening zijn dat democratische verankering bij kan dragen aan de effectiviteit van het netwerk, lijkt dat de democratische verankering te versterken. Twee, wanneer de overheid middels metagovernance democratische verankering probeert te bevorderen, lijkt dat de democratische verankering te versterken.
Deze inzichten kunnen een aanwijzing zijn dat een door de overheid gestimuleerde verwerking van democratische verankering in de netwerkdoelen bij kan dragen aan de democratische verankering van governance networks.","['Governance', 'Networks', 'Democratisch', 'Verankering', 'Anchorage', 'Interactive']"
"HET MYSTERIE VAN DE SCANDINAVISCHE THRILLER
Een onderzoek naar de rol van culturele kenmerken bij het succes en de populariteit van Scandinavische thrillerboeken in Europa",M. Bakuwel,2017-06-22,['M. Verboord'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Scandinavian thriller books are exported on a large scale, however it is unclear how successful Scandinavian books are in Europe and if the chance of success and degree of popularity depends on Scandinavian culture in the books. By analyzing bestseller lists, this study investigates the extent to which there is an influence of cultural identification, as assumed by the cultural proximity theory of Straubhaar. In addition, the impact of the position of the Scandinavian language and the language of the country to which Scandinavian thriller books are exported is being investigated, as discussed in Heilbron’s cultural world system. Lastly, the impact of gender equality has been researched. As gender equality is an important value in the Scandinavian thriller books, the degree of gender equality in a country could be a factor for the degree of success and popularity of these books. The formulated research question stated: ""To what extent does the proportion of Scandinavian thriller books differ in the period 2010/2011 and 2014/2015 in bestseller lists in Eastern, Southern and Western Europe and can possible differences be explained based on the cultural proximity theory, cultural world system and gender equality? "". For each region in Europe two countries were selected. Success was measured by looking at how many Scandinavian thriller books of the total amount of Scandinavian thriller books, were presented in a country’s bestsellers list. Popularity was measured by looking at the number of weeks that one book was in a country’s bestsellers list. Using cross tables, ANOVA tests and multilevel analysis, the bestseller lists have been analyzed in SPSS. Scandinavian thriller books have a large share within the thriller genre. The share of Scandinavian thriller books in bestseller lists does not appear to have increased or decreased. Differences between countries could not be explained directly from the cultural proximity theory, the cultural world system or gender equality. Although the effect is not consistent, there has been a small impact on cultural proximity and gender equality in a country. More gender equality leads to more popularity and contrary to what was assumed, greater cultural distance appears to ensure increased popularity. However, due to the inconsistency and the relatively small impact, the effect of cultural proximity and gender equality can be called into question. Possibly Scandinavian thrillers or the ‘thriller’ genre may in Europe have a universal attraction. A striking result was that, despite the idea that the success of the books is due to gender equality, these books often contain strong female main characters and are written by many successful female writers, most successful Scandinavian thriller books in European bestseller lists still have male writers and protagonists. Due to the relatively low amount of Scandinavian thriller books that have been analyzed, the results must be interpreted with caution. Because of this relatively low quantity, some successful books and authors can quickly become dominant and thus have had a possible influence on the
overall results. In order to better understand the success and popularity of Scandinavian thriller books, future research should focus on the earlier success of authors, the role of the media that promotes these books and the choices taken by publishers. In this way one can better understand how Scandinavian thriller books spread to other countries and the secret behind the success of the Scandinavian thriller books can be further uncovered.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Scandinavian crime fiction', 'bestseller', 'cultural globalization', 'Straubhaar', 'cultural proximity', 'gender(equality)', 'cultural world system', 'Heilbron']"
All roads lead to... Where? - The Transformational Power of Tourism,Alina Pavlova,2017-06-21,['Arjo Klamer'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This journey-style thesis is a sense-making attempt to the cultural tourism practice. Conceptualizing contemporary travel as a rite of passage, a modern-day pilgrimage, this paper strives to find out what transformational effects are available to an individual engaging in tourism practice and how it can benefit the society at large. When traditions, norms and morals lost in postmodernity create existential angst, the tourism as a “get away from it all” sheds a light on the values which went amiss and emphasizes the need for a more humanistic, value-based approach on a global level. Utilizing previous empirical research on transformational tourism and transformational psychology the conceptual framework of 3 levels of transformation through othering is created, leading to the conclusion that for the achievements of wholeness, peace and existential authenticity the loss of ego is required. By coalescing the fragmented theories in the fields of tourism, cultural economics and sociology this work contributes to the body of knowledge in these domains. The metaphorical nature of this thesis allows for the application of the findings beyond tourism and outside the mentioned areas.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'value-based approach', 'cultural tourism', 'transformation', 'loss of ego', 'existential authenticity']"
The hidden economic potential of Rotterdam:,"Pijpstra, A.",2017-06-20,['Spence J'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the 21st century globalisation has contributed to the creation of the entrepreneurial society and city. The location of entrepreneurship has become an important factor in entrepreneurial studies and, moreover, for entrepreneurial success. Research has shown that the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Rotterdam needs to be strengthened for businesses to grow, but solutions have not been found yet. In the region of Rotterdam immigrants make up a large part of the population and are very entrepreneurial. Immigrant entrepreneurs are considered as important agents for urban economic growth and competitiveness. Although studying immigrant entrepreneurs could be very informative to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Rotterdam, this is not done before. Therefore, in the present study, we analyse the entrepreneurial habits and experiences, and challenges regarding infrastructure, culture, and media, of immigrant entrepreneurs to find out to what extent immigrant entrepreneurs could contribute to the development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Rotterdam. Hence, the following research question is posed: To what extent could immigrant entrepreneurship contribute to the development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Rotterdam? In order to answer this question, a strategy of Grounded Theory orientated qualitative research is undertaken and ten in-depth interviews are conducted with immigrant entrepreneurs located in Rotterdam-Zuid. Furthermore, the entrepreneurial ecosystem is applied to Rotterdam-Zuid. By understanding the environment of the city, we build a list of unique behaviours or attributes that define the entrepreneurial habits and experience of immigrant entrepreneurs in Rotterdam-Zuid. A thematic analysis on the outcome of the interviews revealed that cross-cultural entrepreneurship is an important characteristic of immigrant-entrepreneurship in Rotterdam-Zuid. It can be considered as a hidden economic potential, as it can strengthen: 1. The immigrant businesses regarding business development and growth; 2. The communities and networks of businesses and entrepreneurs; and, 3. The entrepreneurial ecosystem of Rotterdam-Zuid. Nonetheless, the entrepreneurial habits of the immigrant entrepreneurs also caused some limitations for business development and collaborations, such as the lack of creativity within ethnic communities and the importance of self-representation. Furthermore, the immigrant entrepreneurs face challenges regarding infrastructure and communication with third parties, resulting in a more negative entrepreneurial experience.","['media', 'business', 'Business development', 'cross-cultural entrepeneurship', 'Entrepreneurial ecosystem', 'Immigrant entrepreneurship', 'Rotterdam-Zuid']"
The cultural shift,"Fleming, M.",2017-06-18,['L Vandenbussche MSc'],Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The academic field and popular media both describe a gap between the lowly and highly educated, concluding that they live in separate worlds. In the past 60 years a shift in cultural consumption has occurred. The elite in the 60’s, and thus highly educated, consumed exclusionary high-brow cultures diverting themselves away from the low-brow mass culture. The 90’s brought a new pattern of cultural consumption, the general trend being the inclusion of both low- and high-brow cultures. The highly educated became omnivorous in their cultural consumption and the lowly educated became univorous, initiating the omnivore-univore distinction. The overlap in cultural consumption could influence the segregation between the lowly and highly educated. To research this cultural shift interviews in the form of life history research was applied. Discussed with the participant was their cultural consumption and their network in the form of weak and strong ties over the course of the cultural shift. In the life stories of the participant no formation of ties was directly the result of cultural consumption, reducing culture to a building block of ties in existing social spaces such as school, work, neighbourhoods or sport & hobby clubs. This makes the ability of the cultural shift to narrow the gap between the lowly and highly educated depended on the heterogeneity of these social spaces and thus limited.","['Elite-mass', 'highly and lowly educated', 'life history research', 'omnivore-univore', 'strong and weak ties']"

Daarbij is gekeken welke invloed hulpbronnen (leeftijd -indicator voor   hulpbronnen-, inkomensbron en inkomen) hierop hebben en hoe dit te verklaren is. Dit is gedaan aan de hand van de online enquête en focusgroepen uit het project ‘Gesprek met de stad’ in Rotterdam. De verwachting was dat jonge mensen, mensen met een hoog inkomen en werkenden over meer hulpbronnen beschikken en daardoor meer proactief zouden reageren. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat Rotterdammers vooral proactief reageren op maatschappelijke trends. Er kon geen statistisch onderscheid worden gemaakt in de reacties. Vooral Rotterdammers met een hoger inkomen reageren het meest proactief. Voor leeftijd en werkenden is dit minder duidelijk. Het verschilt per thema hoe leeftijd en werk samenhangen met reacties.","['Sociale veerkrachtreacties', 'Rotterdammers', 'Hulpbronnen', 'Trends']"

Nevertheless, the empirical comparison of effect of high performance HR practices on individual-level outcomes across cultures is limited. By incorporating the national culture concept by Hofstede (1985), this study investigated the effects of two configurations of high performance HR practices (autonomy and skills enhancement) on organizational commitment in 25 European countries. The present study used multi-level modelling for the exploration of the effects. Results of analysis showed significant differences in the impact of both autonomy and skills enhancement on organizational commitment depending on the level of power distance in the country. However, the level of individualism moderated only the effect of autonomy on organizational commitment, but not the effect of skills enhancement. Overall, outcomes of the present study support the idea of applying multiple levels of analysis to gain more knowledge of the mechanisms based on which the HR practices affect individual attitudes in various national cultures.","['organizational commitment', 'national culture', 'HR practices', 'individualism', 'power distance']"

Middels kwalitatief onderzoek en het houden van focusgroepen en diepte-interviews is getracht te achterhalen of verschillen in opleidingsniveau leiden tot conflicten, waardoor het contact tussen ouder(s) en kind(eren) vermindert. Het onderzoek levert een verdiepende en nuancerende bijdrage aan de bestaande literatuur. Zo blijkt dat opleidingsverschillen tussen ouders en kinderen deels kunnen bijdragen aan gescheiden leefwerelden. Hierdoor kunnen conflicten tussen hen bestaan, waardoor minder contact onderhouden wordt met de ouders. Daarbij biedt dit onderzoek een belangrijke nuancering, namelijk dat er niet altijd gescheiden werelden ontstaan omdat er ook sprake is van familiesolidariteit. Wanneer er bijvoorbeeld wel conflicten ontstaan als gevolg van het verschil in opleidingsniveau, worden juist op grond van familiesolidariteit omgangsvormen ontwikkeld om de conflicten te relativeren en de verschillen te overbruggen. Daarmee lijkt het gezin een brug te bouwen tussen de gescheiden leefwerelden van laagopgeleiden en hoogopgeleiden.","['Contact', 'Gezinnen', 'Hoogopgeleiden', 'Laagopgeleiden', 'Omgangsvormen']"

JPL Burgers', 'L Vandenbussche MSc']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Al enige tijd is er een discussie gaande in Nederland over de scheidslijn tussen hoog- en laagopgeleiden. Zo verschillen hoog- en laagopgeleiden in de mate van tolerantie met betrekking tot immigranten. Eerder onderzoek toont al aan dat hoe hoger iemand is opgeleid, hoe toleranter iemand is ten opzichte van immigranten. In dit onderzoek is onderzocht, of dit verschil tussen hoog- en laagopgeleiden op het gebied van tolerantie met betrekking tot immigranten, verandert door het buurtcontact met immigranten. Op basis van de culturele bedreigingstheorie kan verwacht worden dat hogeropgeleiden toleranter worden als er sprake is van meer buurtcontact met immigranten en laagopgeleiden minder tolerant, maar vanuit de contacttheorie kan juist verwacht worden dat hogeropgeleiden minder tolerant worden en laagopgeleiden toleranter. Hierdoor zou de scheidslijn tussen hoog- en laagopgeleiden op het gebied van tolerantie met betrekking tot immigranten worden vergoot of verkleind. Om er achter te komen of de theoretische aannames ondersteund kunnen worden door dit onderzoek zijn er vier hypothese opgesteld die zijn getest door middel van een multivariate regressie. Resultaten van dit onderzoek zijn dat opleidingsniveau en buurtcontact met immigranten allebei los van elkaar de mate van tolerantie met betrekking tot immigranten beïnvloeden. Zoals al eerder door andere onderzoeken is aangetoond geldt voor opleidingsniveau dat: hoe hoger iemand is opgeleid, hoe toleranter ten opzichte van immigranten. Voor het buurtcontact met immigranten geldt dat hoe meer contact met immigranten, hoe toleranter iemand word ten opzichte van immigranten. Dit betekent dat in tegenstelling tot wat werd verwacht het buurtcontact met immigranten niet voor een grotere scheiding of voor een kleinere scheiding zorgt tussen hoog- en laagopgeleiden. Ongeacht het opleidingsniveau zorgt buurtcontact met immigranten voor een hogere mate van tolerantie ten opzichte van immigranten.",

The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between three types of school leadership, namely instructional-, distributive- and administrative school leadership, and the self-efficacy of teachers. Research shows the direct effect of school leaders on the self-efficacy of teachers. This study examines a model including mediating variables that can explain the possible relationship between school leadership and self-efficacy of teachers. The mediating variables that are beinig tested are ‘improving school climate’, ‘professional learning community’, ‘collaborative processes’ and ‘professionalisation of teachers’. To test this model a multiple hierarchical regression analysis is conducted. The data used for the regression analysis is obtained from TALIS 2013 (OECD, 2013). TALIS 2013 is an international dataset, in which data is collected through surveys among teachers and school leaders from 33 countries. In this study only data from the Netherlands are used. 128 Schools in the Netherlands participated in the survey. The results show that there are no direct links between the three types of school leadership and self-efficacy of teachers. However, indirect relationships between school leadership and self-efficacy of teachers have been found.  Mainly, instructional and distributive school leadership seem to have an effect on the four intervening variables. Of the four intervening variables, the professional learning community appears to have the strongest relationship with self-efficacy of teachers.","['collaborative processes', 'professionalisation of teachers', 'professional learning community', 'school climate', 'school leadership', 'self-efficacy']"

De spanning in het veld leidde aanvankelijk tot de vereniging van verschillende groepen aandeelhouders, die de transformatie van macht van de bestuurselite naar de aandeelhouders in gang brachten door kritiek te uiten op de bestaande beschermingsconstructies in Nederland en door druk uit te oefenen op het management van ondernemingen om zich aan te passen aan de nieuwe – op aandeelhouderswaarde gerichte – manier van waardebepaling en strategie.","['Aandeelhouderswaarde', 'Beschermingsconstructies', 'Vereniging van Beleggingsanalisten', 'Veldtheorie', 'Economische sociologie']"

A multiple regression analysis has been executed with data obtained from a study of the OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2013. Firstly, the findings show that top down feedback has a positive relationship with teacher self-efficacy. Secondly, there is no significant relationship between bottom up feedback and teacher self-efficacy, unless there is a feeling of collective efficacy in a school. Thirdly, feedback acceptance does not moderate the relationship between internal feedback and teacher self-efficacy. In the qualitative section some interpretations explaining the outcomes are discussed. The results demonstrate the importance of effective feedback of school leadership. Further research is needed to determine the effects of intervision among teachers for developing skills, increase self-efficacy and to improve the feeling of collective efficacy within a school.","['Bottom up feedback', 'collective efficacy', 'feedback acceptance', 'teacher self-efficacy', 'top down feedback']"
Niet alleen een kwestie van besparen: De invloed van organisatie-inbedding op de uitbesteding van organisatieonderdelen,"Schaap, F.",2017-06-18,"['prof.dr. F Koster', 'dr. SRJM van Bohemen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Outsourcing of organizational units is commonly explained as a result of an economic consideration based on maximizing profits. This article examines this claim by testing whether outsourcing declines when transaction costs are made aimed at developing firm-specific skills. Or alternatively if the decline of outsourcing is the result of the organizational embeddeness of organizational units. This article puts response of 17.958 companies to use, which are located in 28 different countries. Whether organizational embeddeness mediates the relation between firm-specific skills and outsourcing of organizational units is tested trough three separate Hayes-tests. Partially in contrast with expectations organizational embeddeness appeared to effect the operational organizational units ‘production’ differently than the staff organizational units ‘marketing’ and ‘research and development’. Whereas outsourcing declined in both cases of marketing, research and development because of organizational embeddeness. Outsourcing of production mostly declined as result of firm-specific skills. As it appears outsourcing is more strongly effect by economic considerations in case of operational organizational units. Whereas staff organizational units are more effectively ‘shielded’ form outsourcing by social ties. Some notions about possible explanations and future research are given at the end of this article.","['Firm-specific skills', 'organizational embeddeness', 'outsourcing']"
Genderdiversiteitsbeleid als continuering van genderongelijkheid?,"Essanhaji, Z.",2017-06-18,"['dr. R van Reekum', 'prof.dr.

Daarom trachten universiteiten middels genderdiversiteitsbeleid deze genderongelijkheid te verkleinen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te kijken hoe dat beleid zich verhoudt tot praktijkervaringen van vrouwelijke promovendi en hoe genderdiversiteitsbeleid een rol kan spelen bij het voortbestaan van genderongelijkheid. Dit doel geeft tevens de verdiepende wetenschappelijke bijdrage van het onderzoek weer. Om dat doel te realiseren is een discouranalyse van diversiteitsbeleidsdocumenten verricht en zijn er semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen bij diversiteitsmedewerkers en vrouwelijke promovendi. Aan de hand van theorieën omtrent genderperformitiviteit, genderpraktijken en (gender-)diversiteitsbeleid konden de resultaten uit het onderzoek adequaat geïnterpreteerd worden. Zo blijkt dat de discoursen van het beleid en van vrouwen enigszins met elkaar stroken en van elkaar verschillen. Vooral de overeenkomsten tussen de discoursen, maken een non-performatieve functie van genderdiversiteitsbeleid mogelijk waardoor het beleid een rol speelt bij de reproductie van genderongelijkheid. Desalniettemin trachten diversiteitsmedewerkers door institutionele initiatieven een culturele verandering teweeg te brengen die bijdraagt aan de realisatie van gendergelijkheid.","['Genderdiversiteitsbeleid', 'Gender gap', 'Genderpraktijken', 'Performitiviteit', 'Universiteiten']"
"Wel samen opereren, maar niet bij elkaar op de koffie","Dubbelden, M. den",2017-06-18,['prof.dr.

Groepen lijken er andere leefwerelden op na te houden welke niet of nauwe-lijks mengen. De werkplek blijkt nog wel een belangrijke ontmoetingsplek te zijn tussen mensen met verschillende opleidingsniveaus. 
In de information-processing theorie wordt gesteld dat samenwerken van ver-schillende opleidingsniveaus leidt tot een meer dynamische organisatie, met meer ideeën, creativiteit en vernieuwing. Daartegenin gaat de similarity-attraction benadering welke uitgaat van het idee dat gelijken elkaar aantrek-ken en er geen vermenging ontstaat. Binnen dit onderzoek lijkt eerder sprake te zijn van het laatste. In de in dit onderzoek gekozen setting van een zieken-huis, werken mensen met een verschillend opleidingsniveau samen in gemixte teams. Het blijkt dat de werknemers zich groeperen in functiegroepen, waarbij er onderling weinig sprake is van vermenging. Er is weinig contact op de werkvloer en daarbuiten, tussen lager- en hogeropgeleiden. Dit lijkt te wijten aan de arbeidsdeling, passend bij het principe van de organische solidariteit. 
De grootte van het ziekenhuis hechtere teams en de plaats van het ziekenhuis (in de stad of kleinere plaats) zijn variabelen die van invloed zijn op de organi-sche solidariteit, en eerder neigen naar een mechanische solidariteit.","['arbeidsdeling', 'heterogene teams lager- en hogeropgeleiden', 'organische solidariteit', 'werkplek']"

Echter er is twijfel of buurtfaciliteiten niet slechts de interactie tussen ‘gelijke anderen’ promoten in plaats van de verschillen tussen verschillende groepen overwinnen (Van Bergeijk, Bolt & Van Kempen, 2008). In deze casestudie is onderzocht hoe buren met verschillende opleidingsniveaus contact hebben in een stadstuin en op een boksvereniging in Den Haag en of dit contact bridging social capital faciliteert.

This thesis aims to identify voter characteristics that increase the likelihood to vote for the left wing populist party SP compared to the right wing populist party PVV and the mainstream left wing party PvdA. To add to the literature this study tests the effects of anti-capitalist attitudes, euroscepticism, political discontent, anti-migration attitudes and socio-economic status on the likelihood to vote for SP compared to PvdA and PVV. Data is deployed from the National Elections Study (NKO) 2012 (N=569). The results from this thesis show that SP voters are similar as PVV voters on levels of euroscepticism and political discontent; a key difference is the lower levels of anti-immigration attitudes and the lower levels of income that are found among SP voters. PVV voters also tend to be less educated. Compared to the mainstream left SP voters are similar in levels of political discontent and migration attitudes. The higher levels of euroscepticism and the lower levels of income distinguish the SP voters from PvdA voters, also PvdA voters tend to be higher educated than SP voters. Surprisingly, anti-capitalist attitudes have no effect on the likelihood to vote for SP compared to PVV and PvdA.","['Dutch politics', 'Left-wing populism', 'populism', 'voter characteristics']"
Ontmoediging of overtuiging?,"Willemsteijn, B.",2017-06-18,"['dr. JFA Braster', 'prof.dr. F Koster']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"By means of multiple regression analyses this thesis investigates whether the presence of special needs students has effect on the degree of self-efficacy of teachers in regular secondary education. To test its ability to increase the self-efficacy of teachers the strategy of ‘Professional Capital’ by Hargreaves and Fullan (2013) is included as an interaction variable. For the quantitative research, data is obtained from the 2013 OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS). Only data about Dutch institutions is used to gain insights on the effects of the newly implemented policy change ‘Passend Onderwijs’ in the educational system of the Netherlands. In this study, it is found that the self-efficacy of teachers increases when the percentages of special needs students in classes rise. Additional qualitative research reveals that teachers gain self-efficacy when they can differentiate their classes between a group of ‘normal students’ and a group of special needs students. Another statement describes a reversed causality; teachers with a high self-efficacy rate more often get classes with a substantial percentage of special need students. Concerning the indicators of professional capital, all three have a significant effect on the self-efficacy of teachers. As interaction variables, only decisional capital has a significant moderating effect. Qualitative research confirms these results as explaining decisional capital has the biggest effect of all the three indicators of professional capital, due to the enormous gain in self-efficacy of teachers when they make the right decisions directed to special need students. Overall these findings indicate that in this study the positive effect of all three indicators of professional capital on the self-efficacy of teachers who have special needs students in their class cannot be justified.","['Decisional capital', 'human capital', 'professional capital', 'special need students', 'self-efficacy of teachers', 'social capital']"

De mate waarin een buurtbewoner contact maakt met de andere bezoekers en daarmee ook in hoeverre er sociale bruggen ontstaan tussen de buurtbewoners is mede afhankelijk van deze motieven. Tevens is bekeken in hoeverre contact tussen de bezoekers van het buurthuis resulteert in onderlinge sociale ondersteuning en/of sociale hefboomwerking. Gebleken is dat de bezoekers van het buurthuis elkaar regelmatig ondersteunen, zowel op praktisch als op emotioneel gebied.

The goal was to see if there is a different reaction for black and white spokespersons addressing the issue, and how this could be interpreted. The results of the analysis show there are several lines of thought/reactions revolved around the issue. The most important finding is that there is a more positive reception for a white spokesperson than a black spokesperson, a paradoxical white privilege to publically speak about racism/white privilege. This can be understood by the conservative and excluding imaginary/identity of Dutch society/culture/citizenship and the infrastructure/interests of white privilege.

F Koster']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Although the degree in which public and private schools educate and perform should be similar to one and another, research has shown that there has been a significant difference in study achievements.
This research has been conducted in order to show whether there is a possible mechanism which can explain the difference between study achievements in both public and private schools. The goal of this research has been to provide more insight as to what different factors between public and private schools contribute to a more positive effect on study achievements.
The conclusion of this research states that students at private schools on average have better study results than students at public schools. This is based on the fact that students from private schools tend to have a higher social economic and cultural status when compared to public schools. In addition research has also pointed that study achievements are positively influenced by the relationship between teacher and student at private schools which is significantly stronger than the relationship of teacher and students at public schools.
 	Although the conclusion and findings indicate a higher study achievement at private schools, the difference could be matched by public schools in order to close the gap. The differences are mostly student related characteristics, for instance; if teachers at public schools would focus more on improving the relationship with their students the difference between study achievement could become smaller when compared to private schools. Although it could be argued that parental involvement could contribute to study achievements, research has shown that this isn’t a mediator in study achievements. This due to the fact that on average parents are less involved when their children have higher study achievements and more involved when the study achievements are low.","['Public Private schools', 'Economic Social and Cultural Status', 'Parental Involvement', 'Teacher Student Relations']"

"De islam als bedreiging?
Een onderzoek naar de berichtgeving over de islam en moslims in Nederlandse kranten",L. de Waard,2017-06-12,['N. Ruigrok'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De laatste jaren worden regelmatig vanuit naam van de islam aanslagen gepleegd en vervolgens opgeëist door islamitische groeperingen als Islamitische Staat. De berichtgeving door de media over dergelijke gebeurtenissen is van invloed op de beeldvorming en de publieke opinie. Wanneer moslims en de islam regelmatig op een negatieve wijze worden besproken, oftewel geframed, wordt dit vanzelfsprekend voor het publiek en kan dit leiden  tot een gevoel van bedreiging door moslims bij het publiek. Deze thesis onderzoekt de berichtgeving van de vijf grootste Nederlandse kranten, onderverdeeld in populaire- en kwaliteitskranten, in drie periodes direct na aanslagen, respectievelijk september 2001, juli 2005 en november 2015. Door het gebruik van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse wordt de volgende vraag beantwoord: ‘In hoeverre is er een verandering te zien in de portrettering van de islam in Nederlandse populaire- en kwaliteitskranten over tijd?’ De afgelopen jaren is er meer aandacht voor de islam en moslims gekomen, maar ook het gebruik van negatieve frames kent een toename. Daarnaast werd het wij-zij frame in het merendeel van de artikelen gevonden, wat betekent dat de islam negatief wordt beschreven, als gewelddadig of met een nadruk op andere normen. Echter, niet voor ieder frame is ook een verschil tussen populaire- en kwaliteitskranten gevonden. Slechts het stigmatiseringsframe kwam vaker voor in populaire kranten dan in kwaliteitskranten. Dit betekent dat een groot deel van het publiek in toenemende mate in aanraking komt met negatieve portrettering van de islam en moslims. Dit sluit aan bij de opvatting dat de media opereren als één institutie en dezelfde routines hanteren. De resultaten van dit onderzoek laten zien dat er sinds 2001 steeds meer aandacht is voor de islam en moslims en dat de berichtgeving bovendien steeds negatiever wordt. Daarnaast toont dit onderzoek aan dat er slechts weinig verschillen zijn tussen populaire- en kwaliteitskranten en dat er direct na aanslagen een groter verband tussen de islam en terrorisme bestaat dan later na een aanslag. Juist in een periode van angst is het van belang dat de journalisten zich bewust zijn van dergelijke associaties, omdat zij een grote rol spelen in het vormen van de publieke opinie. Dit onderzoek draagt bij aan het begrip hiervan.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'framing', 'islam', 'populaire- en kwaliteitskranten', 'verandering over tijd', 'media']"

Daarbij ging het overgrote deel van de aandacht uit naar de ideeën van de aanhangers van de Verlichting. McMahon beschrijft deze belangrijke gebeurtenis juist vanuit het perspectief van de behoudende tegenstanders van de Verlichting. Daarmee legt hij een strijd bloot die eeuwenlang het westerse politieke toneel zou bepalen.
Deze scriptie onderzoekt de relevantie van dit conflict, tussen de voor- en tegenstanders van de Verlichting, voor de huidige tijd, met als focus de hedendaagse opkomst van het rechts-populisme. Aangetoond wordt dat het hedendaags rechts-populisme een wonderlijke combinatie vormt van beide stroming. Aan de ene kant wordt het sterk beïnvloed door de rechts-conservatieve stroming, die terug te voeren is tot de tegenstanders van de Verlichting. Aan de andere kant is er ook een sterke invloed vanuit het rechts-liberale verlichtingsgedachtegoed. Het tweede deel laat de parallellen in de interactie zien tussen beide conflicterende groepen en de lessen die hieruit getrokken kunnen worden voor de huidige tijd.",

This paper explores the issues of land ownership and land rights experienced by the ‘marginalized’ indigenous people mainly the women in order to determine how land grabs occur (who grabs the land from whom). A central aim of the study is thus to ask how land grabs in-fluence Maasai women’s efforts to achieve empowerment. Four questions posed by Bernstein in his agrarian political economy are used to guide the exploration of how land rights among ‘marginalized’ indigenous people and land policies in Tanzania affect Maasai women’s power relations. Moreover, different concepts and approaches relevant to the wider area of study will be used as the analytical lens. This question is discussed in relation to how the community and the state interact, since such interactions can be considered vitally important when it comes to issues of land grabbing, resource allocation and gendered power rela-tions. One of the key findings of this study is that once women are provided with land ownership titles, they gain confidence in legal protection. This study confirms the view that land title matters to rural Maasai women, when faced with land grab situations, although none of the key informant women does not hold a right to own land as of the moment this research took place. This study sug-gests at the end if gender lenses are placed on the issue land deals, land owner-ship can be seen as a key issue influencing the outcomes of land grabbing on women compared with men.","['Land grabs', 'Maasai women', 'gendered power relations', 'land tenure', 'NIE', 'agrarian political economy', 'gender inequality']"

Using the sociological concepts of vulnerability, access, and right to education as part of enhancing capabilities, the study combined these lenses through which the experiences of URC and their foster parents were analysed and better understood. The study included both those who were in primary school, and those who were not attending primary school. To have a clearer understanding of the challenges, obstacles and strategies that enable, or do not enable, URC to access primary education, several sets of perspec-tives were explored. These included the points of view of foster parents, teachers, and of the children themselves, first about the Ugandan primary ed-ucation system, and second about these children’s experiences within this sys-tem. I narrowed down the study area to a renowned slum area in the centre of Kampala, Kisenyi. This area has a predominantly refugee population, an es-timated 95 per cent of the total. I conducted a qualitative study through the use of focus group discussion with children, and individual interviews to col-lect more data. One key finding was a clear distinction between making school places available for URC and ensuring their ability to access such places and do well in school. Others key findings are that poverty is the main obstacle to access for those URC not in primary school. Language barriers were also significant. Some participants suggested formal mainstream school did not meet their practical, job-seeking ambitions. Overall the study finds partners involved, including government, NGOs and support organisations, could more effectively cooperate to support the URC and foster parents. The government may need to revisit the Refugee Act of 2006, so this group of children can also be assisted in urban areas, to enjoy their right to primary education, and not only in the formal refugee settlements.","['Unaccompanied Refugee Children', 'Foster parents', 'Uganda', 'Access', 'Primary education', 'Vulnerabilities', 'Rights', 'Experiences']"
"Contestation on freeport, Papua and Indonesia
scrutinizing media representation by reuters.com, detik.com, and tabloidjubi.com","Pakpahan, Ruth Damai Hati",2017-03-31,['Zarkov Dubravka'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Media has long been the watchdog in a democratic government, providing essential

This research aims to see how media representation presented a violent event,
the tunnel collapse in Freeport’s mine, Papua on May 14th, 2013. The media
selected are Reuters.com, Detik.com and Tabloidjubi.com representing international,

method to observe how the media portrayed the tunnel collapse. There are six
news articles and 3 images from Reuters.com; five news articles and four images
from Detik.com; and 10 news articles and 8 images from TabloidJubi.com
that will be the primary data of this research. Those articles and images taken
from the first two days of the event and will be scrutinized by using Framing

The United States and the Founding of NATO,Stef Schuthof,2017-02-03,"['H.A.M. Klemann', 'D. Fazzi']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","On the 4th of April 1949 several Western European states, Canada and the United States signed the North Atlantic Treaty. The new allies agreed that “an armed attack against one or more of them… shall be considered an attack against them all”.  To help the allies, a new organisation based on the North Atlantic Treaty was formed: the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The reasons that led President Harry S. Truman to sign the treaty have been researched quite extensively in the past decades. NATO’s purpose in the eyes of the Truman administration was to institutionalize, from a military point of view, the strategy of containment set forth in the Truman Doctrine. It was supposed to support Western Europe and prevent the further expansion of the Communist influence sphere. However it is still somewhat unclear what kind of alliance and appropriate organization the US administration wanted and envisioned during the founding phase of the alliance and if the eventual embodiment of NATO corresponded with the US administrations views. Therefore this thesis focusses on the following questions: how did the relevant officials within the US administration envision NATO during its founding phase, why did they chose those views and did the eventual embodiment of NATO correspond with the US administrations views? In this traditional historical research project, which covers the time-period between 1945 and December 1949, an awnser to these questions will be formulated by looking at internal and external communication of the Truman administration. 						From the American point of view, the primary goal of NATO was to enhance American security by strengthening the ability of the Europeans to resist the Soviet political threat.	 However since the US administration at the time did not fear a Soviet attack, and since military commitments needed to stay in line with US capabilities, they wanted to keep the military commitment to Europe as small as possible. Also the US government did not want to lose the right to make their own decisions and to make and peruse their own policy’s and goals, also in regard of defence matters. Finally the US government, especially the Senate, did not want to support an alliance which would endanger the existence of the UN. Subsequently the Americans wanted  an alliance which  would stiffen European moral but which at the same time would keep US military commitments to a minimum, support the UN and in which the US could retain the largest possible freedom of action. When we look at the North Atlantic Treaty and NATO as they were in December 1949 it is safe to say that the US administration got there way on almost all fronts. Although the US negotiators had to give in on some minor points, the US government got almost all of their demands realised.","['Cold War', 'United States', 'Truman Administration', 'Containment Policy', 'North Atlantic Treaty', 'North Atlantic Treaty Organization', 'NATO', 'International Relations']"

De elektronische muziekscene is de laatste jaren enorm in populariteit gegroeid en is sindsdien in tientallen subgenres versplinterd. Ondanks de relatief korte levensduur van de elektronische muziek zien we oude patronen uit de rock- en punkscene terug op het gebied van gender. De man-vrouwverdeling in de elektronische muziekscene is erg scheef. In dit onderzoek wordt er gekeken naar de manier waarop vrouwelijke DJ’s omgaan met de voor- en nadelen van het vrouw-zijn in een muziekscene die door mannen gedomineerd wordt. In de theorie wordt er eerst gekeken naar de aspecten van de punk- en rockscene. Vele aspecten van deze scene worden in onze cultuur als mannelijk gezien. Het gevolg hiervan is dat het voor vrouwen zeer lastig is om tot deze groep door te dringen. Dit zien we ook terug in de huidige elektronische muziekscene. Op basis van de literatuur kunnen we 4 belangrijke aspecten onderscheiden over gender en elektronische muziek. Het eerste aspect is technologie, er is namelijk veel technische kennis vereist om DJ te worden door het gebruik van verschillend soft- en hardware. Het tweede aspect is geluid, onderzoek wijst uit dat harde, sterk klinkende muziek met weinig vocalen als mannelijk wordt gezien. Het derde aspect is verzamelen, het is een mannelijke eigenschap om een verzameling op te bouwen die kennis en expertise vereist. Het opbouwen van een muziekverzameling zou daarom eerder door mannen gedaan worden. Het vierde aspect is lichaam, er ligt tegenwoordig een grote focus op het uiterlijk, met name voor vrouwelijke DJ’s. Hierdoor moeten bepaalde belangrijke keuzes gemaakt worden. Met behulp van diepte-interviews wordt er gekeken naar hoe vrouwelijke DJ’s in Nederland omgaan met deze aspecten en een positie voor zichzelf creëren. Hieruit bleek dat er tweedeling is waarin bepaalde vrouwen dagelijks worstelen met het feit dat zij niet serieus genomen worden of zelfs minder kansen krijgen om de top te bereiken. Een ander deel is trots op haar vrouwelijkheid en gebruikt deze ook in haar voordeel, zij heeft vertrouwen in haar eigen vaardigheden en kan daarom beter omgaan met tegenslagen.","['Gender', 'Identiteit', 'Elektronische muziek', ""Vrouwelijke DJ's"", 'Dancescene', 'Populaire muziek', 'Diepte-interviews']"

Het instrumentele denken dat zo kenmerkend is voor de moderne techniek, speelt ook een belangrijke rol binnen de economie. Termen als ‘human resource management’ en ‘human capital’ lijken aan te geven dat het calculerende denken overheerst en er mogelijk geen oog meer is voor de mens in zijn of haar zelfstandigheid.

"Aid Dependency and Institutional Capacity Building in Afghanistan: How Aid Dependency Undermines Institutions Building
Ministry of Education (Case Study)","Alokozai, Abdul Ghafar",2016-12-16,['Murshed Mansoob'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Studying the relationship between “Aid Dependency” and “Institutional Capacity
Development” in conflict affected countries is at the core of debates on effectiveness of foreign
aid and assistance. This research paper studies and analysis the mechanisms of foreign aid
delivery and its adverse impacts on institutions building at Ministry of Education (as case study),
Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The paper argues that long term aid
dependency undermines the quality of institutions and is negatively associated with building
permanent in-house capacities. The paper focuses on changing the mechanisms of aid delivery,
particularly bypassing the recipient government financial and budgetary channels. It argues that, setting up temporary and independent project implementation units parallel to the existing government institutions cause severe problems such as fragmentation of policies and projects, poaching and syphoning off the scarce qualified staff from already weak and decaying public institutions, missing opportunity of learning by doing, and increase the culture of dependency. While the argument of aid dependency and its adverse impact on institutional capacity building doesn’t not mean that foreign should be decreased, this paper concludes that, aid has the potential to improve and strengthen the public institutions if it is delivered through the government budgetary system with the long term and clear development agendas to improve the service delivery, to strengthen the institutional planning capacity and to establish a strong civil services administration with a permanent in-house capacity.","['Aid-dependency', 'Institutions Capacity Building', 'Ministry of Education – Afghanistan', 'Technical', 'Assistance', 'On/Off Budge Funding Mechanisms']"
"Sweet Potato Value Chain in Rwanda: Understanding Actors and Interaction
Challenges in a Context of Food and Livelihood Security","Nyirahanganyamunsi, Gerardine",2016-12-16,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"There are several crops cultivated in Rwanda to fighting food insecurity. In that regards this
study was conducted to understand actors involved in the production of sweet potato which is
one of the most popular crops grown in Rwandans. This is because the crop has the potential
to effectively contribute to address poverty through income generation for producers and other
involved in the value chain.
This study attempted to examine the interaction between actors involved in sweet potato value
chain. The study focused on sweet potato farmers’ cooperatives, Indyo Inoze bakery as sweet
potato processor, government and researchers (public and private) institutions located in
Muhanga District as a case study. It cover all 15 professional groups that are in the 5 sweet
potato farmers’ cooperatives representatives of NGOs, Government and other institutions. The
study used mixed-methods approach for data analysis. In that respect stakeholders mapping and
stakeholders’ analysis were conducted to know the actors in the sector and to understand their
roles and relations. Venn diagram and Network diagram were used to describe the interactions
between actors and shed light on power relations. The results from research show the
importance of stakeholders in the chain and how the Government influences other actors due
to its power and capacities through agricultural policy. The study revealed that the issues
holding back sweet potato production are based on good land that have been taken for priority
crops and also agricultural policy operation as well. Networking between stakeholders is still an
issue and that does not favor an effective collaboration for improving sweet potato production
that is very important crop in the daily life of farmers and affect their livelihood. The study
recommends a change in the current policy to guaranty farmer’s participation during the
formulation of policy that affect directly their livelihood.","['Sweet potato value chain', 'food security', 'livelihood security', 'stakeholders', 'power relations']"

the standard between the years 1992 to 2014. The result shows, food products’
export of the selected African countries’ to EU countries are highly sensitive to
ISPM 15 standard. The direction and extent of the standard effect varies depending
on country and product group mix under consideration. With regard to trade
interaction of the selected African countries with all trading partners, the standard
has trade distortion effect on both export and import of agricultural and nonagricultural
product groups’. Interestingly, meeting the requirement of the standard
does not necessarily improve or ensure these countries’ better trade performance.

This is a journey for which dialogues and remembrances are the source of reflections about gender, race, class and education.

Evidence from Survey Experiments
on the Streets of Moscow","Mecheva, Margarita",2016-12-16,['Rieger Matthias'],International Institute of Social Studies,"During his sixteen years in power Vladimir Putin has enjoyed high approval
ratings. Despite a recent deterioration of Russia’s economy the president
remains very popular. The research paper studies the possible effect of allegedly
threatening media content on the support for Putin using survey experiments
conducted on the streets of Moscow. The study explores whether
experimentally induced anxiety may influence citizens’ support for a controversial
internet censorship policy and that, in turn, can help to understand
whether people may alter their attitudes based on the frightening signals
from media. The experimental evidence suggests that priming may induce
confusion-anxiety emotions. The threatening effect of media content elicited
by priming was not detected. The framing of internet censorship policy has
moderate effect on tested attitudes, suggesting that high level of Putin’s
public support is not indisputable.","['Putin', 'survey experiment', 'media effects', 'Terror Management Theory']"

of the notion of empowerment is still marred with the social construction
of women as caregiver. Education is taken as the main pointer to
women’s empowerment that promotes women’s participation in formal jobs
and decision making organs. The legal frameworks dealing with the education
of women are mainly concerned with access to education and the political participation
of women is more influenced by the agenda of the party-state. The
educated women in Ethiopia still understand their educational achievement in
relation to becoming better wife and mothers in the future. The notion of
women’s empowerment in Ethiopia is explored both at the legal regime and
lived experiences of women in Addis Ababa. Building on the concepts of
‘choice’ (kabeer 1999) and ‘capability’ (Sen 1999) approaches, the research uses

"Perspectives of Head Teachers on Girls Exclusion
in Education in Northern Ghana","Amadu, Grace Seidu",2016-12-16,['Ramos Charmaine'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study explores this issue of exclusion of girls in Ghana, with reference
to the problem of low completion rates and high dropout rates among
girls in basic education. Education of children most especially the girls is of
primary concern in contemporary Ghana, a concern shared among the highest
government levels, district-level assemblies, and parents. As a result, significant
financial resources are annually allocated for educational development. Reggardless
of this, many young girls in the Northern region most especially those
from the rural communities drop out due to several reasons. Various studies
have approached the problem from the students’ and the parent's perspectives,
the point of view of head teachers have been left out from most of the argument
put forward and this has pose a challenge to understand why students
dropped out. We asked why has the problem of girls exclusion from education
persisted despite above interventions by the government?, what roles do head
teachers plays in curbing or contributing to the high rate of school dropouts
among girls in the Tamale metropolis?, and what are the limits of the government’s
policy response in tackling the exclusion of girls in education. These
questions were dealt with through the interview session with 16 head teachers
from both primary and junior secondary schools, which are the foundation of
basic education in Ghana. The findings show that the household factors remain
the most dominant followed by the economic, and then societal factors
that contributes to girls dropping out of school before completing their education.
Nevertheless, these factors do interact with each other because the girls
don’t drop out of school because of a single reason; rather they drop out from
school as a result of combined effect of multiple factors. It was also revealed
that the head teachers are also complicit in pushing the girls out of school as
much as they play significant roles in retention rate in school. Unfortunately,
the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) cash transfer program
and Ghana school feeding pro-gram (GSFP) Initiated by Ghana government
to attract and retain girls to school has only managed to attract students, but
many did not complete their studies.","['Head teacher', 'Exclusion', 'Girls', 'Education', 'Dropout']"
“We are the people of conservation” negotiations of local officers to implement conservation in National Park Sumapaz,"Ardila Vargas, Diana Stella",2016-12-16,['Arsel Murat'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Using ethnographic methods examining the case of the Natural Park Sumapaz, the research delves into the analysis of how conservation in those restricted areas could be more a matter of a daily construction rather than a hegemonic tactic for state expansion. In the Colombian case, where protected areas management occur in the middle of territorial conflicts and warfare, coercive conservation tactics are devoid of enough power, making negotiation strategies more feasible to be applied in contested territories. Coercion and Negotiation are two elements that help to understand how state, particularly its conservation project is locally and daily made. The research uses actor oriented approaches to highlight the importance of local bureaucrats in the process of state formation. Those actors, in charge to materialize state projects in field, could use their own meanings, motives and power sources in response to the local reactions that emerge when conservation policies are tried to be implemented. Those local actions and interactions contribute to determine how state is locally configured and conservation project is territorialized.","['local officers', 'state formation', 'protected areas', 'negotiation', 'conflict']"

Gendered analyses of the Bontanga irrigation project reveal that in many cases women’s participation in irrigated agriculture has been limited due to lack of access to land. Past research suggests that variables other than access to land condition low women’s participation in irrigated agriculture. Fully understanding women’s participation in terms of their access to irrigated land demands the examination of how intra-household dynamics and the market, as well as the state, interplay as constraints to women access to irrigation land.","['gender', 'access', 'land', 'irrigation', 'scheme', 'allocation', 'Bontanga', 'Ghana']"

The central research question lies in the assumption that diffusion of food sovereignty at the national level is a site of contentious politics - subject to socio-political dynamics and historical context of a country as well as the relations and interactions of social movements within themselves and with the State.
Using qualitative methods like discourse analysis and semi structured interviews, the paper concludes that food sovereignty is both a site of discursive and material struggle between and among key actors. Further, the study posits that food sovereignty diffusion is neither vertical - top-down or bottom-up - nor horizontal process. It is an iterative process – one which is subject to various (re)interpretations, adaptations, adoptions at the global, national and local fronts by different groups.","['food sovereignty', 'social movements', 'diffusion', 'Philippines', 'state-society interaction', 'political sociology']"

It does this by examining how three schools of thought conceptualize environmental limits, and investigates the reason for differences in articulation of the problem as well as the solution. In the process we see how the scientific framework and the discourse of environmental limits is a co-production with interpretive flexibility, and usually unacknowledged, non-environmental aspects together making it a much-contested concept.",

Will the problem be solved if we just keep eating? A critical analysis of the Marine Stewardship Council as a response to the overfishing issue,"Westin, Maria",2016-12-16,['Schneider Mindi'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The overfishing crisis has become increasingly severe during recent decades, and there is an enormous urgency in putting an end to the depletion of fish stocks globally. With neoliberalism, market-based instruments to govern fisheries have gained importance, and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) ecolabel
has become the most influential certification system for capture fisheries. This paper attempts to analyse the effectiveness of the MSC when it comes to reducing overfishing. Based on political economy and degrowth theories I argue that to get to terms with the issue of overfishing, fish consumption needs to reduce, and seeing the uneven consumption and production patterns globally any viable solution must also work towards redistribution. I furthermore analyse to what extent the MSC addresses the need for redistribution and reduced
consumption, and argue that its strategies and standards do not consider these issues sufficiently and may instead reproduce them. Based on this I argue that while the MSC may have localised effects on specific fisheries and indirect consequences in the shape of increasing awareness about the overfishing crisis, the label’s reliance on a neoliberal scope of action constrains its abilities to address some of the core issues within the overfishing problematic.","['eco-labels', 'overfishing', 'neoliberalisation', 'degrowth']"
Journey narratives of Eritrean refugees living in The Netherlands: Becoming and being a refugee.,"Kindipan-Dulawan, Jeanette M.",2016-12-16,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper wishes to analyse the journey narratives of Eritrean refugees in The Netherlands in their becoming and being refugees. It consists of the different constructions of the participants’ journeys through its beginning or ending; as an (un)imagined destination; as narratives of uncer-tainties and as influenced by the mode of travel in the stages of their physical journeys. The study illustrates that focusing on refugees’ own meaning and narratives of their journeys can help in understanding the temporalities and permanence of temporariness in becoming and being a refu-gee. I argue that the participants’ notions of time and place were altered while becoming and being a refugee as demonstrated by their narratives of waiting, enforced idleness and being made to wait especially before and after granted a refugee status and that important places where refugee status have been granted can be both a place of ‘opportunity’ and ‘constraints’.

defenders are subjected to several marginalization. HRDs face challenges because
of their commitment to strive for the promotion and protection of human
rights and fundamental freedoms incorporated in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. In doing so, numerous actors have been involved in
endangering their life, rights and work. The study reveals that Ethiopia’s counter
terrorism law has significantly undermined the rights of HRDs and affected
their work. Moreover, the findings show that counter terrorism laws in the
country have gradually eroded fundamental human rights enshrined in the

"Mediation at the road of intersection: The case of Family Division, Kampala High Court.","Nassuna, Rebecca",2016-12-16,['Shehada Nahda'],International Institute of Social Studies,"vi ii
Abstract
The sociological understanding of mediation has received less attention
in Uganda despite the rolling out of mandatory mediation to all civil cases.
This research seeks to understand how parties around the negotiation table
in mediation employ gender in its intersection with class and status to pursue
their interests. It employs intersectionality, the tool of analysis that helps
to understand how social interactions overlap and cause unique experiences.
Qualitative research methods using observations of mediation sessions
and unstructured, informal interviews of participants was carried out at the
Family Division of the High Court of Uganda at Kampala over a period of
one month. Through analysis of mediation sessions attended and the interviews,
the findings revealed that parties employ the social norms of gender,
class and status during their negotiations to give themselves a positive position
and the opponent party a negative one by framing themselves as; the
good version of the symbols depicted while framing the other party as the
bad version of the symbol, the disadvantaged and deserve protection and the
opponent party framed as advantaged and not deserving protection, the right
ones and other party as wrong one. The findings further reveal mediators
employ legal norms in form of rules, together with social norms from their
social background upon which they rely to interpret and process the mediation.
The study therefore concludes with recommendation for a wider research
on the topic in order to generalize the findings. It also recommends a
research on the impact of the effect of social norms on the mediation outcome.","['mediation', 'gender', 'class', 'status', 'intersectionality', 'Family Division of High Court', 'Uganda']"
Risk and policy in Indonesian toll road development: from the perception of public and private sector :  Study case of Pandaan – Malang & Manado - Bitung,"Nadia, Fadil Arif",2016-12-16,['Tankha Sunil'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Government of Indonesia targeted to build 1.000 km of toll road for the next five years (2015-2019), however there is a distinctive gap in Indonesian toll road investment. Nonetheless, toll road development is closely related to risk, after the 1998 crisis common perspective that Indonesia is identified as a high-risk country. Therefore, investor is reluctant to invest in Indonesia. The purpose of
this study is to define impact of policy reform (Government Guarantee) on the risk of toll road investment in Indonesia from the perspective of the public and private sector. As an exploratory research, this study relies on secondary research literature and data such as feasibility study, law & regulations and monitoring data in toll road sector. This study also uses the interview to obtain perspective from the two stakeholders. In additions, by using two study cases, it compares the mechanism, implementation, and limitation of government guarantee scheme in two different regions. The findings indicate that the policy is not effective
in reducing the risk in toll road development rather more like a procedural step to the received financing. The lessons learned are valuable for determining appropriate government guarantees for future PPP projects.","['toll road', 'risk', 'policy', 'government guarantee', 'public private partnership', 'Indonesia', 'Infrastructure Guarantee Fund', 'Indonesian Toll Road Authority', 'private sector']"
Exploring the potential of mobile money for financial inclusion for socially deprived groups in northern region in Ghana : A case of nomadic herdsmen in Savelugu district,"Aliu, Fauzia",2016-12-16,['Knorringa Peter'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Ghana like most developing countries has witnessed an increased growth in the number of mobile phone users over the last few years. This has led to the increasing adoption and use of mobile money services (Aker and Mbiti 2010, Donovan 2012a). Mobile money is argued to have significantly increased access to basic financial services to the unbanked (ibid). This paper examines the accessibility and use of mobile financial services by nomadic Fulani herdsmen in northern Ghana. Findings from this research indicate that mobile money financial services are facilitating a convenient means for the Fulani to make payments and transfer money. Evidence from this finding are also indicative that mobile money financial services to a certain degree if not wholly is supplementing in its provision of financial services to the socially deprived Fulani. From in-depth face to face interviews and mobile money service providers at the community, this study presents an empirical data to their access and use of financial services provided by the new mobile money technologies. And discussed how they use this technology for their day to day management. It also highlights in what ways their social deprivation has restricted their full utilization the services it offers.","['financial inclusion', 'basic financial services', 'mobile money services', 'social excluded groups']"
Rethinking metropolitan governance: an exploration of urban entrepreneurialism in decentralized Indonesia : The case of Jakarta Metropolitan Region (JMR),"Talitha, Tessa",2016-12-16,['Wit Joop de'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Past studies of urbanization in Indonesia found that market-oriented policies in Soeharto’s regime in the late 1980s already contributed to the rapid development in the Jakarta Metropolitan Region (JMR). They indicate the emergence of the phenomenon of urban entrepreneurialism which highlight an ambitious policies for gaining economic growth. However, indications are that following Indonesia’s decentralization reforms, this phenomenon became more visible at the local level and resulted in inter-urban competition. The intention between good planning for all on the one hand and generating fiscal income on the other hand, has lead to unexpected, even preverse outcomes of decentralization. This study investigates the extent to which municipalities in JMR show characteristics of urban entrepreneurialism, by considering overall trends across local governments in JMR and by zooming on and comparing two such fast growing municipalities. Several general implications can be drawn from the results: First, the intra-regional competition to escalate economic competitiveness has increased regional disparities in JMR. Second, the development of spectacular places, such as shopping malls and fancy buildings – at the expense of lower income group welfare – has transformed the suburbs into new urban centers and has created development fragmentation. Third, in both cases, the urban entrepreneurialism strategies rsther cause spatial segregation and environmental problems. Finally, the emerging trends of urban entrepreneurialism phenomenon in JMR seem inevitable if seen as a political agenda of mega-project development with deep cooperation between the local government and the private sectors. In order to prevent the negative impact of the growth competition, this study proposes The Government of Indonesia to strengthen the currently weak – regional administrative body (BKSP), to empower it to intervene in the planning and implementation of JMR development as a key organization keeping in mind the interest of all.","['decentralization', 'urban entrepreneurialism', 'inter-urban competition', 'regional disparities', 'development fragmentation', 'Jakarta Metropolitan Region', 'Indonesia']"
Syrian refugees’ right to human dignity in reception centers of Greece: An analysis of the right to an adequate standard of living,"Stratigou, Mary",2016-12-16,['Handmaker Jeff'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Human dignity defined in terms of an adequate standard of living is a key figure within refugees’ treatment discourses. Respecting them as a vulnerable group of people forced to leave their homes for a wide variety of reasons and protecting their unalienable rights is always an issue at stake within societies, even in the most liberal and democratic states. The present paper problematizes the idea of providing humane living conditions for refugees as long as their asylum process is under consideration. Using a socio-legal approach in understanding human rights norms and laws, it is argued that these norms do not constitute independent values but are embedded in social, cultural and economic contexts. Through the lenses of the Greek society’s characteristics and specific needs, the study examines the necessity for international human rights norms’ translation and their framing into familiar for local people terms. The role of institutional and transnational actors is deemed to be determinant towards this direction by simply constituting mediators between the international or regional and the national level. Consequently, when a state or society itself is not able to realize the value of human rights norms and regulations and effectively implement them, non-state actors such as NGOs lay the foundations by providing the guidelines for local people and government officials to follow. Thus, delinking human rights ideas from the ambiguity and embedding them into each society’s context will be the main argument in order to approach refugees’ right to human dignity and adequate living standards. Negotiation for a better quality of living conditions and opportunities for improvement can also be encountered during the journey of this academic analysis.","['Syrian refugees', 'human dignity', 'living conditions', 'reception centres', 'Greece', 'camp of Eleonas', 'implementation of human rights norms', 'legal obligations', 'role of non-state actor']"

Ambiguous positionalities: Bangladeshi migrant men in The Hague,"Khalad, Mohammad Ibrahim",2016-12-16,['Zarkov Dubravka'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Gendered experiences of men are an important aspect of development studies,
as it has become clear that gender should not be equated with women. In
addition, migration holds relevance for development studies as migrants bring
important economic, social and symbolic contributions to both the host society
and the societies ‘back home’. Thus, focusing on migrant men within development
studies means broadening gender and development scope of research.
Doing it in the post 9/11 context means addressing some of the major issues
in the contemporary world. Connecting migration, masculinity and Islamophobia,
this research showed that the process of marginalization is not always

of marginalization can give advantage in some contexts while becoming
problematic in others. Therefore, this research is important for broadening our

Enabling human rights of persons with disabilities in post-conflict contexts: interventions and outcomes in Cambodia,"Sato, Akiko",2016-12-16,['Kurian Rachel'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research explores how interventions have made an impact on the human rights of PWDs, particularly those caused by landmines and explosive remnants of war in Cambodia, which has developed as a post-conflict country. Disability, despite being emphasized from a medical viewpoint, the adoption of UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities completely changed it to a social model under which disability began to be regarded as something society has created. As long as disability continues in society, to investigate the relationship between disability and society, we need a lens which addresses this link appropriately. Whilst conflict causes disability to a large extent, the study regarding how PWDs can exercise their human rights in postconflict era has not matured, even though many interventions have been undertaken by regional bodies, state, international aid, and NGOs. In addressing the experiences of persons with disabilities and related interventions, this research employs social exclusion and inclusion, and the capability approach to explore the phenomenon of human rights invasions and efficient remedy for them with dynamics. Social exclusion and inclusion look at the process of how people are deprived of opportunities, and the capability approach states the importance of real opportunities; both can be a lens to stress the demand for a holistic approach to improve the human rights of
PWDs.","['disability', 'human rights', 'social exclusion and inclusion', 'capability approach', 'post-conflict']"
"Child vulnerability or agency? Exploring the experiences of children with disabilities in street beggary in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Ayele, Abrham A.",2016-12-16,['Arts Karin'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The involvements of children with disabilities (CWDs) in street beggary is an under-studied phenomenon and little-understood due to the complex nature of the activity. CWDs who are begging for alms in the streets are often approached as part of the ordinary street working street children. They are not in schools, care or protection schemas and/or out of the policy web in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Employing a qualitative methodology of exploration, this paper considers both the narratives of child agency and vulnerability of CWDs involved in beggary in the streets of Addis Ababa. The presentation of these discourses results in a broader framework of understanding the practices of begging by CWDs in Addis. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the child rights pillars expressed in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989). The research has also generated practical evidence that the notion of agency needs re-thinking and dismantling. These existing discourses have not adequately analyzed the experiences of CWDs with begging. This study
disproves the agency assertion in beggary by CWDs and highlights the multiple child rights abuses involved in the activity. The children themselves perceive the activity as the last resort. In the words of participant child; ‘‘there is nowhere for me to go and to do outside of the streets and begging; the money helps me to buy food and a place to sleep’’ (4th participant child with physical
disabilities due to polio, male, age 14). Further evidences throughout the study also indicated that, it is child rights violation, yet ignored in intervention policies and programs. A deeper understanding of the CWDs involvement in beggary is vital to move towards more effective and rights-based interventions. For this end, the paper suggests that this also applies to relevant offices in child
protection in Addis Ababa’s city administration. These offices would do well to apply a child rights-based approach to supporting the rights of CWDs that involve in beggary.","['Addis Ababa', 'agency', 'begging', 'children with disabilities', 'child abuse', 'RBA', 'Ethiopia']"
"Large-scale land transactions in Karamoja region, Uganda: a right to food perspective","Ogwang, Christopher Odyek",2016-12-16,['Handmaker Jeff'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper uses the socio-legal approaches of Legal Consciousness, Legal
Translation and the Human Rights-Based Approach to development to address
the question of access to land and the realisation of the right to food.
This is in the context of an indigenous Karimojong pastoral community in
Uganda, where large chunks of land have been allocated by the government to
mining companies. Accordingly, the influence of international human rights
norms on state behaviour at the local level is analysed.
The empirical findings of the study illustrates how lack of access to land
has affected the pastoralists’ realisation of their right to food, through denial of
access to grazing grounds, contamination of water sources and lack of access
to wild fruits. This is a consequence of a mismatch between the indigenous
pastoralists’ conception of property rights; coupled with limited knowledge of
the existing laws and procedures, and inadequate monitoring and control
mechanism by the state. The none-fulfilment of the right to food is also attributed
to limited involvement of the affected communities in the processes
of land transactions. The paper argues that whereas the adoption of international
human rights standards in relation to property rights and the right to
food are necessary for addressing human rights concerns at the local level, the
process of framing these norms to suit the local context determines its effectiveness.","['land', 'property rights', 'right to food', 'pastoralism', 'mining', 'large-scale land acquisitions', 'legal translation', 'legal consciousness', 'human rights-based approach to development', 'legal pluralism', 'Uganda']"

political economic factors hindering adoption of conservation agriculture in Malawi by small scale farmers. The location of the study was at Chingati-Phiri Village in Lisasadzi Extension Planning Area, Traditional Authority Kaomba and at Chilemba Village, Traditional Authority Mnyanja in Kasungu District, Central Region. The analytical frame work used was the agrarian political economy by Bernstein where qualitative analysis was mainly used for deep understanding of the issues on agrarian political economy. Though, to know the profile of the respondents, the quantitative viewpoint was used. The study interviewed 31small scale farmers’ respondents from both villages and conducted 2 focus group discussions in both villages with a total of 23 participants.
It has been explored that the small scale farmers possess small land sizes
because of increased population and illegal transferring of land by chiefs. They are also scared to use rented land because CA is a long term benefit technology so owners can easily take back their land. The majority of small scale farmers have inadequate capital for agricultural production since there is low labour
wages, lack of jobs and capital to start business. Additionally, the technology is labour demanding due to the family labour which has no capital. The State is extremely requested to implement the land reform arrangement so that the small scale farmers gain both access to land and land security. This will enable them adopt CA and other improved technology leading to
more income. Therefore, the State is argued to use agrarian political economy perspective to know the farmers without land. There is also need for the State to be well coordinated with the Non Governmental Organizations for appropriate exist strategy.","['conservation agriculture', 'customary land', 'agrarian political economy', 'adoption', 'labour', 'capital', 'land ownership']"
Financial inclusion in Ghana : How has the use of Akuafo cheques introduced cocoa farmers to banks?,"Macnally-Boateng, Adwoa Mensima",2016-12-16,['Gomez Georgina M.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Financial inclusion is a developmental policy, which is increasingly gaining importance in many countries in the world because it can bring many welfare benefits. The World Bank estimates that globally about 2 billion working adults do not use formal financial services. It is to help address this phenomenon that the World Bank Group and a coalition of partners in 2015 made commitments to help promote financial inclusion, and accelerate universal financial access by the year 2020. Arguably, extending an individual’s access to finance is the first step towards building an enhanced standard of living. More importantly, financial inclusion is key in upgrading the living conditions of poor farmers and other vulnerable groups such as women
and the youth. In Ghana, many more people live in rural areas than in cities. Thus, an increased growth of the rural market will ultimately lead to a growth in the national economy. It is for this reason that extending financial services and lending opportunities to rural households is essential. Literature on the importance of financial inclusion indicate that factors such as levels of income, inequality and literacy move closely with levels of human development. This study endeavours to bring to the fore the impact that the availability of basic or low cost bank accounts to cocoa farmers in rural areas of Ghana can have in promoting the use of banking services in particular, and financial inclusion in general.","['financial inclusion', 'cocoa', 'Akuafo cheque', 'rural banks', 'farmers', 'rural areas']"

This study also proposes a toolkit and a new methodology of discourse analysis based on framing, myth and legitimation to understand these speeches and the usefulness of autopoiesis as a new concept to recognise the discourse.
The analysis shows that the general frame in the Latin American new Left discourse is based in cultural resonance and a problem-solution logic as part of substantive and procedural framing. Moreover, the study shows that this discourse has a multidimensional legitimation and that it uses myth as a regular tool to support the speech. Finally, this study uses autopoiesis to respond to the research question, as a new perspective applied to discourse which is treated as a living system, to comprehend the unceasing framing of “myth making” in order to legitimate initial discourses of Presidents Morales, Chavez and Correa.","['discourse', 'framing', 'myth', 'legitimation', 'legitimacy', 'autopoiesis']"

The policy action evolved had an effect of containing import growth. The policy action was aligned with the objective of National Steel Policy, however, stakeholder companies and Industry associations desired other policy actions too. Stakeholder’s classification as provided in theoretical framework has been arrived at by calculating salience based on attributes of power, legitimacy and urgency towards MIP policy action. The results of stakeholder’s salience and MIP decision have been analysed to show correlatable findings as per theory of stakeholder’s salience.

It employs qualitative methodology and case study approach. Also it takes critical perspective of social capital and value chain development and frames the analysis on asymmetry power distribution among local chain actors and its implication on trust, collective action in fragile context of South Aceh-Indonesia. The overall research finding is that value chain development and social capital are necessary but not sufficient conditions in fragile context. VCD and social capital helps reduce transaction cost and foster collective action but simultaneously they benefits powerful and wellconnected groups at the expense of disadvantaged ones. Thus these two concepts have to be applied critically in fragile context when it comes to create sustainable
peace and inclusive development. And It has confirmed prior study that fragile context is not necessarily a “zone social capital deficiency”. Rather it both increases and decreases bonding and bridging social capital. In the context of South Aceh relatively speaking value chain development plays some roles to it.","['fragile context', 'social capital', 'value chain development', 'nutmeg', 'South Aceh-Indonesia']"
The effect of district proliferation in a decentralized Indonesia : The cases of South Sulawesi and West Sulawesi provinces,"Aprilia, Herwina Dian",2016-12-16,['Gómez Georgina M.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Indonesia's decentralization has shifted to the devolution process to cities and districts resulting in a large creation of new autonomous regions. Decentralization is claimed to improve public service provision. However, the transfer of public service delivery to local government together with the process of government units’ proliferation is argued to lead some challenges in the fiscal
balance and administrative capacity of the local government. Meanwhile, there are also arguments on the political motivation behind decentralization and district proliferation. This study tries to examine the effect of government's unit proliferation to the allocation of fiscal resource and the outcome of education service in South Sulawesi and West Sulawesi provinces, by comparing the conditions of the proliferated region compare to the non-proliferated region and the child region compare to the parent region. Although stronger conclusions are not possible due to the limitation of descriptive statistic method to handle causality issue, the findings of this study demonstrate that apart from any political motives behind government units’ proliferation process in Indonesia, there is the potential that new district creation may enhance service delivery by increasing the sensitivity to local need, with additional remarks that such
benefit comes together with additional cost for both local government and central government.","['decentralization', 'district proliferation', 'service delivery', 'education', 'local government', 'Indonesia']"

Maramba and Ata in East Sumba, Indonesia. This phenomenon is yet to be
widely studied unlike the caste system in India or the slavery in North
America. The term being used to define the system in this study is itself
still contested. I argue in this study that the caste system, the practices of
slavery and concubinage are all simultaneously present. However, the degree
of slavery is more prominent, and therefore this study emphasizes on
analyzing the slavery system.
By using ethnography approach and adopting Joan W. Scott’s
framework, this study analyzes how cultural symbols, ideology and social
institutions existing in the villages contribute to the construction of identity
and the sustaining of the slavery system.
Evidences from the fieldwork showed that the continuity of slavery
practices is resulted from the solid attachment of the people to their cultural
symbols that widen the gap between Maramba and Ata. The hegemonic
ideology where people believe in ‘blood purity’ and the greatness of Maramba
is also continuously produced, practiced and sustained. Furthermore,
local institutions, including rule and regulation, especially the adat, and the
division of roles and sanctions in the society provide the solid platform in
governing and forcing the people to adhere to their tradition.","['slavery', 'caste system', 'power relations', 'concubinage', 'Maramba-Ata', 'identity', 'construction', 'Sumba', 'East Sumba', 'Indonesia']"

Merry has argued that society views the state as the guardian of social justice
and likewise that citizens assume that it is the duty of the government to solve
problems associated with violence against women and girls (2009:5). The Zimbabwean
government showed its commitment to promoting women and children’s
rights by ratifying international and regional treaties like the African
Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which expressly condemns
child marriage, and adopting a new Constitution in 2013 that observes children’s
rights which were not included in the old Constitution. However, the
government’s ‘piecemeal’ reforms which left the existing marriage laws unaligned
with the Constitution led former child brides and human rights activists
to challenge the constitutionality of the marriage laws in the country. This led
to the subsequent landmark ruling of January 2016 ending child marriage. Using
a socio-legal perspective, this paper analyses how transnational laws can be
translated into the Zimbabwean native context and promote children’s rights

European NGOs and the Naga freedom struggle: transnational engagements.,"Muivah, Worrin",2016-12-16,['Zarkov Dubravka'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The signing of the Peace Accord between the NSCN-IM and the Indian
Government in August 2015 brought to an end the sixty plus years long armed struggle between the

of blood and tears along the way. There have been quite a few players and stakeholders in the
process, who have made the signing of the Peace Accord possible, or have offered aid to the Naga
regions and thus contributed to the regional development and stability. Most notable among these
players, but often the most overlooked are the European NGOs. These NGOs have provided the
Nagas their much needed links with the rest of the world, and voice outside India. This research
looks into two such organizations: Naga International Support Center (NISC) based in Amsterdam,
Netherlands and another European NGO (to be referred to as: ENGO), exploring the transnational
relationships and solidarities, studying the work of these two organizations. The research found out
that the two organizations have very different ways of working, the former engaged in political
support and transnational solidarity, the latter in development aid. Each way has its own
consequences in terms of who is the main partner and what can be achieved in the process. This

Reconciling self reliance & external assistance in the development process:  the case of Eritrea,Mehretab Medhanie,2016-12-16,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Self-reliance has been the development principle of Eritrean State since its independence in 1991, a principle inherited from its long years of liberation struggle. As a new and poor country, Eritrea requires external assistance. However, relations with partners are persistently strained due to ideological differences, discord in strategies and policy frameworks. Eritrea follows the ‘developmental state’ model where the state is the driving force of development, spearheaded by the only political organization in the country-the PFDJ. On the other hand, donors fall within the liberal or neo-liberal continuum; where the private sector plays a driving force and political pluralism is emphasized.    Countries that pursue self-reliant development policy pass through three discernible and temporal phases-(i) partial dissociation/disengagement, (ii) gradual restructuring and (iii) re-association (Biersteker 1980: 229-264). Although Eritrea’s development path within these three typologies had faced persistent interruptions; the country has modelled its own development path mirroring its self-reliance and ownership principle amidst a global aid system which adheres to a set of explicit and implicit norms. The development and the sustenance of strong ownership involves negotiations relative to once negotiating capital. This indeed is different to idealistic donor-recipient marriage of interests; it manifests a power-control features as neither the ‘recipient’ nor the ‘donor’ is passive in the process of negotiation (Whitfield and Fraser 2010: 341–366). While the three-phase process was arduous; the evidence show that it has worked for Eritrea. Eritrea owns its development strategy, on its own terms and in the ‘Eritrean way’, with external assistance only coming in case of capacity gaps. However, the sustenance and translation of the national self-reliance policy at the community level requires shared understanding, wider mass participation and the presence of civil society. While Eritrea has modelled its own form of mass participation based on local social movements, the country’s increasingly tight restriction of civil society, circumventing of aid management and lack of political pluralism raises questions over the feasibility of its selfreliant principle. Notwithstanding the persistent hiccups to the process of selfreliance, Eritrea’s travel through the contours of the three phases was dynamic, continually evolving and merits its own features that can be learnt in the quest for alternative development for the developing world.","['Self-Reliance', 'Partnership', 'Cooperation', 'Community Participation', 'Ownership', 'Development Assistance', 'Aid', 'Aid Negotiation', 'Civil Society', 'Social Movement']"

"Grey Academic Degree Market in India: 
A Mixed Method Study","Majilla, Tanmoy",2016-12-16,['Rieger Matthias'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In India, there exists a grey market of degree certificates, where legal degree certificates can be bought. The local agents work as mediator between the certificate seekers and the certificate providing universities. This research combines qualitative ethnographic research and quantitative field experiment to uncover the various dimensions of the grey degree certificate market in India. The grey degree market is a complex and densely networked contour of numerous socio-economic and cultural factors. The grey certificates have symbolic meaning and economic meaning. The calculative buyers buy these grey degrees for numerous reasons and in diverse ways they incorporate these grey certificates in their life goal. Reproductive role plays important role, so the social acceleration. They are rational but the notion of rationality here goes beyond the arena of pure judgement.
The field experiment data reveal that those who can afford to buy grey credentials are in better position in the job market. In the field experiment, fictitious CVs with grey credentials are sent and these are controlled with another two CVs, one with an authentic credential and another one with no graduation degree credential. We measure callback rates as proxy to the employability of different types of certificates. On average grey degrees receive 8.33% more callbacks than having no graduation degree certificates. However, grey degrees receive on average 13.67% less callback than the callbacks. In terms of economic return women are in far better position in terms of return on grey credentials.","['Education', 'Degree Certificate', 'Grey Market', 'Commodification', 'Calculative Agent', 'Reproduction', 'Social Acceleration', 'Field Experiment']"
"Early Childhood Development in Urban Poor Locales in Colombia: 
Tensions and Liberation of Local Perspectives","Franco Franco, María Camila",2016-12-16,['Okwany Auma'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In recent years, Early Childhood Development (ECD) has become a policy concern in Latin America. Despite the great efforts to provide comprehensive ECD services for children in poor locales, these services are still far from the local realities and focused on deficiencies in these marginalized contexts instead of the potentialities that they can offer. This research is an attempt to explore the ways in which ECD policy framework in Colombia influences local practices in a context of urban poverty in Soacha a town near to Bogotá.
The study draws on empirical evidence policy makers, teachers, caregivers and children as well as secondary data to argue that policy framework in Colombia promotes a Western ECD model that contrast with the actual experiences of communities in urban poor locales. Accordingly, the paper teased out the power/knowledge relations embedded in the ECD field in Colombia by uncovering the key policy assumptions on issues of universalism, quality and family strengthening. Simultaneously, is illustrated its influence in program’s implementation and the varied intersections with economic and cultural issues of childhood and childcare in this context. The findings revealed that beyond these discursive practices, people in contexts of urban poverty navigate within them developing coping and resilient strategies as counter narratives to the dominant ECD framework.","['Childhood', 'Care', 'Early Childhood Development', 'Local Knowledge', 'urban poverty']"
"Youth Council as Saling-Pusa:
Part of the Political Arena, But Not as Legitimate Players","Sayoc, Michelle Rose P.",2016-12-16,['Cheney Kristen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Children and youth participation have been institutionalized in Philippine policies,
predating the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child’s (UN CRC’s) call of
valuing children and youth participation in civic affairs. This research argues that even
though children and youth have been highly regarded in Philippine policy and in practice –
the inclusion is tokenistic and manipulated, as observed in my research on youth councils. I
use a Filipino term, saling-pusa, to describe the youth council’s position in the government.
Saling-pusa is a title given to younger kids who tag along in a game with older kids. It is a
symbolic position granted by the older ones to the young ones to give an impression of
inclusion – so that the young ones will not be upset and cry. I support my argument by
critically examining the various framing of youth and youth councils through policy-makers
discourse in a historical perspective – from previous administration up to the present.
Contradictions between policy and practice are illustrated by comparing policies with
experiences of youth council members. In the end, a conjecture of the future of the youth
council is made – and it seems that treating the youth council as a political saling-pusa will
persist with the current administration.","['Youth', 'Youth Councils', 'Policy', 'Philippines', 'Sangguniang Kabataan']"
"Chinese Undocumented Migrants in The
Hague:
Precarity, Work and the Search for Autonomy","Huang, Szu Hui",2016-12-16,['Siegmann Karin Astrid'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study is about Chinese undocumented migrant workers living in The
Hague. The study looks at their living conditions and working situation, and
how their ‘illegal’ stay in the country influences their ‘precarity’ and sense of
autonomy. Rooted in the belief that more research is needed on undocumented
migrants in particular, the study is also aimed at trying to find out how the
daily lives of undocumented Chinese migrants exhibit ‘precarity’, in relation to
their own experiences of balancing risks with the search for autonomy. The
study was based on informal conversations with undocumented migrant workers,
most of whom were contacted through Wereldhuis in The Hague, a
church-run advisory NGO operates for undocumented people in the city.
Through the interviews, and secondary literature, the study was able to reconstruct
the historical phases of migration from China to The Netherlands. In
addition, informal conversations allowed participants to give feedback on the
scope of the study and the study focus. This contextualised my own research
on the present-day situation of the undocumented. The key findings were that
although undocumented migrants do experience precarity at work, they can
help themselves towards greater autonomy through acquiring language skills,
and through creating wider social networks. One obstacle they face is that being
concentrated in the catering industry, there were few contacts with trade
unions for most of the research participants.","['Undocumented', 'migrant worker', 'Chinese', 'Netherlands', 'precarity', 'work', 'life', 'conditions', 'autonomy']"

"Skill Training Programs and Employment
Prospects in Bihar: 
A Study in Darbhanga District","Chakravorty, Bhaskar",2016-12-16,['Bedi Arjun'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In a number of countries, youth unemployment is a pressing economic and
political concern. In the Indian context 54% of the country‟s population of
1.21 billion is below 25 years of age and faces a high rate of (disguised) unemployment.
To augment youth employment, the Government of India has
launched a number of skills training programs in several states of India. This
thesis deals with participation in and the impact of one of these programs
(DDU-JKY) located in Bihar, one of India‟s poorest states.
Participation in these programs is based on voluntary self-selection by
eligible candidates and it is not always clear whether those for whom the
programs are intended are actually able to access such programs. To examine
this issue, I estimate what determines participation in these training programs.
Furthermore, I also estimate the impact of participating in training
programs on employment and earnings of participants as compared to nonparticipants.
The study is based on a survey of 526 respondents conducted in
July and August 2016 in Darbhanga District in Bihar. All respondents were
residents of Darbhanga district and had applied for 3 months training program
implemented under DDU-GKY.
My analysis shows that participation in training programs significantly
depends on program awareness of the respondents. Aware individuals are 15
percentage points more likely to participate in the programs. Expected future
earnings perceived by the individuals from the training programs are
crucial determinant of program participation. 1% increase in expected
monthly earnings increases programme uptake by 5%. Furthermore, expectation
of future earning varies significantly with program awareness. Increase
in program awareness increases monthly expected earnings by Rs.
2600 to Rs.2900. Thus, increasing program awareness is essential to increase
program uptake by target population.
Participation in training programs was not identified to have impact on
outcome indicators. One reason was lack of job opportunities in local market
but equally important were hindrances to job market entry posed by existing
social structure prevalent in the area.","['Skill Building Programs', 'Rural', 'Unemployment', 'Participation', 'Expected', 'Future Earning', 'Program Awareness', 'Impact', 'Bihar', 'India', 'Youths']"
"Bridging the Gap Between Gendered Access and
Completion: The Educational Exclusion Experiences of
Girls in Rural Tanzania","Sanga, Hoffman Hans",2016-12-16,['Okwany Auma'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Several studies conducted on the factors responsible for the educational
exclusion of girls in Tanzanian and likewise, various actors at both international
and national level have come up with many strategies towards attaining a
higher level of female enrolment in secondary schools. In Tanzania, there are
limited opportunities for a girl to be educated and efforts by the government to
address the problem are outshined by the high percentage of non-completion
of the mandated schooling years. The Government of Tanzania has attempted
to implement the necessary policies and programs aimed at curbing the exclusion
of girls from school. While the enrollment record for girls in schools appears
to be impressive, the number of girls that are non-completers is quite
alarming. Without critical examination of the process that leads to the exclusion
of girls in school, the government will continue to chunk out statistics that
did not resonate with the realities of rural areas in regards to why girls dropped
out from school. For example, the 2014 statistics of Tanzania Ministry of Education
suggested that truancy was responsible for 75% of students not completing
their education. On the contrary, evidence gathered from the data collection
shows that factors such as distance and pregnancy that were relegated
to the lesser position by the government statistics are much more crucial to the
understanding of the non-completion of studies. Therefore, this study attempted
to investigate deeply the exclusionary factors that hindered girls education
completion in Tanzania rural areas by exploring the experiences of the girls
themselves to have a clear understanding how to address the issue of girl’s exclusion
from their perspective. To achieve the set objectives, a qualitative approach
to data collection through the methodological tool of focus group discussion
and semi-structured interviews were adopted in a purposively selected

The State of Communal Farmers’ Livelihoods and Vulnerability in Rural Zimbabwe after the Fast Track Land Reform Program (FTLRP):  A Case Study of the Hurungwe District,"Gamundani, Peter",2016-12-16,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Land ownership is a recognised human right. Being in possession of land can be the
foundation for livelihood strategies. Land ownership also has a relationship with vulnerability
patterns especially among those communities that depend on farming for their survival. Using
a mixed methods approach, this study interrogated the Zimbabwe Fast Track Land Reform
Programme (FTLRP) and its impact on rural livelihoods and vulnerability patterns before and
after the year 2000. The sustainable livelihoods framework was employed as a theoretical
framework in unpacking the study. The study findings pointed to asset ownership structure as
important in determining vulnerability and livelihoods among communal farmers. Those
endowed with more assets significantly produced more from their land based activities. The
findings also showed that the challenges of the Zimbabwean economy invariably impacted on
vulnerability and livelihood patterns. Apparently, any land reform without the necessary
support (through finance, relevant assets and the necessary infrastructure) was generally not
effective in reducing poverty. Land reform consequently must be complemented by
programmes that enabled land beneficiaries to access financing and support in the form of
assets that assisted them to utilise their land more productively. It was also noted that due to
constrained livelihoods, some beneficiaries ended up resorting to relying on the natural
resources through cutting down of trees for resale and engaging in unregulated mining
activities. Climate change was a reality as most respondents had a perception that droughts
were becoming more frequent and this affected their livelihoods. Any land reform
programme hence must be comprehensive in order to have any significant impact on
communal farmers’ livelihoods patterns.","['Fast Track Land Reform Program', 'livelihoods', 'assets', 'vulnerability', 'climate change']"

"Lived Experiences and Social Relations of Power: Young Widows in Urban Trivandrum, Kerala","Mohan, Priya",2016-12-16,['Chhachhi Amrita'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Death is an inescapable reality of life. It is always shocking and often traumatic when our beloved ones depart from our life. This paper aims to analyze the deprivations of young widows in urban Trivandrum, Kerala and their experiences as a result of the painful transition from wife to widowhood. The transformation that a conjugal bereavement brings to someone often leads him/her to a crossroad. Like in any patriarchal dominated society, married women in most households in Kerala are under the protection of their husband. He is usually the main breadwinner and provides the economic and social security for his wife and children. In the sudden absence of her spouse, besides encountering an unexpected shock, a widowed woman undergoes a radical life altering path. It leaves her with high instability in terms of economic, emotional, physical and social well-being which is an often neglected issue in Kerala despite the high social indicators for women. The aim of the thesis is to understand the lived experiences of a few young widows with children and the challenges they face in coping up and living a fulfilling a good human life. A qualitative study based on narratives with eighteen young widows was conducted using unstructured interviews. In an effort to understand the coping mechanisms and negotiations around the normative restrictions on widows and ways in which widows’ express their agency; concepts of gender, sexuality and agency have been used. The paper concludes by examining their lives based on the broader normative framework of Nussbaum’s capability approach with a view to shaping public policy.","['Widows', 'Widowhood', 'Women', 'Gender', 'Sexuality', 'Agency', 'Capabilities', 'Kinship', 'Property rights', 'Patriarchy']"

Social and Solidarity Economy scale beyond contradictions: The case of the actors of the Alternative Community Commercialization Network (Red Comal) in Honduras,"Díaz-Meco, Paula Sánchez de la Blanca",2016-12-06,['Gómez Georgina M.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper looks at Comal, a large Honduran Social and Solidari-ty Economy (SSE) network of peasants that supports the commercialization of its members‟ products since 1995. The paper sets out two interrelated objec-tives. Firstly, I aim to understand how Comal‟s members live and cope with the contradictions between their collective values and their practices. Secondly, I explore how these contradictions are related to Comal‟s large-scale, mirroring the challenges of growth in SSE. Taking an ethnographic approach, the focus of analysis is Comal‟s actors‟ subjective narratives and practices. The research showed that Comal‟s mem-bers‟ experiences of contradictions can be explained by centralization and pro-fessionalization processes related to large-scale. Thus, Comal‟s actors also have a role in making sense of and shaping these contradictions by (re)adjusting their SSE principles and practices, as analyzed through two examples. Drawing on literature about social organizations and diverse economic re-lations and practices, this research is brought into conversations about struc-ture and agency in the Social and Solidarity Economy. In contrast to what is implied in some SSE debates, I will argue that SSE organizations are not bound to “degenerate” when they become big. Contradictions triggered by up-scaling can be interpreted not as “negative” outcomes of growth but rather as a dynamic process. By exploring what I call “the social life of contradictions”, it became clear that SSE organizations are a nuanced mixture of co-existing prin-ciples and practices, and their members, as SSE agents, make sense and shape their perceived contradictions. It implies that (re)embedding the local economy in a SSE project is a messy process never completely achieved and not free from inconsistencies. This hints at a more nuanced interpretation of challenges and responses of how SSE projects are up-scaled and sustained while holding its core principles and objectives.",

This study examines Dutch-American relations in the Arab-Israeli conflict between 1967 and 1974. The main question is: Why did the Dutch government continue to support Israel between 1967 and 1974? Was this due to American pressure? First, this research elaborates on the background and the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Furthermore, it explores the background of Dutch-Israeli and American-Israeli relations. After providing the reader with sufficient context on the topic, the last two chapters focus on Dutch and American policies towards the Six Day War (1967) and the October War and subsequent oil crisis (1973-1974). The last two chapters examine if the United States pressured the Dutch government in supporting Israel. This research is based on both primary and secondary sources. The primary sources include sources from the Roosevelt Study Center, transcripts of Dutch parliamentary meetings, and WikiLeaks, as well as two interviews.","['Dutch foreign policy', 'Atlanticism', 'Dutch-American relations', 'Arab-Israeli conflict', 'Israel', 'Palestine', 'Middle East', 'Cold War', 'Political influence']"

Do mitigation plans come true?,"Heemann, J.S. (Jeniffer)",2016-11-01,['Grafakos S. (Stelios)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"European cities voluntarily adopt targets and climate action plans with the objective of
reducing GHG emissions related to urban activities. Although studies confirm the importance
of cities’ action in mitigating climate change, it is still unknown the extent to which their
mitigation plans become a reality, and the factors that influence their execution. This study is
one of the first attempts to assess the status of implementation of urban-scale mitigations
actions undertaken by 113 European cities through the Sustainable Energy Action Plan, and
to analyse the governance factors that drive and constrain the implementation of such
measures. The governance factors are related to the three variables: local framing, political
actors and factors, and local government capacity, which institutionalises the governance
aspects within local governments.
Based on a survey, SEAPs’ monitoring reports, and academic literature, the study shows that
58% of the mitigation actions are being implemented, while the other half is divided into
completed and not started actions. Political authority and the inclusion of the mitigation
policies in the city’s budget appear as the main drivers of implementation, while the main
barriers are lack of staff and the fact that climate change mitigation is not mainstreamed
among other government’s departments. The availability of knowledge and information
regarding mitigation at the local level is both considered as a main driver and a main barrier.
The study also analyses the critical factors of implementation in each of the nine sectors of
the SEAP. In two-thirds of the sectors, it is essential that the mitigation actions are aligned
with the cities’ priorities and with national policies, while the most common barriers to
implementation across sectors are the resistance of the private sector and the lack of cobenefits
offered by the measures adopted. Furthermore, the analysis highlights that the
mitigation actions related to local electricity production have the highest potential to reduce
emissions, but are the least implemented by European cities, mainly because of the
interactions of the local governments with the national government and the private sector.","['Climate change', 'mitigation', 'climate action plan', 'governance', 'implementation']"

Deze krant, geschreven door jeugd voor jeugd, was halverwege de jaren zestig een opmerkelijke verschijning. De opvallende vormgeving en de controversiële inhoud zorgden ervoor dat de haren van veel ouderen recht overeind gingen staan. Het blad was volgens hen een tijdschrift voor langharig werkschuw tuig, dat liever gisteren dan vandaag moest worden verbannen. Hitweek verzette zich hiertegen; het wilde ‘een eigen alles voor iedereen’. Het blad werd populair onder jongeren uit het gehele land, maar dat ging niet zonder slag of stoot. De spanningen tussen de vooroorlogse- en naoorlogse generatie kwamen in Hitweek duidelijk naar voren. Jongeren uitten in het blad veel kritiek op ouderen: de vooroorlogse generatie en de gevestigde orde. Hitweek profileerde zich als een progressief en vernieuwend blad. Jongeren bevestigden hun onafhankelijkheid erin door zich los te maken van de manier waarop hun ouders hadden geleefd. Dit kwam onder meer tot uiting in de aandacht voor nieuwe muziekgenres (beat) en modetrends (lang haar), in het taalgebruik (fonetisch) en in de vernieuwende grafische vormgeving. Hiermee leek sprake te zijn van een uiting van een nieuw begin en een breuk met het verleden, maar het verleden werd ook gebruikt om de eigen positie te legitimeren; bijvoorbeeld bij het construeren van de eigen identiteit. In het kader van de discussies over lang haar publiceerde Hitweek een afbeelding waarop de lange pijpenkrullen van Johann Sebastian Bach werden verweven met Elvis Presley, een icoon van de nieuwe jeugd. Omdat veel jongeren boos en verontwaardigd waren over de kritiek van ouderen op hun kapsel, gebruikte Hitweek in dit geval het verleden als middel om de eigen positie te legitimeren. Daarnaast werden modetrends uit de jaren dertig in Hitweek op een voetstuk geplaatst en gebruikt om de eigen, ‘vernieuwende’ identiteit vorm te geven. Om zicht te krijgen op hoe een deel van de jongeren in de jeugdcultuur van de jaren zestig omging met het verleden, is het blad Hitweek (1965-1969) onderzocht. De manier waarop het verleden in het heden werd ingezet, de gecreëerde relatie tussen het heden en verleden en de historische periodes waarnaar verwezen werd, stonden hierbij centraal. De uitkomsten van dit onderzoek problematiseren het beeld dat in historiografie over de jaren zestig bestaat over een progressieve en vernieuwende naoorlogse generatie die op zoek ging naar een eigen, van ouderen onafhankelijke jeugdcultuur. De aversie bij jongeren tegen de manier waarop oudere generaties hadden geleefd, bleek niet hand in hand te gaan met een algemene afkeer van hun verleden. Het verleden werd, zo blijkt uit dit onderzoek, zowel positief als negatief gebruikt door jongeren bij de vorming van een identiteit. Het verleden werd gebruikt als een instrument om kritiek te uiten, maar óók als een instrument om de eigen identiteit te verrijken.","['Jaren zestig', 'Jeugdcultuur', 'Generatieconflict', 'Verleden', 'Instrumentalisme', 'Populaire cultuur', 'Identiteit']"

From Paucity to Inefficiency: The Case of Democratic Governance,Tej Gonza,2016-10-07,"['prof. dr. J.J. Vromen', 'prof. dr. G.M. Hodgson']",Erasmus School of Philosophy,"The participatory governance on the workplace remains rare. Control does not follow
ownership by logical necessity; why, then, is the capitalist enterprise so prevalent? Oliver
Williamson, Michael Jensen, Henry Hansmann and some other scholars take the paucity of
labour-managed firms (i.e. the prevalence of capitalist firm) as the evidence for the
inefficiency of democratic governance. For support to this proposition, they turn to the early
characterization of the evolutionary dynamics on competitive markets by Armen Alchian
(1950). He argues that firms are selected for according to their relative profits, and that the
relatively profitable production behaviour prevails on the markets. Similarly, the Efficiency
Branch argues that it is the relatively efficient organizational form that prevails on the
markets. Thus; if we observe an organizational form to be rare, this means that it is relatively
inefficient. In my thesis, I show that the evolutionary argument employed in support of this
proposition is incomplete. Prevalence consists of both differential survival and differential
birth, therefore, we should also be able to explain how different organizational modes enter
the markets. I introduce the appropriation hypothesis that suggests that capitalist enterprise
is formed more often because it allows easier appropriation of benefits for certain groups,
and not necessarily because it is technologically superior. As long as we define inefficiency
in the terms of technological inefficiency, we cannot take the paucity of labour-managed
firms as the evidence for their inefficiency.",

De vlucht van het leven,M. de  Vries,2016-09-30,"['J.A. Baggerman', 'G. Oonk']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Mijn masterthesis had als doel om meer inzicht te krijgen in het leven van ‘expats’. Om dit te bewerkstelligen is er een autobiografie onderzocht van één ‘expats’ echtpaar. Aan de wetenschappelijke literatuur over ‘expats’ (zie hoofdstuk drie)  zijn vijf concepten (identiteit, het contact met de lokale bevolking, het contact met de gemeenschap, nostalgie en heimwee) ontleend, die belangrijk zijn in het leven van ‘expats’. Deze vijf concepten vormden de rode draad van deze masterthesis. Per onderzochte periode is er gekeken naar de manier waarop deze vijf concepten terugkomen in de memoires. 

Het echtpaar had in alle onderzochte perioden weinig contact met de lokale bevolking. Het contact dat het echtpaar onderhield met de lokale bevolking bestond voornamelijk uit zakelijke contacten. Met name de man van het echtpaar had in de zes onderzochte perioden zakelijke contacten met de lokale bevolking. De vrouw kwam vooral in contact met de lokale bevolking bij het doen van boodschappen of het aansturen van de bedienden.

Het echtpaar had in alle perioden hoofdzakelijk contact met andere Nederlanders en Westerse ‘expats’. Dit komt overeen met de wetenschappelijke literatuur die besproken is in hoofdstuk drie. Met deze groep voelde het echtpaar zich verbonden en het bood hen een bepaalde vertrouwdheid en verbondenheid. Bovendien bleef het echtpaar ook in contact staan met de gemeenschap in Nederland. Zij bleven verbonden met Nederland door persoonlijke relaties met familie, zakelijke contacten met het hoofdkantoor van de KLM en Nederlandse media. 

Het echtpaar en dan met name de vrouw (zij heeft tenslotte het meest geschreven) heeft het  besef dat de beschreven situaties tot het verleden behoren en zich nooit meer zullen voordoen.  Naar sommige landen zoals Sierra-Leone verlangde het echtpaar ook terug, daarom keerde het echtpaar een aantal jaar na hun vertrek ook weer terug in Sierra-Leone voor een korte vakantie.  Er zijn dus zeker nostalgische elementen te vinden in de memoires. Het echtpaar zal echter niet terugverlangd hebben naar alle perioden. De sterkte van de nostalgische elementen in de memoires verschilt dan ook per periode. 

In de memoires van het onderzochte echtpaar zijn met name in de beginperiode van hun ‘expats’ carrière elementen van heimwee te vinden. Deze elementen van heimwee werden voornamelijk veroorzaakt door een cultuurschok, een breuk in de dagelijkse routines, het niet kunnen deelnemen in bekende sociale en culturele netwerken en lokale moeilijkheden.  

In de memoires van het echtpaar is weinig over de economische belangen of motieven van het echtpaar zelf geschreven. Dit is opmerkelijk omdat het aannemelijk is dat het echtpaar koos voor een ‘expats’ carrière uit financiële overwegingen (Dit is een aanname en staat niet expliciet in de memoires).  Daarentegen wordt er wel sporadisch iets opgemerkt over de economische belangen van de KLM (bijvoorbeeld tijdens de boycot van de KLM in Libië). 

De gekozen concepten (identiteit, het contact met de lokale bevolking, het contact met de gemeenschap, nostalgie en heimwee) komen in elk land en elke periode op een andere manier in de memoires naar voren. ‘Wat’ het echtpaar schreef was erg afhankelijk van de lokale situatie(s).","['Autobiografie', 'Egodocumenten', 'Expat(s)', 'Heimwee', 'Identiteit', 'KLM', 'Memoires', 'Nostalgie']"
‘Politiek’ in de moderniteit,Boris Pulskens,2016-09-28,"['dr. S. van Tuinen', 'dr. G.H. van Oenen']",Erasmus School of Philosophy,"In deze bachelorscriptie maak ik een analyse van politiek in de moderniteit aan de hand van een vergelijking tussen ‘The Human Condition’ van Hannah Arendt en ‘Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare life’ van Giorgio Agamben. De visies op politiek van beide filosofen lenen zich goed voor een vergelijking, omdat deze sterk geworteld zijn in de antropologie. De scriptie begint met een onderzoek naar de filosofische oorsprong van politiek in de Griekse oudheid. Nadat hiermee een beeld is geschetst van de respectievelijke standpunt van Arendt en Agamben, behandel ik een aantal gebeurtenissen die bepalend zijn geweest voor vorming van de politieke wereld in de moderniteit. Vervolgens bespreek ik de overeenkomsten en verschillen tussen hun analyses van politiek in de moderniteit. Het belangrijkste verschil dat naar voren komt is Agambens controversiële notie van soevereiniteit die in scherp contrast staat met Arendts noties van pluraliteit, nataliteit en het menselijke vermogen vrij te handelen.",
Digital Media Data and Market Intelligence Management for International Business,W. Li,2016-09-28,"['J.S. Lee', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the last decade, digital media platforms have become important communication channels between businesses and consumers. Unstructured data management has become even more imperative of corporate communication these days. A lot of interactive data between consumers and companies are available online. However, they are not fully utilized, especially those unstructured format that is not currently compatible with many analytical tools and platforms. Unstructured digital media data management is one of the most mentioned challenge in digital marketing practices but has rarely been sufficiently launched and also lack of empirical research. The present study aims to identify how big data analytics are conducted and what the strategic framework have been used to launch. 
A semantic network analysis and thematic analysis study with 15 strategy director of digital marketing in the Netherlands was conducted. To make use of these data, suitable operational environment in the companies is needed and also the strategic framework of big data analytics. This study proposes a new approach to digital data analysis, which enables marketers to retrieve market insights with the aforementioned characteristics of unstructured data across digital media channels. In this new approach the data are analyzed semantically by data presentation tools and further developed following the principles of thematic analysis, after a comprehensive literature review has been conducted to guide the analysis strategy. Evaluation criteria weights are derived on the basis of findings through the literature. The relationships between nodes are identified by statistical semantic network analysis. These relationships are analyzed based on within-case and across-case analysis approaches, node co-occurrence functions. 
Based on the results, thematic analysis of current practice regarding digital media structured data analytics in the Netherlands is still under developing stage, and semantics of unstructured datasets are hardly being probed. Organizations should be aware of the factors that may affect the results and competence of big data analytics and invest in resources such as knowledge and human. Also, companies should consider to build up guidelines to make this mechanism as valuable as possible for the business. The conceptual framework customer journey is widely used among b2c and media agencies in an attempt to acquire market knowledge. Various tools, resources, and competence in analytics are all in place, whereas real insights are still hard to achieve.","['Big Data', 'Digital Marketing', 'Market Insights', 'Data Driven Strategy', 'Digital Media Data Analytics']"

Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Dit onderzoek is onderdeel van de Master Media & Cultuur van de Erasmus Universiteit van Rotterdam. In deze thesis is onderzoek gedaan naar de beweegredenen van de lezers van Scandinavische thrillers om de boeken uit dit genre te lezen, waarbij de volgende onderzoeksvraag gesteld is: Wat zijn de beweegredenen van lezers van Scandinavische thrillers om boeken uit dit genre te lezen en in hoeverre komen hun interpretaties van dit genre overeen met de frames uit de media? De afgelopen decennia is de populariteit van de Scandinavische thriller in een stroomversnelling geraakt en zijn er door verschillende mediacritici en mediaprofessionals uitspraken gedaan over wat de redenen kunnen zijn voor de stijgende populariteit van het genre. Diepgaand respondentie-onderzoek door wetenschappers is hierbij echter uitgebleven. Deze thesis tracht een bijdrage te leveren aan de vraagstukken rondom de groeiende populariteit van het genre door respondentie-onderzoek uit te voeren, aan de hand van semigestructureerde diepte-interviews. Door het gebruik van deze methode is achterhaald dat het lezerspubliek van de Scandinavische thriller gecharmeerd is van de schrijfstijl van de Scandinavische auteurs, het psychologische karakter dat de auteurs verwerken in hun verhalen en de kritische noot die verweven is in de boeken. Verder is onderzocht in hoeverre de interpretaties van de lezers over dit genre overeenkomen met de vooropgestelde frames van mediacritici en mediaprofessionals. Waarbij aangetoond is dat een aantal van deze frames onderkend worden door de respondenten, zoals de gelijkwaardigheid tussen man en vrouw en de mysterieuze aard die het landschap en de omgeving met zich meebrengen. Hoewel soortgelijke frames onderkend worden door zowel mediacritici als mediaprofessionals is uit onderzoek gebleken dat de invloed van mediacritici en mediaprofessionals in mindere mate doorslaggevend is in het uiteindelijke keuzeproces van de lezers, maar dat de echte waarde gehecht wordt aan de mening van mensen die dichter bij het lezerspubliek staan. Uit onderzoek is verder ook gebleken dat typerende kenmerken van de Scandinavische thriller en de frames die hierbij aangedragen worden ervoor zorgen dat de Scandinavische thriller meer gewaardeerd wordt dan andere misdaadromans. Het onderzoek heeft door middel van het combineren van wetenschappelijke literatuur, inzichten vanuit de media en voornamelijk de visie van de lezers zelf, uitgewezen wat de belangrijkste aspecten zijn van Scandinavische thrillers en wat veronderstelt dat dit genre de aankomende jaren alleen maar aan populariteit zal winnen.","['Scandinavische thriller', 'sociaal-politiek engagement', 'frames', 'beweegredenen', 'betekenisgeving']"
Commuting by bicycle in Rotterdam: Encouraging and discouraging factors,"Pintusava, H. (Hanna)",2016-09-01,['Sharma S. (Somesh)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"With the worldwide increasing demand for urban mobility and urban kilometres travelled, the cities are facing new ecological, social and environmental challenges in transportation system. To cope with these challenges, addressing the root – behaviour of users – and prioritizing sustainable modes of transport would be essential. Bicycle is one of such transportation modes – it is efficient, environmentally friendly and physically beneficial for its user. The Netherlands is world renown for cycling both in terms of existing bicycle culture and in the quality of infrastructure provided. However, one of its largest cities, Rotterdam is lacking behind with a bicycle share lower than the country average, especially for work trips. For this reason, travel behaviour and bicycle use of commuters in Rotterdam was thoroughly investigated in this study.
The main objective of this research was to explain the determinants of the current level of bicycle use in Rotterdam, specifically focusing on commuting. To achieve this objective, several groups of factors influencing user’s decision to (not) cycle were examined. The study included not only hard factors, such as factors of built and natural environment, socio-economic and demographic factors, trip characteristics, but it also covered often neglected soft factors – psychological.
Survey was used as the main strategy of the research collecting user perspective. It was complemented by interviews with the experts in the field of urban mobility. As a result, both quantitative and qualitative primary data was generated. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation and multiple linear regression in SPSS and Excel in order to explain the relationship between the level of bicycle use and a number of travel behaviour factors: built and natural environment, socio-economic and demographic factors, psychological factors and trip characteristics.
Based on the concepts of travel behaviour factors, the analysis revealed a number of statistically significant determinants of bicycle use in Rotterdam. The two encouraging factors were bicycle ownership and convenience of cycling to work, while the discouraging factors were the following: long trip distance, positive attitude towards use of other modes of transport for commuting (in particular, car and public transport use), subjective norm (friends and family expectations) towards car use, public transport use and walking to work location.
Research findings also indicate the significant share of commuters traveling by train from other cities. It is important to ensure that cycling facilities are well connected with the public transport and commuters-targeted rental programs are available. Additionally, considering the strong influence of subjective norm (especially of friends and family), promotion of cycling among potential target groups could contribute to increasing its share.","['Travel behaviour', 'cycling', 'sustainable mobility', 'commuting to work', 'urban mobility']"
Freeland of Oosterwold,"Tkachenko, O. (Oleksandra)",2016-09-01,['Tsatsou A. (Alexandra)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"After more than a hundred years of over-controlled master planning approaches dominance, urban specialists agreed that it failed. Even the most generous team can not predict all complexities and externalities of city developments. There are more and more theoretical and practical works, which insist that our cities should develop organically. Even though, the experience of the previous century should also be taking into account. That is why contemporary projects are trying to combine both top-down and bottom-up development.
This work focus on the development of urban expansion areas, which are traditionally totally influenced by the architect’s visions (the informal urban expansion is not taken into consideration in this thought). In the light of Organic Urbanism movements, these areas tend to give more opportunities and responsibilities to the future residents. With this in mind, the current study looks at residential Community Building as an essential parallel process with the actual spatial area development. Moreover, for many western countries these responsibilities deviations are new not only from the environment policy point of view but also for the society. Altogether, it determines the nature and focus of current study. The aim of the research is to explore the links between Organic Urban Expansion and Community Building as well as what is the influence of the Innovation Diffusion on it? The Almere Oosterwold is a case study for this research.
The study makes use of qualitative data. The main sources if information for this were interviews with future residents, municipality workers, architects; analysis of Facebook and Twitter posts, comments; secondary data as several interviews with project creators, information about Almere development history as well as project details. First, the analysis of this information leads to the identification aspects that influence on particular personal and community characteristics. Second, it showed the relationships of these characteristics with spatial characteristics of the different initiatives1. Finally, this analysis determinates several community and spatial projects typologies as well as result of their combinations.
At present, the actual development of Oosterwold consists of initiatives of different sizes (from a single detached house up to large developments with 60+ dwellings). Most of the initiators, who are building now or about to start it, are the pioneers of Oosterwold. Each of them had spent around two or even more ears on getting all necessary permits. This study detected what are the drivers and barriers which influence on the social composition among pioneers. It also shows that they form different types of communities depending on their attitudes and reasons of collaboration. It is important to realise that relationship inside those communities, their openness to the neighbours, decision-making power distribution and other aspects influence on the physical characteristics of their projects. For example, some of them have common space other do not; there are monotony projects and diverse.
Under those circumstances, it is important to understand to what kind of pioneers the strategy of Organic Urban Expansion correspond to achieve certain goals the urban professionals have.","['Organic City', 'New Town', 'Bottom-up', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Community Building', 'Almere', 'Oosterwold']"
External forces and adaptive governance,"Henkes, R.P. (Riccardo Palazzolo)",2016-09-01,['Gianoli A. (Alberto)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"“External forces and adaptive governance: The evolution of the 22@ Barcelona between
regeneration and innovation” is a research about the influence of economic, politic and
technological forces on the evolution of an urban regeneration project. The research focuses on
the analysis of the impact of such forces and the suitability of adaptive governance theory for
the analysis of the governance system.
This research considers the main theories of Urban Regeneration, Innovation Districts and
Adaptive Governance for the creation of the conceptual framework. The model is based on the
influence of external forces on the achievement of pre-established targets that have been
classified according to the triple transformation pursued: physical, economic and social. The
adaptive governance theory has been concentrated in three main assumptions (complexity,
conflict, uncertainty) and three main actions (anticipate, learn, adapt) obtained from adaptive
socio-ecological systems. Thanks to the adaptability of the project, the final outcome is the
result of the influence of the external forces and the consequent adaptation to such changes.
A qualitative case study approach is used to collect information and catch the evolution of the
project over more the 15 years. Semi-structured interviews and secondary data have been the
main sources of information used for the analysis. After considering the positive and negative
aspects of the different characteristics of the transformation, this study analysed the influence
of the external factors, selected due to their connection with the three main actors of the Triple
Helix approach: Public, private and academic sector.
The results of this study suggest that political and economic changes have a more consistent
influence in comparison of the technological aspects, mainly due the need of municipal
willingness and private funding in order to materialize the transformation. The impact of
technological aspect is partially influenced by the political (e.g. Smart City as a metropolitan
strategy) and economic (e.g. public and private R&D and the creation of new markets) forces.
The study also indicates the importance of having a bridging organization in order to deal with
a multi-level and multi-scale reality. In this reality is necessary to react to changes and adapt,
being crucial the communication and participation of all the stakeholders. Especially important
is to include the weak stakeholders that might not have the power or the capital to determine
the implementation of the project, but are main affected and need to have a feel of ownership
of the new reality is being created.
This need of adaptation suggests that further studies could focus on the cooperation among
actor towards an adaptive governance system. Further research could be done expanding the
system from a Triple Helix approach to a Quintuple Helix (civic, social, cognitive, public and
private actors) and analysing the real issues in designing and implementing and adaptive
governance system.","['Urban Regeneration', 'Innovation District', 'Adaptive Governance', 'External Factors', 'Complexity', 'Conflict', 'Uncertainty', 'Anticipate', 'Learn', 'Adapt', 'Bridging Organizations']"
Water-Energy-Climate Nexus CDMX,"Valek, A.M. (Adrián Moredia)",2016-09-01,"['Sušnik J. (Janez)', 'Grafakos S. (Stelios)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Global urbanisation is rapidly developing, with an expected seven billion urban residents by 2050. This rapid growth will put considerable stress on both water and energy resources in cities. While there is much research at the national and regional levels on the energy implications of water supply (the urban water-energy-climate ‘nexus’), there is relatively little at the city scale. In this paper, a city-level study of the urban water-energy-climate nexus is presented for México City (CDMX). It is shown that at present 50% of CDMX water (city total c. 1000 x 106 m3 yr-1) comes from a local aquifer with a further 30% deriving from energy-intensive surface sources which are pumped over considerable topography. The water supply system consumes currently 90% of the water system energy demand (city total c. 2500 x 106 kWh yr-1), and is responsible for the majority (90%) of the CO2e emissions (city total c. 750-2000 x 106 kg CO2e yr-1). In the wastewater sector, 80-90% is discharged with no or little treatment, with corresponding low energy demand. The small fraction that is treated accounts for the vast majority of energy use in the wastewater sector. This study also shows the uncertainty in energy demand and CO2e emissions when reliant on secondary data as it´s considerable over/under-estimated energy used compared with primary data. Three water savings mesaures are assessed for their impact on energy and CO2e emissions reductions. Considerable reductions in water supply volumes and concomitant energy consumption and CO2e emissions are possible. However the extent of implementation, and the effectiveness of any implemented solutions depend on financing, institutional backing and public support. Additional climate impacts are explored taking particular attention to water security, flood capacity enhancement and CO2 abatement to evaluate adaptation-mitigation interrelations. This work adds important city-level quantification of the urban water-energy-climate nexus, allowing operators and policy makers to discern which water-system elements are responsible for the greatest energy use and climate impact, and are therefore better equipped to make targeted operational decisions.","['Water', 'Energy', 'Climate', 'Nexus', 'Adaptation', 'Mitigation', 'Mexico City']"
Religion and economic development,"Qayyum, U. (Unbreen)",2016-09-01,['Burger M. (Martijn)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Historically, plethora of researchers has investigated the role of religion across multiple facets of human existence. Research in the field of religion and economic development is in its initial stage, and now many researchers are concerned about the non-economic factors and their role in the development of an economy. Religion is considered as the most important non-economic factor that construct the basic institutional infrastructure of a society. The role of religion is reflected in many aspects of human life i.e. personal as well as professional. Scholars have been examining the impact of religion on economic growth such as Weber Max, Robert Baro, Rachel McCleary etc. to mention few. All the previous studies have tried to examine the impact of religiosity on economic growth directly, but next to none has tried to examine the indirect relationship of religion and economic development via different channels. This study is thus aimed at exploring the indirect channels through which religion can influence economic growth such as ethics, poverty alleviation, political participation, social capital and mental health. This research also intends to investigate how religion can contribute to eliminate conflict that arises due to fractionalization (ethnic, religious and linguistic), polarization (ethnic and religious), ethnic and religious tensions etc. In addition, the association between religiosity and economic development at continental level is examined coupled with an effort to know the role of religion in the economic growth of developed and developing countries.
In this study religion has a positive direct effect on economic development and it is very significant. No strong evidence is found for the channels i.e. ethics, poverty alleviation, political participation, social capital and mental health through which religion mediates its effect on economic growth. Religion do mediate its effect through poverty, political participation and mental health, but it is not significant. It is hard to find any evidence that shows mediation effect of religion through ethics, and social capital. In case of fractionalization (ethnic, religious and linguistic), polarization (ethnic and religious), ethnic and religious tensions, they all have negative impact on economic growth. When their respective interaction terms with church attendance is included in the equation, all the coefficients of interaction term turnout to be positive except religious polarization, and these results are not significant. In economic development, religion also plays its role in various regions particularly in Asia and Europe where its impact is positive and is highly significant; Africa shows somewhat positive but insignificant results and in case of American region, the linkage of religion and economic development is not robust. Developing countries show the positive impact of religion on economic development but these results are not robust. In developed countries effect of religiosity on economic development is positive and it is robust as well.","['Religiosity', 'Ethics', 'Poverty Alleviation', 'Political Participation', 'Social Capital', 'Mental Health', 'Fractionalization', 'Polarization', 'Ethnic Tensions', 'Religious Tensions', 'Economic Development']"
Gender analysis of climate change and natural hazard related vulnerability perception,"Joshi, C. (Charu)",2016-09-01,"[""D' Acci L. (Luca)""]",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The purpose of this thesis is to understand how socio-cultural dynamics make women feel more vulnerable to climate change and natural hazards. The impacts and magnitude of climate change are not known. It is well recognized that climate change is not gender neutral. This thesis focuses on disadvantages and challenges that women face in terms of socio-cultural dynamics that may not give them equal access to resources and services that are necessary to respond to the negative effects of climate change and natural hazards. In order to come up with sustainable solutions to climate change and natural hazards, it is important to address gender dimensions, recognizing the fact than women and men have different needs and priorities. It is important that processes address the needs of both men and women. In many societies, women considered one of the most vulnerable and economically disadvantaged group, deal with several social constraints in their everyday lives that restrict their access to and control over vital resources. This research therefore, aims to understand how socio-cultural dynamics make women feel more vulnerable to climate change and natural hazards. The study also assumes that socio-cultural dynamics may also have indirect effect on vulnerability perception via influencing individual's socio-economic status, which is conceptualised as a combination of education, employment and income.
Socio-cultural dynamics, socio-economic status and vulnerability perception are the key concepts in this research. To measure these concepts in quantifiable units, they were operationalised into variables and then indicators based on various definitions. The study was conducted in 28 slums of Indore city in India where an equal number of male and female respondents were selected on the basis of a stratified random sampling. The study used a survey strategy to conduct the research because of large number of research units. Primary data was collected thorough questionnaires which included questions about the respondents socio-cultural context, socio-economic status and vulnerability perceptions. The data obtained was translated into SPSS and several statistical tests which included t-tests and regression, in order to compare the differences between men and women and to see the influence of socio-cultural dynamics and socio-economic status on vulnerability perception, were conducted. While socio-cultural dynamics, conceptualised as a combination of freedom on mobility, decision making power in the household, burden of household responsibilities and age of marriage, was found to be significantly influencing vulnerability perception, making women feel more vulnerable to men with burden of household responsibilities as the variable influencing vulnerability perception the most, socio-economic status when included in this model was not found to be a significant predictor of variations in vulnerability perception. However, this could be also because of the measurement approaches used for the variables of socio-economic status.
The research concludes that socio-cultural dynamics significantly differentiates vulnerability perceptions of men and women. And in order to create unbiased and sustainable responses to climate change and natural hazards, it is important to include local people in vulnerability assessments to understand their differing needs. While socio-cultural dynamics is critical domain where more research is required, the need for gender segregated data is strongly apparent.","['Socio-cultural dynamics', 'socio-economic status', 'vulnerability perception', 'gender', 'gender equality']"
The determinants for enhancing the competitiveness of service FDI in East Africa,"Tsegaye Yigezu, M. (Mekdes)",2016-09-01,"['Wall R. (Ronald)', 'Budding-Polo M. (Monserrat)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"According to Trade and Sustainable Development News and Analysis on Africa (2016),
Services now constitute the largest sector of the world economy, accounting for approximately
63.5 percent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). They also represent the largest sector
in 194 individual countries, among which 30 countries derive more than 80 percent of their
GDP from services-related activities.
African countries have also seen a considerable share of their GDP coming from the services
sector. As one of the key drivers of economic growth, services will have a significant role in
enabling Africa to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by the international
community. For Africa, to take full advantage of the economic and social opportunities offered
by services sector development, critical injections of foreign direct investment (FDI) are
required. However, inward FDI is currently mostly concentrated in the extractive and
agricultural sectors of only a few African countries, although evidence seems to indicate that
this is gradually changing.
African countries, including the East African ones, are opening their doors to attract service
FDI towards their country. Nowadays, Africa has become one of the strategic major regions of
global investing, which has grown strongly over the past five years. Ethiopia, the second
populous country in Africa, has been a leading Africa state for more than 50 years. The
comparatively central location of the country, coupled with being host to the headquarters of
several international organizations, has helped accelerating Ethiopian economic growth. This
has resulted in an increasing demand for both quantity and quality services.
However, due to the accelerating demand for all kinds of services there are currently huge
demand-supply and quality gaps. Therefore, attracting foreign investors towards this sector is
required as input to economic development.
Attracting service FDI has a lot of positive spill-over, such as technology transfer, management
skills and investment capital. Therefore, emerging economies like Ethiopia should take efforts
to further attract inward investment. To this end, Ethiopia should define her position with
respect to the service sector by identifying the most determining factors of attracting service
FDI, both at the regional and global levels. This would facilitate detecting and comparing the
gaps and, in turn, pinpoint to recommendations on what Ethiopia should do to enhance and
attract more FDI in the service sector and become more competent and competitive at the
regional and global levels.
As main objective, the research will identify and define the determinants that are significant to
increasing the inflow of service FDI and set guidelines to improve the services FDI flows
towards East Africa: Ethiopia. In addition, the study aims at adding knowledge in identification
of service FDI inflow at global level and African countries (both country and city scale) in
addition to examining their determinants of service FDI attraction.
The literature review conducted in Chapter 2 relates the main concepts of competitiveness,
multilateral cooperation, location factors, FDI and services sector. As the conclusion, the
conceptual framework is formulated and discussed.","['Competitiveness', 'Service sector', 'FDI', 'MNCs', 'Location Factors']"
Explaining the Spatial Pattern of Knowledge Intensive Business Services,"Benashvili, T. (Tamar)",2016-09-01,['Stavropoulos S. (Spyridon)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"There is a widespread discussion regarding the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the era of digital economy. Though, the question how these technologies are related to the economic activities in space, is not answered fully yet. Partially, it is conditioned by the invisible and complex nature of ICTs, which is hard to deconstruct and even harder to explore. What is obvious is that those technologies are not evenly distributed and equally accessible to everyone – not all people, places and businesses benefit equally from the advantages that those technologies generate (Tranos and Mack, 2015). Hence, if those technologies create comparative advantages to places through increasing digital accessibility (Tranos, Reggiani, et al., 2013) the lack of those technologies might cause respective results.
The importance of internet’s physical infrastructure is well noted by policy makers. Aiming to foster the network-based knowledge economy and growth in Europe, the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE) was adopted in 2010 with the specific broadband coverage goals, which is acknowledged as priority at all policy levels of Europe:
- Universal broadband coverage by 2013, which was already achieved in 2013 mainly (96.1%) through fixed technologies
Universal broadband coverage of speeds at least 30mbps, and penetration of ultra-fast broadband (above 100mbps) in 50% of European households for 2020. These speeds are achieved through Next Generation Access (NGA) coverage (Soldi, Cavallini, et al., 2016, Valdani Vicari & Associati and IHS Inc., 2015, Point Topic, 2012).
The developmental role of ICTs at regional level also a subject of interest for researchers. This study tries to determine the comparative importance of broadband coverage (as main part of ICTs) for knowledge intensive business services in European regions. The Knowledge intensive business services are also subject of increasing interest of both, scholars and policy makers intending to foster a knowledge-based economy.
The study uses spatial analysis techniques to understand the comparative importance of broadband coverage for knowledge intensive business services. The results suggest that there is no homogeneous impact of internet’s physical infrastructure on KI(B)S – the comparative importance of broadband is different for Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern Europe depending on the region-specific characteristics, such as absorptive capacity of a region. The results of the study also revealed the higher importance of advanced broadband technologies in comparison with the standard ones. It is an important implication for policy makers as well, who might emphasize to improve the NGA technologies coverage at regional level.","['Internet Infrastructure', 'Broadband', 'Knowledge Intensive Business Services', 'Spatial pattern', 'spatial analysis techniques', 'Moran’s I']"
Determinants of Foreign Direct Investment Inflow into Africa in Manufacturing Sector,"Demo, Y.A. (Yetmgeta Abera)",2016-09-01,"['Wall R. (Ronald)', 'Salimgareeva M. (Marina)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The process of globalization has been intensified across developed and developing regions to connect countries in terms of economy and other areas. Currently, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) became important source of finance and catalyst of economic growth for countries though it can also cause crowding out domestic investments and other negative effects. The distribution of FDI is uneven where majority of FDI is concentrated at developed regions the rest goes to developing regions. The comparative share of Africa in FDI attraction is least at global level. When the possible economic benefits of FDI are considered, it can be taken as important tool for Africa’s economy. In order to fasten industrialization process in the continent, manufacturing oriented FDI is vital, helping to transform Africa’s agricultural based economy to industrialize and creating more employment opportunities than any other sectors. However, the share of manufacturing FDI in Africa could not be improved and its pace of growth could be as fasts as the service sector. Therefore, central theme of this study will be to identify determinants of manufacturing FDI inflow into Africa compared to other global countries and cities.
Data for independent variable (MFDI inflow) and independent variables (location factors) is accessed from data sources fDi Market, World Economic Forum and euro monitor international. Research design and methods used to analyse these data are descriptive and explanatory. In analysing data of sampled African countries and cities, and global countries and cities statistical application tools (STATA, Gephi and Microsoft Excel) are employed to generate econometric models, charts, figures and tables of variables.
Based on descriptive analysis and finding, global countries and cities performed high relatively to African countries and cities in all measures of location factors. Moreover, both global countries and cities attracted more MFDI and are major investors into Africa. The Middle East is the leading region followed by Europe to invest high capital in manufacturing sector. United Araba Emirates and Unites States are leading investors in capital and number of manufacturing projects in Africa, respectively. Half of the MFDI is concentrated at Northern Africa implying that the distribution is uneven. Countries Egypt, Nigeria and Libya are among top recipients and also most connected with global countries through MFDI.
Location factors inflation, business impact rules on FDI, flexibility wage determination are shown to be significant at global countries level whereas cities MFDI inflow is found to be determined by unemployment rate, total population and consumer expenditure. Furthermore, Determinants of Foreign Direct Investment Inflow into Africa in Manufacturing Sector. 3
MFDI inflow into African countries is explained by determined such as inflation, foreign market size and working rules related FDI. Finally, total population and productivity are significant location factors for foreign investors’ intending to operate in manufacturing projects. Inflation, business impact rules on FDI, and total population are common explanatory variables both Africa and global level.
The research concluded that identified determinants inflation, foreign market size, working rules related FDI, total population and productivity are vital to affect foreign investors’ decisions. Therefore, in order to increase MFDI inflow into Africa, a stable macroeconomic environment should be created addressing the prevailing high inflation record. Integrating countries economy through interaction trade is also vital, as it encourages foreign investors to export their manufactured products. In addition, incentive packages and flexible rules addressing needs of foreign investors should be implemented. Lastly, cities should exploit their growing population by means of trainings in line with labour demands of manufactures. Overall, since access to data is major the challenge at various scale, results of this research should be developed by further academic studies, subsequently, governments and investors could make informed decisions.","['FDI', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Africa', 'determinants']"
Does top-down and bottom-up city morphology influence street integration?,"Vujic, I. (Ivana)",2016-09-01,"[""D' Acci L. (Luca)""]",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This thesis presents an urban morphology study which examines the spatial configuration of 68 cities around the world, classified according to the circumstances under which they originated, planned or unplanned. The objective is to explain using Space syntax method, which urban morphology, top-down or bottom-up, has more influence on street integration level.
An initial analysis indicates that cities belonging to the same type have similar street pattern, but at the same time they can be distinguished from one another according to the network shapes as a consequence of their different topological conditions and development.
From ancient times, cities have been classified into those which grow organically and those which are planned. The distinction between these types is complex and blurred, and of course, most towns today are being formed from elements of both, bottom-up and top-down. The key difference involves the speed at which cities change, and the scale at which they develop.
The differences between BU (bottom-up) and TD (top-down) cities strike at the very fundamentals of the way cities develop. Since the form of the city is in direct relation with its street network pattern, and street network pattern presents the basis for the analysis, the street integration is the main metric of this study. This study does not analyse the factors which contribute to the city shape development (street pattern shape) such as social factors, culture, land use, terrain form, climate conditions etc. This study concentrates on the pure geometry of the city, keeping in mind the difference in the way they originated: unplanned or planned.
The measurement and the analysis of the spatial integration are conducted using the approach and the methods of Space syntax (Hillier, 1996). Integration is used as a measure which describes street accessibility or how easy it is to get to one street from all other streets (Hillier, 2009). Furthermore, integration explains how close each street is to all others, also known as closeness or “to-movement” (Hillier, 1996).
The results obtained following this study indicate that top-down cities have higher levels of street integration compared with bottom-up cities. Significant syntactic differences appeared while analysing cities with grid street pattern, which obtained the highest level of integration overall. The most segregated results are reflected in organic-like and cul-de-sac street patterns since they consist of many dead-end streets within their network. It is also concluded that SS (Space syntax) method can efficiently quantify precise spatial configurations of the large sample, and thus, compare urban street networks from the integration point of view.
By calculating integrated and segregated parts of the city, it is possible to know whether a proposed design fits into the existing structure of an area. It is also possible to create a new perspective in understanding street patterns and learn from mistakes when the integration is weak and should have been higher for the existing scenario (Hillier & Hanson, 1984). Calculating integration levels within urban areas can even help in regulating human movement, predicting crime, adapting traffic and solving commuting issues, connecting distant city centres in more efficient ways, creating social hubs or on the other hand planning safe neighbourhoods. Future study can go a step further analysing social aspects and liveability by studying human behaviour within integrated and segregated cities. The research would certainly benefit from such an effort as it would go beyond the rather clinical analysis of Space syntax and street integration level.","['Urban morphology', 'Top-down', 'Bottom-up', 'Street pattern', 'Street integration', 'Space syntax']"
"Land leasing policy, industrial land price and industrial investment in China","Chen, R. (Rui)",2016-09-01,['Rabé P. (Paul)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"For a long time, the industrial land leasing price is purposely controlled at a very much low level by the local government especially through private one-to-one negotiation with industrial etherises, which acted as a cross subsidies. The phenomenon has been recognized as government competition. After the 2007 new land leasing policy issued by central government, the informal land subsidies were strictly forbidden. The thesis conduct an empirical study on China’s industrial land leasing price and its impact on industrial investment since 2007. The research utilized city-level panel data and interviews for analysis. The regression models are run separately by using city data of Eastern China, Middle China and Western China to test the different effect of industrial land. Combined with interviews, the research found out that, in general the lower industrial price and government competition has been obstacles for increase of industrial investment. However, when looking at different regions, we noticed that, due to the different development level, the land prices have different influences on investment. The lower land price impeded the investment in Eastern China as land is becoming less available, while in Middle China the price competition weakened the comparative advantage over the east, and Western China could still use land price as leverage under the relatively poor local investment environment. In the future, the land policies and economic development policies should be made based on the differentiation of the regions to avoid vicious government competition and to improve the land market.","['Land leasing', 'Land price', 'Industrial Land', 'Industrial investment', 'Government competition']"

Italian industrial districts and urban competitiveness,"Piperno, A. (Alessandro)",2016-09-01,['Karreman B. (Bas)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The thesis wants to understand the relation between the urban competitiveness and the presence of industrial district in the area. This relation is particularly interesting because the increase of competition. On one side, there are cities that are pushed by the global flow of capital, financial and human, to pursuit new competitive advantages that allow them to be attractive. Especially for small and medium cities, it is impossible to compete in different sectors and the specialization of local factors became necessary. On the other side, the power of the IDs to boost the regional economy is putted at risk. Industrial district were the best case of how the SMEs could create economies of agglomeration without the necessity of a central control of the authorities. Economies of agglomerations make companies perform better compare to others outside the cluster and increase the productivity of the entire district. The goal of the analysis is to understand in which measure this spillovers influence the innercity and which kind of relations can be created between the agents in order to increase the number of employees, decrease the number of poor families and increase the foreign direct investments in the city. In particular the analysis focus on three important aspects of industrial districts, the dimension of companies, the geographical structures of cities and the performance of the districts. In order to have valid results, the analysis study all the Italian cities within an industrial district and compare their performance with a comparison group. The analysis is based on quantitative and secondary data collected by the ISTAT and FDI Markets and the dataset in analysed scientifically thank the use of statistical packages as STATA. The results suggest how the cluster theories tend to overestimate and oversimply the importance of the agglomeration economies. The analysis discover that in order to make a district influence the competitiveness of the city an equilibrium has to be found. This equilibrium is between big and small companies, specialization and diversification and between proximity and distance. First, cities, in which there are different companies’ structures, over perform the comparison group. When companies of the same sector exchange different organizational ideas, they make the city perform better at all the point of view. Second, the geographical concentration of different industrial districts promote urban competitiveness. In this case is the different cognitive background and knowledge create an exchange of ideas that contribute to the innovation process. Third, the good performances of the districts are necessary to create the inner dynamics that boost the cities’economy. In conclusion, the analysis reveal the possibility of industrial district to be engine of the urban competitiveness, but this has to be pursued with equilibrium, saving the heterogeneity of the region and structures.","['Industrial district', 'urban competitiveness', 'agglomeration economies', 'specialization and diversification']"
Identification of Best Practices for Climate Planning Using Comparative Case Study at Pilot Cities in Indonesia,"Budiasih, Y. (Yulie)",2016-09-01,"['Frantzeskaki N. (Niki)', 'Grafakos S. (Stelios)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The pilot cities are defined as the municipalities in Indonesia which have been developing adaptation and mitigation action plans since the early initiatives in 2009 until today (2016). The approaches of the arrangement of the adaptation and mitigation actions of the cities may vary from being either a stand-alone or a combination of both actions of approach.
This study focuses on cities with the combination of adaptation and mitigation approach and observes the level of integration of adaptation and mitigation objectives in the cities‘ climate action plan. In this study, the integrated action plan is defined as the policy and program to implement the combination of adaptation and mitigation action plans.This study also explores the various driving forces which have brought the cities to arrange such plan.
There are four selected pilot cities with each having its own urban area characteristics, based on the variation of locations, expert bodies involved behind the process of arrangement, and the time of release for the first action plan documents. Those cities are Bandung City, Malang City, Palembang City and Semarang City.
This study finds that, the driving forces of the majority of the selected pilot cities to arrange integrated plan are similar with the driving forces of city to arrange a climate action plan in general. Those driving forces are also a combination of some variables and context specific. They range from the awareness of climate change impact, the awareness of co-benefit to climate change issue, public demand, environmental factor, political leadership, awareness of adaptation-mitigation relationship until marketability orientation. To some extent, they are influenced by the level of knowledge and experiences owned by local governments with the integrated action plan concept.
In the climate actions they have, it is identified that all cities have synergy and co-benefit interrelationship other than actions with single adaptation or mitigation objective. Although having an integrated plan, most of cities unable to avoid trade-off interrelationship in their actions due to insufficient information about the interrelationship.
However, the four cities have built the enabling condition as an initial part for integration of adaptation and mitigation objectives in their governance system. It can be seen from the readiness of the institutional arrangement to execute and coordinate both actions, the linkage program between climate planning with spatial and city development planning, the sustainable resource funding for both adaptation and mitigation actions, and the equal opportunity for the execution of adaptation and mitigation programs. Yet, the pilot cities need to emphasize more on the capacity building for their working group members, keep maintaining the function of climate working group to reach its optimum level, and also define clearly the special unit to conduct evaluation and monitoring to the implementation of climate action plans.","['Integrated action plan', 'inter relationship', 'climate action plan', 'driving forces', 'trade-off']"
Infrastructure networks and foreign direct investment,"Elesa, L.B. (Lynda Bitrus)",2016-09-01,"['Alade T. (Taslim)', 'Wall R. (Ronald)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Globally, Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) is one of the essential features of the world economy and Global Economic Integration. The availability of Infrastructure is considered as one of the factors that guide the investment decision of Multinational Enterprises and these Enterprises carry out foreign Direct investment. The purpose of this research is to analyse the function of infrastructure network in determining the attractiveness of countries for greenfield FDI. The study analysed the relationship between FDI and the spatial configuration of physical infrastructure network in Africa with emphasis on the Lagos-Abidjan (L-A) Corridor in West Africa by benchmarking Europe and the North Sea Mediterranean (NS-M) corridor by means of space syntax methodology. This benchmark is necessary since West African region, where the L-A corridor is located have consistently perceived European countries and particularly EU as a guide.
Firstly, the network centrality measures of the infrastructure in 40 African countries and 38 European countries were generated using GIS analysis in ARCMAP10.4.1 and space syntax analysis in UCL DepthMapX. Secondly, the network centrality measures of degree centrality (measured by connectivity); closeness centrality (measured by integration); and the betweenness centrality (measured by the choice) were obtained and used in a panel data regression using a random effect model to determine the influence of infrastructure network on the inflow of: (a) Total FDI (obtained from the FDI market of the financial times) into Africa and Europe as well as to L-A and NS-M corridors; (b) FDI inflow into four sectors in Africa namely Hitech, manufacturing, resources and services from 2006 to 2014.
The findings show a strong positive significance of infrastructure network in attracting FDI in both Europe and Africa as well as in NS-M and the L-A corridor. However, variation exists based on Regional Economic Community (REC) and the rate of impact of the infrastructure network, as well as in its interaction with other location and competitiveness factors. The infrastructure network, large market size and Regional Economic Community are essential for FDI attraction in EU member states in Europe whereas FDI to non-EU member states is sensitive to macroeconomic stability, large market size, labour force and institutions. On the other hand, in Africa, infrastructure network and large market size is a determinant of FDI to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) whereas, in non-Sub-Saharan Africa(non-SSA), Institution and labour force are the major determinant of FDI inflow. While, in both Africa and Europe, regions with good Regional Economic community(REC) attract more FDI than regions with weak REC. Furthermore, Contrary to Europe that has bridged the gap between coastal and landlocked areas with good infrastructure and logistics services, hence, eliminating the disparity between coastal and land-locked regions, coastal regions in Africa and in SSA in particular attracts more FDI than landlocked areas and infrastructure network is significant for FDI in manufacturing, service and resource sectors in SSA with high elasticity in the manufacturing sector, however its impact and level of significance varies based on region and sub-region. Additionally, French-speaking countries in L-A corridor attract less FDI than English speaking countries. This indicates that improved and well-developed infrastructure is a vital tool for FDI attraction and cross-border trade facilitation by enhancing physical connectivity of countries and improving the investment climate in Africa and Europe as well as the two corridors respectively.
The findings can be useful to Government, Policy Makers and Urban Development Administrators with respect to FDI, Regional and Global Economic Integration. This can be achieved by understanding that infrastructure network has the potential to bridge the gap between coastal regions and the hinterland. It is equally important for international development/donor agencies and countries interested in the construction of new as well as rehabilitation of existing infrastructure to understand its network effect and prioritise accordingly, since infrastructure network can serve as a development tool for both developing and emerging economies. The main novelty of this study lies in the treatment of infrastructure as a spatial network with topological dimension, using GIS and space syntax analysis; using a spatial configuration of infrastructure network measures and a non-spatial unit flow of investment (greenfield FDI) representing the spatial location of MNE’s to explain the extent of Global Economic Integration; confronting Infrastructure network with other factors, such as macroeconomic environment, institutions, market size, labour force as well as controlling for strategic location,

The Citizen-a fictional character in India’s urban makeovers,"Shankavaram, H. (Hiranmayi)",2016-09-01,['Jachnow A. (Alexander)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Strategic rationality of a planning module, defined by Albrechts, places citizens as protagonists
of decision making. This empowerment of social and intellectual capital facilitates transparent
processes and encourages participatory democracy. A Smart City through its interlayered
definitions and components stresses upon the importance of citizen engagement in all its
undertakings. The concept dating back to the ‘70s has seen its maturity in the developed world.
In recent times, implementation of infrastructure needs and governance tools through smart
solutions, places the concept of smart cities as the most sought urban reform, particularly in
the developing world.
India, one of the biggest agglomerations of the world and with a doubling character in
urbanization, has proposed an ambitious proposal of 98 smart cities across the country.
Determination of the newly elected Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi saw this model develop
as one of the biggest urban reforms with his Ministry of Urban Development penning down
guidelines for the federal states to execute. The model proposes installation of smart
infrastructure with citizen engagement and feedbacks, through all the stages of decision making
i.e., from framing the vision statement to the prioritization of development schemes and
proposition of smart solutions. The Smart Cities Mission also aims to foster smart citizenry
through consultations, citizen based solutions and calls for active engagements of
representative groups.
This research juxtaposes itself between the set guidelines of the Mission and ground reality.
The country is marked by dominance of public authorities on one hand and poverty on the other
hand, playing the main curmudgeons that can render urban projects hapless. Moreover,
overcoming problems related to access to information, prevailing inequalities and
administrative inefficiencies are critical elements that determine the success of this initiative.
With citizen participation framing the crux of the concept, the guidelines outline participatory
means and the stages to be adopted in the cities. The city of Tumakuru was one of the first
nominated smart cities amongst the 98 cities and forms the context to the findings of this
research focusing on the citizen engagement initiative. With an inquiry on the concepts and
impacts of urban reforms, contextual parameters that surface the injustices, are observed calling
for a case study typology.
The premise of this research is concentrated on the vulnerable class of the informal settlements
who are excluded in voicing out their opinions. Specific to citizen engagement framework of
smart cities, the performance of this particular social class is evaluated and comparatives are
drawn with other social classes through semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, adherence to
the mission guidelines and the execution at the city’s context are chalked out to analyse the
effectiveness in participation. On-ground explorations revealed participation absent in all social
classes exposing missing links in networks. These networks were identified as a commendation
to strengthen the nexus and foster enhanced participation.","['Smart Cities Mission', 'citizen engagement', 'access to information', 'contextual sensitivities', 'Tumakuru']"
"Assessing the impact of Green Infrastructure on Land Values
through Hedonic Pricing Model - Cañaveralejo River case","Aranda, N.E.R. (Nohemí Eréndira Ramirez)",2016-09-01,['D’Acci L. (Luca)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"For centuries, traditional approaches for waste and storm water had as main purpose
removing water from the urban environment as quickly as possible (CWAA, 2011). These
initiatives, still in use, are traditional grey approaches such as pipes and conduits, which may
had worked for the main goal of taking water out of streets, nevertheless, they never took into
account water resources and natural environment, which lately would become the reason of
their decline.
In recent years, variety of strategies for tackling water issues and environmental problems
across cities have been discussed and implemented across the globe, however, Green
Infrastructure (GI) strategies have become lately the preferred ones for their multiple benefits
and integral approach in comparison to the sectorial and Traditional Grey Infrastructure
(TGI) solutions (Naumann et al. 2011; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee 2013). Recently,
the city of Cali in Colombia has decided also to use GI (Environmental Corridor
Cañaveralejo - ECC) as a way to tackle public issues. Unfortunately, despite GI’s financial,
social and environmental benefits, developing countries like Colombia are limited to
implement GI techniques due to the lack of budget, planning, municipal capacity and smart
financing strategies.
Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to provide reliable information about the
positive impact that GI can have on Land Values (LV), which can be used to encourage
private and public stakeholders to invest in the ECC. Based on papers from Jim and Chen
(2006), University of Wisconsin Milwaukee (2013), D'Acci 2014 and Noor et al. (2015), this
research combines the Hedonic Pricing Model (HPM), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
regressions and GIS analysis to calculate the actual impact of GI elements in LV across Cali
at neighborhood and block scale. Then, using the resultant regression coefficients, the
potential impact of the ECC in the LV adjacent to the project areas is forecasted.
Analyses at neighborhood and block scales showed congruent results in the direction and
significance of GI’s indicators as well as variations in the coefficient magnitudes related with
the analysis scale. The results for the control variables scored similar and as expected. The
block scale analysis provided more in detail results about GI, showing GI’s indicators had a
high significant and positive impact. However, the unexpected positive impact that Exposure
to Fluvial Flooding (EFF) had in block models turned negative after carrying a third model
analysis where Contact to water bodies was controlled. The results from this third analysis
showed that the positive aspects of closeness to water are more important for the LV than the
chance of flooding (Barford, 2012) but that the potential of flooding does decrease the LV of
blocks with comparable closeness to waterbodies.
OLS results showed that when comparing GI’s regression coefficients per unit increased,
number of trees have the highest impact in $COP1/m², meaning e.g. one additional tree causes
a major impact in LV than adding one meter of bike line. However, the overall impact in the
forecast assessment indicated that bike lines contribution is bigger since it has more presence
in ECC than trees. Summing up the potential increases in LV from trees, vegetation coverage,

pedestrian and bike lines, the average increase in the adjacent areas to the ECC is about
23%2.
All these results can provide hints to stakeholders about ECC marketability and potential
profit margin, incentivizing them to invest. They also provide useful insights to government
for future development projects, improvements in land valuation systems and Land Value
Capture (LVC) tools as well as for green spaces protection programs. In a nutshell, this thesis
provides evidence of GI’s positive impact on LVs and translates it into a language that
decision makers feel familiar with, such as money (de Groot et al. 2012).","['Climate Change (CC)', 'Traditional Grey Infrastructure (TGI)', 'Green Infrastructure (GI)', 'Environmental Corridor Cañaveralejo (ECC)', 'Land Values (LV)', 'Hedonic Pricing Model', '(HPM)']"

Africa and Europe","Nkuli, M.C. (Manace Castory)",2016-09-01,"['Alade T. (Taslim)', 'Wall R. (Ronald)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The focus of this study is to explain the contribution of physical infrastructure in attracting
foreign investments in East Africa by referring to Africa and Europe. Thus, the study has
used FDI inflow data (total inflows and inflows in specific sectors) for the duration of 2006 –
2014 and seven different types of infrastructures namely road networks, railway and port
services, air transportation, electricity supply, mobile telephone subscriptions and internet
subscriptions in order to examine the contribution of physical infrastructure in attracting FDI
in Europe, Africa and East Africa. The study is designed to test one of the most prominent
theories of FDI – Eclectic theory (Dunning, 1988).
Therefore, the study employs panel data for FDI inflows in European, African and East
African countries for nine consecutive years (2006 – 2014) to examine the trend of FDI
inflows against development of infrastructures in control of pillars and sub-pillars of
competitiveness as stipulated by Porter, et al, 2007. The study has applied appropriate tools
such as Ms Excel, ArcToolbox of ArcMap, Gephi, Space Syntax and Stata for descriptive and
inferential analyses. However, in order to link the study with global economic integration
theory which is one of the theories underpinning the study; four variables have been
generated for the purpose of this study. These are physical infrastructure index in presence of
internet, physical infrastructure index in absence of internet, segment angular choice and
segment angular integration. The last two were generated by using Acr Toolbox and Space
Syntax; while the computation of others used the P2 distance index, a synthetic index that
combined indicators of specific infrastructure into a single value.
The study has found that physical infrastructure stock is crucial for the inflow of FDI in
European, African and East African countries because it facilitate smooth operations of
business and maximizes profits as it reduces production costs. Moreover, it has been found
that the maximum impact of physical infrastructure to space is exerted when the
infrastructure reduces the distance from the specified space to all other spaces in the
predefined radius. This phenomenon is well explained by using the impact of segment
angular choice and segment angular integration to the inflow of FDI. Thus, effective
infrastructure for FDI inflow is the one which facilitate the region to be highly connected (i.e.
reduces distance to other places by increasing integration) and allow frequent passages (i.e.
becomes the preferred route/ destination and become busier). In that case, the space attains
locational advantage to attract more FDI than its competitors.","['Foreign direct investments', 'Competitiveness', 'Global economic integration', 'Physical', 'infrastructure']"
Impact of foreign direct investment on employment in Africa,"Mehta, P. (Poonam)",2016-09-01,"['Wall R. (Ronald)', 'Salimgareeva M. (Marina)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"In the past few years the flow of FDI towards the developing countries and especially towards the African countries is growing due to the pursuit of MNEs to maximize their profits, to lower their costs and to search for new markets. This is an opportunity for the African countries to work not only towards economic growth but also towards creating employment opportunities that can translate this growth into inclusive development. The changes brought about by technology including the wide spread use of internet and mobile phones have changed the way people work. There are even virtual markets, e-commerce activities and websites supporting for employment opportunities. Part-time or temporary employment is not uncommon e.g. in South Africa temporary workers comprise of about 7 percent of the labour force (The World Bank 2013). The employment impact of FDI needs to be looked at from such varied dimensions for the FDI policy perspective. Adoption of appropriate policies to create conducive factors for attracting employment generating FDI is the key to a bright future for Africa.
Based on the above, the main objective of this research is to address whether FDI is effective in creating employment opportunities in Africa. The research addresses three sub-problems. Firstly, whether FDI impacts the quantity and quality of employment in Africa. Secondly, the impact of various sectors of FDI on the different employment sectors. Thirdly, to see if there are geographical differences across different regions and cities. As a culmination of the research it is also intended to contribute towards policy recommendations on the subject, as the topic of research is of considerable socio-economic relevance for the region.
The literature analysing the correlation between FDI and employment uses a variety of methods and models and panel data analysis is often used for such research. The data used for the present research is panel data for the continent, region, country and city level analysis. Panel data is the data that consists of a number of observations with two dimensions i.e. time and space. Thus panel data analysis enables the study of data from multiple locations collected periodically over a certain period of time and is a combination of time series and cross sectional (Greene 2012). The period under research is a time span of twelve years from 2003 to 2014. An interaction between two variables is also used to avoid multi collinearity and thus to get more authentic results.
It is clear from the findings of the research that the aggregate FDI does not have any significant impact on the overall employment in Africa. However, at sectoral employment front, it has a negative impact on employment in agriculture and positive impact on industry sector employment. Sectoral FDI too does impact employment industry sector. The negative impact of hi-tech FDI on overall employment and the positive impact of resource FDI on employment in industry are noticeable. The service sector employment, however, remains hardly impacted by the inward FDI, both in terms of aggregate FDI and sectoral FDI. As regards quality of employment the aggregate inward FDI does not exert any significant impact, neither at the continent level, nor at the regional level.
The key variables of this research, both inward FDI and employment are pivotal for African countries to address the present development challenge and elevate them to the next level of development. The burgeoning youth population in Africa calls for urgent steps to generate employment opportunities. The research analyses the ways in which FDI has impacted employment in Africa during the research period that covers a span of twelve years i.e. 2003 to 2014. While historically, resource FDI has been a dominant other sectors are taking over,

manufacturing FDI has the largest share during the research period, and looking at the recent trends in FDI, in future services FDI may takes its place. Overall amongst the FDI sectors manufacturing FDI is the key driver of employment during the research period, which may be replaced by services FDI a few years hence.

The influence of government enabling environment on the quality of solid waste collection delivered by the private sector,"Buadee, J. (Jacqueline)",2016-09-01,['Frank E. (Edward)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The need to tackle Solid Waste Management (SWM) problems has become crucial especially in an era where environmental issues have become an integral part of achieving sustainable development. In recent times, SWM has become an impossible task for local governments. The continuous increase in solid waste generation as a result of urbanization and high consumption rates inhibits local governments, especially those of cities in developing countries, of which Madina and Adenta are no exception, from providing solid waste services according to the desired quality. Most cities are characterized by uncollected waste in centres and corners of cities and streets, indiscriminate disposal of solid waste, gutters clogged with waste resulting in flooding, stagnant pools of water creating the platform for mosquitoes and the ensuing prevalence of malaria, polluted water and the environment causing series of cholera outbreaks.
To solve this menace, private sector involvement in SWM was introduced in Ghana considering the notion that the private sector is more effective than the public sector. Having been the agency solely responsible for the collection, transportation and disposal of solid waste in Madina and Adenta from 2008, private sector provision of solid waste collection has been very effective in Madina. However, with the operation of the private sector in Adenta for 8 years now, there has not been maximum efficiency and massive improvement in solid waste collection. Indiscriminate disposal of solid waste continuously persists and all forms of waste are found at unauthorized locations in the municipality including drains, uncompleted buildings and along the streets. This situation denotes failure on the part of the private sector to deliver solid waste collection services according to the desired level. Literature confirms that certain pre-conditions and an enabling environment such as existence and enforcement of policies, bye-laws and legal and regulatory frameworks and institutional capacities of the public sector must be created to enable the private sector deliver improved quality of services. The study therefore sought to determine which conditions in Madina makes the private sector more effective than that of Adenta. It is against this background that the study sought to determine the extent to which government enabling environment influences the quality of solid waste collection delivered by the private sector.
The study adopted a case study research strategy and interviewed professionals in the Madina and Adenta Municipalities as well as private sector companies to enquire what enabling environment was created to support the private sector to deliver an improved quality of service. Questionnaires were also administered at the household level to ascertain from users the quality of solid waste collection received. Data collected from the field was analyzed using Atlas ti and Ms Excel.
Findings of the study indeed revealed that the existence and enforcement of policies, bye-laws strong institutional capacities of the public sector, performance monitoring and environmental sanitation education contribute to an improved quality of service delivery of solid waste collection by the private sector. It was revealed that the private sector in Madina are able to collect 90% of solid waste generated unlike Adenta where only 25% of solid waste generated is collected. Service users in Madina were extremely satisfied with the services rendered whilst those in Adenta were extremely unsatisfied. The reason why the private sector in Madina was effective is because the Madina Municipality observes and enforces the guidelines in the Environmental Sanitation Policy of Ghana which spells out what role each stakeholder should play to ensure that the desired quality of solid waste delivery is attained. The Madina Municipality also has the La Nkwatanang Madina Municipality Bye-Laws that sanctions all defaulters be it private sector companies or individual residents who flout the bye-laws.","['Government Enabling Environment', 'Solid Waste Collection', 'Quality of Solid Waste Collection', 'Private Sector Involvement', 'Adenta Municipal Assembly', 'La Nkwantanang Madina Municipal Assembly']"
"The attraction of direct foreign real estate investments
into Sub-Saharan Africa","Meldgaard van Gils, M. (Max)",2016-09-01,"['Haaren J. van (Jeroen)', 'Wall R. (Ronald)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Direct Greenfield Foreign Real Estate Investment (FREI) has the potential to fulfil a positive role in the development of urban Africa, by enhancing economic growth, improving the built environment and by creating a relatively large amount of jobs (Tibaijuka 2009; Dasgupta et al. 2014; Harvey 2014; EY 2015). However, inappropriate urban planning regulations and inadequate urban service provision might be deterring economic growth and FREI attraction (Collier and Venables 2013; Collier 2013; Alterman 2013; Brueckner and Lall 2015; Castells-Quintana 2015). Although the interest in the ‘rising’ continent is increasing (Watson 2013; KnightFrank 2015; JLL 2015; PWC 2015), the amount of FREI attracted by Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is still very small. The determinants of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and indirect FREI have been researched quite extensively1, however Direct Greenfield FREI has received less attention (Rotherberger 2010). As many authors acknowledge (Laposa and Lizieri 2005; Holsapple et al. 2006; Rodríguez and Bustillo 2010; Rotherberger 2010; Fereidouni and Masron 2013; Salem and Baum 2016), direct FREI has both FDI and Foreign Portfolio Investment (indirect FREI) characteristics and especially the real estate specific locational factors are important differences from general determinants of FDI attraction. One real estate specific determinant that has been overlooked by international trade research thus far, is the impact that different legislative, regulatory and procedural aspects of urban planning2 have on Direct Greenfield FREI. This research tries to add to the body of knowledge on the attraction of Direct Greenfield FREI in general and in the context of SSA in particular. Additionally, this research tries to fill the gap of knowledge that exists between the impact of urban planning regulations on urban and economic development in terms of the attraction of foreign investments.
In light of Africa’s urban challenges, this research is interested in capital attraction that may be beneficial for urban centres in SSA. Since FREI can be a beneficial source of foreign capital for cities in Africa, the external goal of this research is to investigate how municipalities, particularly in SSA, can attract more direct greenfield FREI. In order to achieve these goals, the internal goal of this research is to research what determines FREI attraction in general and in SSA in particular as well as to investigate how different aspects of urban planning regulations impact FREI attraction.
This research uses Geographical Information System (GIS) and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB) techniques on secondary quantitative data to obtain the determinants of the number of FREIs cities and countries attract. First a sample of 72 global cities is used to obtain the general determinants of FREI attraction and subsequently a sample of 31 African countries is used to obtain the region specific determinants of FREI. In all of the analyses the impact of different aspects of urban planning regulations will be investigated. The results show that urban planning does matter for FREI attraction. The global city analyses indicate that excessive population densities and inadequate basic urban service provision, apparent in many developing cities, deter FREIs.","['FDI', 'Greenfield', 'FREI', 'Real Estate', 'Urban Planning', 'Investments', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'Urban Competitiveness', 'Urban Development', 'Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial', 'GIS']"
Infrastructure investment and land value capture,"Akomea Bonsu, B. (Beverly)",2016-09-01,['Walters L.C. (Larry)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Urbanization of towns and cities within the past decades has become a matter of concern in both academic and political circles. With an estimation of seventy-five percent of the global population living in towns and cities by 2025, the onus lays on the local governments the world over to generate enough revenue to provide infrastructure and services to cater for the urbanites.
Local governments in Ghana for that matter the Ejisu-Juaben Municipal Assembly (EJMA) rely mainly on inter-governmental transfers as the District Assembly Common Fund and District Development Funds which are not regular inflows for the provision of public infrastructure for the Municipality. This therefore means that internal sources of revenue such as property rate, ground rent and other non-land related revenue need to be effectively mobilized to help alleviate the challenges of revenue for the municipality.
The objective of this research was to explain the extent to which the EJMA is generating internal revenue from property rate and ground rent within the municipality as a result of the development of the Boankra Inland Port (BIP). Property rate and ground rent were chosen because assessment of property rate in Ghana is based on buildings alone using the Depreciated Replacement Cost (DRC) Method which does not make it an efficient value capture tool therefore ground rent was included to consider the extent of value capture from the BIP development within the municipality for this research.
To achieve the objective, the main research question “to what extent is the Ejisu-Juaben Municipal Assembly generating internal revenue from property rate and ground rent as a result of the development of the Boankra Inland Port” was asked. A range of literature based on the main concepts like urbanization, infrastructure, land value capture, property rate, and ground rent were reviewed from which a conceptual framework was developed and operationalised.
The case study strategy was adopted to facilitate answering the main research question. The data sources were primary, secondary and primary-secondary data. While the data collection methods included semi-structured interview guides which was used to solicit in-depth knowledge about the study from purposively selected key actors from the study area. Additionally, observations were made and through the use of stratified and simple random sampling methods, closed-ended and open questionnaires were administered to property owners within the municipality.
The research findings and analysis indicated that the EJMA witnessed increased rate of urbanization as indicated by the population and housing stock data with land and property values increasing after the development of the BIP. Furthermore reassessment for property rating and ground rent purposes had not been done. In addition, the municipality was having challenges with the collection of revenue for both land instruments.
The customary stool land tenure found to be operational in the municipality meant that the municipality was entitled to only 55 percent of the total revenue collected from ground rent hence, the inability for ground rent to contribute more towards the IGF of the EJMA. As such, property rate contribution towards the IGF was more than the ground rent contribution though the Valuation List had not been updated.
Further discovery indicated that after 2012, the EJMA was allowed to use not more than 45 percent of the IGF for public infrastructure provision. As such up 2015, 2 sets of a 4-bedroom teacher’s accommodation, a 14-seater water closet toilet and an Accident and Emergency Unit had been built for the municipality.","['Ejisu-Juaben Municipal Assembly', 'Property rate', 'Ground rent', 'Infrastructure and Internal revenue']"
Sustainable competitiveness and happiness at global level,"Dwivedi, T. (Tanya)",2016-09-01,['Pertiwi Ginting N. (Natalia)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Depending on the concerns of time, definition of development has taken various forms -
economic development, environmental friendly development, inclusive growth, sustainable
development etc. After economic recession experienced worldwide and slow economic growth
becoming a norm (Schwab et al. 2015), many countries around the world are preparing policies
to enhance national competitiveness. Competitiveness relates to productivity of an economy
and factors of production at national level – infrastructure, labour, institutions, R & D etc. This
concept, though to target slow economic growth, lacks a sustainable approach. Sustainable
development, which concerns the social and environmental factors, has been part of the
ongoing development debate since publication of the Brundtland Commission report – Our
Common Future in 1987 and proposal of Sustainable Development Goals, more recently.
Concept of sustainable competitiveness combines the concept of sustainable development with
that of national competitiveness. Countries, must thus, strive to be competitive but not at the
cost of environment or society.
A new addition to the development debate relates to well-being, which has been accepted by
philosophers as well as some academicians as the ultimate goal in life. Till now, very few
countries apart from Bhutan have actually implemented policies for improving people’s wellbeing.
Few authors like Kerekes (1995), Aiginger (2006) and Huggins and Thompson (2012)
have linked happiness level in a country to its competitiveness level. While some other like
Zidansek (2007), have proved a link between sustainable development and happiness. Thus to
achieve well-being centric progress, countries can propose competitiveness or sustainable
development policies.
This study tries to address three prominent issues - slow economic growth, sustainable
development and lack of well-being centric approaches by establishing a link between
sustainable competitiveness and happiness. This can give a more holistic and comprehensive
way to measure progress and define our development path. This study aims to understand the
links between competitiveness and happiness and sustainable competitiveness and happiness.
In addition to presence of a link, this study tries to explain variations in the relationship by
geographical regions and income level of countries, and identify the factors of sustainability,
which influence either positively or negatively the level of happiness at a country level.
This study makes use of three main data – Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) scores (to
measure competitiveness), Sustainability adjusted-Global Competitiveness Index (SGCI)
scores (to measure sustainable competitiveness) and Cantril ladder (to measure self-reported
level of happiness). The research uses panel data for years 2012 and 2014 in Random effects
and Fixed effects regression to understand change in happiness scores influenced by change in
GCI and SGCI scores.
Results of regression show a significant and positive relationship between competitiveness and
happiness and also sustainable competitiveness and happiness. The most significant
components of competitiveness for happiness are infrastructure and health and primary
education. When compared, variation in competitiveness scores could explain variation in
happiness score better than sustainable competitiveness scores. Similar pattern was observed
when geographical regions and classification of countries by income was included in the
model. A major underlying reason for this was level of GDP. It was concluded that to be
happier, countries need to focus on being competitive and sustainable but also earn higher GDP
so as to invest in enhancing the competiveness as well as sustainability at country level. This finds support in (Lapinskiene 2011), who marks growth in GDP as a prerequisite to sustainable
development. However, importance of GDP is short-term and mainly for countries in transition
(Hagerty and Veenhoven 2003; Clark and Senik 2011). Among the components of
sustainability, most significant for happiness at country level were found to be inclusive growth
and good governance.
In the past, the approach to development has been lop-sided towards economic growth, but
with results from this research, it is proved that sustainable competitiveness can actually lead
to happiness at country level. Policy makers should most importantly focus improving
infrastructure, health and primary education, inclusive growth and good governance as these
lead to improved level of sustainable competitiveness as well as happiness. Improvement of
financial markets as well as R & D sector is important and should now be part of development
policy. Governments which aim to achieve this holistic development approach, relating to
economic growth, sustainability and well-being, should invest more in strengthening the
society and basic infrastructure. Technology and innovation should be encouraged, not only
for improving competitiveness but also happiness.","['Competitiveness', 'Sustainable Competitiveness', 'Happiness', 'Beyond GDP', 'Sustainable', 'Development']"
"The Impact of Property Taxation in the Provision and Maintenance of Infrastructure (mainly local roads) in Formal and Informal Settlements, Dar es Salaam","Ishenkumba, K.J. (Kokwika Judith)",2016-09-01,['Sandroni P. (Paulo)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Cities in Sub- Saharan Africa is facing challenges in providing new infrastructure and maintaining the existing one due to urbanization trend. Although, sustainability growths of the cities require local authorities to have funds to provide efficient basic infrastructure and services, insufficient finances has been a major obstacle for local authorities in Sub Sahara Africa as the results the number of informal settlements are growing with inadequate basic infrastructure services like waste management, local roads, surface water drainage systems and portable water. Property tax is among the main tools of land value capture in Sub - Saharan Africa region for financing local governments in the provision of infrastructure and services.
This thesis gives the outcomes of a research whose goal was to explain the impact of property taxes in provision and maintenance of infrastructure mainly local roads in formal and informal settlement in Dar es salaam City. A case study strategy was adopted. The study is an explanatory and a single embedded, it researches Dar es Salaam city with the focus on two settlements that is Mbezi Beach formal settlement and Makongo Juu informal settlement. The analysis of property tax revenue collected, allocation and cost of road construction and maintenance was done. This is the better way to explain to what extent property tax collected is adequate provision of infrastructure services. The views from taxpayers were explored, in order to know their perceptions on property tax in two settlements i.e. Makongo Juu and Mbezi Beach in Dar es Salaam.
The findings reveal that residents in both settlements are paying property tax as per laws administering the same in the country. The legal and institutional set up does not distinguish collection as well as use of property tax between the formal and informal settlements. Nevertheless, despite the fact that those who live in informal settlements, in this case Makongo Juu comply more with payment of the tax as compared to those living in Mbezi Beach which is a formal settlement; the formal areas have been given more attention in terms of infrastructure provision and maintenance as compared to informal areas.
Moreover, the taxes collected from formal and informal settlements are not sufficient to meet the expenditures related to road provision and maintenance due to use of outdated valuation rates, exemptions, poor law enforcements for non compliance, as well as lack of proper collection strategies. Apart from that, there is greater awareness of the rights and obligations to both the tax payers and the Municipal officials as they both showed that there is a relationship between property taxation and service provision, of which the practice proved to be different especially in the informal settlements. Therefore, based on the discussions it suffices to conclude that property taxation in Tanzania does not influence much on provision and maintenance of infrastructure mainly local roads in the informal and formal settlements.","['Land value capture', 'Property tax', 'Formal and Informal settlements', 'Infrastructure']"
The Volksdeutsche and victimhood,L.  Roeleveld,2016-08-31,"['C.L.A. Willemse', 'R.J. Adriaansen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis looks into the politics of memory surrounding the German expulsion of 1944-1948, through an analysis of three autobiographies of ethnic Germans who were labelled as Volksdeutsche. These three authors emigrated to the United States in the 1950s and published their autobiographical accounts in the late 1990s and beginning of the 2000s. The three autobiographies were Valley of the shadow (1997) by Erich Anton Helfert,  Barefoot in the Rubble (1998) by Elizabeth B. Walter and Casualty of War. A Childhood Remembered (2002) by Luisa Lang Owen. The two female authors, Elizabeth Walter and Luisa Owen were expelled from Yugoslavia in this period, while Anton Helfert was expelled from Sudetenland. 
In this research, the research question is the following: with respect to the three Volksdeutsche narratives of the German expulsion of 1944-1948; how did the authors use the ambivalent term Volksdeutsche in order to negotiate the dominant discourse of the United States in the 1990s concerning ethnic German perpetrators before and during the Second World War? Here, the term Volksdeutsche referred to the term which was put on ethnic Germans  in central and Eastern Europe as a label by Nazi Germany, this was done for political reasons. This term is fluid, and the meaning of the term changes over time.
 In order to answer this research question, both the context of narration and the context of justification is elaborated on. The context of narration concerns the historical events discussed in the autobiographies. The context of justification is the context which influenced the authors when they published their autobiographies. In both the context of justification as the context of narration the term Volksdeutsche can be allotted to perpetrators of the Second World War and victims of the period after the Second World War. Within the dominant discourse of the United States in the 1990s however, these Volksdeutsche are put into connection to Nazi Germany and are seen as perpetrators. The authors try to use this ambivalent meaning of Volksdeutsche  in both contexts in order to negotiate an alternative subject position within the dominant discourse. The authors do this in their narratives by deconstructing the notion that the Volksdeutsche were collaborating with Nazi Germany, establishing that they were innocent during the Second World War and comparing their suffering with the Jewish victims of the Second World War. Furthermore, their focus of having been targeted because of their ethnicity served to connect their sufferings to events concerning ethnic cleansing in the 1990s.","['Volksdeutsche', 'Yugoslavia', 'Czechoslovakia', 'Memory', 'Autobiographies', 'Discourse', 'Identity', 'Agency', 'Nazi Germany', 'The German Expulsion 1944-1948']"

Rothbard is a well-known libertarian author who argues for the abolition of the FED and the restitution of a Gold Standard. It is easy to understand libertarians' opposition to the government's forceful monopolization of the money supply: as it constrains individuals' freedom from choosing the currency they most prefer, issuing their own currencies, and deciding upon that which constitutes money. I will argue that Rothbard’s vehement advocacy for commodity backed money is misplaced within his anarcho-capitalist ideology, and that similarly, this conclusion can be extended to libertarianism more generally. Rothbard is a Market Anarchist who opposes the very existence of the state, in such a system gold would become the only form of money iff all individuals independently chose gold as money, for otherwise the state would have to impose and enforce its adoption. I will present Hayek’s proposal for the denationalization of money, i.e. a competitive system of privately issued currencies as a more suitable currency regime for Market Anarchism and for libertarian systems more generally.",

Door te wijzen op de praktische consequenties van de reductie van het noodlot tot het toeval, wordt duidelijk dat er tussen het noodlot en het toeval een innige relatie bestaat die niet zomaar opgeheven kan worden. Aan de hand van Nietzsches essay ‘Over waarheid en leugen in buiten-morele zin’ zal worden aangetoond dat zowel het noodlot al het toeval constitutief zijn voor het bestaan van de mens. Uiteindelijk wordt geconcludeerd dat de relatie tussen het noodlot en het toeval een fundamentele spanningsrelatie is, gesitueerd op een dynamisch grensgebied.",

'Other people might like it. I just didn’t',L.M. Kranenburg,2016-08-31,"['M.N.M. Verboord', 'M.S.S.E. Janssen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","GoodReads.com offers a place where readers can review and rate the books they have read.
More than before, cultural audiences can thus express the interpretations and evaluations in
public.. In this thesis, I use these expressions to study how readers created meaning in an online
social network. Previous research has predominantly focused on cultural consumption patterns
and its relation to social status and cultural classification, on the one hand, and on the use of
aesthetic criteria by professional critics, on the other hand. I adopt a qualitative approach in
researching meaning as well as value of readers actively seeks to bridge the gap between
meaning making and value attribution. This study aims to research in what way reviewers on
GoodReads make sense, evaluate, and relate to what they read. By studying 238 reviews of
bestseller and prizewinner books, it will become apparent that meaning making touches upon three
dimensions, each of these dimension delving deeper into the core of the reviews. First, we will see
the great variety in which reviewers contextualise their opinion. Most reviewers offer a reflexive
context so their readers can make sense of the review. Simultaneously, this leads to a form of
distinction and classification: prizewinner reviews state their experience and knowledge, place the
books in a wider literary context and mention the relativity of taste. Bestseller reviewers on the
other hand, are more clear-cut in their aesthetic criteria, due to the genre-expectations they have.
Second, the motivation to read books is closely related to the way readers appreciate different
aspects of a book. A need for escapism in reading bestseller books for example, leads to a great
appreciation and demand for the build-up of a clear plot. Third, the tone reviewers use to evaluate
a book, using either more distant or more personal aesthetic criteria, vocalises a more technical or
literal understanding of the book. It will become apparent that in researching online reviews,
therefore concentrating on readers’ agency instead of mere readers’ consumption, we gain a better
understanding in how people make sense of what they read and that indeed, reading bestseller
books is experienced differently from reading prizewinning books.","['Reading', 'Value', 'Meaning', 'Culture', 'Books']"
The Causes and Consequences of the First Barbary War 1801-1805,R. Monsieurs,2016-08-29,"['F.M.M. de Goey', 'H.A.M. Klemann']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study examined the First Barbary War that transpired during the beginning of the nineteenth century (1801-1805) and was fought between the early United States and the semi-independent Ottoman Barbary State of Tripoli, located within the region of Northern-Africa. The primary objective of this study was to shed a light on the reasons that the United States had for waging the first-ever transatlantic war in its existence. It found that a multitude of factors were responsible for this occurrence, which were located within the ideological, economic, military and political realms. Secondly, the study examined the long-term effects that the First Barbary War had on the American identity, American foreign policy and the relationship between the executive and legislative powers within the U.S. government.

During the course of this study it became clear that the ideological foundations of the United States, namely its central pillars of liberty, independence and free commerce, all played their respective roles in the outbreak of the conflict. Furthermore, it was found that the United States was incentivized to wage the First Barbary War out of economic necessity. Military developments at the end of the eighteenth century also played a role, with the permanent establishment and growth of the United States Navy allowing the United States to go to war. Finally, it was found that Thomas Jefferson’s personal convictions also played a major part in the outbreak of the conflict. 

The second part of the study focused on the long-term effects that the First Barbary War had on the United States. Here it was found that the successful conclusion to the war led to an explosion of patriotism within the United States, with its population becoming more sure of the continued independence of their nation. The war also caused a power-shift within the United States government, with the unilateral actions of Thomas Jefferson setting a precedent for future demonstrations of executive power over the more constitutional prior consultation of congress. And lastly, the war had an effect on American foreign policy in later years, with the nation now becoming increasingly confident in its abilities to project force abroad. 

This study thus attempted to paint a comprehensive picture of the causes and consequences of the First Barbary War. Furthermore, it also divided the reasons found by order of importance, with the personal convictions of Thomas Jefferson and the economic factors previously mentioned being deemed the most influential. The ideological and military factors, while also important, were classified under secondary reasons. In its conclusion, the study stressed that the war however small in scale and largely forgotten today still had a major impact on the course of both American and Northern-African history.","['Barbary Wars', 'First Barbary War', 'United States', 'America', 'Foreign Policy', 'American History', 'Barbary Corsairs', 'Privateering', 'Barbary Pirates']"
Veranderde vrouwen. Vrouwelijk denken in Catherine Malabou's Changing Difference,Jan Miller,2016-08-29,"['dr. S. van Tuinen', 'prof. dr. M.M.S.K. Sie']",Erasmus School of Philosophy,"De positie van vrouwen en de positie van het vrouwelijke als concept hebben in de filosofie een
pijnlijke geschiedenis. Als hiërarchisch onderscheid was de traditionele opvatting van seksueel
verschil de legitimatie van vrouwelijke ondergeschiktheid. Maatschappelijke en wetenschappelijke ontwikkelingen hebben een hiërarchisch onderscheid ongeloofwaardig gemaakt, waarmee ook het filosofische concept van het vrouwelijke onder druk is komen te staan. Heeft het vrouwelijke een toekomst als aparte filosofische categorie? Hebben vrouwen een bijzondere filosofische bijdrage te leveren, of moet filosofie juist geslachtsneutraal worden?

In deze thesis geldt het werk van Catherine Malabou als uitgangspunt voor een zoektocht naar de
mogelijkheden van een vrouwelijk denken, dat zou kunnen dienen als de filosofische grondslag
voor een positieve herwaardering van het vrouwelijke. In Changing Difference legt zij de
conceptuele problemen van seksueel verschil uiteen, en schetst de gevolgen voor vrouwelijke
filosofie. Haar aanpak wordt vergeleken met twee andere feministische benaderingen. Dit leidt tot een concept van vrouwelijkheid als gesitueerd, relationeel en politiek stimulerend.",

The Finnish Freedom of Speech: An Illusion?,A.L. van Ommen,2016-08-29,"['C.E. Aalberts', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","As Finland experienced a long and complex history of “oppression” by Russia, it is interesting to explore whether the history is reflected in the way journalists shape the existing ideology and image of Russia. According to the literature the Finnish history of “domination” by Russia and the former Soviet Union, is reflected in the existing journalistic content on Russia. Moreover, over the last five years Finland holds the number one position worldwide on the Press Freedom Index this in contrast to Russia, who is ranking 148th on index. This was different during the Soviet Union era when Finland exerted self-censorship. Considering the history of self-censorship, it is interesting to explore to what extent Finnish journalists are able to maintain their high level of freedom regarding the coverage on Russia. Accordingly, the aim of this research is to examine how journalists position themselves in reference to Russia. In order to examine this, the following main research question was designed: What is the position of Finnish journalists when it comes to reporting on Russia? In exploring the research question, a qualitative interview study was conducted among 18 Finnish journalists from 12 different newspapers that are based in Helsinki. Although Finland has the freest media environment worldwide and Finnish journalists claim to feel free in writing about Russia, the findings of the research show that in some way they are restricted in their reporting on Russia. It appears that Finnish journalists do approach Russian sources in a different way than they approach sources from other countries. They approach the Russian sources more carefully. This is reflected in their writing on Russia. Finnish journalists feel they carry an extra load when writing about Russia. Some journalists even choose to write anonymously to guarantee their privacy to prevent themselves from becoming a victim of the Russia cyber-war (i.e. Russian troll attacks) or the restrictions (i.e. being denied to get a Russian visa). The journalists feel they take a risk by reporting on Russia, as they can become victims of the Russian restrictions. Nevertheless, the cyber-war does not stop Finnish journalists from writing critically about Russia.","['Finland', 'Russia', 'journalism', 'freedom of speech', 'public image']"

EXPLAINING THE EMERGENCE OF EUROPEAN UNION BATTLEGROUP CONCEPT: THE TEST FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION THEORIES,"Koreneva, A.",2016-08-25,"['dr. M. Onderco', 'prof.dr. M. Haverland']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The study intends to contribute to the discussion of European defence cooperation by testing two – process-centric and state-centric – EU integration theory’ explanations of Battlegroup policy pattern. The first explanation rests on the argument about spillover logic of development of operational set of EU military forces and the importance of supranational regulation. The second takes as its reference point an intergovernmental nature of the Common Security and Defence Policy, with Battlegroup Certification process being driven by self-interested policy choices made by European nations.
The importance of this policy is determined by the fact, that it is the first and the only experiment of the Union to jointly establish military force, which is to be deployed by the common decision. Correspondingly, the attempt must be made to find a place of this empirical object within the milieu of International Relations, and, more specifically, European Integration theory. I assume, that two alternative explanations – Neo-functionalist an Intergovernmentalist – must be employed, as they can provide comprehensive alternative outlooks on studied phenomenon.
The study is conducted in logic of Congruence analysis, which allows for confronting of two theoretical perspectives. The data is obtained from unclassified sources – official European and country reports on the certification progress and documents setting standards for certification and evaluation, including the NATO documents, and via expert survey. The results suggest that Intergovernmentalist account is more accurate in its explanation of empirical facts, although a set of strong arguments can be found on Neo-functionalist side.",
