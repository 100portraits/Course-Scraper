"Irrigation policies in Cayambe, Ecuador before and after 2007","Martínez Nuñez, María del Mar",2016-12-16,['Arsel Murat'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The differences between neoliberalism and post-neoliberalism have been debated on several levels: from the recognition of the terms to specific applied policies. The present document examines the differences between these two
periods in terms of water politics, using the case of an Andean region in Ecuador (Cayambe and Tabacundo). This region has a history of social struggles over water access and distribution, and there is competing needs for the use of water between flower farms and indigenous communities.
Through the examination of the implemented water politics, it’s argued that there is a dichotomy between the normative and the day-by-day politics. Normatively the differences on water politics in post-neoliberalism marks a turning point, engaging with a different development paradigm, assuming new priorities on water distribution and recognizing community water management.
While the applied politics and plans show a greater state control on water management; it also results in the marginalization of communities participation in decision-making power through the establishment of a -state wide- hierarchy on water management structure in the rural areas. Also, the implementation of new infrastructure for irrigation unbundles pre-established social relations on a community water management that surged as a protest of neoliberal water policies.","['Water', 'water management', 'neoliberalism', 'post-neoliberalism', 'community water management', 'Andean region', 'Ecuador', 'irrigation canal']"

"The puzzle in service delivery through public-private partnership in Nigeria : The case Of household solid waste management in Lafia, Nasarawa State","Bassey, Oten Ita",2016-12-16,['Arsel Murat'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Public-private partnership (PPP) is a common development model promoted by the World Bank and other international organizations as what can solve the problem of service provision in diverse sector of the economy. The management of solid waste has been marked with economic crises and the increasing flow of waste drives policy makers in Lafia to adopt PPP. The adoption of PPP has transformed the state institution and changed the mode
of governance. The designing and implementation has created different
outcome for different classes of citizens, obscured with cultural practices that is not embrace by the state. However, the various practices, human intentions, the resistance in the nature of waste and the commodification of waste by the
state has influence the efficiency that is promoted with PPP. Besides, the
environmental change that is produced from the mode of regulation by the state has created a clean environment for the wealthy while intensifying the indiscriminate disposal in poor neighbourhood. The role of the state in marketization of solid waste has led to contradictions, inequality and has limited the sustainability of household solid waste management in Lafia.","['public-private partnership', 'regulation', 'household solid waste', 'sustainability', 'inequality', 'environment', 'materiality']"

of global discourses about culture and development conceptualized mainly in the
Agenda 21 for Culture. Also the expanded concepts of arts and social sculpture,
fostered by the artist Joseph Beuys in the 1970s, are un-packed and brought to the field
of development studies as a drivers for social cohesion. The triangulation between
practices, concepts and a reflexive interpretation is understood a way of doing
development (Escobar 2007). As a methodology it places this research in the poststructural
margins (Strega 2005) where a counter-hegemonic knowledge may emerge.

Collection and disposal of solid Waste by private companies in Ghana : A case of Zoomlion Ghana Limited in the Sunyani municipality,"Afia Twenenboah Kodua, Oppong",2016-12-16,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Solid waste collection and disposal poses a serious developmental challenge to many governments in developing countries of which Ghana is no exception. In a concerted effort to tackle this challenge has necessitated the involvement of the private sector to partner with governments.
It is imperative to state that the involvement of the private sector has not seen any drastic improvements in the management of solid wastes. An assessment of Zoomlion Company, a private solid waste management company in the Sunyani Municipality in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana has amply testified to this phenomenon. This study was conducted with a sample size of 76, consisting of 40 residents from non-residential areas, 30 from residential areas and 6 officials selected from both the Municipal Assembly
and Zoomlion Company. A mixed method research design involving questionnaire, interview and observation was used in the data collection. The research revealed that sole-sourcing does not promote effectiveness and efficiency in any developmental agenda such as solid waste management. This is due to the fact that the selection of the Zoomlion Company was not done through any rigorous competitive bidding. It was revealed that the collection and disposal practices in the Sunyani Municipality was far from being appropriate due to certain inappropriate collection and disposal practices such as insufficient human and materials resources, people’s attitude towards sanitation practices and the sanitation workers, and lack of knowledge or education on waste management as a whole. In a bid to ensure practical improvement
in solid waste management in solid waste management in the Sunyani municipality, the study has recommended that the Assembly should award contracts with due recourse to the Public Procurement Act (Act 914) of 2016.
Finally, the Assembly should, among other measures expedite actions on intensifying regular supervision and periodic public education on solid waste management in order to ensure effectiveness and efficiency for a better health for the residents.","['private companies', 'solid waste', 'Zoomlion Ghana Limited', 'public private partnership', 'private sector']"
Euthanasia as a case of judicial entrepreneurship in India? Analysing the role of the Supreme Court in the policy process of euthanasia,"Pothula, Aishwarya",2016-12-16,['Tankha Sunil'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Euthanasia is a non-political issue in India. It does not receive adequate political attention necessary to arrive at policy solutions. This paper – the first of its kind – explores the role of the Supreme Court of India in euthanasia’s policy making process. Why the Supreme Court of India? In 2011, it established passive euthanasia as a temporary law in India. This 2011 judgement in the Aruna Shanbaug case is the first and the only instance that brought euthanasia some public attention. This judgement therefore is the empirical focus of this paper.
The paper employs two techniques of discourse analysis to study the Court’s system of argumentation. The two methods, Text Analysis using Gasper’s Analysis Table and Frame Analysis – are complemented by other discourse techniques of metaphor analysis and lexical analysis. The results of this paper are three-fold: 1) The Court dismissed the petitioner’s request for euthanasia on weak grounds, thereby setting no precedent for the ‘historic’ procedure it put in place. In other words, it left the decision open for the Parliament to decide. Hence, the judgment cannot be considered judicial overreach. 2) It defines euthanasia in a way that is reflective of broader societal themes. It combines this with its accepted authoritative and protective stance to find an intermediate position to balance the possible opposition to its role in the process and what it (perhaps) perceives to be an optimal solution. 3) It softens up the policy community (including the public) to the idea of passive euthanasia in India leading it towards a Parliamentarian legislation. It achieves this by shaping prevalent principles, provisions and worldviews through a remarkable use of its legal instruments. This paper refers to this unconventional role of the SC as ‘judicial entrepreneur-ship’ which is also the first scholarly contribution towards research on euthanasia as a policy issue in India.","['argumentation', 'Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug', 'discourse analysis', 'euthanasia', 'India', 'judicial entrepreneurship', 'non-political issue', 'policy agenda', 'policy-making process', 'Supreme Court of India']"
Gender Stereotypes in technology use: a content analysis of Mr. Robot,N. El Sabagh,2016-12-08,"['A.F.M. Krijnen', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","GENDER STEREOTYPES IN TECHNOLOGY USE:
A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF Mr. ROBOT

ABSTRACT

The present research further develops the existing body of knowledge on the representation of gender stereotypes in the usage of technology in media. Gender and technology use are primarily studied in advertising. However, television fictions forms the largest share of audience’s media diets. Therefore, the current study analysed how gender stereotypes with regard to technology are portrayed on television, focusing on the cyber-TV drama Mr. Robot. This program is of interest as its main theme is technology and in particular hacker culture. This study tests the hypotheses gathered from previous research about gender stereotypes in the usage of technology. The quantitative content analysis of Mr. Robot showed that gender stereotypes in relation to the usage of communicational technological devices such as computer, tablets and mobile phones are present. Exploring these results through the lenses of the social role theory (Eagly, 1987) led to the conclusion that, when it comes to using communicational technological devices, men and women are represented quite different. Male characters are portrayed to able to use technology with high skills, for instance hacking, whereas female characters are represented in general as less capable of using advanced CTDs and only a small minority of them are able to carry out difficult tasks with technology. Overall, in this contemporary television drama, men are represented as tech savvy compared to women, suggesting a male-dominated view of the usage of technology.","['Usage of technology', 'social role theory', 'content analysis', 'gender differences', 'gender stereotypes']"

Yucatan, Mexico has particular communities with high index of migrant population who live in the United States and regularly try to visit home. Through formal and informal interviews and conversations and observations, this study analyze the impact of rituals on both, local people and migrants through which women and men produce and reproduce feelings of home, belonging and cultural identity. Although the study is mainly interested in the adjustment of the peoples' identities based on the phenomenon of migration during the festivity, discussions and interviews will not be confined to return migrants only, it will include a wide range of female and male from different backgrounds, who have returned especially for the patron saint festivity of Cenotillo and those people who are currently living in the community. This study explores women and men migrants’ self-defined identities, who visit their hometown and compare to those people who stay and adapt their lives during those days of celebration. Questions about ‘belonging’ and ‘home’ will be focused at as a way of understanding the rituals and identity formation among such populations.","['migration', 'Yucatan', 'Cenotillo', 'fiesta', 'rituals', 'identities', 'religion', 'community']"

Lost sons of the Fatherland
The Boer Wars in Dutch history textbooks, 1907-2012

The first Boer War (1880-1881) aroused much enthusiasm amongst the public in the Netherlands for the white Dutch speaking population of South Africa, particularly those living in Orange Free State and the South African Republic, also known as Transvaal. This was in sharp contrast to the years before when there was hardly any attention for the Boers. However, during the last two decades of the nineteenth century, with a climax during the Second Boer War, the ties between the Boers and the Dutch were actually celebrated.1 Many people compared the successful fight of the Boers, who wanted to regain their independence from the British Empire after the annexation in 1877, with the conflict between the Dutch and the Spaniards in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. Consequently, the Boers were seen as worthy descendants of their ancestors, the pioneers of the Dutch East India Company who had settled in the Cape Colony in 1652.2 Even Abraham Kuyper, who was prime minister of The Netherlands at the time, felt that the Boers resembled the freedom-loving, wholesome, devoutly Christian Dutch of the past, precisely because ‘they have managed to preserve the old spirit of our nation more truly than we’, while ‘we have become more cosmopolitan’.3

Textbooks, especially history and geography textbooks, are some of the most important educational inputs: textbooks reflect basic ideas about a national culture and they contain the knowledge a society wants to transmit to its children.4 They are means by which the political and social norms of a society can be anchored.5 Over the last few decades we have seen a so-called ‘boom’ of historical research on the impact of the Boer Wars in the Netherlands. Some scholars have researched the representations of the Boer Wars in media, children’s books and other sources. However, there hasn’t been an analysis of these representations in history textbooks. Consequently, the main question I have attempted to answer during my Master Thesis research is the following: ‘How are the Boer Wars

represented in Dutch history textbooks between 1907 and 2012, and what do these representations tell us about the national identity of the Netherlands in that period?’ To answer this question, I analysed Dutch history textbooks (used in secondary education). Additionally, I conducted a small pilot study on the representations of the Boer Wars in South-African history textbooks.6

The quantitative analysis showed that it was not until the 1950’s that the Boer Wars became a less popular topic in the Dutch history textbooks. By looking at the total amount of pages that were dedicated to the Boer Wars, one can see that the space devoted to the Boer Wars, between 1907 and 1950, varied from ca. 3% to 4,5%. After the 1950’s the findings show that the total amount of pages dedicated to the Boer’s was reduced to a percentage of 1.0% to 0.5%. Further quantitative research showed that Cecil Rhodes, Horatio Kitchener, Louis Botha, Christiaan de Wet and Paul Kruger were dominant actors in the narratives. Especially Paul Kruger, quite often nicknamed ‘Uncle Paul’, was referred to often. However, after the 1990’s we can see a shift in terms of which people are mentioned in the narratives. The English actors, as well as some Boer-actors, are replaced by Nelson Mandela and Willem de Klerk. These shifts, as my research shows, reflect changing public opinions and developments in the field of history education. Although the quantitative analysis can tell us a great deal about where the emphasis lies and about the popularity of the narrative, it does not tell us anything about values and interpretation. What does a text tell us, what message does it transmit?

The empirical heart of this research, the narrative analysis, is based on three concepts: emplotment, patterns of reasoning and mythologization. All three concepts have been analysed in the textbooks of the following three periods: 1907-1940, 1946-1968 and 1969-2012. Narrative analysis shows that the plot of the narratives about the Boers during the first period (1907-1940) centred on the ‘good guys’ versus the ‘bad guys’. Through narrating about myths of kinship and descendancy, the narratives confirmed a shared community, being the community of the Boers and the Dutch. Surprisingly, the South-African textbook did not narrate about feelings of kinship. Moreover, the English are not portrayed as the ‘bad guys’ or ‘villains’. This indicates that the kinship was being highlighted or maybe even exaggerated in the Dutch history textbooks.

The plot of the narratives used during the second period (1946-1968) still centred on the conflict between the Boers and Britain. However, even though the Boers were still represented as heroes in Dutch textbooks, Britain was no longer portrayed as the ultimate ‘bad guy’. Even though some textbooks still narrated about the kinship and the shared past, in most narratives one could also find critical notes on racial distinctions and nationalism in South-Africa. Consequently, we could see the first signs of ‘exclusion’: the Boers were no longer a part of the Dutch ‘we-group’. As a result myths about origins

and ancestry more or less disappeared. In the South-African textbook the opposite was happening: the English were now the ultimate ‘bad guys’.

The narratives in the last period (1969-2012) clearly reflected the changing society and public opinion. The plot centred on the racist, obstinate and immoral Boers who fought Britain with hideous war tactics and established the system of apartheid. The story of the Boer Wars is nowadays no longer a narrative in itself, but a part of the narrative about the apartheid. The Boers are the bad guys and as a consequence we no longer see anything that could indicate a shared past or relationship between the Boers and the Netherlands. All this shows how the dichotomic structure of good guys and bad guys can fill an important function in both myth and narrative, confirming ‘our’ community as something good and defining the enemy as not only evil but also as a threat to humanity.

This study does not only touch upon areas such as history education and the changing cultural and political relationship between South-Africa and the Netherlands. It also shows how national identities and myths are part of cultural and historical circumstances. This analysis of the representation of the Boer Wars in Dutch (and South-African) textbooks gives us an insight into how narratives and national identities can transform through time. But most of all it contributes to the historical knowledge about the representations of the Boer Wars in the Netherlands.","['History textbooks', 'History education', 'The Boer Wars', 'National identity', 'Myths', 'Narrative analysis']"

The Influence of Customers’ Motivation Leading to the Contributions of Individuals and Communities to a Waste Bank Program,"Pratiwi, D.A. (Destri Ayu)",2016-10-31,['Smals R. (Raphaël)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This research focused on the implementation of integrated sustainable waste management (ISWM) through household participation in a waste bank program. This study investigates the influence of customers’ motivation in participating in a waste bank program, thereby affecting customers’ contribution to the effectiveness of the waste bank program. The research examines two types of customers in Cimahi municipality: individuals and unit customers who have different characteristics and behaviors. The first part of the research explains implementation of Samici Waste Bank’s program in Cimahi city, and how it operates on a daily basis. The second part of the research investigates the differences between individuals and unit customers in terms of motivation to participate in the waste bank program. The third part inspects whether discrepancies between the two types of customers influences the costumers’ contribution to the waste bank, and how this affects the program’s effectiveness in achieving waste reduction policy targets.
The study was an explanatory, single holistic case study. Various literature and case studies on ISWM were reviewed, particularly related to waste recycling activities, waste bank programs and household participation. Assessment variables and indicators were then formulated as analytic tools to assess the influence of customers’ motivation to participate in a waste bank program, thereby contributing to the effectiveness of the program. The method of primary data collection involved questionnaires which were completed by waste bank customers. The selection of a sample for questionnaires was by stratified random sampling based on types of waste bank customers (individuals and units). In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the waste bank director and with selected waste bank customers for data triangulation purpose, using single purposive sampling as sample selection method. Use was also made of reviewing secondary data as well as observation. The data from field work were then analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, assisted by SPSS, Microsoft Excel, and Atlas.ti program software in the forms of narratives, tables, chats and images.
The findings reveal that in terms of customers’ motivation to participate in the waste bank program, there are four variables which demonstrate significant differences between individuals and unit customers, namely: socioeconomic condition (occupation and community level activity), attitude towards participation in a waste bank program, subjective norms, and convenience. It can be concluded that customers’ motivation significantly influences each household’s decision on the level of participation to which they want to become involved in the program, as individuals or unit customers. This research also shows a weak correlation between a customer’s motivation and their contribution to the program in Samici Waste Bank. This means that customers’ motivation to participate did not directly and significantly affect the amount of contributions made to the waste bank program. However, encouragement from external referents (friends, neighbors and community leaders) and convenience (accessibility to the service facilities) may influence people to participate and contribute more to the waste bank program. Furthermore, contributions to the waste bank program are more influenced by technical aspects such as frequency of depositing waste, number of recyclable materials delivered, and total amount of waste deposited.
To improve the effectiveness of the waste bank program, several recommendations are formulated. First, encouraging more socialization about Samici Waste Bank with related stakeholders to create awareness. Second, improving the quality of convenience which consists of availability of service facilities and accessibility.","['sustainability', 'ISWM', 'waste bank', 'motivational factors', 'household behavior', 'participation', 'performance measurement', 'effectiveness']"
Bergson en James: twee handen op één buik?,Stefan Schwarz,2016-10-31,"['dr. G.A.M. Groot', 'drs. F.H.H. Schaeffer']",Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Bergsons duur en James’ stream of consciousness vertonen onmiskenbaar overeenkomsten, en zij komen onafhankelijk van elkaar tot een dynamische opvatting van het bewustzijn. Om deze reden is het interessant na te gaan op welke vlakken hun opvattingen van het bewustzijn overeenkomen, en interessanter nog: hoe en of ze van elkaar verschillen. In deze scriptie zullen de opvattingen van Bergsons duur en James’ stream of consciousness worden uiteengezet, waarvoor zal worden georiënteerd op enerzijds Tijd en Vrije Wil, en anderzijds op het hoofdstuk ‘Stream of Thought’ uit The Principles of Psychology. In het laatste hoofdstuk van de scriptie zal worden ingegaan op vraag hoe die opvattingen met elkaar overeenkomen, dan wel van elkaar verschillen. 
 
In deze scriptie zal duidelijk worden dat Bergson en James, onafhankelijk van elkaar, tot een vergelijkbare opvatting van het bewustzijn zijn gekomen. Bergson introduceert zijn duur en James zijn stream of consciousness. Beide opvattingen gaan uit van een dynamisch bewustzijn, één dat voortdurend in verandering is, waarmee ze een felle kritiek behelzen op het associationisme. Het is tevens een zeer moeilijke opgave de stroom, respectievelijk de flux introspectief te zien voor wat zij echt is. Ook taal vormt tevens een obstakel, want zij is nooit in staat de stroom of de flux in zijn zuiverheid te handhaven. Daarnaast zien we dat Bergson met zijn notie van duur metafysische claims maakt aangaande de aard van het bewustzijn en de werkelijkheid zelf. James’ beschrijving van het bewustzijn is een puur wijsgerig-psychologische analyse en ten aanzien van de werkelijkheid gaat hij niet zo ver als Bergson. Waar Bergson in de loop van zijn leven richting de metafysica trekt, blijft James trouw aan de psychologie en trekt in filosofisch opzicht juist richting het pragmatisme.",

The second part of the study presents the essential ideas of contemporary philosophers of technology. By analyzing their works it turns out that ‘things’ mediate the relation between humans and their world on all sorts of levels. The theories provide a framework for thinking from the perspective of things and for a vision on technology that Verbeek in What Things Do calls a ""postphenomenological perspective”.

The spell of the self-ownership thesis: an attempt to break it,Fabrizio Ciatti,2016-10-10,"['dr. B. Ferguson', 'dr. C.B. Binder']",Erasmus School of Philosophy,"The thesis of self-ownership (SO) asserts that each individual qua exclusive proprietor of his
own self possesses “original moral rights over his own body, faculties, talents and the fruits of
his labour” (Nozick 1974, Cohen 1995). Nozick in his famous Anarchy, State and Utopia
argues that the rights of self-ownership entitle each individual to make use of his own body as
he sees fit and to impose upon others the obligation to respect these rights. The same
prerogatives extend to the extra-personal objects one legitimately possesses. Libertarianism,
in its traditional vest is essentially a moral and political theory that stresses the inviolability of
individuals’ natural rights of ownership. The term “natural” is owed to the fact that these
rights belong to the individuals independently of a civil framework of legal rules and their
binding force “obtains and can be recognized as valid by moral and rational people quite apart
from any provisions of positive law” (Waldron 1988: 64). More precisely, libertarians of the
right and the left hold property rights to be the non-acquired rights individuals have over their
bodies. Such rights determine what individuals may do to others. The chief purpose of this
thesis is to interrogate the possibility of building up a theory of justice and a theory of private
property on the grounds of the principle of SO. First I am going to cast doubt on the
foundation of SO rights and then I am going to present the difficulties in making property
rights over extra-personal resources a corollary of property rights over one’s body. By these
means I hope to offer valid reasons against the use of SO as a starting point in a theory of
justice.",

"The Influence of Push and Pull Strategies on a Modal Shift from Private Vehicle Use to Trans Jogja in Yogyakarta, Indonesia","Danandjojo, Y.N.E. (Yescha)",2016-10-03,['Beenakker I. (Ivo)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Being aware of the urban transportation problems in Yogyakarta, and wanting to minimize their negative impact, the government of Yogyakarta Special Region (the equivalent of provincial government) has introduced several transportation programs, and Trans Jogja is one of the programs for providing urban public transport in Yogyakarta. However, the existence of Trans Jogja has still not managed to make it the alternative main transportation option for people in Yogyakarta. Private vehicle use in Yogyakarta still increased during the period (2008-2016), showing that dependency on private vehicles in Yogyakarta is still high.
Using the concept of Transport Demand Management (TDM) with the implementation of push and pull strategies, the main objective of this research is to explain how push and pull strategies influence a modal shift from private vehicle use to public transportation (Trans Jogja) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. To support the research objective, the main research question of this study is “How do push and pull strategies influence a modal shift from private vehicle use to public transportation in the case of Trans Jogja in Yogyakarta, Indonesia?”
This research used survey (questionnaire), interview, and secondary data as research instruments. The questionnaire in the survey was used to gather primary information of actual behavior of commuters in making a modal choice that could be influenced by TDM policy (implementation of push and pull strategies); and what respondents preferably need to do to make a modal shift from private vehicles to public transportation. The interviews were conducted to gather in-depth information from the government as policy-maker, policy-developer, and operator of Trans Jogja. Last, secondary data were used to support the explanation about push and pull strategies as TDM policy implementation in Yogyakarta, and its relationship with a modal shift from private vehicle to public transport.
Based on the findings of this research, current Trans Jogja users do not use Trans Jogja for all their trip purposes. Some only use Trans Jogja for certain trip purposes, and most of those are trip purposes with a high degree of flexibility. Moreover, the findings in the field survey reveals that quality of service is more important than travel costs in getting them to make a modal shift. Respondents would still use their private vehicles even if they could travel free of charge, if this is not in combination with the provision of a good service. The quality of Trans Jogja’s services need to be improved, especially with regard to waiting environment; reducing waiting time; reducing the number of public transport interchanges; providing adequate operational hours and affordable ticket fare; and also ensuring safety of passengers when using Trans Jogja to attract more people to use Trans Jogja based on the data analysis.
Three transportation policies were implemented as push strategies in Yogyakarta, namely parking management, restricted road policy, and taxation on cars and fuel. Nonetheless, those three implemented transportation policies currently have given less influence to respondents in making modal shift from private vehicle use to Trans Jogja. Finding of this research shows that the implemented policies were still supply-oriented rather than demand-management, so that the policies implemented give less pressure and still give comfort for commuters to use private vehicles.","['modal shift', 'Trans Jogja', 'transport demand management', 'pull strategy', 'push strategy']"

But, what makes one place more attractive to creative enterprises and activities than another? How is the spatial behavior of creative entrepreneurs formed? This study focuses on the dynamics which affect the relationship between creative enterprises and their spatial context. The spatial clustering of (creative) industries is traditionally explained by agglomeration economies benefiting co-located firms and urban amenities that attract creative people to certain cities.  A wide literature has attempted to explain the general characteristics of ‘creative places’ by focusing on firms rather than people. Nevertheless, there is still little knowledge of the perceived attributes of a location by those creative individuals and the micro-interactions that occur especially at the micro-city level of clustering.  By conducting interviews with creative entrepreneurs in the city center of Athens, this qualitative study attempts to investigate the perceived attractiveness of a location and how those creative entrepreneurs choose and evaluate this location, by assessing the relative importance of different location determinants.","['creative economy', 'locational behavior', 'creative entrepreneurs', 'creative clusters', 'Athens', 'city center']"
"Understanding Intermediate Public Transport (IPT) as the Mode of Choice in Jakarta, Indonesia","Panjaitan, F.W. (Fresly Willyater)",2016-09-01,['Sharma S. (Somesh)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Jakarta suffers from heavy traffic congestion, and this costs people not only their money but also their valuable time. Yet public transportation is still not enough to facilitate people’s daily mobility. In response to the Jakarta’s gridlock, the paratransit or intermediate public transport (IPT) plays a bigger role in helping the commuter’s activity and mobility. However, most of the existing IPT mode has poor quality and level of service. In 2014, GOJEK as a newcomer in IPT was launched and started to provide an alternative means of transport, and its presence has created a new system of providing service to its customers, and shortly it became popular and highly demanded by the people.
Since the IPT operation is based on the user’s travel needs and their satisfaction with the level of service, the user may leave the IPT with poor service, and they prefer to switch to another IPT mode that is considered better and capable of accommodating their mobility.
GOJEK operation and popularity has not only alarmed other IPT operators about how important the quality of service is, but it has also raised government’s awareness of how the regulation should adapt to and accommodate the new system of IPT operation without sacrificing the travel needs of the commuters.
Hence, to bridge the government’s interest in formulating a new regulation and in helping IPT operators improve their service, this study will explore the four IPT modes’ level of service in Jakarta from the commuter’s perception. The attributes of the commuter’s perception of the level of service will be analyzed to find the most influential factor that determines their transportation mode decision. This study will reveal the important aspects of developing the transportation system policy by determining different weights of importance for the paratransit users in Jakarta. Finally, this research proposes several recommendations to help the government formulate the regulation that accommodates the operators’ and commuters’ interest.","['intermediate public transport', 'paratransit', 'choice of mode', 'perception', 'level of service']"
Determinants of Household Participation in Solid Waste Segregation,"Jauhari, A. (Azibi)",2016-09-01,['Skinner J.M. (Julia)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Solid waste management practice is a matter of concern for public health and environmental protection and has become a major challenge in most developing countries. Improper waste management can bear adverse consequences on public health, environment, and natural resources. Many governments have been implemented several strategy in dealing with solid waste in a sustainable way, and recycling is one of them. However, a recycling program can only be successful if the community support and actively participate in it, and as the largest stakeholder, households have important role especially in waste source segregation. Therefore, it can be argued that households’ participation, especially in source segregation, is essential in the successfulness of recycling activity.
Depok have been implemented recycling programme to deal with solid waste problem since 2006. A source separation from the source is introduced in this recycling programme. Therefore, households participation is essential. However, recent survey held in 2011 and 2015 have showed low household participation and there are only 1% increase of household participation in waste segregation from 32% in 2011 into 33% in 2015 (Health Agency City of Depok, 2015).
In general, many researches have focusing to enhance in studying household participation in waste recycling programme with the objectives to enhance their participation. However, most of the researches that have been done were based on the psychological perspective. Recent studies have shown that situational factors need to be incorporated, as recycling also relies on practical issues rather than only on psychological motivations. Accordingly, this research incorporated both approaches that include psychological and situational factors to understand household participation in waste source segregation.
This research aimed to understand the influence of psychological and situational factors on household participation in waste source segregation within Depok Waste Recycling Programme. By doing so, we hope to find the conditions and kind of interventions which may enhance cooperation for the implementation of Depok recycling program.
Survey is chosen as the strategy of this research. Questionnaire, interview, and field observation is used as research instruments. A total of 176 respondents for the questionnaire was obtained. As analysis tools, either independent T-test or Chi-square test was used in order to differentiate household participation in waste segregation. This research also used binary logistic to analysis which psychological and situational factors influence household participation. Binary logistic analysis was used because the dependent variable was designed in dichotomous variable based on the household self-reporting response on waste segregation practice.
The research finds that household participation could be distinguished by psychological and situational factor. In term of psychological factor, household participation can be distinguished by their attitude towards waste segregation, subjective norms, and perceived easiness. In term of situational factor, both groups can be distinguished by their perception regarding facility quality, source of information regarding recycling programme, concrete knowledge about the type of recyclables material, and the importance of monetary incentives. Additionally, in term of demographic attributes, both groups can be distinguished by family income, and level of education between the two groups. Further finding, only external subjective norms and perceived capability, number of source information regarding recycling Determinants of Household Participation in Solid Waste Segregation: a case study in Depok, Indonesia iii

Landlord and Tenant Profiles and Informal Rental Arrangements,"Gokhale, S. (Sneha)",2016-09-01,['Dijk T. van (Tara)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Given the number of people who rent informal housing, its marginalization in policies and projects is concerning. It is estimated that, number of renters will soon out number the private owners in many slums of developing countries. Informal settlements cater to such needs and it is estimated that 60% to 90% of affordable rental stocks in Asia is available in informal settlements. 25% of housing stock in India comes from the informal rentals in settlements. With this alarming increase, the informal rental sector continues to be an understudied area. This study was conceived to further the knowledge about the informal rental markets.
The research aims to understand how socio-economic characteristics of the landlords and tenants affect the rental arrangements, present in the same settlement. Authors like Kumar (2001), Gilbert (2016) claim that informal rentals offer the tenant with housing at an affordable price with flexibility to live and proximity to livelihood opportunities. These are perceived as the positive attributes of the sector. However, Gulyani (2008), Desai (2013) and Chattraj (2015) question these same attributes shaping the theory debate surrounding the rental market. The research seeks to understand the inclusion and exclusionary tendencies of the rental market based on the socio-economic profiles of the landlords and tenants.
This research employed case study method as the research strategy with qualitative analysis. For which, semi-structured interviews were conducted. These interviews covered tenants, landlords and brokers in the informal settlement. Hence, the first step was to note the types of rental arrangements and types of landlords and tenants. The next step, was to draw out links between the rental arrangements and the types of landlords and tenants. Further steps included, interpreting qualitatively the strength of the relationship between these variables.
It is clear from the findings, that the rental arrangements are varying and certain characteristics of the tenants and landlords are contributing for the change. The family structure of the tenants and the type of landlords influence the rental arrangement chosen. Furthermore, these alterations are more biased towards the landlords, leaving most tenants on the weaker side of the bargain and not always offering flexibility to tenants. Moreover, the rental arrangements can be linked with the domestic strategies of financial management opted by both the actors. The research leaves us with further questions, which are relevant to housing policy and further the knowledge of informal markets in developing economies.","['informal rental housing', 'rental arrangement', 'landlords', 'tenants']"
Impact of FDI on income inequality in Africa,"Kaur, R. (Rupinder)",2016-09-01,"['Fransen J. (Jan)', 'Wall R. (Ronald)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"FDI is considered as a channel of growth and economic development for the country therefore, many developing countries have gone through economic reforms adopting liberalisation policies towards FDI for achieving higher economic development. There have been contradicting views about the impact of FDI on the economies of recipient countries. Also, there are contradictory evidences in the literature explaining the relationship between FDI and income inequality therefore, present research aims to explain the relationship between FDI and income inequality using dependency theory. It also attempts to identify the factors which determine this relationship in African countries.
The study confirms the argument of dependency theory that the relationship between FDI and income inequality is not direct rather it is determined by local factors such as absorptive capacity, human capital, technology and innovation and institutional environment. It is found that all these factors influence the impact of total and sectoral FDI on income inequality(Li and Liu 2005) but absorptive capacity is the most important factor that positively determine the relationship between FDI and income inequality(Wu and Hsu 2012). In general, a higher absorptive capacity in the country is associated with lower income inequality that is countries with higher absorptive capacity have lower income inequality.
Further the present study found that role of FDI is also sector specific where FDI in hi-tech and manufacturing sector reduces income inequality in African countries while inward FDI in other sectors does not make a significant impact in the host countries. At regional level, there is no significant relationship between FDI and income inequality because of lack of heterogeneity in the sample of countries.","['Income inequality', 'Greenfield Foreign Direct Investment', 'hi-tech sector', 'manufacturing sector', 'service sector', 'resource absorptive capacity', 'technology diffusion', 'human capital', 'quality of institutions']"
"Influence of institutional arrangements on stakeholder’s participation for
effective urban river management","Wawira Kareithi, M. (Millicent)",2016-09-01,['Ast J. van (Jacko)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Water is vital and a key element of any sustainable growth. However availability is
constantly threatened due to increased demand arising from population growth, urbanization
and climatic changes among others. Kenya is not an exception to this. Although a fast
growing agricultural economy at a rate of 5.5%, the country has been labelled a water scarce
country. Therefore water sector reforms introduced the need for stakeholder’s participation
under the Water Act 2002. In this light the legal framework supported participation of
multiple actors; stakeholders including government, non-governmental organizations and
community to help in management of the dwindling resources.
Through decentralization, hydrological basins and sub basins were established to get closer to
the people in management of water resources. One mechanism sought for engagement was
through establishment of Water Resources Users Associations (WRUAs) along the delineated
sub catchments as platform for engagement with multiple actors. One such WRUA that was
established is lower Rupingazi. It manages one of the sub basins with urban and rural
characteristics covering the current Embu town, headquarter of Embu County.
Based on reviewed literature that emphasized that institutionalization encourages
participation, the researcher sought to carry out an explanatory research. The aim was to
explain the influence of institutional arrangement on participation of stakeholders in Lower
Rupingazi WRUA, Embu Kenya.
The researcher employed a qualitative type of research design and carried out a case study.
Using semi structured questions, the researcher conducted interviews to gain an in-depth
understanding on the subject of institutional arrangement and participation. The data
collected from the interviews was triangulated through the secondary data including the
legislations, government reports and plans. Using atlas ti the outputs generated were used to
analyze data to establish the institutional arrangement that affect the stakeholder’s
participation in this sub catchment.
The major findings were that there are various legislations that are related to water resource
management. However there are duplications that lead to conflicts and at times impacted on
the implementation of the activities on the ground. Equally there were overlapping mandates
and unclear roles of some of the stakeholders depicted in the legislations. Further a gap in
coordination mechanisms and weak enforcement of the legislations was noted.
Also it was noted that although the legal framework support provision of financing for water
resources management activities through the WRUA, it was inadequate and inconsistent.
Equally, participation of the stakeholders was high whenever there were activities to be done.
This was mostly when funds were available to implement the activities.
The issue of enforcement came out strongly as the element of the institutional arrangement
that was lacking watering down the intended goodwill of the legislations. The current
legislations however are undergoing review to align to the Constitution of Kenya (COK)
2010. Therefore an opportunity exists to correct the anomalies given the two levels of
government to avoid further complexity in duplication of activities and overlapping roles.
Further enable clear coordination mechanisms to enhance participation of various actors.","['Institutional arrangement', 'stakeholder’s participation', 'Lower Rupingazi river system', 'Water', 'Resource Users Association']"
Willingness to pay for Ecosystem  Services provided by a Green Infrastructure project in Santiago de Cali,"Guatemala, D.G.E. (Diego)",2016-09-01,"['Grafakos S. (Stelios)', 'Tsatsou A. (Alexandra)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The transformation human interaction has enforced on nature is primarily for the growth and development of cities with production and consumption activities that demand 75 percent of the world's energy and produce 80 percent of its greenhouse gasses. Consequently, the responsibility and the key for changing the current trajectory lies in cities, with an economic development that is less resource intensive. Cities can be very rich in biological diversity that provide ecosystem services. Green infrastructure planning can create frameworks for future development while ensuring the preservation of natural resources that provide ES. Urban Ecosystem services are a key component to building urban resilience and reduced vulnerability through mitigation and adaptation measurement. Cities need not only resilient ecosystem services, but to generate them as well.
This paper examined the value of urban ecosystem services provided by a green infrastructure project “Corredor Ambiental Urbano Río Cañaveralejo” in Santiago de Cali, by means of a contingent valuation method (CVM) applying a survey/questioner and damage cost avoided method (DCA) and emphasises in the need for context-specific classification of ecosystem services provided by project. Within this context, the project will provide the city among other benefits with regulating services and cultural services and the WTP for this services is $35.00 per year with a medium range of $25.00 to $44.00.
The study also reveals citizens positive attitude towards nature and the environment and the importance of including natural solution in city planning.
Past events analysis applying damages cost avoided exposed that an average cumulative value of $92,220.37 dollars (insurance value) per year could be utilized for alternative flood prevention methods. Which relates to the project's objective regarding adaptation and mitigation measures for flood events.
A broader and more generalizable result could be obtained if similar studies where performed in the other rivers that course thoroug Cali.

Development & Revocation of undeveloped plots,"Singano, J.M. (Jabiri Musa)",2016-09-01,['Fika O. (Oreoluwa)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Dar es Salaam like any other city is face with a high demand of serviced plot as compared to ability of the government to supply due to increasing population and urbanization. The situation was manageable in 1960 because plots for different use were produced and supplied proportionately with the demand but the situation changed from 1972 when the government decided to decentralize the administration machinery to the regional level. Having realized the situation, the government initiated the first biggest project for land delivery for residential purposes in 1978 covering some neighbourhoods of Dar es Salaam city known as Site and Service Project. Initiatives extended further to produce serviced plots in Dar es Salaam city in the year 2001/2002 MLHHSD decided to launch a project famously known as the 20,000 Plots Project. These projects were successfully achieved and allocated to citizen through recouping capital invested. Almost all plots are owned but most of them remained undeveloped for a long time as opposed to anticipation of the authorities and neither the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlement Development nor the three Dar es Salaam Municipalities took initiatives to enforce development of the allocated plots. Land Act No.4 of 1999 have expressly prescribed that allocated plots to be developed within 36 month after the commencement of the right of occupancy. Furthermore, the law has set a fine of 1% of land value for not conforming to 36 months and if the breach is serious the law has given the president power to revoke the right of occupancy in the public interest. However the enforcement of the regulations is feeble.
This research was conducted in Dar es Salaam with the main objective of revealing and explaining factors that limit development of allocated plots in the 20,000 plots project in Dar es Salaam city and explaining why revocation of the right of occupancy of undeveloped plots beyond 36 month in 20000 plots project in Dar es Salaam city is not effectively enforced. To establish these objectives the main research question that guided the entire study process read; “Which factors hinders the development and revocation of undeveloped plots allocated in the 20,000 plots project in Dar es Salaam city?” The study surveyed Mwongozo and Kibada as neighbourhood study areas.
To ascertain factors hindering the development and revocation of undeveloped plots allocated in the 20,000 plots project, it was first discovered that distance to the CBD and work places is not the accessibility factors that has impact on the development of the plots since it is 15km to Kibada and 20 Km to Mwongozo. However accessibility factors that affect development of plots in Kibada and Mwongozo is the means of transport. On top of that, study found that mobility factors that constrained development of plot in Mwongozo and kibada are commute cost and time. Furthermore, it was discovered that level of services is not satisfactory since in all most all of these areas there is no public water connection, electricity is far from the neighbourhood only found along main roads to Kibada and Mwongozo. Most of roads are weathered roads that are made by the dwellers themselves during the construction time. The study also discovered that there is no clear and convenience fiscal incentive that are provided by the government to encourage the development of plots in Kibada and Mwongozo since most of the system which is available do not benefit the targeted people. On the issue of regulatory incentive study found that there is neither permit procedures reduction and waivers nor building rule waiver. In addition to that the study found that no incremental building practices is allowed from the municipality. Moreover, study found that staff, set up, role and responsibility and politics impede effective revocation, revocation law and procedures are okay since they seems to protect individual land right before revocation. Lastly, study found that resources for revocation are unevenly distributed between the local and nation government and hence finance is the serious challenge at the municipality level.
In conclusion the project objective was clear to plan, survey provide infrastructure then allocate the plots to Dar es Salaam land seekers but problem occur because of the bad implementation of the law.","['Urban land development', 'Revocation', 'undeveloped plots. 20', '000 Plots project']"
"An Analysis on Governance in Watersheds
The Case of Ipo Watershed, Philippines","Corsame, M.E.S. (Maria Edrose Salvania)",2016-09-01,['Ast J. van (Jacko)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This study seeks to understand the role of institutional arrangement, in the context of watersheds, as a tool to encourage coordination among actors. Assessing institutional arrangement and understanding how institution affects the level of coordination are instrumental in identifying appropriate strategies to address the prevailing problems in water resources management. The results are vital in developing watershed management framework, defining policies and programs implementation. This research also highlights the importance of clear, integrated and comprehensive institutional arrangement as a governance tool to encourage the culture of coordination, partnership, and accountability.
The concepts that were used in this research include academic theories on institutional arrangement, governance, and coordination. Related literature revealed that institutional arrangements are instrumental in linking local, provincial, and national level of government and non-government organizations (Mattingly, 2007). Furthermore, it is viewed at a macro and formal perspective, formalized in forms of legal framework, policies and administrative arrangements (Saleth and Dinar, 2000, Mireku, Acheampong, et al., 2014). In the context of governance, the institutional arrangement is deliberated as the basis of management and governance (Montgomery, Stren, et al., 2003). It is considered as a platform to guide, specify incentives or constrainsts and install mechanisms to enhance management (Nansam-Aggrey, 2015). Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) highlights the importance of defined roles and responsabilities among public authorities in order to avoid fragmented policies in water resources management, unharmonized programs, and lack of wholistic performance measurements (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2011). On the other hand, coordination is rationalized as a result of institutionalized norms, rules, and logics (Sehested and Groth, 2012, Orton and Weick, 1990). It was stated that coordination processes are more or less institutionalized governance of different government levels in a political system that came about due to their interdependence, transformative politics and selective interconnectivity. (Sehested and Groth, 2012). Through the lens of these academic literature, empirical information of Ipo Watershed was processed, analyzed and correlated.
The study area was selected because of the role it plays in the provision of water supply to 13 million population of Metro Manila, Philippines. Despite its ecological importance, this watershed degraded down to 30% forest cover as of 2009. The data for this study were collected through semi-structured interview, observation, and secondary data research. Target institutions were pre-selected based on existing laws, regulations, policies and researched articles. Respondents to the interview were identified based on their position in their respective agencies and the role they play in the management of Ipo Watershed. The interviews were carried out with five (5) sectors namely: Environment, Water, Local Government Units, Indigenous Peoples and Non-Government Organization, with a total of thirteen (13) respondents.
Thorough evaluation and analysis revealed that the actors have a high understanding of their roles and responsibilities in the management of Ipo Watershed. However, gaps were observed on the clear delineation of roles and responsibilities and documented processes for iii
administration, planning, implementation and monitoring. Consequently, coordination among these actors resulted to None to Low ratings which means that it is “not existing” and” existing but not all-encompassing”. Although it is notable that efforts had been made to collaborate, such tend to be inconsistent and fell into a per-need-basis due to lack of clear and documented institutional arrangement. The nature of coordination among the actors in Ipo Watershed was defined by the legislations that created the agencies and/or defined their role in the management of the study area. The same goes for the level of coordination among the stakeholders. Needless to say, the quality of institutional arrangement therefore, influences how the actors coordinate with each other.","['Watersheds', 'River Basins', 'Catchment Areas', 'Institutional Arrangements', 'Governance', 'Coordination', 'Integrated Water Resources Management', 'Integrated River Basin Management']"
"Exploring Connectivity of Urban networks and their influence in determining Neighborhood Satisfaction, for the city of Rotterdam","Vinay, N. (Nidhi)",2016-09-01,"['D’Acci L. (Luca)', 'Salimgareeva M. (Marina)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The research aims to analyse the extent to which connectivity of urban networks influences Neighbourhood Satisfaction. To achieve this requires that the two concepts be understood independently. Neighbourhood satisfaction is seen to be an important subset of Quality of Urban life (QOUL), hence the research begins with a brief theoretical explanation of QOUL subsequently narrowing down to exploring neighbourhood satisfaction and the features that constitute it i.e. neighbourhood features. Analysing the scope of neighbourhood features provides a vivid description of their influence on other domains of life, and methods of measuring them.
It is further observed that each feature can be assessed through objective and subjective measures and, through theory identified that both forms of measure are significant in determining neighbourhood satisfaction.
The second section of the research explores connectivity of urban networks and its effects in shaping urban structure. In reference to theory by professor and urbanist Bill Hillier urban networks has been defined as the physical network of streets, roads and pedestrian walkways, and connectivity of these networks is seen to influence distribution and development of different parts of the city. The scope of this research is to analyse if connectivity of these networks contributes to the quality of neighbourhood development by comparing it with the people’s satisfaction with their neighbourhood. With the help of spatial analysis tools like Space Syntax this section identifies 2 relevant spatial measures that best represent street connectivity. Together with spatial measures and measures of neighbourhood features an ordinary least square analysis is implemented, with dependent variable Y being neighbourhood satisfaction and independent variables being neighbourhood features and two measures of connectivity. The result of this analysis is a reflection of different relationships between these two concepts.
The results indicated no significant relationship between connectivity of urban networks and neighbourhood satisfaction. It was surprisingly observed to have a negative effect on the level of neighbourhood satisfaction. However connectivity of urban networks were seen to influence neighbourhood features and satisfaction with neighbourhood features, albeit negatively. Nevertheless this indirect measure was considered to test for mediating effects, but the coefficient of influence indicated weak relationships. The research further observed profound effects from control measures ethnic composition and population density.","['Quality of Urban life', 'Neighbourhood satisfaction', 'Neighbourhood features', 'Connectivity of Urban Networks', 'Urban Morphology', 'Space Syntax', 'Street-integration', 'multiple linear regression']"
"BRT in Makassar (BRT Trans Mamminasata), Indonesia","Fahma, M.R. (Muhammad Rizqi)",2016-09-01,['Beenakker I.

A lot of cities have been implementing the system and some of those cities are notable as successful BRT systems. As one of the biggest cities in Indonesia, and with >1.7 million of inhabitants, Makassar and the adjacent cities (Mamminasata) have been suffering from transportation issues, including traffic jam. The central government has issuing a policy to urge every capital city in Indonesia to implement BRT in order to address transportation issues along with other issues attached to it. Thus, BRT Trans Mamminasata was launched several years ago by the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation, and it is operated by Perum Damri. Despite all the efforts done by the government and other parties, the BRT is still lacking of passengers. That is the main problem which indicates that it is likely that the performance of the BRT has not satisfying its users yet.
This research aims to explain the effect of current BRT Trans Mamminasata performance to user’s satisfaction, thus the research questions are figuring out to what extent the current BRT Trans Mamminasata performance (service, accessibility, availability, and time) affect the user’s satisfaction, and the sub questions are trying to figure out: first, the current performance of the BRT, second is figuring out how different SES perceive the current performance of the BRT, and lastly is figuring out which dependent variable is more significant compared to the others in term of satisfying the BRT users.
Methodology used in this research is relying on qualitative method, in which it is related to the fact that it has only a small unit of research, and that outcomes are not obviously measurable and quantifiable. Instruments used in this research are interview and online questionnaire, where the interview is conducted with 10 key informants, and the online questionnaire is using random sampling.

Impact of Land Use Regulation on Land Values,"Pramana, A.Y.E. (Yunastiawan Eka)",2016-09-01,['Samsura D.A.A. (Ary Adriansyah)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"In Indonesia, the implementation of National Law no. 28/2009 has given local government great challenge to provide public infrastructure and also a great opportunity to find a suitable alternative for generating revenue. Land value capture policy could become an alternative for local government to generate revenue to be used for providing public service. In the condition where rapid urbanization happens, increment value of land also becomes inevitable. This increment value of land, which in many cases occurs as a result of public investment on infrastructure development and land use regulation, could be captured back to be used for financing public infrastructure.
The problem is that it is sometimes difficult to separate which part of that increment is resulted from public action, and which one is resulted from the investment of either individual land owners or private developer. If the effect of public infrastructure development, especially transportation infrastructure, into land value is more or less clear, the effect of public action in term of land use regulation is still debatable. This research is then conducted to gives contribution into the debate about the impact of land use regulation into land value and to figure out the impact of land use regulation imposed within the context of Indonesian city into land value.
This research used Ngaglik district as case study area. It is located in Sleman, a regency in Yogyakarta Province who has enacted a new spatial plan, called RTRW Sleman 2011-2031 in 2012. This new spatial plan put a clear distinction between urban and rural area, which gives several advantages into area designated as urban in term of intensity of social-economic activity in the future, possibility of development, and availability of public infrastructure. This regulation has the possibility to affect land value, thus making this case as an interesting example to be investigated.
This research utilized primary data collection using Global Positioning System (GPS) tool and GIS Software analysis. This primary data collection method could deal with the problem of lack of official data about land transaction in the case study area. It also utilized secondary data resources from newspaper advertisement to figure out the fluctuation of land value in the case study area before and after the enactment of the new spatial plan. Finally, this research has demonstrated the usefulness of statistical modelling using Multi Linear Regression to isolate the impact of land use regulation from other factors that may determine land value in the case study area.
The result shows that despite there was a significant land value uplift in the designated urban area after the enactment of RTRW Sleman 2011-2031, this uplift could not be attributed into the enactment of the new spatial plan. There might be another factor that creates this significant land value uplift in the designated urban area, such as the existence of big development that occurs in the designated urban area after the new spatial plan has been enacted. The insignificant effect might also due to the lack of consistency and stringency on the enforcement of the new spatial plan. The statistical modelling shows that public action in term of transportation infrastructure development and change land status into development land are considered as giving more significant effect on land value rather than the enactment of RTRW Sleman 2011-2031.","['Land value capture', 'land use regulation', 'land value']"

The influence of residential license on household access to formal loans in Dar es Salaam City,"Nichodemas Mgalula, A. (Anna)",2016-09-01,['Skinner J.M. (Julia)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This research was done in Temeke Municipality in Dar es Salaam City. Its focus was on *Comprehensive Property Register for Economic Empowerment project which fell under the flagship of poverty reduction programme implemented by the Government of Tanzania starting year 2004. In this programme, the Government aimed at formally registering all properties in informal settlements in order to turn the properties from being “dead assets” to “active assets” because it was theorized that an asset that lacks formal registration and legal ownership has no potential to engage in active land and finance markets. In addition to this objective, the Government also aimed at increasing its tax base because once formalized, owners of these properties would be subject to paying tax to the Government. Towards implementation of this project, properties in informal settlements were formally registered and households were issued with residential licenses as a form of tenure security for their properties. The residential licenses were also expected to be used as collateral in commercial banks for accessing formal loans and credit for the purpose of expanding business enterprises hence improving livelihood of the residents and finding a way out of poverty.
The relationship that had been established between residential license and how it influences access to formal loans and credit is what formed the base for this research. This research therefore, was tailored to study and explain the influence that the issued residential licenses have had on household access to formal loans and what has been the experience of households in Temeke Municipality. In addition to that, through academic literature, other factors have been established to have influence on household access to formal loans. These factors include household vulnerability, need for formal loans and loan conditionality. Together with residential license possession, these factors have been studied as intervening variables to check the extent they influence access to formal loans.","['Residential license', 'De Soto', 'Loan', 'Vulnerability', 'Dar es Salaam']"
Implementing mixed use developments,"Okaisu, A.A. (Achom Ann)",2016-09-01,['Krabben E. van der (Erwin)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Understanding the existing property rights regime in Uganda, in which the development right was ‘nationalized’ for the purpose of implementing physical development plans and sustainable management of land in the country, was important to contribute to the topical issue under study that is; the influence of property rights regimes on spatial forms. Although the development right was nationalized in Uganda, in fact to prevent a so-called tragedy of the anti-commons, through the enactment of the Physical Planning Law in 2010, unsustainable urban development in Kampala continues. The aforementioned urban policy reform aimed to reverse the negative effects of fragmented, individualized property rights (introduced by law since 2008) on sustainable use of land and urban development. Policy and newspaper reports noted that Kampala continues to grow in a manner that doesn’t reflect the provisions of its mixed use master plan, as seen from the existence of single use developments that dominate the city’s centre space. Questions were being asked as to why the city authority was not able to utilize its explicit right to issue development permission to effect the master plan goals of mixed use developments; which formed the motivation for the study. Specifically the study aimed to; i) identifying the relevant criteria that would be used to assess the property rights institution in which the development right had been nationalized; ii) identifying the obligations and rights that are accrued to the proprietors managing and using the resource iii) finding out how these obligations and rights manifest themselves in practice and; iv) finding out how the process of granting and seeking the development rights has influenced the spatial structure of Kampala since 2010, after the enactment of the Physical Planning Act. A congruence case study was chosen as the appropriate research approach, with Kampala Capital City Authority selected as the unit of analysis. Secondary data sources and qualitative primary data collection formed the main data collection methods. For analysis of field data collected, ATLAS ti and a fuzzy set ideal type analysis tools were used. 4 cases of development proposals, submitted to the city authority for the purpose of acquiring the development right, were closely followed and studied to help build the case by unravelling the events, strategies, practices and choices made by the different appropriators involved in the development permission process. The aim was to gain an in-depth understanding and insight that would ultimately provide explanations to the phenomenon of spatial segregation, inspite of the city authority’s explicit right to issue development permission and a mixed use master plan and the; in the local context.
The results show that the necessary conditions required for the efficient allocation of the existing property rights in Kampala were absent which led to ambiguity in the allocation of rights and obligations amongst appropriators. This was manifested in the fact that appropriators were found to have misunderstood, misinterpreted or violated the rules of the game because of the ambiguity in the rights and obligations allocated to them. Consequently, conflict and inefficiencies were typical of the plan approval system, processes and procedures. The analysis of private property architectural designs and development proposals submitted and approved by the city authority, showed a greater number of approved plans were of single land use category and a lesser number were of mixed use development, moreover at low densities. In conclusion, the nationalization of development rights so far has not been successful in preventing single use developments. The results of my research show that, although the legal, formal framework provided for the institution of the necessary planning conditions to prevent unsustainable urban development were in place, the city of Kampala has not been sufficiently able yet to promote sustainable mixed-use urban developments.","['Property rights', 'development rights', 'spatial segregation', 'densities', 'tragedy of the anti-commons', 'urban commons', 'sustainable land use']"
Customers’ trust and the perception of public drinking water quality in Amman.,"Almomani, A. (Abeer)",2016-09-01,['Brilhante O. (Ogenis)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This research addresses the challenges that the Jordanian Water Authority and the public water utility in facing in regaining customers’ trust, and improving the perceived quality of public drinking water. In Amman, even though the drinking water quality fully complies with required standards, the public perceive the quality as poor and regard the water as unsafe. Sector officials relate this negative perception to the decline of customers’ trust in public water institutions after a contamination incident in one of Amman’s major water treatment plant twenty years ago.
Based on earlier studies on trust in customer relationships, customers trust in the service provider was unbundled to three elements. Those elements are a) process-based trust which relates to customers’ confidence service provider’s competency in service delivery, b) goodwill-based trust which relates to customers’ belief in services provider’s show of good faith and integrity in dealing with its customers and c) system-based trust which relates to the confidence in efficiency of regulatory system governing the service delivery in enforcing service standards. In this research the extent of each element’s influence on perceive quality was investigated and explained. Understanding the extent of each elements influence can provide a helpful insight to the policy makers to develop strategies in targeting the most influential element thus effectively improve those perceptions. Therefore, the research questions are: What is the level of customers’ trust in Miyahuna measured across the three elements? What is the current perceived quality of tap water in Amman? And, to what extent does each element of trust influence the perceived quality?
This research is quantitative, it employed survey as a research strategy and questionnaires as the main data collection instrument. The survey covered 216 households within Miyahuna service area which serves 617,000 households in Amman.
The level of process-based, goodwill-based and system based trust were measured and the results showed that customers had generally a fair level of trust across the three elements. The perceived quality of water which was assessed based on colour, odour, taste, biological, chemical and radiological safety. The results showed that water colour, odour and taste were perceived as being good. The views about water safety however, were different. The results confirmed the concerns about water biological and chemical safety and the presence of radioactive matter in their water.
Data analysis showed that all three elements of trust had significant influence on the perceived quality. However, the magnitude of the influence varied between the elements. System-based trust is the element of trust that had the biggest influence on perceived quality. Process-based trust had the second biggest influence and good-will based trust had the least influence on perceived quality. Which indicates that people regard having an efficient regulatory system that is monitoring Miyahuna’s performance and ensuring the quality of water thus minimizing health risks is more important than just relying on competency and goodwill of Miyahuna to deliver good quality water. Based on the findings of this research, the authorities have to focus on improving the public trust in the regulatory system governing water quality monitoring since it is the most influential element of trust as demonstrated by the results of this research.","['Perceived quality', 'trust', 'water quality', 'perceived risk', 'customer', 'service provider']"
Policy Effectiveness on Foreign Direct Investment in Chinese Real Estate Sector between 2000 and 2014,"Min, L.

In China, FDIRE policy intervention closely follows the cycles of the real estate market in most countries. However, researchers stand on two opposite sides on policy effectiveness on foreign investment. This research is focused on whether FDIRE policies released by Chinese government really affected FDIRE inflow from 2000 to 2014. Firstly, according to review of FDIRE policy files, there were 17 restriction policies and 1 stimulation policy released in China between 2000 and 2014. Secondly, through P2 distance policy index, implementation degree of each policy is computed. Thirdly, policy index and control variables in panel data regressions of 25 provincial data show that FDIRE policies really influenced FDIRE inflow, and high policy implementation degree has negative effect on oversea capital inflow, because most policies are restriction rules. Thirdly, according to the regressions adding spatial dummy variables representing eastern, central and western China, eastern regions attracted more FDIRE than central and western provinces. However, policy effectiveness did not show significant difference among these three regions. Data limitation may be one reasons for this insignificant spatial result, therefore, more researches should be done to explore into this field in the future.","['Foreign Direct Investment', 'Real Estate Market', 'Policy Index', 'Policy Effectiveness', 'Spatial Difference']"
The effects of psp regulation on solid waste collection methods and quality of service delivery.,"Tereshkova Armah, V. (Valentina)",2016-09-01,['Skinner J.'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This study focused on Private Sector Participation in Solid Waste Collection in Nima East.
The main objective of the study was to explain the effect of PSP regulation on solid waste
collection methods and quality of service delivery in Nima East. The study made emphasis
specifically on Solid Waste Collection Methods, Quality of Service Delivery and Private
Sector Participation Regulation.
To achieve the objective indicated earlier above, the study adopted the use of both qualitative
and quantitative methods and a single case study approach. Secondary and primary sources of
data were used in addition to observation. Municipal assembly officials and private sector
waste collection officials views were solicited in in-depth-interview technique. The use of
survey was employed for user perspective and inputs. The study found that solid waste
collection by private companies in Nima had generally been successful, thus an improvement
in quality of service delivery, though a lot more is required in terms of consistency of solid
waste collection, implementation of user feedback mechanisms and creation of awareness
campaign as stipulated in contracts agreements.
It was established that, effective and efficient implementation of PSP regulation solid waste
collection by private sector in Nima depends on a number of factors including existing
relevant policies, its implementation, monitoring and enforcement as well as adequate
municipal capacity. The study found challenges such as non-enforcement of bylaws,
inadequate supervision and lack of monitoring of service delivery by the Assembly due to
lack of human and financial capacity. It was also established that outsourcing of Solid Waste
Collection contracts was not entirely transparent.
Study findings revealed that the attainment of quality of service delivery in Solid Waste
Collection by private sector and efficiency in collection methods depends on the existence of
private sector participation regulation, implementation/enforcement of regulations and
contract terms as well as adequate municipal capacity.
The study recommends the need for strict enforcement of byelaws, increased transparency in
outsourcing, improved resources and manpower training for assembly staff, as well as clear
administrative structures devoid of political influence.","['Private Sector Participation', 'Regulation', 'Solid Waste Collection', 'Nima East', 'Good Governance']"
Insufficient Potable Water Reticulations to Urban Households,"Osasumwen Ainiuwu, D. (Donna)",2016-09-01,['Scholten H.T. (Peter)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This study is about the prevailing situation of the municipal water supply in Abuja, the federal capital city (FCC) of Nigeria in West-Africa. The nation’s water sector has had a number of policy formulations to improve service delivery of water to all the citizens on a sustainable basis. However, none of these efforts has brought about the needed panacea for sustainable water delivery.
The installation of the major water infrastructures and reticulation services was a 3-phased development that took place in the city from 1979 to 1980, beyond that period further expansion have been very skeletal such that only about 40% or less is the spatial spread of reticulations for the teeming population in the city. Water being very vital to all living forms and particularly to man as a means of sustenance requires better management strategies by the public sector to ensure that there is sufficient and sustainable supply to all households in the city of Abuja.
Consequently, the objective of this research is to explain how the management of Federal Capital Territory Water Board (FCT WB), the government agency in charge of potable water supply, influences the development of the reticulations to urban households in Abuja. The objective gave rise to the research questions that are directed at the strategies used by the management of the FCT WB to influence the causality at the beneficiaries end, which are the households in the city. The need to provide valid answers for this study led to the adoption of the ‘multi-level governance framework’ by Frantzeskaki and Tilie (2014).
The research strategy found suitable for such an explanatory voyage is the case study because of the empirical inference of the case in view. The case study supports experiential observations as evidence for checking the applicability of concepts in substantiating the reason for the empirical context (Blatter and Blume, 2008). The instrument used was semi-structured interview guides because some information is known of the situation but in-depth knowledge was required to provide the answers to the research questions.
A total of 20 in-depth interviews were conducted as follows: - 15 professionals from 3 actor groups namely FCT WB, Federal Capital Development Authority Engineering Services Department (FCDA ESD) and Federal Housing Authority (FHA) as well as on 5 residents in Kado estate of Gwarinpa district, a catchment area that is one of the oldest residential estates in the city and benefits sufficiently from the public water supply. Gwarinpa district was benchmarked against Lugbe district, the latter conspicuously lacks water reticulation yet it is one of the residential estates developed by the FHA (a co-actor in the water reticulation process). There was an overview of information, though not in-depth, from a 21st respondent in the FCDA ESD. The in-depth interviews were analysed by ATLAS.ti software being a qualitative research methodology and suitable for this study.
The main findings from the data analysis revealed that FCT WB is practically not in charge of the infrastructural development for water reticulations but the responsible agency is the FCDA ESD. The main policy goal of the FCT WB is to operate and manage the infrastructure and water reticulations after FCDA ESD has completed the installations of the primary and secondary reticulations. The only aspect of installations conceded to the FCT WB is tertiary reticulation of individual houses to the secondary lines that have been installed by the FCDA ESD. The situation begs for better coordination in Abuja water management.","['FCT Water Board', 'water management', 'potable water reticulations', 'multi-level governance', 'Abuja city residents']"

Governance neemt een steeds centralere plek in de werkwijzen van de gemeenten bij de realisatie van publieke waarde en het oplossen van complexe maatschappelijke problemen. Het is een echter politieke keuze om maatschappelijke doelen met of via interorganisatorische samenwerkingsverbanden te realiseren. Daarbij zullen gemeenten hun doelen en ambities zo moeten formuleren, dat maatschappelijke partners voldoende ruimte hebben voor eigen doelen en belangen. Want de kern van governance is dat beleidsvorming en –uitvoering gezamenlijk plaatsvindt. De gemeente heeft dan als taak het samenwerkingsproces te faciliteren en moet de regierol loslaten. De gemeentelijke politiek moet zich beperken tot sturing op hoofdlijnen, prioriteiten en kaders aangeven waarbinnen samengewerkt moet worden en controleren op democratische waarden en representativiteit van de (verschillende) maatschappelijke belangen. De ambtelijke organisatie moet de samenwerking organiseren. Een dergelijke nieuwe werkwijze heeft wel gevolgen voor de gemeentelijke besluitvormingsprocedures.

Weliswaar heeft de Kamer een redelijk goed beeld hoe publiek wordt besteed, maar het heeft geen inzicht of dit wel zinnig en zuinig gebeurt.

Balanceren tussen exploiteren en exploreren,"Braber, P.C. den",2016-08-31,"['prof.dr.ing. G.R. Teisman', 'prof.dr. M.W. van Buuren']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In deze thesis treft u een onderzoek naar de invloed van de exploitatie- en exploratiebalans in de werkwijze van Rijkswaterstaat op de intensiteit en effectiviteit van de wederzijdse samenwerking met externe actoren. Om dit te onderzoeken is een theoretisch kader opgesteld waarin de begrippen exploitatie en exploratie gedefinieerd zijn aan de hand van zes kenmerken. Voor exploitatie zijn dat achtereenvolgens: single-loop learning, uniformiteit/eenduidigheid (selectie), geleidelijk en beheerst ontwikkelen van competenties en taken, stabiliteit, risicoaversie en ontkenning en reductie van complexiteit. Voor exploratie zijn deze: double-loop learning, creativiteit, ontwikkeling van nieuwe competenties, flexibiliteit, chaos / onzekerheid en erkenning en vergroting van complexiteit.Op basis van deze kenmerken zijn balanstypen opgesteld die van toepassing kunnen zijn op een organisatie, afdeling, projectteam of persoon. De balanstypen zijn achtereenvolgens: low performance type, limited performance type, limited performance type + interne of externe exploratie,  vluchtige type,  vluchtige type + interne of externe exploitatie, ambidexter type. Aan de hand van de balanstypen zijn de vraagstukken vooroeverbestortingen Oosterschelde en zandsuppletie Roggenplaat geanalyseerd. Hierbij is de opstelling van de lijnorganisatie omtrent deze vraagstukken meegenomen. Uit de analyse komt naar voren dat voor verschillende vraagstukken, verschillende balanstypen van toepassing zijn. Zo is de werkwijze van het projectteam rondom het vraagstuk vooroeverbestortingen te typeren als limited performance + externe exploratie. Voor het vraagstuk zandsuppletie Roggenplaat is dit het ambidextere balanstype en de opstelling van de lijnorganisatie is het beste te typeren als limited performance.Vervolgens is geanalyseerd welke invloed balanstypen hebben op de intensiteit en effectiviteit van de samenwerking van Rijkswaterstaat met de visserijsector en het Ministerie van Economische Zaken. Hieruit bleek dat de projectteams qua balans (iets) exploratiever zijn dan de lijnorganisatie. Eveneens bleek de samenwerking intensiever en effectiever te worden naar mate er meer exploratie is. Zo was de casus vooroeverbestortingen eerst exploitatiegericht, maar werd deze in de loop van de tijd meer explorerend. Deze toename van exploratie leidde tot intensievere en effectievere samenwerking. Ook in het vraagstuk zandsuppletie Roggenplaat is het positieve effect van exploratie waar te nemen. In dit project, dat in vergelijking met het vraagstuk vooroeverbestortingen exploratiever is, is eveneens sprake van intensiever en effectiever contact. Bevinding: toename van procesmatige exploratie leidt tot intensievere en effectievere samenwerking. Uit de analyse komt ook een ander beeld naar voren. Het blijkt dat de lijnorganisatie, die getypeerd is als limited performance (exploitatie gericht), een intensievere en effectievere samenwerkingsrelatie onderhoudt met de visserijsector en het ministerie van Economische Zaken dan de projectteams, die in principe exploratiever zijn. Verklaring die de respondenten hiervoor geven is dat lijnorganisaties vanuit hun beheerdersrol op langetermijnrelaties uit zijn, in tegenstelling tot projectteams met een tijdelijk bestaan. De relatie tussen projectteams en externe actoren is over het algemeen een kortetermijnrelatie, gericht op vernieuwing. Projectteams realiseren iets wat er nog niet was. Hierdoor staat deze relatie van nature meer onder spanning. De vergelijking tussen projectteams en de lijnorganisatie is daardoor qua balanstype en de invloed van de balans op samenwerking moeilijk te maken. Hier spelen schijnbaar andere factoren. Wel blijkt het niet noodzakelijk een exploratieve werkwijze toe te passen, indien men wil komen tot intensieve en effectieve samenwerking, zo getuigt de werkwijze van de lijnorganisatie.  Uit het onderzoek komt verder naar voren dat inlevingsvermogen, vertrouwen en persoonlijke factoren een grote rol spelen. Respondenten stellen unaniem dat inlevingsvermogen in de ander cruciaal is. Als dit ontbreekt verloopt de samenwerking niet goed. Het vertrouwen ontbreekt dan of is onvoldoende aanwezig. Een grote mate van exploratie leidt kortom niet automatisch tot intensievere en effectievere samenwerking, als het ontbreekt aan inlevingsvermogen en vertrouwen in elkaar.","['Exploitatie', 'Exploratie', 'Balans', 'Wederzijdse samenwerking', 'Governance', 'Omgevingsmanagement', 'Sociale- en organisatorische innovatie']"

How did the CIA perform compared to its main rival, the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV)? Among others, primary sources from the CIA were used as research objects.

Although the CIA did make mistakes, they still delivered valuable information. There were three main problems with intelligence during the Vietnam War. Firstly, there was the (deliberate) misuse of information by policymakers and military. Secondly, Cold War doctrines such as the Truman doctrine and the domino theory dictated future US policy. Thirdly, a culture of no dissent existed within the White House. Often it were not intelligence agencies that were wrong, it were the questions asked or the specific rapports chosen that gave a distorted view of reality inside Vietnam.

This research paper also gives suggestions for policymakers and researchers to be able to measure the performance of intelligence reports.","['CIA', 'MACV', 'intelligence', 'Tonkin Incident', 'Tet-Offensive', 'Vietnam War', 'Presidents Daily Briefs', 'Cold War']"
A trade model to promote Dutch welfare during a period of decline,G. Schutte,2016-08-31,"['R.C.F. von Friedeburg', 'K.H. Stapelbroek']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Between 1771 and 1796, Dirk Hoola van Nooten (1747-1808) published translations of works written by Bonnet, Condillac, Montesquieu and Smith, while he also wrote several books on Dutch and natural law. In my thesis I argue that Van Nooten’s ideas should be seen in the context of an ongoing debate about Dutch foreign trade policy. As described by Koen Stapelbroek, a number of thinkers debated in the 1740’s and 1750’s about the question whether there still was a relation between ‘the flourishing of the linen industry in Haarlem and Leiden and the Dutch staplemarket’ and about the question whether this dynamic still prevailed in the modern ‘jealousy of trade’. Van Nooten’s translation of Condillac’s Le Commerce et le Gouvernment and his translation of Montesquieu’s De l’Esprit des lois conceptualised the problems of Dutch trade and manufacturing. Van Nooten explained the structure of the Dutch mercantile system and elaborated on its weaknesses, which were exploited by countries like France and England. Van Nooten thought that Dutch industry was essential for the Dutch mercantile system. Manufacturing offered an opportunity to transform raw materials into more valuable products, which could be exported to other countries. The government had to support this practice by enabling manufacturers to import raw materials as cheap as possible. Trade and manufacturing were both essential elements of the Dutch mercantile system. This strategy was threatened by England, which limited Dutch imports by its Navigation Acts. 
	Van Nooten’s translation of The Wealth of Nations of 1796 should be seen in the context of his other proposals to reform the Dutch mercantile system. His earlier proposals highlighted the role of the government in promoting commerce, but his introduction in De Rijkdom der Volkeren was very critical about commercial policy of the state. He adopted Smith’s vision of the mutual benefits of international commerce, which implied that the Dutch Republic was not involved in a commercial war with France and England. Instead, the Republic could profit from the commercial success of its neighbours. This development should not be seen as an adoption of the idea of ‘free trade’, but as the adoption of an alternative ‘trade model’. 
 	Smith’s model had an important advantage. It did not require sophisticated commercial policy. The political decline of the Dutch had forced Van Nooten to reconsider his earlier opinions about commerce. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War and the war with France during the 1790’s had made it clear to him that the Dutch were not able to compete with their neighbours. This failure would also imply that the Dutch government would no longer be able to support domestic commerce. Smith’s model offered a remedy to this problem, since his model did not require such support. It rejected such support as harmful. The state should only protect property, build infrastructure, and prevent the emergence of monopolies. The state only had to enforce the rules in order to facilitate economic competition.","['Montesquieu', 'Adam Smith', 'Dirk Hoola van Nooten', 'trade model', 'economic history', 'ideas', 'eighteenth century', 'manufacturing', 'Wealth of Nations', 'jealousy of trade', 'commerce', 'Dutch Republic', 'decline']"

werkelijkheid baseren ze op het empirisme (onze kennisbron is de waarneming). De
semantici vormen de tweede groep, zij verdedigen het standpunt dat een theorie uit een
collectie modellen bestaat, waarbij een model opgevat worden als een wiskundige structuur.
Het uitgangspunt van kennis bij deze visie is naast het empirisme ook het realisme (de termen
in de beweerzinnen verwijzen naar entiteiten). De derde categorie die een metatheorie

 and mobile apps, covering all sorts of 
subjects, including history. This research aims to make a start
 in illuminating how such apps represent 
history, by showing how the Second World War (WWII) is represen
ted through popular and museum-
related mobile applications, and why this is done in this parti
cular way. It examines these questions by 
investigating two groups of apps: five of the most popular WWII
-related apps and three WWII-apps 
related to Dutch museums and institutes. Combined these eight c
ases cover a range of apps on one of 
the most popular historical subjects. Main focus points in anal
yzing these representations were the 
narrated stories, including the 
perspectives and different aspe
cts on WWII that were given through the 
apps. These were related to the concept of remediation in order
 to show the motivations and rules 
dictating these representations.    
     It was found that the five popular apps present themselves as
 being authentic and highly 
immersive. Games turned out to 
be most popular applications in 
the app stores. In these games third-
person shooters present WWII through Allied eyes, in which it a
ppears one man (or ship) has the power 
to decide the outcome of the War. In this category of mobile ga
mes the outcome of history is fixed: 
events unfold in a linear sequen
ce through the actions of users
. Although strategy and simulation apps 
diverge from this pattern, all five apps are mainly focussed on
 the military aspects of the war. Military 
tools can be bought and upgraded, in these highly commercialize
d games. Apps related to museum 
turned out to be aimed immersive experiences as well, but contr
ary to popular apps they do so by 
providing information at historical sites. Stories are told mai
nly from an Allied perspective, and through 
personal accounts. Multimedia and location-technologies are use
d to enhance visitor experiences. 
     Overall these representations o
f WWII can be related to the t
heory of remediation. Visitors and 
users long for an immersive experience of this historical episo
de. Apps contribute to this demand by 
offering a mixture of authentic multimedia, engaging elements a
nd the possibility to engage in stories 
at the exact place where the events took place. The narratives 
and images they present to their users 
build  upon  existing  (popular)  historical  material,  ensuring  fam
iliarity  (and  thus  popularity  and 
engagement) among their users. The story of WWII through apps l
argely remains the same as that one 
found in comparable media, apps rather form an extension to the
 existing network of representations. 
Their power lies in their possibility to deliver a story that c

In 1971 kwam het bedrijf tot stand en het werd in 1983 failliet verklaard. In 1974 werd er door de Centrale Ondernemingsraad van RSV vastgesteld dat de scheepsbouwmarkt voor lange tijd onrendabel zou blijven. Een inkrimping van het bedrijf werd als een noodzakelijke maatregel gezien. Niettemin werd de inkrimping van het bedrijf vertraagd. De vertraging van de inkrimping had meerdere oorzaken. De vraag waarom dit gebeurde staat centraal in de thesis.
Vier factoren worden in het werk geanalyseerd: De historische context van de jaren zeventig, het bedrijf Rijn-Schelde-Verolme, vergelijkbare industriële sectoren (mijnbouw, textielindustrie, synthetische vezelindustrie) en de rol van de vakbonden.
In de jaren zeventig kwam de Nederlandse industrie in de problemen door onder andere de toenemende buitenlandse concurrentie en de oliecrisis van 1973. RSV had vooral last van de Japanse concurrentie. Japan kon voor lagere prijzen schepen op de markt brengen. RSV besloot niet in te krimpen, maar te bouwen op eigen rekening. Het bedrijf begon zelfs verliesgevende orders aan te nemen. RSV werd hierin bijgestaan door de overheid. De Nederlandse overheid beschikte over genoeg financiële middelen door de aardgasbaten. Het leveren van subsidies was hierdoor geen probleem. Na het faillissement bleek dat de overheid in totaal een bedrag van 2,7 miljard gulden in het bedrijf had gestoken. Ten slotte was er nog de rol van de vakbonden. De bonden pleitten voor een vertraging van de inkrimpingsmaatregelen die in de industriële sector plaatsvonden.
De inkrimping van RSV werd afgeremd door een combinatie van het vertragingsbeleid en de massale stakingsacties van de vakbonden, de ongegeneerde financiële steun van de overheid en het trotste karakter van de Nederlandse scheepsbouw.","['Rijn-Schelde-Verolme', 'RSV', 'jaren zeventig', 'scheepsbouw', 'industrie', 'neergang industriële sector', 'Dutch Disease', 'Den Uyl', 'Nederlandse scheepsbouw', 'Japanse scheepsbouw', 'mijnbouw', 'textielindustrie']"

Zij vieren niet 1 juli als dag van de vrijheid. Zij vieren in augustus dat de slaven hun eigen leven wilden leiden. Zij vieren 17 augustus. Dit is de dag dat Tula in 1795 de grote slavenopstand begon. De dag dat slaven zelf besloten vrij te zijn. Dat is een reden om te vieren.” Het zijn de woorden van de voormalige Curaçaose minister van Cultuur, Rubia Bitorina, op 1 juli 2013. In haar speech vergeleek zij de 1 juli viering van Suriname met die van Curaçao, waar op 1 juli helemaal niets gevierd wordt. Normaliter wordt de afschaffing van de slavernij niet eens herdacht op Curaçao , alleen in 2013, 150 jaar na de afschaffing, is hierop een uitzondering gemaakt. Het citaat geeft aan hoe belangrijk de slavenopstand van 1795 nog steeds is voor Curaçao. Voor Curaçaoënaars is 17 augustus 1795 het begin van het einde van de slaventijd. De weg naar de officiële afschaffing zou nog vele jaren duren. Pas op 1 juli 1863 was het zover en werd de slavernij daadwerkelijk afgeschaft. Over de rol van slaafgemaakten in het abolitieproces op Curaçao is niet veel bekend. Wat is er precies veranderd op Curaçao in periode 1795 – 1863, wat heeft ervoor gezorgd dat de Curaçaoënaars zoveel waarde hechten aan 1795 en hadden de slaafgemaakten invloed op het afschaffingsproces? Hierover gaat dit onderzoek.
	Van een afstand lijkt het inderdaad dat na 1795 alle interventies gericht zijn op afschaffing van de slavernij: de toevoer van slaafgemaakten uit Afrika werd verboden (1814) en de koloniale wetgeving waarin de slaafgemaakten in toenemende mate in bescherming worden genomen werd meer en meer aangescherpt.  De slavenhandel met Afrika was echter afgeschaft onder druk van Groot-Brittannië en de uiteindelijke afschaffing van de slavernij kwam ook tot stand door aandringen van Frankrijk en Groot-Brittannië. De invloed van de grote slavenopstand deze grote gebeurtenissen is nog onbekend, toch is de opstand van 1795 voor Afro-Curaçaoënaars belangrijker dan de Emancipatie-datum. De vraag is of die opstand wellicht zodanige ommekeer teweeg bracht dat de uiteindelijke afschaffing van de slavernij onvermijdelijk werd en daarmee geen echte cesuur meer was in het leven van de slaafgemaakten.","['Slavernij', 'Curaçao', 'emancipatie', 'slaafgemaakten', '1795', 'Grote Slavenopstand', '1863', 'Caribbean']"
Imagining the Enemy: A Constructivist Deconstruction of Daniel Yergin's Riga Axioms,M.S.U. Choudhury,2016-08-25,"['B. Wubs', 'F.M.M. de Goey']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis is a constructivist analysis of James F. Byrnes and George F. Kennan, who were both key foreign policy figures in President Harry S. Truman’s administration. Specifically, this thesis critically analyses and deconstructs Daniel Yergin’s 1977 book Shattered Peace: the Origins of the Cold War and the National Security State. Yergin argues that the origins of the Cold War can be traced to the actions of a group of policy officials of the United States Department of State, who subscribed to a common view of the Soviet Union. In his book Yergin categorises the view of these State Department officials as the Riga axioms due to their views being formed in Riga, Latvia. This thesis argues that Yergin’s theory is too simplistic when explaining the motivations of these officials. It uses Byrnes and Kennan as two case studies and examines them using the theory of constructivism, which looks at non material factors, to understand their motivations. This work also uses the theory of epistemic communities to better define whether a group of adherents to the Riga axioms even existed. This thesis concludes that in reality these foreign policy officials were motivated by their personal perceptions of the world, individual motivations, and interpersonal relations; and that aligned interests do not necessarily mean aligned beliefs.","['Cold War', 'Byrnes', 'Kennan', 'Riga axioms', 'American Soviet Policy']"
‘Death to America!’ or enemy in disguise?,S.A. Niehof,2016-08-23,"['D. Douwe', 'F.M.M. de Goey']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the recent decades the Western World had more interaction with Middle Eastern countries than before. With the continuous level of globalization, we have established more trade, exchange of thoughts and political co-operation between the Western and the Middle East. However, globalization has not only brought prosperity for both worlds. Especially in the last decade we have witnessed several terrorist attacks of Islamic extremists in the Islamic world, but also within the West, in which the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 can be seen as the most large-scale attack and also the starting point in the ‘war on terrorism’. After this terroristic attack the United States have started several interventions in the Middle East, which led to the Iraq War (2003-present) and the Afghanistan War (2001-2014). From this moment the Western world was aware that the terrorist attacks, committed by Al-Qaeda in 2001, were supported by a far much larger group of Muslims (and not only radical Muslims) than  assumed. Quite a number of people in countries like Lebanon, Iran, Egypt and Iraq argued that the attacks in America were legitimate and that Al-Qaeda was doing ‘the proper thing’. Anti-Americanism was more deeply-rooted in the Middle Eastern societies than scholars or politicians were aware of.
	In 1993 political scientist Samuel P. Huntington published an article ‘The Clash of Civilizations?’ in response to political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s book The End of History and the Last Man in which Fukuyama argued that with the end of the Cold War, ideological evolution also ended. The universalization of Western democracy would eventually be the final form of human government. Huntington was not so much opposed to this idea, but he believed that the world would eventually be dominated by cultural clashes. He categorized seven distinct cultures: the Western, Orthodox, Latin-American, Islamic, East-Asian, Japanese and Buddhist culture. In 1996 Huntington expanded his thesis in The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World order. Huntington’s thesis was generally not well received. Many scholars found his work controversial and did not see the relevance or relevance of his thesis. Although Huntington considered a clash between the Western world and China more likely, after 9/11 followers of Huntington’s thesis warned that the clash between the Islamic world and the Western world would eventually be inevitable. After the 9/11 attacks the importance of Huntington’s work was attracted renewed attention. But, also today there is still much debate whether it concerns an actual clash of civilization or a conflict between states or a conflict of power. Although Huntington discusses seven civilizations in his thesis, I focus on the Islamic/Middle Eastern and Western civilizations, more particularly the United States, Iran and Saudi Arabia. It is important to realize that Iran and Saudi Arabia are not ‘mainstream’ countries in the Middle East. Their highly religious state systems are not representative for other Middle Eastern states. Both have a very special relationship with the US and are very influential nations in the Muslim world at large, in particular Saudi Arabia that finances a wide range of Islamist organization all over the Muslim world. Which actors and motives were important in the anti-American discourse in Iran and Saudi Arabia between 2001-2011 and to what extent do the anti-American manifestations reflect Huntington’s  theory of the ‘Clash of civilizations’?","['anti-Americanism', 'Iran', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Middle East', 'United States', 'Clash of civilization', 'Samuel P.

Bretton-Woods Conference: the Soviets Perspective,N. Klyausova,2016-08-19,"['B. Wubs', 'F.M.M. de Goey']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This paper examines the reasons of the Soviet Union’s decision not to ratify the Bretton-Woods agreement. The Bretton-Woods Conference was a symbol of the Twentieth Century, which left a mark in the international financial history. The Conference gathered more than 730 delegates from 44 countries that wanted to avoid the financial catastrophe in the postwar period. The Soviet Union participated in the pre-conference meetings and was actively engaged in defending its national interests at the Bretton-Woods Conference. However, the Soviet Union refused to enter the newly founded IMF and IBRD, and reasons behind the refusal are merely mentioned in various sources. The most common information that could be found is that the Soviet Union never officially explained its decision. The result of the work shows that the Soviet officials studied and favored the Bretton-Woods agreements, explaining that the Soviet Union could derive a profit from it. Moreover, the Soviet economic technicians prepared a set of the recommendations which the Soviet government needed to apply before entering the Bretton-Woods institutions. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union never ratified the Bretton-Woods outcome. Although, there are no official reports or papers which might shed the light on the final decision of Stalin, who refused to become a part of the new financial order, this work still contributes to the common knowledge of Bretton-Woods and the role of the Soviet Union in the Bretton-Woods system and the postwar world.","['The Bretton-Woods Conference', 'financial order', 'gold standard', 'Harry Dexter White', 'John Maynard Keynes', 'the Soviet Union', 'refusal', 'the Cold War']"

“Hitler was a Silly”,N. Spelt,2016-08-14,"['C.R. Ribbens', 'R.J. Adriaansen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In contrast to their singleplayer counterparts, World War Two-themed multiplayer first person shooter (FPS) games often lack an explicit narrative and refrain from actively addressing a player's views and ideas about history. These games do not build on the interaction between the game and the player, but on the interaction between players themselves, which is facilitated by the game acting as a social platform. Through these games, players face a social environment in which a potentially huge amount of historical knowledge, insight and opinions about the war can be shared between players. Additionally, the majority, if not all popular multi-player first person shooters provide ways of communication between players, both voice- or text-based. These pre-programmed communication channels, however, are not the only ways through which players of a game can communicate with each other. Most commercial games have at least one easy-to-find website with an official forum, through which a virtually endless amount of questions can be answered, requests fulfilled, and information can be published. 
Thus far, the growing field of historical game studies has not focused on researching the ways in which history is used and addressed within the gamer communities that exist through these channels, leaving much of their influence on their members’ grasp of WWII-history and historical practice in obscurity.  What and how do gamers learn about the Second World War in WWII multiplayer FPS gaming communities? Through a thorough content analysis of historical (and not so historical) discussions in one of these communities and the ways in which these are influenced by both the community itself and the characteristics of the social platforms it utilizes, this thesis attempts to answer this question. The Heroes & Generals (Reto-Moto, 2014) community provides a case study, which is analysed using the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework (Garrison et al., 1999) and Peter Seixas’ ‘benchmarks of historical thinking’ (Seixas, 2006). The results show that these gamer communities can be very capable of sustaining sophisticated historical discussions, in which many indicators of historical thinking are apparent. The main reason for this is that community forums and dedicated historical forums in particular provide an effective learning experience, but only when the criteria dictated by the CoI framework are met.","['Multiplayer', 'Fps', 'Gamer communities', 'Gaming', 'WWII', 'Community of Inquiry', 'Historical thinking', 'Peter Seixas', 'Inquisitive mode', 'Utilitarian mode']"

Deze vraag staat centraal bij deze bespreking van Foucault’s Discipline, toezicht en straf, waarin hij een beschrijving geeft van de geschiedenis van straffen en de totstandkoming van de gevangenis als ultieme straf, waarbij Foucault komt tot een omschrijving van de disciplinaire samenleving. Dit boek wordt in verband gebracht met twee romans: The Circle van Dave Eggers, dat een futuristisch beeld schetst van wat media kunnen beteken voor transparantie, en 1984 van George Orwell, een dystopische toekomstvisie uit de jaren ‘50. Er wordt gekeken of de psychologie een antwoord biedt op de vraag naar het effect van toezicht op de mens, waaruit blijkt dat mensen zich ‘socialer’ gedragen indien zij (het idee hebben te) worden geobserveerd.  Geconcludeerd kan worden dat toezicht een machtsmechanisme is dat positief kan werken, maar op individueel niveau beter niet continu moet  zijn.",
Ben ik dat?! Moslims en de islam: Beeldvorming in de media,B.M. Planken,2016-08-11,"['B.C.M. Kester', 'J. Jansz']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Diverse onderzoeken naar de manier waarop moslims en de islam in Westerse (nieuws)media verschijnen, tonen aan dat deze religie en haar volgelingen op een negatieve, eenzijdige en stigmatiserende manier worden gepresenteerd. Ook is bekend dat Turkse en Nederlandse moslimjongeren de Nederlandse en Westerse media niet vertrouwen. Omdat een lange periode van negatieve berichtgeving kan leiden tot meer verdeeldheid in de samenleving en een gevoel van uitsluiting, is (kwalitatief) onderzoek naar de perceptie van Nederlandse moslims over de beeldvorming over moslims en de islam in Nederlandse media erg belangrijk. In dit onderzoek staat de volgende probleemstelling centraal: Hoe ervaren Nederlandse moslims de beeldvorming over moslims en de islam in Nederlandse media en hoe zou dit beeld volgens hen moeten zijn? Door middel van tien semi-gestructureerde interviews is deze probleemstelling onderzocht en vervolgens geanalyseerd door middel van codering. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat Nederlandse moslims de beeldvorming over moslims en de islam als zeer negatief ervaren, het gevoel hebben dat zij als ‘de Ander’ worden weggezet en het slachtoffer zijn van de media. Op basis van hun meningen en ervaringen lijkt het alsof media zich schuldig maken aan institutioneel racisme. De participanten willen graag dat de beeldvorming drastisch verandert en denken dat dit de saamhorigheid in Nederland ten goede zou komen. De Nederlandse moslims zouden graag een positiever en realistischer beeld over moslims en de islam in de media zien en willen dat mediaorganisaties hen gelijkwaardig behandelen. Ook is er behoefte aan rolmodellen die de islam op een positieve manier vertegenwoordigen en tegengeluid laten horen. Daarnaast vinden zij dat media satire over de islam niet zouden moeten verspreiden en moeten stoppen met de islam te associëren met terreur. Zij begrijpen dat terroristische organisaties als IS worden geassocieerd met hun religie, maar herkennen de islam niet in de interpretaties van IS-strijders en vinden dat media beter moeten uitleggen dat de religie zelf niets te maken heeft met geweld of terreur. Tot slot vinden de Nederlandse moslims dat iedereen met een Nederlands paspoort in de media ‘Nederlander’ genoemd zou moeten worden en dat de religie van daders niet relevant is in berichtgeving. Enkele participanten interpreteren de berichtgeving zoals mediaorganisaties deze bedoeld hebben – de preferred meaning – en zien geen groot probleem in de huidige beeldvorming, hoewel geen enkele participant beweert dat de beeldvorming niet negatief is.","['Othering', 'media', 'moslims', 'islam', 'minderheden', 'communicatie', 'interpretatie', 'preferred meaning', 'institutioneel racisme']"
Women’s struggle for recognition,Sophie Chetrit,2016-08-11,"['dr. G.H. van Oenen', 'dr. C. Binder']",Erasmus School of Philosophy,"This thesis explores how Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition can be translated in terms of gender, to explain why women are less engaged than men in the public sphere. As we all know, there is a gap between men and women’s participation in the public sphere, a gap that is first due to the past exclusion of women from the public space and to their relegation in the private domain. Honneth defines recognition as the necessary condition of self-realization. According to him, recognition allows one to acquire the necessary self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem to participate in public life. Therefore, if we use this theory, women’s low engagement is owed to the gendered denials of recognition – such as rape, sexual harassment or discrimination - women are victim of in the sphere of primary relationships, the legal sphere and the sphere of esteem. In addition, thanks to his idea that experiences of disrespect can trigger the necessary negative feelings to engage in political struggles, Honneth’s theory provides indications as for women’s emancipation and perspectives for social change.",

Crowdfunding is often used for cultural industries. This research reports on empirical research regarding the relationship between crowdfunding for cultural industries and marketing strategies used for crowdfunding. Previous research normally looked at the motivation of funders based on donation theories which considered funders as donors. However, this research considers funders as consumers and investors and it focuses on marketing perspective that can increase the success rate of crowdfunding. Specifically, the aim of this research is to find elements related to marketing that can increase the chances of success of crowdfunding.
Accordingly, this research reports (1) positive effects on limited edition rewards, tangible rewards and intangible rewards promised during the crowdfunding campaigns; (2) evaluation of marketing strategies used for crowdfunding such as prosumer marketing and viral marketing; (3) basic findings on the influential marketing related elements on crowdfunding platforms; (4) positive relationship between social exchange theory and success rate of crowdfunding.
These empirical results give insight into crowdfunding and can contribute to the development of crowdfunding as a source of raising capital. Furthermore, this research discusses the limitations of marketing strategies currently used for crowdfunding and gives recommendations on launching a successful crowdfunding campaign in the future.","['Crowdfunding', 'Marketing', 'Success Rate', 'Entrepreneurs', 'Social exchange theory']"

However, the concept of mechanisms has received relatively little attention within the realm of economic policy. This thesis aims to defend the claim that mechanisms are a useful tool for economic policy-making. For this purpose, two main arguments will be presented. First, mechanisms are able to partly resolve the methodological problem of external validity by specifying the similarity in background conditions between the artificial and target environments of economic policies. Mechanism design seems to be particularly promising approach in this regard. Second, mechanisms have the ability to provide a preliminary understanding of the evidence that could be relevant for the effectiveness of policy interventions. Interpreted as causal scenarios, policy makers can use mechanisms as a tool in order to establish evidential relevance.",

 Heritage, whether in its tangible or intangible form, is an extremely discussed topic, due to its presence and impact on communities’ lifestyles. It has been the target of several debates concerning its preservation, its economic valorisation and mostly, its role on the communities nowadays. This research intends to understand if heritage has the capacity to contribute to a local development process.
 To better understand this topic, this thesis will be illustrated by the case study of Baixa’s Traditional Shops. Similar to several European urban historic centres, Baixa, Lisbon’s historic centre, is loosing its traditional shops that symbolize a cultural and commercial reality, but are no longer economically viable. Thus, if their role as an economic agent is not enough for their own survival neither a key to Baixa’s local development, their conceptualization as cultural heritage is a new path to explore.
 So first, it is crucial to associate these traditional shops with the concept of heritage. Secondly, it will be investigated whether they can promote the local development of Baixa. Such research will be conducted through interviews to several actors involved in this case study. The aim is to see whether it is possible to suggest that heritage can be a lever for local development.","['(tangible and intangible) heritage', 'local development', 'historic city centres', 'preservation', 'cultural valorization', 'traditional shops']"

Let’s talk about sex baby,L. den Hertog,2016-06-23,"['S.R.J.M. van Bohemen', 'M.S.S.E. Janssen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Academic research on youth’s media consumption and their sexual lives has predominantly focused on sexual risk behavior. Countless scholars argue that sexual lyrics influence youth to engage in early sexual intercourse, have unsafe sex and develop distorted notions of gender relations. The approaches of these media effect studies include experimental designs and questionnaire-based research. Four problems can be identified with these studies. First of all, youth are positioned as non-reflexive, cultural dopes. Secondly, youth-centered approaches are lacking, which leaves out their own understandings and negotiations of these media texts. Thirdly, the focus is predominantly on risk behavior, thereby ignoring a major part of their sexual experiences. Lastly, the discourses of sexualization are interwoven with stereotypes about young girls and ‘ethnic’ youth. This study attempts to go beyond this one-sided perspective on youth, sexuality and media consumption by focusing on youth themselves and on ‘good’ sex. It aims to answer the question: What do youth consider to be good music for good sex and how do they make sense of their musical choices? This question was addressed by means of an innovative ‘music voice’ approach, which required participants to create their own playlist of music for good sex  about which they were subsequently interviewed. Youth’s narratives demonstrate that they do not primarily draw upon the ‘sexualized’ music that is discussed in media effect studies. Moreover, songs are included on the basis of beat rather than lyrics and interpretative meaning.  The way in which the beat is experienced by respondents subsequently influences the ways in which they implement music in their sex lives. Furthermore, when discussing sexually explicit lyrics, respondents voiced critical reflections and made a distinction between the content of these songs and their personal notions of good sex.","['youth', 'sex', 'music', 'music voice', 'sexualization']"
Nationalism and the Media,A. Sarycheva,2016-06-22,"['D.D. Dumitrica', 'I. Awad Cherit']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Russian contemporary society experiences nationalistic moods contagion that causes tensions
among different ethnic groups. The subject of these tensions, ethnic minorities, comprises
22% of the population, a total of 26 million people (RFSSS, 2010). However, relatively little
research is conducted on the topic of ethnic minorities media representation in Russia.
Scholars focus on television news coverage though entertaining media is being neglected in
existing academic research. The project explores ethnic minorities representation in the
Russian television series in order to fill in the lacuna. It combines theoretical foundations
from nationalism theories and media representation theory to explore the particular case. The
first theoretical pillar brings a specific understanding of ethnicity as a socially constructed
notion; the second one contributes by explaining the media role in ideology transmission. As
a method, the thesis uses Multimodal Discourse Analysis to investigate the chosen series
from a multimodal perspective. It allows the researcher to fix meanings in a variety of
semiotic resources as well as explores socio-economic and political influences on the media
representations. Project’s results provide confirmatory evidence that ethnic minorities in the
series are undervalued — they are represented as insignificant parts of the Russian society.
Furthermore, the data appear to suggest five ethnic minorities representation themes exist in
the Russian TV discourse — money, traditionalism, aggression, illiteracy and criminality.
However, some tensions within this discourse were also discovered. As such, five
representation themes are problematic only within ethnic characters — the same
characteristics for Russian characters are approved and justified. Moreover, the research has
found that the series frequently mock the society itself for being xenophobic and judgmental.","['Ethnic minorities', 'Nationalism', 'Media Representations', 'Russia', 'Multimodal Discourse Analysis']"
The Performance of Journalism in Documentaries,B.C.T. Mulder,2016-06-22,"['A.G. Fokkema', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The field of journalism is evolving in contemporary society. To achieve high quality content and maintain audiences, journalists attempt to develop new and original forms of journalism. In order to accomplish this, the performance of journalism is combined with various media platforms in light of media convergence. One of these media platforms through which journalism is conducted, is the documentary. The documentary is a type of film which combines art with a reflection on reality. The inherent qualities of a documentary to investigate social topics and reflect on reality lend itself to the investigative goals of journalism. The question is how journalism is performed in the narratives of documentaries, while the artistic aspects of the documentary influence this process. Also, how can past conflicts be researched through this medium? The aims of this thesis are to investigate the following research question: to what extent documentaries perform journalism, while being a form of art, and dealing with a past conflict? The conflict of genocide, specifically the genocides in Cambodia and Indonesia, is the main topic of this research. This thesis’ theoretical framework delves into the fields of journalism and documentary. The history, context and developments of journalism are discussed. Next to this, two types of journalism that share qualities with documentaries are investigated: slow journalism and narrative journalism. Then, the field of the documentary is examined. This framework looks into what constitutes a documentary, how it can reflect on reality and how narratives are applied in its creative process. Finally, the concept of collective memory is explored, as collective memory is connected to the investigation of conflicts in society. In order to answer this thesis’ research question, a narrative analysis is conducted. Through the application of two approaches to narrative analysis – the holistic content approach and the sociocognitive approach – four documentaries that deal with the genocides in Cambodia and Indonesia are the units of analysis being researched. The holistic content approach focuses on the content of the narrative; the sociocognitive approach inspects its discourse and context. In the analysis, data will be labeled based on the documentaries’ narratives. The inductive nature of this analysis leads to interpretations of this data, from which conclusions are drawn. The main findings of this research are that the narrative qualities of documentaries are very fitting for the performance of narrative journalism. Also, the extensive investigation that documentaries perform is strongly suitable to the performance of slow journalism. The artistic aspects of the documentary do not affect, but support the investigations being done in these documentaries. Finally, documentaries dealing with past conflicts like genocide show a powerful ability to shape collective memory regarding these conflicts.","['Journalism', 'Documentary', 'Narrative', 'Slow journalism', 'Narrative journalism', 'Narrative analysis', 'Holistic content approach', 'Sociocognitive approach']"
De adoptie van digitale leermiddelen door leraren in het Nederlandse basisonderwijs,M. Vriend,2016-06-22,"['W.M.H. Ribbens', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De hedendaagse maatschappij vertoont een toename in het gebruik van digitale media waardoor digitale kennis en vaardigheden steeds belangrijker worden. Het is daarom van belang dat kinderen op een jonge leeftijd kennis maken met nieuwe technologieën. Er zijn echter grote verschillen te bemerken in hoe kinderen gestimuleerd worden om met digitale media om te gaan. Volgens recent Europees onderzoek hebben vooral scholen daarom een grote verantwoordelijkheid bij de ontwikkeling van digitale vaardigheden. In Nederland maken basisscholen steeds meer gebruik van digitale leermiddelen maar de adoptie van digitale technologie in het klaslokaal op dit moment is gefragmenteerd en verloopt niet simultaan. De vraag is waar deze fragmentatie precies vandaan komt en in dit onderzoek wordt geprobeerd deze vraag te beantwoorden door de adoptie van digitale technologie door leerkrachten van jonge kinderen op basisscholen te onderzoeken. Onder jonge kinderen worden kinderen tussen de 4 en 8 jaar oud verstaan, uit de groepen 1 tot en met 6 van het basisonderwijs. De onderzoeksvraag die hieruit voortvloeit en in dit onderzoek beantwoord wordt, is: “Welke opportuniteiten en belemmeringen ervaren leraren in het basisonderwijs in Nederland bij de adoptie van digitale leermiddelen voor kinderen tussen de vier en acht jaar ?”. Ter beantwoording van de hoofdvraag wordt vertrokken vanuit inzichten uit het ‘Technology Acceptance Model’ (TAM) en het ‘Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology’-model (UTAUT-model). Deze modellen meten de mate van adoptie aan de hand van gebruiksintenties. Omwille van het exploratieve karakter van deze studie, alsmede uit groeiende ontevredenheid over deze modellen, wordt een stap terug gezet door een meer holistisch perspectief te bieden aan de hand van het domesticatieperspectief. Het empirische deel van het onderzoek is verricht door de uitvoering van een kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethode gebaseerd op diepte interviews met tien leerkrachten uit het Nederlandse basisonderwijs. Door deze interviews thematisch te analyseren zijn belangrijke thema’s in de opportuniteiten en belemmeringen geïdentificeerd. Hieruit wordt geconcludeerd dat binnen de thema’s twee duidelijke tegengestelde lijnen te ontdekken zijn: de opportuniteiten spelen zich voornamelijk af op een persoonlijk vlak terwijl de belemmeringen vooral voortkomen vanuit het instituut, in dit geval de school. Aan de hand van deze conclusies is een aantal adviezen samengesteld, voor partijen zoals de scholen maar ook voor ontwikkelaars en de overheid, om de adoptie van digitale leermiddelen door leerkrachten in de toekomst adequater te kunnen ondersteunen.","['Digitaal onderwijs', 'Digitale Adoptie', '21e eeuwse vaardigheden', 'Nederlands Basisonderwijs', 'Technology Acceptance Model', 'TAM', 'Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology', 'UTAUT', 'Domesticatie.']"

Liking social media as an extension of online public service media strategy,J.F. Pronk,2016-06-22,"['P.M. Leendertse', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","While public service broadcasters started out as monopolistic organizations in their respective countries, they have currently evolved into public service media in highly commercialized and diverse media markets. Not only commercial broadcasters, but also online video on demand services and other web media companies have started to compete with them. Social media platforms can also be thrown into this equation, although these third-party platforms also offer many opportunities for public service media to engage and interact with their audiences. Nonetheless, the commercial nature of these platforms conflicts with the public values most European public service broadcasters have to adhere to. Hence, the following research question is posed: “How do European public service media strategically utilize commercial social media platforms as part of their online activities to meet their public objectives?” Through 10 interviews with 11 employees from various public broadcasting organizations across Europe, many interesting insights into the social media usage of public service media were found. A thematic analysis was performed on the data, which in the first place brought to light the complicated organizational structure that makes online and in particular social media activity still quite hard to do in comparison to the core Radio and TV activities. Nonetheless, online activities are growing steadily: public service media are currently mainly focusing on building centralized video on demand platforms where all broadcast content can be consumed. Web-only content and other classic web characteristics such as personalization features are also gradually becoming more accepted at public broadcasters. Furthermore, public service media are also slowly expanding their activities on third-party social media platforms, most notably Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Strategies used on these platforms include second screen functionalities, pure promotion of their own content and online platforms, and the creation of native stand-alone content for various social platforms. The ability to successfully do that though with the desired high-quality is limited, due to current regulations but most notably due to a lack of available resources for such online activities. Most respondents acknowledged the third-party commercial status of the social media platforms they used, but did not see this as an issue that should hold them back in using such platforms. Consequently they valued connecting with the fragmented audiences on these platforms as more important than trying to completely protect their public service mission, by arguing that the presence of various audiences is precisely the reason why they should also be present on social media platforms. Nevertheless, social media activity by public service media is still very much in development as the organizations are still adapting to its emergence and the situation might be completely different a few years from now. Subsequently it will be interesting to see how social media utilization by public service media develops in the future.","['Public service media', 'public service broadcasting', 'social media', 'multi-platform', 'online strategy']"

Social Media and Civic Engagement,K.A. Uhsemann,2016-06-22,"['D.D. Dumitrica', 'I. Awad Cherit']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","With over one million refugees arriving in Europe in 2015, countries have entered a state of emergency as they struggle to cope with the continent’s greatest migration wave since the aftermath of the second World War. In this context, grassroots initiatives are stepping in where political administrations are failing and capacities are exhausted. Mobilization has been exceptionally large in Germany, where hundreds of grassroots initiatives were born all over the country under the common slogan “Refugees Welcome”. The vast majority of them is characterized by their shared use of social media, in particular Facebook and Twitter, which have played a key role in organizing and mobilizing the efforts of thousands of citizens. With a slowdown of the refugee crisis not in near sight, the grassroots initiatives are constantly trying to find new innovative ways of using those digital platforms to their advantages in order to meet their challenges. In this context, new forms of civic engagement emerge that translate to a successful use of social media for civic mobilization purposes.
The goal of this study was to understand how social media are used by such an initiative in the context of the refugee crisis. With the aim of providing a holistic picture of how social media are used by a grassroots initiative, firstly, it was investigated how different online platforms are used by identifying what messages are circulated through them for what purpose. Secondly, it was examined why those platforms are used in a certain way by identifying reasons and motivations behind this specific social media use.
 Using the example of one particular case of civic activism through social media (i.e. the Berlin-based initiative Moabit helps), this research was approached from a case study perspective. By combining a qualitative content analysis of their Facebook page, Facebook group, Twitter page and website, as well as in-depth interviews with initiators and volunteers, the actual practices of social media usage were assessed as well as reasons and motivations for this specific usage examined. 
The findings of this study showed that the context of the refugee crisis shapes the nature of the social media use in some ways more than in others. Through positive and negative experiences on the different online platforms, strategies are formed over time. While the divisive nature of the refugee issue and its outcomes such as right-wing extremism led to a limited informational usage of the public Facebook page, the closed nature of the Facebook group functions as a safe space that encourages dialogue and is primarily being used for mobilization purposes through the group’s swarm intelligence. While Twitter is still mainly used as a complementary channel for reaching new audiences, the people working at Moabit helps consider it a learning process.

But is such employee social-mediated crisis communication (ESMCC) an opportunity or a threat to their organisations? By developing the perspective of the internal employees in contrast to external stakeholders such as consumers, the research investigates the specific conditions for ESMCC to be-come either threat or opportunity to assets such as organisational reputation. To generate knowledge in line with scholars’ calls for quantitative, “evidence-based” crisis communication, a sur-vey with experimental conditions was conducted among 594 participants constituting the publics of an organisation. The findings show that in comparison to consumers, employees attacking their or-ganisation cause disproportionally more damage to organisational assets such as reputation than those defending it. In the latter scenario, employees are not more influential than consumers. It would still be a premature conclusion that ESMCC is only a threat – to this end, the study provides implications for both scholars and practitioners alike that outline positive and negative aspects.","['crisis communication', 'employees', 'reputation', 'secondary crisis actions', 'social media']"
Social TV: Second Screen and Audience Participation,A. Borgomastro,2016-06-22,"['A. Paz Alencar', 'D.D. Dumitrica']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The vast popularity of social networks and mobile devices has led to a transformation of television,
called Social television. Specifically, due to technological innovations, both public and commercial
broadcasters are trying to respond through developing cross-media processes, expanding the actual
content of their TV shows on social media (García-Avilés, 2012). They increasingly provide a
growing level of interactivity, which enhance online audience participation in a variety of ways. In
fact, social media allows a wide range of possible interactions, such as sharing, commenting, liking
etc. While previous studies have documented audience perception of the integration of social
networking sites into television contents, employing vary techniques of analysis (e.g., quantitative
descriptive statistics, social network analysis etc.) with the focus on the frequency of tweets,
qualitative investigations about audience’s opinions have not been adequately addressed to this day.
In this thesis, the dimensions of Italian audience participation on social media was explored. In
particular, if and to what extent viewers of a certain TV show are engaged in online interaction with
the content and with other viewers and how do they participate. I do so by examining the Italian
version of the talent show The voice and its media platforms. The literature review discussed
comprehends relevant theories about the topic of Social TV, which partly helped to guide the analysis.
A qualitative analysis approach based on the conduction of focus groups was applied. Then a thematic
analysis method was used to analyse the data and answer the research questions. In analysing the
social media use of the audience, I identified five main themes, namely: program perception,
perception of online content, information seeking patterns, communication patterns, motivations to
interact. The findings of the research suggest that viewers of the TV show are not as engaged on
social media as literature claims, the relationship between Italian audiences and broadcasters is still
weak. However, media field is constantly changing and especially in the Italian television and media
system there is a lot of room for improvement in the ability of broadcaster of engaging viewers.
Online participation initiatives need to increase their efficiency and transparency with more clearly
identified goals and following the taste of audiences. Hereby, this research will have a direct
implication on the way audience perceive the online content and it can be considered as the first step
in a larger one to develop and evaluate the interaction dynamics through second screen between
audiences and TV shows.","['Social TV', 'interactivity', 'participation', 'sociability', 'audience', 'social networks']"
Racism versus Democracy,B.L. de  Vries,2016-06-22,"['O. Nyirubugara', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The Zwarte Piet issue has become very salient in the Netherlands. How news media reported on the issue has for a large part determined the course of public debate surrounding Zwarte Piet. To explore the relations between gatewatching, agenda setting, and framing, the issue is approached as a case. In the public sphere, journalists normally inform the public about pertinent issues. Through agenda setting, they control the public agenda at first and second level and trough framing, they control the course of public opinion formation. They determined how the Dutch people understand and think about the Zwarte Piet issue. The emergence of web 2.0 and gatewatching brought a shift in that paradigm: commenters can frame an issue their way and differences can arise between journalist framing and commenter framing, affecting the public agenda. A case study of two Dutch online news sources, RTL Nieuws and Nu.nl, was conducted to research that process empirically. The objective was to identify how journalists and how commenters framed the Zwarte Piet issue. Theoretical sampling was done to gather articles and related comments (N=104) and framing analysis was used to analyze the material. The analysis involved detecting framing and reasoning devices and was performed using the computer program NVivo. To measure how operative each frame is, the number of framing devices was counted. Based on the frames and their operativeness the framing strategies of journalists and commenters were identified. In total, twelve frames were found: Children, Unfairness, Proponents vs. Opponents, Majority vs. Minority, Ridiculous, Serious, Threat from Outside, Color, Racism, Not Racism, Change, and Tradition/Heritage. The journalists framed the issue as serious and involving racism. In the framing done by commenters the issue does not involve racism and involves much unfairness towards the Dutch people. The framing strategy of each group was exactly the same at both news sources. Their strategies were not only different, but oppositional. Proponents vs. Opponents was the only frame journalists and commenters shared. Children, Unfairness, Majority vs. Minority, Ridiculous, Threat from Outside, Not Racism, and Tradition/Heritage were commenter frames and Serious, Color, Racism, and Change were journalist frames. The cases formed a good example of multiperspectival news, encompassing fact and opinion. Although the journalists were counter-framed and the issue was reframed by commenters, the journalists did not change their own framing strategy over time. It is argued that through gatewatching, journalists lose their agenda setting power at the second level, but they can gain agenda setting power at the first level if they conduct a certain gatekeeping policy or framing strategy.","['Agenda setting', 'Framing', 'Gatewatching', 'Zwarte Piet', 'Journalism', 'User comments']"
Public Values in the Social?,J.M. Kimmel,2016-06-22,"['P.M. Leendertse', 'J.S. Lee']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Ever since the 1980s, public service broadcasters, particularly in Western European countries, have increasingly seen the need to legitimize their existence. An added challenge for these now-called public service media is how to behave on commercially-orientated social media platforms. On the one hand, these commercial platforms can be considered a threat to the public service mission of these public service media, but on the other hand social media platforms have been heralded as providing opportunities to put long-cherished public values into practice, such as reaching demographics that are hard to reach with traditional broadcasting and engaging audiences. This research explores the ways in which people working for the Dutch public broadcaster the NPO create social media content for one or multiple television programs to explore in which ways this is influenced by the fact that they work for a public broadcaster rather than a commercial one. The research question of this research therefore is In which ways do public service broadcasting programs employ social media in light of their adherence to a public service orientation? In order to answer this research question, eleven in-depth interviews with fifteen people creating social media content for the Dutch public broadcaster have been conducted. A thematic analysis on the interview data revealed that generally speaking, specific public values were not at the foreground of the interviewees’ minds when creating social media content and that instead practical considerations such as wanting to be successful with posting content were regarded as more important. However, interviewees all believed that the television program(s) they did social media activities for did adhere to a public service orientation to such an extent, that reaching people and getting them to engage with content related to the television program(s) on social media is so valuable that this outweighs the importance of the fact that social media platforms are commercial in nature. In addition, many interviewees expressed a dissatisfaction regarding the social media strategy of the overarching Dutch public broadcasting organization, hereby revealing that within the same public broadcaster, wide differences can exist regarding attitudes towards how to utilize new digital technologies. This in turn has implications for the way in which strategies for adapting to social media platforms can evolve in the future.","['Public Service Media', 'Public Service Broadcasting', 'Social Media Platforms', 'Social Media Activities', 'Public Values']"

digital environment to innovate their business models and strategically position themselves in their
markets. Operating in a global and extensively disruptive industry new tech ventures find it difficult to
acquire strong strategic position and sustain a competitive advantage purely on their technological
basis. Young tech companies have to innovate their business models from a customer-centric approach
and find new ways to increase their competitiveness. Building brand online allows young tech startups
to create additional value and establish immutable differentiation which leads to a strong strategic
position. This research examined business models of ten prosperous media technology startups
through a branding perspective by conducting comparative case studies.
The comparison of the cases revealed several significant findings. Early stage media tech
companies should innovate their business models through a brand differentiation perspective working
towards establishing an online brand presence and customer engagement accompanied with innovate
use of technologies for their branding purposes. The following business model elements should be
considered as important by startups: brand identity, brand extensions, web-analytics, onboarding
experience, personalization, customer engagement, customer service, social media and websites. Tech
startups can address those elements by creating coherent brand identity, using brand endorsing
strategy, providing interactive onboarding experience on their websites, producing branded content for
social media channels, organizing contest and giveaways on social media, using web-analytics and
behavior tracking systems, as well as automation marketing services and real-time online support tools
for greater relational personalization. The findings indicate the rising role of customers in the media

CSR Communication for Advancing Corporate Reputation,Z.P. Mocheva,2016-06-22,"['J.S. Lee', 'S.J. Opree']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has emerged as an important topic for both corporations and researchers as public expectations of the proper role of business in society continue to grow. This thesis focuses on what constitutes effective CSR communication that establishes consumer perceptions of higher corporate reputation and legitimacy. In particular, the study analyzes the CSR report as a communication tool utilized by companies to advance their reputation. The analysis adopts a case study of one of the most prominent companies in the world, the Coca-Cola Company in order to determine the most prominent CSR themes communicated by companies to educate their consumers about corporate CSR initiatives. Further, it seeks to find out which CSR issues resonate the most with consumer perceptions. In order to assess stakeholder reactions and sentiment towards Coca-Cola’s CSR communication strategy, the study utilizes the social networking platform Twitter. The results are obtained through a mixed method approach of thematic qualitative content analysis and digital methods, including topic modeling, semantic network analysis and sentiment analysis. The thematic analysis of the corporate CSR report revealed that the most prominent themes within Coca-Cola’s CSR communication are the Stakeholder, Environmental, Ethical, Philanthropic, Legal and Economic. The semantic network analysis proved that the CSR themes are non-mutually exclusive. The Ethical and Stakeholder themes and the Philanthropic and Economic themes are the most interconnected pairs, while the Environmental and Legal themes are the least related. Finally, the top seven topics discussed by consumers regarding Coca-Cola and CSR are Women, Economy/Business, Environment, Sustainable Packaging, Consumer Health and Safety, Labeling and Corruption Scandals. Overall, the predominant sentiment towards Coca-Cola’s CSR was neutral. The Ethical and the Legal themes sparked the most negative conversations, while the Philanthropic and Stakeholder themes were the most positively discussed. The findings of the research could assist companies’ efforts to tailor effective CSR communication and serve as a basis for future research investigating successful CSR strategies.","['CSR', 'CSR Communication', 'Corporate Reputation', 'Consumer Perceptions', 'Social Media', 'Twitter']"

Gemeenten werden door het Rijk en het Centraal Orgaan Opvang Asielzoekers (COA) benaderd om vluchtelingen onderdak te bieden. Voor veel gemeenten werd dit als een zware taak ervaren. Naast de snel te realiseren opvang voor vluchtelingen, leverde dit ook veel angst en onbegrip op onder inwoners. Regionale dagbladen beschreven het gevoel van de samenleving. Ongeruste inwoners, bedreigde wethouders, behulpzame verenigingen en dwingende politieke collega’s werden besproken in de zestig geanalyseerde artikelen van zes kleine tot middelgrote gemeenten. 
           Met behulp van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse zijn in het codeerproces 53 open codes gevonden. Deze zijn teruggebracht naar tien axiale codes, die de subframes vormen van het onderzoek. De mediafuncties van regionale dagbladen, die zijn gebaseerd op eerder onderzoek, zijn ook in de analyse waargenomen. Regionale dagbladen vervullen in hun berichtgeving over het gemeentelijke vluchtelingenbeleid een informatieve, kritische en constructieve functie. De subframes vormen het antwoord op de deelvragen en zijn onder te verdelen in de drie mediafuncties. De subframes kunnen worden vertaald in drie overkoepelende thematische frames. Deze frames gaan in op het democratisch proces, het gevoel van angst en het versterken van een community.

Consumer Education on Digital Privacy,X. Zhang,2016-06-22,"['P. Arora', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Digital technologies are increasingly threatening consumer’s right to privacy, in spite of the conveniences they have brought. Besides corporations and governments invading consumer privacy, there are numerous malicious actors compromising consumers’ personal information. In spite of this, today’s consumers do not possess sufficient knowledge and skills to tackle the rising risks posed on their digital privacy. The inadequacy of consumer privacy literacy combined with the growth of digital privacy risks has sparked the urgency for privacy education. However, to date, few studies have investigated this important arena of privacy education through digital literacy campaigns. Hence, this thesis critically examines the range of communication actors and processes involved in contemporary campaigns across the globe designed to educate consumers on privacy issues.
Qualitative content analysis is conducted on selected digital literacy campaigns from four different countries. The thesis comparatively analyzes the websites and social media activity of these campaigns to gauge the global approach to privacy literacy and the range of communication strategies employed to reach their consumers. The findings reveal that contemporary campaigns educate consumers across different media channels by communicating digital privacy risks initiated by companies, governments and malicious individuals and risk-coping solutions that contain privacy protection measures and demands for better protection of privacy rights. Among these campaigns, public education campaigns backed by governments differ from privacy activism campaigns driven by non-profits in terms of the scope of privacy issues, their interpretations of privacy and their positioning of the relationship between consumers and companies. Based on the findings, the thesis provides important implications that future global campaigns should focus on the communication of privacy risks and risk-coping solutions while using more interactive features on social media for engagement. The thesis further argues that the existing dimensions of digital privacy literacy needs to be expanded.","['Digital literacy', 'Consumer digital privacy', 'Privacy education', 'Cyber security', 'Privacy activism', 'Social media engagement']"
Dat heeft gestaan op Facebook,S. Hofstede,2016-06-22,"['P.C. Ruigrok', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De grote stroom vluchtelingen die in 2015 uit voornamelijk Syrië richting Europa trok, ging gepaard met een stroom aan mediaberichtgeving. Naar mate de problematiek rond vluchtelingen dichterbij Nederland kwam, leek het publieke debat over migratie feller te worden en de weerstand tegen vluchtelingen groter, iets wat zich vooral uitte in hevige emotionele discussies op sociale media. Door te focussen op het verband tussen de berichtgeving van Nederlandse dagbladen op hun Facebook-pagina’s en de daaropvolgende discussies, onderzocht deze thesis diverse relaties tussen mediaberichtgeving en het publieke migratiedebat en werd er verder gegaan dan de aanname dat negatieve mediaberichtgeving over vluchtelingen automatisch leidt tot een negatievere perceptie op immigratie. Hiervoor werd de hoeveelheid nieuws en reacties onderzocht, maar ook de focus van deze discussies, de frames die deze berichten domineerden tijdens het verloop van de problematiek en in hoeverre er sprake is van een publieke sfeer in het online migratiedebat. Om een zo breed mogelijke blik op deze medialogica te verkrijgen, werden ook de verschillen tussen kwaliteitskranten en populaire media geanalyseerd.
Via een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse werden eerst de frames in beide soorten berichten opgetekend. Deze vormde de input voor een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse. Hieruit bleek dat er een duidelijk verband bestaat tussen de mediaberichtgeving van Nederlandse dagbladen op Facebook en de daaropvolgende reacties. Naar mate de problematiek dichterbij Nederland kwam, nam de media-aandacht toe en daarmee ook het aantal reacties, een indicatie van een grote invloed van de nabijheid van gebeurtenissen en dat er sprake is van agendasetting. Ook is er sprake van frame-setting in reacties. Uit beide soorten berichtgeving bleek dat er in de loop van de vluchtelingenstroom inderdaad een grotere weerstand tegenover vluchtelingen is ontstaan. Deze trend werd vooral geobserveerd in reacties, die veel stigmatiserende opmerkingen bevatten. De inhoud van reacties wordt beïnvloed door mediaberichtgeving, maar kan ook worden verklaard door de achterliggende dynamiek van migratie en politieke discussies op sociale media. Zo is er duidelijk sprake van een groep burgers die, vermoedelijk vanuit onvrede over de politiek, een groot onbehagen koestert ten aanzien van immigratie. Uit de lage mate van onbevangen en rationele discussie in reacties bleek bovendien dat er op Facebook maar weinig sprake is van een publieke sfeer. Daarom moeten er zeker kanttekeningen worden geplaatst bij de representativiteit van Facebook-discussies voor het algehele publieke debat.","['Migratie', 'Sociale media', 'Publieke sfeer', 'Framing', 'Frame-setting', 'Agenda-setting', 'Nieuwswaarden', 'Populaire media', 'Kwaliteitsmedia']"

ABSTRACT
Due to increased reliance on creativity across industries as well as to the vaguely delineated boundaries of the concept of creativity, new trends have emerged as a way for companies to innovate. One such complex new trend which has received less attention in academia is interdisciplinary work in creative fields such as fashion and design. With its fast-paced dynamics and constant developments, technology in particular constitutes an area of interest for creative professionals. Since collaboration between design studios and technology-related firms is still considered a more unusual way of working, it also presents certain new challenges for experts. Overall, it is not well known nor documented how smooth the collaborative process is or what work practices are common among these different stakeholders. Thus, the current research takes on an exploratory approach and aims to give a more contemporary overview of collaborative work practices in interdisciplinary environments. The research question is formulated as follows: “How do designers experience interdisciplinary collaboration between design or fashion studios and technology-related firms and how does it shape work practices in the creative industries?”
The study employs a qualitative approach through a combination of two data collection techniques – namely, conducting one focus group interview and multiple in-depth individual interviews with interdisciplinary designers. Results and their analysis show that the blend of design and technology is still considered an innovative and highly dynamic type of collaboration. Various aspects that are discussed in a positive light also emerge as possible limitations or challenges that need to be overcome throughout the work process. In particular, the quality of communication between partners from these different fields is deemed as an essential component of collaborative work. The research findings could be especially useful in providing an external overview of designers’ experiences in collaborations with technology-related firms or experts as well as in pointing out the main interdisciplinary work practices exercised in such settings.","['Interdisciplinarity', 'Collaborative creativity', 'Interdisciplinary work practices', 'Creative industries', 'Wearable technology']"
Corporate social responsibility in the fast fashion industry,L.H. Aarnio,2016-06-21,"['Y. Wang', 'J. Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The increased consumer attention towards CSR (corporate social responsibility)- practices, needs and execution is a tendency that has equally developed amongst the consumers of fast fashion industry. This study was inspired by the paradoxical paradigm that exists between fast fashion brands and their CSR.  
Previous research highlights the aspect of reputation in the context of CSR, as well as its potential to increase organisational legitimacy. Research on CSR- communication and information is equally vast. However scholars have not specifically addressed the fast fashion industry in this context. Literature further suggests, that CSR- information is interpreted and understood and judged differently by different stakeholders. 
12 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with consumers of fast fashion industry in order to research the phenomenon. In order to understand the true meaning behind the paradigm, the following thematic entities were inspected with detail: 1) the understanding of CSR by the consumers of the industry 2) the CSR- preferences of consumers 3) the preferred and most efficient CSR- communication strategies and 4) the possible means for increased legitimacy of fast fashion brands via CSR and its communication. 
The author was aware of the prevalent mistrust of consumers of fast fashion brands towards their CSR. Nevertheless, the main findings suggest a plethora of varying beliefs and hidden consumer attitudes towards the CSR of fast fashion brands. Salient findings show that consumers prefer sustainability- and employee- related- CSR.
Understanding the consumer mindset seems crucial in order to build a connection between properly adjusted, executed and communicated CSR. The findings further suggest a re-direction of CSR- policies, initiatives, and communication, without however demolishing the organisational structure and business models of fast fashion brands. As suggested by this research, a possible future road points towards an ideal combination of transparent, relevant, proactive, educative and authentic CSR and CSR- communication. 
Consequently, as its main implications, this research proposes transparent and authentic CSR- communication in order to appease the consumer mistrust. Once achieved, consumers have the potential to become more aware of CSR- issues, trust companies more and spread good word-of-mouth. In return, this all can gradually lead to repeated purchases due to clearer consumer consciousness.","['corporate social responsibility', 'fast fashion industry', 'CSR- communication', 'social media', 'trust', 'legitimacy', 'knowledge gap']"
Engaging with the environment: the role of mobile apps.,E. Karachaliou,2016-06-21,"['P.M. Leendertse', 'S.J. Opree']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","During the last decades, the development of museums throughout the Western World has significantly increased. However, this so-called museum boom has not translated into an increase in visitor rates; in contrast, a decline in visitor attendance has been recorded. In parallel, shifts in the leisure industry have resulted in museums competing with not only other museums but also with other leisure attractions –and what’s more, museums receive limited funding due to the stricter extension of public money in the last years. Therefore, museums, operating within a tumultuous and quickly changing environment that has also dramatically been influenced by the rise of the Web 2.0, need to reposition themselves and find innovative ways to attract the today’s sophisticated and demanding audiences. The diffusion of Web 2.0 and lastly the upsurge of mobile technologies have provided museums with a potential to attract these diverse audiences and to provide new value propositions that correspond to the needs of contemporary users. In fact, over the last few years the use of mobile devices has been an already established trend, and this momentum generates an additional opportunity for museums to exploit the capabilities of mobile technologies and to achieve their goals.
This paper attempts to investigate the capabilities that mobile applications offer to museums to attract the contemporary audiences by providing new value propositions. In order to do so, eleven mobile applications were selected to be analyzed based on geographic criteria as well as their size and the cultural context where they operate. The data collection and analysis of the cases was guided from the conceptual framework that was formulated according to the literature on the field. The significant findings confirmed most of the theory and permitted a judgement on what extent museums exploit the capabilities of mobile apps to provide public value to their audiences.","['value propositions', 'diverse audiences', 'mobile applications', 'public value', 'museums', 'business model']"

Specifically, in-depth interviews are conducted to achieve this goal. The sampling method used to recruit participants is purposive sampling; with help of NU.nl, the largest news web site and mobile application in the Netherlands, the students were recruited. After the transcription of the interviews, thematic analysis was used as a toolbox for the data analysis process. The three main themes, or selective codes, found in the interviews are ‘accessibility’, ‘societal needs’ and ‘low control’. The motivations for the consumption of news on social media are: the speed of news delivery, staying updated, the ease of news consumption, consume news with similar perspectives as they personally have and consume news that is relevant to their lives. The motivations for sharing news on social media are: give their opinion, want to know others’ opinions, start a discussion, keep their friends or followers updated on current events and news and enhance their status.","['News consumption', 'news sharing', 'social media', 'uses and gratifications', 'motivations']"
Digital Campaigns for Social Change,R.A. Mouws,2016-06-21,"['A. Paz Alencar', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Over the last decades, storytelling methods have become increasingly popular to be used as a marketing tool. And therefore, many companies are starting to realise that good storytelling elements are central to strategic management tools (Denning, 2006). Another development in marketing strategies is integrating the widespread concerns about social issues and the environment (Peattie, 2001). Surprisingly, most research on the field tends to be conceptually driven (see Barnes, 2003; Dowling, 2006; Driscoll & McKee, 2007; Larsen, 2000). Therefore, there is not much empirical research analysing corporate stories and what they consist of within brand communities. Moreover, this is especially not the case for NGO’s, non-profit organisations, and social enterprises (Spear & Roper, 2013). This study aims to start filling this gap by combining storytelling theory and practice to test the effectiveness of storytelling elements in digital marketing campaigns of non-profit organisations for social change (Spear & Roper, 2013). Moreover, despite increasing specialization in the field, most organisations still need help in learning effective ways to make use of storytelling techniques (Denning, 2006). The present study, therefore, also helps enable organisations to fully benefit from using storytelling techniques relating to the social good in their marketing campaigns.
By taking the case study of Tunga, more insights will be gained in understanding how the social good story of an organisation can be used most effectively to build a successful marketing campaign and eventually a successful corporate brand.
More specifically, this study will focus on two aspects of an online marketing campaign, namely storytelling in blogs and in online advertising. Moreover, through a quantitative automated experiment that tests nine different stories and nine advertisements on the social media platforms Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, it was concluded that the most effective storytelling strategies in telling the social good story of Tunga are focusing the messages on the identity and reason to believe of Tunga. Moreover, it is likely that this will be the most effective and efficient on Twitter. These insights can be the starting point of building a successful online marketing campaign on multiple channels. However, it is also important to keep in mind that it requires a tremendous amount of planning, effort and refinement before brands start to see the results of a successful online marketing campaign (Johansson, 2016).","['Storytelling', 'Sustainable Marketing', 'Non-profit Organisations', 'Social Enterprise', 'Branding']"

“I am just posting myself online”,L.D. Petrova,2016-06-21,"['J.H. Pridmore', 'I. Awad Cherit']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study examines the ways in which prosumers (co-)produce their personal identity while generating branded content on Instagram. The research looks at how certain brands are related to the daily production of consumers’ identities and discusses the positive and negative experiences associated with their involvements in such practices.
In order to answer the research question, the study employed in-depth interviews and netnographic like observations of participants’ branded Instagram content. The combination of both methods allowed for clarity and deeper understanding of the phenomena studied.
The findings of this research show that participants tend to generate branded content on Instagram for positive self-presentation. Irving Goffman’s (1959) academic work on impression management is one of the underlying theories in this research in order to present the different ways in which people adjust their behaviour when around other people. Goffman’s work on self-presentation was then transferred to the social media context, in which participants in this research produce branded content, and, therefore, shape their identities. Interviewees prefer to produce their identities through generating and sharing branded content, to which values they want to identify with, which very often were big and prominent brands, such as Mercedes or Starbucks. As a result, a tension between who one is online and offline occurs. In order to interact with certain brands, respondents are likely to “exchange symbolic knowledge and emotional value” with them, which creates value on a primary level which was transferred to the market level through appropriation by brands (Cova & Dalli, 2009). Interactive practices of consumers with brands online are examined in relation to notions of “immaterial” (Lazzarato, 1997) and “social labour” (Anderson et al., 2016). Even though many theorists argue that such practices are forms of exploitation (Fuchs, 2011, 2014; Hardt & Negri, 2004; Tapscott & Williams, 2008), participants feel empowered by brands. This empowerment has been related to the variety of opportunities for access, autonomy and recognition brands offer to their customers, and, thus, the latter are not critical when prosuming online.
Last but not least, limitations of the study and implications for further research are proposed.","['identity', 'Instagram', 'prosumption', 'brands', 'social media']"
Dj’s and the sound of social media,S. Pieter,2016-06-21,"['W.M.H. Ribbens', 'A.F.M. Krijnen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De traditionele muziekindustrie, die zich kenmerkte door een redelijk gesloten marktstructuur en platenmaatschappijen die domineerden, heeft door de opkomst van digitalisering plaats gemaakt voor een ‘nieuwe’ muziekindustrie. De macht van platenmaatschappijen in de markt is gereduceerd, omdat nu zowel gevestigde als opkomende artiesten in staat zijn zelfstandig op professioneel niveau te opereren. Aangezien artiesten tegenwoordig zelfstandig aan hun carrière kunnen werken en de toetredingsdrempels tot de muziekindustrie zijn verlaagd, wordt er gesproken van democratisering. Deze democratisering heeft echter niet alleen implicaties voor de muziekindustrie zelf, maar ook voor de rol van de artiesten werkende in deze industrie. Het onderzoek focust zich op een specifieke groep artiesten werkende in de muziekindustrie, namelijk autonome Nederlandse dj’s. Zelfstandige dj’s zouden tegenwoordig te maken hebben met meer taken dan voorheen, omdat ze nu zelf de verantwoordelijkheid dragen voor hun eigen carrière. Hoewel de wetenschappelijke literatuur zich tot nu toe voornamelijk heeft gefocust op de veranderingen in de muziekindustrie, focust dit onderzoek zich op de ervaringen van de dj´s werkende in deze industrie. Want hoe ervaren zij deze verandering? Ervaren zij de rol van een culturele ondernemer? Hoe geven zij invulling aan hun social media kanalen? Op welke manieren doen zij aan self-branding door middel van social media? Dit zijn allemaal vragen die dit onderzoek tracht te beantwoorden. Het doel van het onderzoek is om de ervaringen en handelingspatronen van Nederlandse dj’s in het gebruik van social media voor self-branding in kaart te brengen. Om de bovenstaande vragen te beantwoorden zijn er diepte-interviews afgenomen met autonome Nederlandse dj’s werkende in de muziekindustrie. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd middels een kwalitatieve thematische analyse. De onderzoeksresultaten wijzen uit dat de autonome Nederlandse dj’s de rol van een cultureel ondernemer ervaren, social media voornamelijk beschouwen als promotiemiddel en de respondenten via diverse social media kanalen proberen een korte en bondige berichtgeving te hanteren met een persoonlijke twist. Met deze berichten trachten de dj’s de doelgroep op de hoogte te houden van hun activiteiten en de hoogtepunten uit hun carrière. Daarnaast zetten ze social media ook (onbewust) in voor de specifieke promotiestrategie self-branding. Voor self-branding benadrukken ze hun persoonlijkheid op social media en werken de respondenten aan het vergroten van hun zichtbaarheid op social media.","['Dj', 'social media', 'muziekindustrie', 'self-branding', 'promotie', 'cultureel ondernemerschap', 'digitalisering', 'Web 2.0']"
50 jaar seksualiteit in vrouwentijdschriften,L. Weggemans,2016-06-20,"['A.F.M. Krijnen', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Deze master thesis onderzoekt de manier waarop seksualiteit wordt gerepresenteerd in de vier vrouwentijdschriften Margriet, Libelle, Viva en Flair in een periode van 1965 tot 2015. In de jaren zestig vindt in Nederland een seksuele revolutie plaats die ertoe leidde dat er in de maatschappij meer ruimte kwam voor seksualiteit. Vijftig jaar later lijken alle taboes op het gebied van seksualiteit te zijn doorbroken. In media kan tegenwoordig alles worden besproken op het gebied van seksualiteit. Maar hoe heeft zich dit in deze vijftig jaar ontwikkeld? Dit onderzoek draagt bij aan het beantwoorden van deze vraag door de ontwikkeling hiervan in vrouwentijdschriften te onderzoeken. Tijdschriften zijn een vorm van massamedia en hebben een belangrijke rol in het representeren van ideologieën, waarden en wereldbeelden. Tijdschriften hebben daarmee ook invloed op de constructie van seksualiteit in de maatschappij.
	Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd middels een discoursanalyse geïnspireerd op de ideeën van filosoof Michel Foucault. Er is hierbij gekeken naar de manier waarop bepaalde discoursen en ideeën tot stand kwamen en hoe deze door de tijd heen zijn veranderd in vrouwentijdschriften. Media als vrouwentijdschriften spelen een grote rol in het representeren van een bepaalde werkelijkheid. De discoursen die uit dit onderzoek naar voren zijn gekomen laten zien hoe de vrouwentijdschriften seksualiteit op een bepaalde manier representeren.  
Uit het onderzoek komen twee dominante discoursen naar voren die de gehele onderzoeksperiode blijven bestaan. Het eerste dominante discours is heteroseksualiteit en monogame seksualiteit als de norm. In de gehele onderzoeksperiode blijft er een norm voor seks terugkomen, namelijk: het gebeurt tussen een man en een vrouw en binnen een liefdesrelatie. Dit discours wordt in stand gehouden door vier strategieën: seksualiteit en liefde, homoseksualiteit, vreemdgaan en anticonceptie. Het tweede dominante discours dat uit het onderzoek naar voren kwam is seksualiteit als intimiteit. In dit discours worden vooral de intieme en fysieke kanten van seksualiteit besproken. Ook dit discours wordt in stand gehouden door verschillende strategieën: inhoudelijk over seks, wat is goede seks?, masturberen en seksuele fantasieën en afwijkende seksualiteiten. Binnen de acht strategieën vinden ontwikkelingen en verschuivingen plaats. Seksualiteit kan steeds openlijker worden besproken en er wordt steeds meer mogelijk op seksueel gebied. Wel is een duidelijk verschil te zien tussen de Viva en Flair, welke seksualiteit heel open bespreken en de Margriet en Libelle, waarbij het bespreken van seksualiteit steeds meer naar de achtergrond verdwijnt.","['seksualiteit', 'seks', 'vrouwentijdschriften', 'discoursanalyse', 'representatie']"
Generational differences among stakeholders regarding CSR advocacy in a developing country,Z.P. Trubek,2016-06-20,"['V. Chaudhri', 'J. Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Following the renewed focus on and demand for corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the contemporary business environment lately, the concept that originates from the Western-country context has also appeared in developing countries starting to gain more traction and shape the corporate initiatives. In this way, naturally, CSR has also raised its head in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) lately, but given that the population of the region is typically thought to be rejecting against social responsibility, the concept did not seem to be rooted in the region. Nonetheless, recent studies suggest that there is a significant change happening in the region, more specifically in Hungary, in terms of the advocacy for CSR, which provokes a number of interesting questions that are worth answering. Among others it would be important to see what may cause the perceived change regarding the acceptance and likeability of the concept in a country, that comprehensively objects volunteerism and social responsibility and whether the approach of the whole of the population is suddenly changing towards CSR or – knowing that Millennials drive the change towards the advocacy of CSR in the Western context – it could be possible that a certain age group is leading this change in Hungary as well. If so, studying what might evoke their support and hinder that of the older generations could also yield interesting results. In fact, looking at whether there are differences with regards to how certain age groups perceive the notion and lastly, if there is really a change in the mind-sets in relation to CSR one can argue about, are also crucial factors to consider. By relying on data from four in-depth focus group sessions, the current perspectives and attitudes of the Hungarian citizens get investigated in the frame of this study. Essentially, therefore, the thesis endeavours to find answers to three key questions: (1) How do Hungarian citizens make sense of CSR? (2) In what ways does generational difference contribute to understandings of and attitudes towards CSR? (3) How do Millennials define their role in promoting CSR in Hungary compared to the older generations? With answering them, the author aims to investigate the distinctive features and peculiarities of CSR in an emerging nation and present the directions CSR as a concept has taken and is taking in a once socialist country, that, being part of CEE as a region can also indicate the perceptions of the citizens and the evolution CSR is undergoing with regards to the neighbouring states.","['Central and Eastern Europe', 'corporate social responsibility', 'developing countries', 'generational differences', 'Hungary', 'Millennials', 'stakeholder perspective']"
Member engagement in sharing communities,J. Ke,2016-06-20,"['M. Slot', 'I. Awad Cherit']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Nowadays, the sharing economy has been a heated subject for public debate. This new development
enables people to lend, swap, rent and barter products or services in a more convenient way. While
property and mobility sharing are gaining more media coverage, other forms of sharing such as knowledge
sharing remain less represented. Although the notion of sharing is not new, however unlike typical sharing
behavior, today the sharing economy is significantly facilitated by digital technologies such as social
media and mobile platforms. Thus, to formulate and engage online communities becomes an important
instrument for a sharing platform to thrive. Given the prevalent use of social media in the sharing
economy, online members’ motivation to participate remains one of the main barriers not only in
knowledge sharing communities but also virtual communities in general. Hence, this thesis is devoted to
studying the strategies of Dutch knowledge sharing platforms using social media to engage community
members, and to what extent do they differ their strategies towards active and less active members. The
three building blocks of this thesis are the interpreted value of social media use, strategic engagement on
social media, and tactical difference on member mobilization.
Theoretical literature indicates that based on the functional features of social media, it is feasible for
practitioners to use them as tools for member engagement. Thus, this thesis postis that if a sharing
platform's social media communication speaks to people’s motivations of knowledge sharing behaviors, it
is likely to stimulate participation in sharing initiatives. Through qualitative interviews with eleven
practitioners across nine Dutch knowledge sharing platforms, this thesis shows that curating social media
content, facilitating social relationships, and fulfilling individual needs are three main strategies deployed
by practitioners. Moreover, this thesis concludes that among the interviewed platforms, there is no distinct
tactical difference towards active and less active community members. Rather, it is the demographic
groups, target audience on different social media channels, and the structure of a community that are
likely to vary a sharing platform’s member engagement strategies on social media.","['The sharing economy', 'Knowledge sharing', 'Social media', 'Member engagement', 'Community']"
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the Russian banking sector: Through an institutional lens.,V. Varteresian,2016-06-20,"['V. Chaudhri', 'S.J. Opree']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Knowledge on how Russian companies perceive and practice corporate social responsibility
(CSR) is limited. The objective of this study is to fill this gap and analyse how the institutional
environment in the country determines CSR practices and motivations of Russian financial
organisations.
The project employs institutional perspectives as the primary lens through which CSR is
observed in the Russian context, arguing that such approach allows grasping a wide range of
factors that may influence CSR processes in a given environment. In particular, the thesis strives
to understand what forms CSR in Russia takes, what drives and motivates organisations to
engage in socially responsible behaviour, and what institutional factors have their say in shaping
these processes.
To answer these questions the study examines the construction of meanings across fourteen
Russian banks. In particular, it applies qualitative methods to analyse publicly available
information on CSR, such as CSR reports, annual reports, and website sections. Findings explain
that the understanding and practice of CSR in Russia is determined by the country’s institutional
environment and unique history, which assumes organisations to contribute to social
development. However, the project also addresses to ‘crossvergence’ of CSR in Russia, meaning
that responsible practices in this framework are not exclusively shaped by the national context,
but also by global processes and practices.","['Banking', 'Corporate social responsibility (CSR)', 'Emerging market', 'Institutional theory', 'Russia']"
Corporate Reputation in the Volkswagen Emissions Scandal,L. Wanjek,2016-06-20,"['Y. Wang', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","While some scholars argue that a strong reputation can protect an organization from
reputational loss during a crisis, others believe that a high reputation leads to higher
expectations among the public, which are violated during a crisis and make the organization
suffer. As the role of corporate reputation in the crisis context is still inconclusive in literature, it
is thus of interest to investigate to what extent it affects the outcomes of a global crisis for a
corporation. In this study, the emissions scandal of the highly reputed corporation the
Volkswagen Group (VW) was investigated. The focus is on whether the crisis resulted in
reputational loss of and an increased negative word-of-mouth intention towards the VW Group
among the German public. The Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) is employed to
conceptualize the crisis context. In addition to crisis responsibility and anger, which have been
identified as key predictors of crisis outcomes in the SCCT, this study also examines two
potential predictors: The newly introduced concept crisis involvement, and the positive thus less
regarded emotion - sympathy. Moreover, the impact of the person-company fit is investigated in
this crisis context.
Using a quantitative online survey, this study investigates the mechanism through which
the emissions scandal influenced the Volkswagen Group’s reputation and the negative word-ofmouth
intention among the German public. These outcomes are compared between the affected
and non-affected German public. The data consists of 1475 German respondents in total and the
data analysis was conducted by employing the structural equation modeling method. The results
suggest that the German respondents evaluate the post-crisis reputation of the VW Group only
on a modest level, though, their intention to express negative word-of-mouth is rather low. Both
emotions - anger and sympathy - among the German public mediate the impact of perceived
crisis responsibility and crisis involvement on post-crisis reputation and negative word-ofmouth
intention. However, the impact of crisis responsibility on anger and that of anger on both
crisis outcomes is stronger among the affected German public than the non-affected German
public, while no difference is observed with respect to sympathy. Next to this, person-company
fit is identified as moderator in the relationships. It weakens the impacts of crisis responsibility
and crisis involvement on anger, as well strengthens the impact of crisis responsibility on
sympathy.
II
The results of this study imply an extension of the SCCT framework through identifying
the role of crisis involvement and person-company fit in the crisis context. Managerial
implications are provided with regard to corporate crisis communication. Corporations should
consider that not only anger might influence the post-crisis reputation and negative word-ofmouth
intention but also sympathy. This implies that corporations should on the one hand
mitigate anger and on the other hand reinforce sympathy in order to save themselves from
negative crisis outcomes. To achieve this, one options is to carry out low perceived crisis
responsibility and crisis involvement. Further, as person-company fit may vary the negative
crisis outcomes for both affected and non-affected general public, it is important for
corporations to build a strong relationship with current and potential customers.","['Crisis Communication', 'Corporate Reputation', 'Negative Word-of-Mouth', 'Crisis Responsibility', 'Crisis Involvement', 'Emotion', 'Anger', 'Sympathy', 'Person-Company Fit', 'SCCT']"
De spanning tussen creativiteit en creatieve controle in de culturele industrie,I. Heijkoop,2016-06-20,"['A.J.C. van der Hoeven', 'A.F.M. Krijnen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De laatste jaren is er volgens diverse filmjournalisten en filmbloggers een toename in het aantal films met een genre over het ingewikkelde leven van creatieve personen. Hierbij staat één drama centraal, namelijk “Being a creative person is really, really hard” (Zeitchik, 2014b; Eig, 2014). Deze toename is volgens filmjournalist Zeitchik (2014b) te danken aan de democratisering van creativiteit. Dit houdt in dat steeds meer mensen kunnen participeren in de culturele industrie, door de komst van internet (Hesmondhalgh, 2012). Creativiteit speelt met de democratisering een steeds belangrijkere rol in de huidige samenleving. Dit onderzoek speelt in op deze ontwikkeling en poogt met het achterhalen van representaties van creativiteit in Amerikaanse podiumkunstenfilms, meer inzicht te geven in de betekenissen van het concept in de huidige samenleving. Hierbij ligt de focus op ‘artistieke creativiteit’, het kunnen bedenken en ontwikkelen van nieuwe en originele ideeën of artistieke objecten, die worden geaccepteerd en erkend door experts als kunstvorm, en cultureel en esthetisch van waarde (Regev, 1994). Dit concept wordt in deze studie benaderd vanuit een cultuursociologisch perspectief. Hierbij staan het concept ‘autonomie’ en de theoretische benadering van ‘spanningen tussen individueel talent en een collaboratief proces’ centraal. De studie tracht hiermee te achterhalen in hoeverre de cultuursociologische visie van toepassing is op recente films, om te bepalen hoe de eerdere literatuur zich verhoudt tot de wijze waarop filmregisseurs artistieke creativiteit representeren. De onderzoeksvraag van dit onderzoek luidt: Hoe wordt artistieke creativiteit gerepresenteerd in Amerikaanse podiumkunstenfilms Black Swan, Whiplash en Birdman? Deze drie recente films die in dit onderzoek middels een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse geanalyseerd zijn, worden door filmjournalisten vaak met elkaar vergeleken vanwege hun overeenkomende verhaallijnen. Uit de analyse blijkt dat de representaties van autonomie en de spanning tussen individueel talent en een collaboratief proces niet ingaan op de democratisering van creativiteit, maar eerder op een strijd voor meer erkenning en controle over het creatieve proces. Artistieke creativiteit wordt daarom in de films Black Swan, Whiplash en Birdman gerepresenteerd middels een spanning tussen creativiteit en creatieve controle. Een spanning die Deuze (2007) herkent in de culturele industrie. De films gaan tevens in tegen clichés door te focussen op een collaboratief proces in plaats van een individueel talent. Ook is er een positievere representatie te vinden van de artiesten in de films, waarbij zij autonomer zijn en worden gerepresenteerd als een ‘artist-as-insider’. Daarnaast krijgt het hebben van culturele, sociale of economische kapitalen en het begrijpen van de ‘habitus’ minder betekenis binnen artistieke creativiteit, doordat juist onervaren artiesten in de films autonomer zijn (Bourdieu, 1990).","['Artistieke creativiteit', 'representatie', 'Black Swan', 'Whiplash', 'Birdman', 'creatieve controle', 'collaboratief proces', 'geldingsdrang']"
Vluchtelingen – van alle kanten,J.A.J. de Vogel,2016-06-19,"['P.C. Ruigrok', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Deze thesis onderzoekt de manier waarop er in Nederlandse populaire en kwaliteitskranten wordt geschreven over de vluchtelingencrisis van 2015/2016. Het onderzoek is van belang vanwege de invloed die media kunnen hebben op het vormen van de publieke opinie. Door bepaalde manieren van framen van de berichtgeving, kunnen media bijdragen aan zowel de pro- als anti-vluchtelingenkant van het debat over vluchtelingen. De thesis focust ten eerste op de verschillen tussen populaire en kwaliteitskranten in de hoeveelheid aandacht voor vluchtelingen. Daarnaast wordt de manier van schrijven zelf onderzocht. Ook wordt er bekeken in welke mate de wijze van schrijven over de vluchtelingencrisis gedurende een tijdsperiode van 1 jaar is veranderd, mede naar aanleiding van twee key events: de foto’s van peutertje Aylan en de gebeurtenissen tijdens Oudjaarsnacht in onder meer Keulen. Om de overkoepelende onderzoeksvraag, “in hoeverre en op welke wijze besteden Nederlandse dagbladen aandacht aan de vluchtelingencrisis van 2015/2016 in de periode van 1 februari 2015 tot 1 februari 2016”, te kunnen beantwoorden is gebruik gemaakt van inhoudsanalyse als methode. Als vooronderzoek is een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse uitgevoerd, waarna zes frames rondom de vluchtelingencrisis konden worden opgesteld. De aanwezigheid van deze frames is gemeten middels een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse van een steekproef van 900 artikelen, afkomstig uit vijf kranten. Een eerste bevinding betrof de hoeveelheid aandacht voor de vluchtelingencrisis, die altijd hoger is in kwaliteitskranten. De hoeveelheid aandacht vertoonde vanaf september 2015 veel pieken voor beide krantensoorten. Uit de analyse van de artikelen kwam naar voren dat populaire en kwaliteitskranten regelmatig van elkaar verschillen wat betreft de hoeveelheid waarin frames voorkomen. De krantensoorten vertoonden daarentegen veel overeenkomsten in de wijze waarop de frames worden gebruikt en dus de manier van schrijven over de vluchtelingencrisis. Dit wijst op zowel diversiteit in als institutionalisering van de Nederlandse kranten. Inzoomend op de specifieke frames waren er twee hoofdbevindingen zichtbaar: het menselijkheidsframe bleef constant aanwezig en kan hiermee bijdragen aan een pro-vluchtelingenhouding. Aan de andere kant nam over tijd berichtgeving die negatieve elementen van de vluchtelingencrisis uitlicht toe via het wij-zij frame, het economisch frame en het sociale onrustframe. Deze kant vormt juist voeding voor het anti-vluchtelingenkamp. Uit deze twee tegengestelde ontwikkelingen kan worden opgemaakt dat de berichtgeving over de vluchtelingencrisis mogelijk bijdraagt aan de polarisatie van het debat hierover.","['framing', 'vluchtelingen', 'populaire en kwaliteitskranten', 'Nederland', 'polarisatie']"
Toveren of Spiegelen,S. Vijgen,2016-06-19,"['F.J.J. van Hest', 'A.F.M. Krijnen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In de masterthesis ‘Toveren of Spiegelen’ wordt gepoogd om door middel van een casestudy naar het
realityprogramma Boer Zoekt Vrouw inzicht te verschaffen in de werkelijkheidsclaim van het televisiegenre
reality-tv. Voorgaand wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar reality-tv heeft zich voornamelijk gericht op
de (al dan niet waarheidsgetrouwe) representatie van specifieke bevolkingsgroepen en op de culturele of
geografische representatie van verschillende landen. In deze studie worden de bovengenoemde aspecten
echter gecombineerd. De representatie van een specifieke bevolkingsgroep (de boerenbevolking)
gecombineerd met de representatie van een nationale identiteit (de Hollandse cultuur) maakt Boer Zoekt
Vrouw tot een interessante case om de complexiteit van de representatie van ‘de werkelijkheid’ in reality-tv
te bestuderen. Om inzicht te verschaffen in de manier waarop de ‘werkelijkheid’ van het Nederlandse
platteland en boerenleven in Boer Zoekt Vrouw in beeld wordt gebracht, wordt de visuele laag van het
programma middels een inhoudsanalyse geanalyseerd. De onderzoeksvraag die hierbij centraal staat luidt:
Hoe wordt het Nederlandse platteland en het boerenleven in de visuele laag van het reality-tv programma
Boer Zoekt Vrouw gerepresenteerd? Allereerst wordt het wetenschappelijke debat over de
werkelijkheidsclaim van reality-tv in kaart gebracht aan de hand van de concepten representatie, televisie
en reality-tv. Vervolgens wordt de representatie van het boerenleven en platteland in Boer Zoekt Vrouw
door middel van een semiotische analyse onderzocht. Op basis van deze bevindingen kan worden
geconcludeerd dat dit gebeurt door middel van uitvergroting, omdraaiing, ontkenning en reflectie van de
werkelijkheid. De eerste drie vormen van representatie geven aanleiding tot een meer constructivistische
definitie van reality-tv: de werkelijkheid wordt in dit genre niet waarheidsgetrouw gerepresenteerd maar
vervormd en gemanipuleerd. De laatste vorm van representatie duidt echter op een meer reflectieve
definitie van reality-tv: de werkelijkheid wordt niet getoverd maar gespiegeld. In Boer Zoekt Vrouw
overheersen de uitvergroting, omdraaiing en ontkenning van de werkelijkheid. Het Nederlandse platteland
en boerenleven worden gerepresenteerd als rurale idylle, terwijl de werkelijkheid vaak veel minder
romantisch is. Toch is het echter ook zo dat Boer Zoekt Vrouw bepaalde aspecten van het platteland en
boerenleven op een realistische manier representeert. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat er in Boer Zoekt
Vrouw sprake is van zowel ‘toveren’ als ‘spiegelen’ (wetende dat het toveren de overhand heeft), waardoor
reality-tv moet worden opgevat als een tv-genre dat bestaat uit reflectie én manipulatie van de
werkelijkheid. Bovendien laat deze studie zien dat de Nederlandse Publieke Omroep haar maatschappelijke
missie in het geval van Boer Zoekt Vrouw niet bewaarheidt en juist bijdraagt aan de handhaving van
bestaande vooroordelen over het platteland en boerenleven. Het programma construeert een overwegend
onrealistisch beeld van het 21e eeuwse boerenleven en platteland.","['Representatie', 'Televisie', 'Reality-tv', 'Rurale idylle', 'Platteland', 'Boerenleven', 'Semiotiek']"

between (rock) musicians and the socialist ideology, this study delineates the ideological/
repressive state-apparatuses in the case of Romanian socialism (1965-1989). In addition
to investigating such apparatuses of creative control (e.g., the Securitate, the Agitprop
branch, but also ideological committees of the party), the present paper explores the role
of (sub)cultural agents (such as rock musicians and the countercultural youth) and their
efforts in navigating the hegemonic ideology. Drawing on archival sources that comprise
nearly 13,000 pages, this delineation throws considerable light on broader sociological
debates such as the role of musicians in totalitarian settings (Linz, 2000; Haraszti, 1988). A
two-fold relationship ensues in the case of socialist Romania: firstly, one of compromise
and duplicity, and, secondly, one of (symbolic) resistance. Ultimately, this study adds to the
ongoing literature concerning the dissident configuration of countercultural youth
movements in the Eastern bloc (Furlong & Guidikova, 2001; Risch, 2015). In the present
case, music leads to the formation of entourages which practice anti-proletarian rituals,
such as the ones constituted by csöves and punks. With the overall Romanian music
scene failing to form a coherent movement of resistance, most musicians become
labourers for the greater, collective good as a result of maintaining a self-sufficient,
subservient position toward the state.","['popular music under socialism', 'Althusserian state-apparatus', 'countercultural practice', 'censorship', 'archival records analysis']"

Kersten']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis focuses on the choices the teachers made concerning their role and their chosen materials in the arts education project ateliers in school and its influence on the learning effects of arts education. It is built on the social-constructive view of learning as a process between teachers, students and the materials (Lenz Taguchi et al, 2010; Frederiksen, 2011) and the theory of Harland et all (2000) which categorizes the learning effects of arts education. Inspired by these views the following research question was proposed: How do the role of the teacher and the chosen materials influence the learning effects of the arts education project ateliers in school?
The literature explores the theories of social-constructivism and experience while focusing on early childhood arts education and, specifically, the Reggio Emilia approach. The role of materials in the learning process is discussed and these are declared as essential for children’s learning. Lastly, the theory of learning as a process between teachers, students and materials is explored and the learning effects of the arts will be discussed.
Throughout the analysis several patterns concerning the aims of the atelier, the role of the teacher and the choice in materials for both the ateliers were discovered. Each pattern had its own effect on the atelier and corresponded to the discussed theories. Through several observed examples in both the ateliers it became clear that the learning effects were influenced by the different patterns that were discovered. Several learning effects, which corresponded to the theory of Harland et all (2000), were observed in the atelier of Punt 5. The most visible were enjoyment, gaining knowledge about the fine arts and the development of technical skills, experimentation and associating with their own experiences. In the case of the atelier of the Wilgenstam this were joy, experimentation, associating with their own experiences and collaborations.

Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Using a quasi-experimental research design in combination with a pre-test and post-test design, this explorative study aimed to find the differences between the interactive medium persuasive game and the non-interactive medium video, with respect to the final feeling of persuasion of the media user. Playing games still has an unwarranted negative connotation, while at the same time studies claim that digital games become more popular among youngsters young adults. Previous studies found out that the persuasive power of digital games can be used in a positive way, as some studies found out that interactivity has a positive effect on persuasion, and can contribute to educational or behavioral outcomes. In addition, the interactivity can influence the process of identification with the main character, which could reinforce the feeling of persuasion. For this present study, in total 161 students of the fifth grade of pre-university education from the age 16 to 18 years old participated. One condition (N=87) had to play the persuasive game Against All Odds, the other condition (N=74) had to watch an edited recorded game play of the same game, which is considered as the video. Against All Odds is a game in which the player takes over the role of a refugee, and therefore represents a current pressing issue. The participants had to fill in a questionnaire before and after the media usage, of which the outcome measures were; Knowledge about refugees, perspective on learning, willingness to help, identification based on similarities, identification based on embodied presence, source credibility and feeling of persuasion. The results show that people felt more persuaded after playing the game, than after watching the video. Also, the identification process with respect to embodied presence was higher after playing the game than after watching the video. However, the identification process based on similarities was higher after watching the video. Moreover, the study showed that even though the participants felt persuaded, they did not seem to be persuaded, as the effects between pre-test and post-test, per condition based on knowledge, perspective on learning, and willingness to help in most cases decreased. Future research is needed to identify the causes of these interesting, but unexpected results. But following the results of this results, it can be concluded that the persuasive power must not yet be underestimated.","['Persuasive games', 'persuasion', 'Interactivity', 'Identification', 'Willingness to help', 'Attitude change']"
"Flipchart, Pebble and Pro-test sign",M. Verdijk,2016-06-08,"['T.P. Franssen', 'N. Komarova']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In recent times more and more audiences have turned from spectators into users and play an active role in shaping certain art practices. Non-human actors such as objects and materials are active agents in transforming, informing and obscuring collaborations between artists and their audiences. Particularly in recent forms of social art practices, or ‘dialogical art’, materials and spaces are used as vessels of communication, rather than transformed into autonomous art objects. This change in agency of all the stakeholders in the art production process demands another way of looking at materials. 
In this paper the ruru huis, a project by the Indonesian art collective ruangrupa in Arnhem the Netherlands, serves as a case study to investigate the agency of objects and materials in a social art practice. Whereas previous studies of cultural production have been mainly focused on social factors within cultural production, this paper takes a socio-material perspective based on ideas such as the actor-network theory of Bruno Latour to explore how objects and materials may form an active part in collaborative processes. Using an object-oriented methodology through participant observation, this research analysed many different configurations that occurred in the ruru huis. From these observations three different categories are identified in regard to how objects and materials are being used: 1) facilitating, 2) operative, and 3) evidential. Subsequently all three functions relate to inclusiveness and active participation in different ways. While some objects are important actors because of their familiar or inconspicuous functioning, others enhance usership through ambiguity. Moreover we have found that many objects and materials in the ruru huis were often incomplete, shapeless, nondescript or empty on purpose. 
Therefore, this paper suggests that within a social art practice, the agency of objects and materials become more visible precisely when they are slightly antagonistic or dysfuntional. In the case of the ruru huis, this ‘friendly antagonism’ was at times successful and at other times less effective in creating temporary communities and dialogue.","['actor-network theory', 'objects', 'materiality', 'agency', 'social art practice', 'antagonism', 'usership', 'hospitality', 'audience participation', 'collaboration', 'ruangrupa', 'ruru huis', 'temporary communities', 'sonsbeek ’16 transACTION']"

With over 100 million users streaming music on Spotify, the service is becoming one of the major ways music is consumed in the 21st century. Yet as of now research on music streaming is relatively scarce. Not surprising considering the rapid growth music streaming experienced in a relatively short time. This research is therefore predominately explorative as it provides a new perspective on how Spotify is used by its users by looking at user created playlists. Personal playlists are created out of an almost endless amount of music, all digitally available on Spotify. Nothing is physically owned like a CD or a vinyl. 
These playlists can be created based on any criteria the user desires. Whether that is an overview of your favorite songs, playlists based on moods or activities, playlists created for parties, for a road trip, or whatever you want. But what do these created playlists mean to the streamer who made them? With the following research question this research gives an insight into this process: How does the playlist creation process take place and what meanings do streamers associate with the music on their playlists? By conducting twelve semi structured in-depth interviews with Spotify users, this research explores what kind of playlists streamers make and what those playlists mean to them. With an equal gender distribution and a diverse age range among the interviewees, an equal amount of diverse reasons for creating a playlist were observed.

The Morality of Music,I.N. Baumann,2016-06-08,"['F.J.J. van Hest', 'C.J.M. van Eijck']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The aim of this master thesis was to learn about the concept of moral self-licensing in
the domain of arts and culture. Therefore, this thesis looked at both, in-domain as well
as cross-domain moral licensing and compared high and low culture in the domain of
music. The research question this thesis tried to answer was thus to what extent moral
self-licensing occurs in the domain of classical and popular music. In order for a moral
licensing action to happen, the preceding action has to be evaluated as morally good. As
no other research on moral licensing has been conducted yet in the cultural field, first it
had to be determined what general reasons there are to evaluate an action as moral. A
literature review of previous research on the topic revealed that there are three main
reasons as to when an action is evaluated as being moral: the action is perceived to have
beneficial effects for one’s health or physique in general, the action improves one’s selfesteem,
or the action is believed to enhance how one is perceived by others. If an action
is perceived as fulfilling one or more of these criteria, then it is possible that it will evoke
a moral licensing action. For this thesis it was assumed that music could be ascribed
with all three of those triggering reasons. Therefore this thesis conducted a laboratory
experiment in order to find out if whether listening to music would indeed trigger a
licensing effect and if this effect differed in its extent for classical and popular music. The
data was then analysed by means of various statistical tools. It was found that the
consumption of popular music does not trigger a moral licensing effect, neither indomain
nor cross-domain. Listening to classical music as well did not result in indomain
moral licensing; it did however evoke cross-domain moral licensing. This thesis
therefore found statistical evidence that the consumption of classical music triggers a
moral self-licensing effect. With its findings and by adding a new field to the scientific
discourse, this thesis might contribute to the research on the concept of moral selflicensing
which is conducted in various fields.","['moral self-licensing', 'cultural consumption', 'classical and popular music', 'cross-domain', 'in-domain']"
Facilitating enriched learning experience in instrumental classical music practice in the century of digitalization,M.

Much of studying can be done in online environments, which means that blended learning has a growing importance in higher education. However, there are studies that are dependent on present being and bodily learning which for example, is the predominant way of learning in performing arts studies. Utilization of digital tools in individual instrumental classical music practice is the main concern of this research. In particular, this study is looking for an answer to the question, how do digital tools facilitate enriched learning experience in individual practices among the instrumentalists in the classical music department at Codarts, Rotterdam? In order to have an ‘umbrella’ term for the three concepts: engagement, ownership and in- depth learning, the enriched learning experience term was created. Questionnaires (n=74) and interviews were used to answer this question. It was found that digital tools are used by many students in their individual learning and practice, but the correlation analysis showed that they are not completely facilitating the enriched learning experience. However, there were some other significant findings. The advancement in studies impacts students’ engagement and owning a smartphone facilitates ownership and in depth- learning. Furthermore, being part of online study groups facilitates the study engagement and in- depth learning. In sum, I will demonstrate that students who own a smartphone, play a woodwind instrument, involve in online study groups, and are either on their last year of Bachelor’s or the first year of Master’s studies experience most likely  the enriched learning experience.","['performing arts', 'enriched learning experience', 'blended learning', 'digital tools', 'classical music study']"

It appeared that the aesthetic aspect is the most important aspect in all online reviews. Moreover artist affiliation is important in the evaluation of opera and pop performances. Group affiliation was an important aspect for all three performing arts genres. Social interaction was most important for pop reviews, indicating how pop concerts are important in signalling social standing.

The Madhubani paintings adorning the walls of a house have been stripped off their original meanings, serving merely as an aesthetic addition to a house’s décor. Hence, as Crane (2002) asserts, it becomes necessary to question what is ‘local’ in this era of globalisation.","['globalisation', 'deterritorialisation', 'commodification', 'circuits', 'India']"
The Markthal Illuminated,L.A. Smit,2016-06-08,"['S. van Ginhoven', 'A. Mignosa']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The Markthal has been an architectural focus point of Rotterdam since 2014. Although millions of people visit each year, reports of dissatisfied vendors reach the news regularly. This research seeks to find whether there are differences between the intentions of the developers of the Markthal and the perceptions of vendors and visitors concerning the indoor food market and the architecture of the building. In doing so, connecting these two aspects of the building to the concepts of food as cultural good, city branding and flagship architecture. As follows, the main research question is: To what extent has the Markthal as an indoor food market and an architectural icon in Rotterdam fulfilled the intentions developers had when it was established, according to vendors and visitors? 
By interviewing members of the developing side and distributing surveys to vendors and visitors, intentions and perceptions of both sides are uncovered, and analyzed using coding and descriptive statistics. The research shows that, although the architecture of the building has fulfilled its intentions of impacting the image of Rotterdam and giving the newly developed Laurenskwartier a ‘face’, the indoor food market is suffering from the high number of infrequent visitors. Because of the cultural good characteristics of the products for sale in the market hall, personal relationships and trust between vendors and visitors are necessary for the market to flourish. Therefore, the intention of creating a food market for a broad audience of Rotterdammers has failed to be realized in the development of the Markthal. It is up to the managing parties of the Markthal to decide whether the Markthal will be further developed to be of service of infrequent visitors and tourists, or whether the indoor food market will be transformed into a place where Rotterdammers come to purchase their daily groceries.","['Market halls', 'Rotterdam', 'Flagship architecture', 'Cultural goods', 'Intentions and perceptions']"
Financing the arts - Why is it difficult to move from one mode of financing to another?,M.C. Ricketts,2016-06-08,"['A. Klamer', 'E.M.M.P. Loots']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the changing funding environment, where a decline in unearned income is seen, arts organisations must increasingly align and meet the demands of a more diverse range of stakeholders in order to strive for their mission. The ability to effectively do so is argued to derive from the adaptability and alignment of an organisations culture, both externally, with customers and funders, and internally, within the organisation. Applying the Value Based Approach (Klamer, 2015), this thesis thus seeks to explore the challenges faced when shifting from one mode of financing to another, considering the influence of an organisations culture, values, and dominant logic, on their wider organisational and financing strategy. This new theoretical model has, to the best of my knowledge, not yet been applied to this topic and thus contributes to the academic field. Following an explorative approach, this comparative multiple-case study research design employs three qualitative research methods: content analysis, a short questionnaire, and 10 semi-structured interviews, in three organisations. Set in the context of Rotterdam the three case organisations are: Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, International Film Festival Rotterdam, and Museum Rotterdam. The findings highlight that the dominant logic, the predominant sphere (the governmental, market, or social) in which the organisation operates, often seen to derive from the sphere in which the organisation was designed to realise its artistic and financial values, guides the case organisations financing approach which in turn makes the shift to realise financial values in other spheres challenging. In addition, the observations suggest increasing similarities between financial values in the governmental and market sphere as the shift to realise more sources of funds through the market sphere appears a more comfortable transition than that of the social sphere.","['Organisational values', 'organisational culture', 'financing', 'Value Based Approach', 'change']"
Being creative with commerce,B.J. van der Linde,2016-06-08,"['A. Klamer', 'A. Do Carmo']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research aims to explore how artists and designers in the Dutch creative industries differ in their attitudes and practices towards the realisation of cultural and financial values. Creative education graduates relatively often become self-employed and at art academies a growing awareness of the importance of entrepreneurship for a career in the creative industries can be observed. In the Dutch creative industries a large number of artists and designers are active as entrepreneurs. Standard definitions of entrepreneurship do not provide sufficient insight into the actual practices of entrepreneurs in the creative industries. The value-based approach to economics, developed by Prof. Dr. Arjo Klamer, is presented as an alternative to standard economic theory. This approach assumes that financial values are instrumental to the realisation of personal, social, societal and cultural values. Furthermore these values are realised in the oikos, social, cultural, governance and market spheres. Seen from this perspective cultural entrepreneurship is defined as the realisation of both cultural and financial values. For the purposes of this research 8 semi-structured interviews with recent art graduates from the Willem de Kooning academy in Rotterdam and 8 semi-structured in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs in the Dutch creative industries were conducted. The expectations that graduates have of an entrepreneurial career in the creative industries are linked to the experiences of the entrepreneurs in the creative industries. All of the respondents are committed to the creative process and see entrepreneurship essentially as an instrument to realise cultural values. This research finds that the practices of entrepreneurs in the creative industries go beyond the market and governance sphere. Their entrepreneurship mainly happens outside of the market sphere and is focussed on the social and cultural sphere. Cultural values are realised in social networks within the social and cultural sphere. The willingness to contribute to social and cultural goods, such as art and design, in the social and cultural sphere seems to be a prerequisite for the realisation of values in the market sphere.","['Art education', 'Graduates', 'Artists', 'Designers', 'Creative industries', 'Cultural entrepreneurship', 'Value-based approach to economics']"

Over the last 15 years almost all cinemas in the United States have been digitized. Instead of projecting on 35mm projectors, movies are now screened in a digital media format. The thesis develops key characteristics of digitized exhibition which are put in context with previous innovations in the theatrical exhibition market. The dataset for the empirical analysis utilizes weekly box office reports of the United States for a period of 15 years and additional data about the theatrical market of the United States. The emphasis of the empirical analysis lies in investigating the supply dynamics of the exhibition industry. The supply dynamics are defined through the product life cycle and the volatility in the programming of cinemas. Furthermore, effects on the market concentration according to gross revenues in the box office are analyzed. 
 Empirical results indicate that the digital transition in the exhibition industry has had a positive effect on the supply dynamics for motion pictures produced by major studios. Independent movies are not profiting from digitized exhibition yet which is also reflected in an increasing market concentration of the motion picture sector in the United States.","['digital cinema', 'motion picture industry', 'theatrical exhibition', 'innovation']"

However, this applies more to the Nederhop records that were sold physically, downloaded or streamed, rather than the Nederhop records that received airplay by the radio institutions.

Clusters & Institutions,L. Fuligni,2016-06-08,"['M. Lavanga', 'A. Mignosa']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Creative clusters are now a popular topic in academic literature and a lot has been written on the positive externalities that emerge from the spatial co-location of similar firms in the same geographic area. At the same time though, academic literature has not yet provided strong empirical evidence on why clusters develop in certain regions. Scholars most often attribute the causes of the development of a cluster to two factors, namely specialisation and human capital. However, a third, less explored approach considers institutions as an equally important determinant of a cluster’s development. The argument of this thesis is in line with the institutional economist perspective and bases its scope on Amin & Thrift’s notion of institutional thickness (1995). In other words, it maintains that the emergence of formal and informal (alternatively, de jure and de facto) institutions is not merely a consequence of agglomeration economies, but rather a key determinant in stimulating the endogenous potential of a region. In particular, the present thesis offers an account of how an increase in institutional thickness affects the economic performance of a creative cluster in terms of buzz and internal interactions, knowledge creation: spillovers and innovation, labour market, and openness and external interactions. This research adopts a mixed methods approach and focuses on Italian fashion clusters, which in the beginning of the 1990s started experiencing severe economic problems and losing competitiveness on the global markets, despite their high levels of specialisation and human capital. In particular, it investigates the economic impacts of Apulia Fashion Makers, a de facto institution that coordinates the activities of a fashion industrial district in the South of Italy, a region often disregarded by academic literature in the field and considered backward in terms of both economic performance and social capital. The analysis is then completed by comparing Apulia Fashion Makers with Consorzio della Moda, a similar, but more established de facto institution that is located in the Northeast of the country and that is considered as a best practice by AFM members. This thesis finds positive results for each indicator and concludes that by increasing its learning-base competitiveness and local and global buzz, institutional thickness is able to shape the long run sustainability of a creative cluster.","['creative cluster', 'institutional thickness', 'buzz', 'knowledge creation', 'cluster openness']"

Creative entrepreneurs are individuals developing their own enterprises, mixing both business and artistic skills. They are employing their creative talents to produce and sell innovative and creative products on various markets. Although creative entrepreneurs would prefer to remain independent, they still rely on different social actors to extend their businesses. In practice, they often co-operate with other individuals from the creative industries such as artists, entrepreneurs or intermediaries. However, the establishment of collaborations is not an easy task. Creative entrepreneurs must therefore cultivate a strong social capital. Increasing or stabilizing their social capital requires to work on their personal network.

Westerse doelen. Na de bloederige aanslagen in Parijs op 13 november 2015 ontstond in
veel media de discussie of dusdanige aanslagen nou wel of niet met de islam en/of moslims
te maken hebben. Premier Mark Rutte stelde duidelijk dat Nederland in oorlog is met IS en
niet met de moslims of de islam zelf. Maar jongerenimam Yassin Elforkani was het hier niet
mee eens, volgens hem kan je niet blijven zeggen dat de aanslagen niets met moslims en/of
de islam te maken hebben. Dit onderzoek gaat nader in op deze scheiding tussen moslims
en/of de islam enerzijds en terrorisme anderzijds. Want worden moslims nog wel objectief
geportretteerd in de media? En in hoeverre hebben aanslagen van IS hier invloed op?
Antwoorden op deze vragen zijn geformuleerd door middel van zowel een automatische als
een handmatige, kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse. Er zijn 900 artikelen gecodeerd uit De
Telegraaf, Het Algemeen Dagblad, de Volkskrant, Het NRC Handelsblad en Trouw. Uit het
onderzoek bleek dat er na aanslagen meer wordt geschreven over de islam en/of moslims.
Ook worden de islam en/of moslims na een aanslag vaker in verband gebracht met
terrorisme en wordt vaker gebruik gemaakt van een conflictframe. Opmerkelijk is dat na
aanslagen in nieuwsberichten niet vaker sprake is van othering en discursieve framing. Ook
worden moslims niet vaker aan het woord gelaten in de nieuwsberichten na de aanslagen.
De aanslagen in Parijs laten telkens een spike zien in de resultaten en deze brachten een
sterkere verandering in de berichtgeving over de islam en/of moslims teweeg. De
bevindingen laten zien dat in de journalistiek de nieuwswaardentheorie en objectiviteit nog
steeds hoog in het vaandel staan. Vervolgonderzoek zou verder kunnen kijken dan de
eventuele aanwezigheid van frames in nieuwsberichten en zou zich ook kunnen focussen op

Beeldvorming van mindfulness in de media,E. Peper,2016-06-01,"['B.C.M. Kester', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Van de buurvrouw tot Emma Watson: iedereen lijkt er tegenwoordig mee bezig te zijn. De boeken over het onderwerp liggen veelvuldig in de schappen, er komen  steeds meer trainingscentra en de kosten voor zo’n training of mindfulness-workshop worden zelfs vergoed door de verzekeraars. Waar het onderwerp vroeger als ‘zweverig’ gezien werd wegens de meditatieve lifestyle, zijn nu zelfs de meest nuchtere mensen betrokken bij het ‘leven in het nu’. 
Dat ‘leven in het nu’ is nog maar één van de kenmerken van mindfulness, ook wel beschreven als een eenvoudige vorm van meditatie of levenshouding, die je aandacht bij het moment houdt. Het gaat er hierbij om dat je je even niet mee laat slepen door de constante stroom van gedachten in je hoofd. Als je ze gewoon als een trein voorbij laat gaan zonder er een oordeel aan te hangen, word je een stuk rustiger. Voor de historische Boeddha van 2500 jaar geleden was dit een belangrijk element om de ultieme kalmte en harmonie, ofwel: nirwana (letterlijk ‘bekoeldheid’) te behalen (Brookhuis, 2011). De oosterse invloeden van mindfulness zijn onder andere door monniken als de uit Vietnam afkomstige zenleraar Thich Nhat Hanh in het Westen beland. Een andere belangrijkere grondlegger van mindfulness in het Westen (met name in de gezondheidszorg) is de Amerikaanse psycholoog Jon Kabat-Zinn. Hij is ervan overtuigd dat meditatie en de kwaliteit van aandacht een cruciale rol kunnen spelen in het genezingsproces van mensen. Mindfulness werd op die manier gevormd op basis van een samensmelting van oosterse wijsheden en westerse psychologie. 										Maar niet alleen in de gezondheidszorg is mindfulness aanwezig, tegenwoordig ook op de werkvloer, in het onderwijs of gewoon bij je thuis. Vooral sinds de ontkerkelijking heeft doorgezet, en de maatschappij steeds individualistischer werd, groeide de behoefte voor nieuwe spirituele trends en daarmee de populariteit van een ‘methode’ als mindfulness. De media hebben in dit popularisatieproces ook een invloed. Elke dag lezen we berichten en zien we beelden uit de samenleving. Ze bereiken ons via diverse mediakanalen zoals de krant, televisie, radio, het internet en hebben een groot effect op hoe wij denken over de wereld waar we op dat moment in leven. De media spelen dus een grote rol in de beeldvorming van ontwikkelingen en verschijnselen, maar niet altijd op de meest werkelijke manier. Zo kunnen de media er voor kiezen om bepaalde (nieuws)elementen juist wel of juist niet te belichten (De Vreese, 2005). Dit proces wordt framing genoemd. Dat mindfulness, als opkomende trend in de westerse cultuur, als geaccepteerde praktijk in de samenleving wordt ervaren, zou volgens deze laatste theorie het gevolg kunnen zijn van de steeds groter groeiende media-invloed, omdat het publiekelijk perspectief dat wij hebben tegenover verschijnselen als mindfulness voor een groot deel gevormd worden door de media. In dit onderzoek wordt dan ook geanalyseerd in welke termen er in de media over mindfulness gesproken wordt, en of het überhaupt nog wel over de oosterse filosofieën gaat, en met name het boeddhisme, die ten grondslag liggen aan deze nieuwe trends. In andere woorden, in hoeverre is mindfulness verwesterd? Welke specifieke bronnen (ook wel ‘primary definers’) worden aangehaald in de media die het discours rondom mindfulness definiëren? Ofwel: hoe dragen de media bij aan het populariseren en acceptabel maken van een oorspronkelijk oosters fenomeen in een westerse samenleving?","['mindfulness', 'boeddhisme', 'ontkerkelijking', 'new age', 'individualisering', 'popularisering', 'beeldvorming', 'framing', 'psychologie', 'lifestyle journalistiek', 'hard nieuws', 'zacht nieuws', 'personalisering']"

Her Prospects of Mankind,M. Buddenbaum,2016-05-23,"['H.B. Harmsen', 'C.L.A. Willemse']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the final three years of her life, former U.S. First Lady, diplomat and pro-active pacifist,
Eleanor Roosevelt, hosted her own television series entitled: Prospects of Mankind on (foreign)
politics that appeared monthly from 1959 until her death in 1962. Television was rising in popularity
in the early 1960’s, and in an article of 1959 Eleanor Roosevelt had written about the special
opportunities of this medium, for which scholars concluded she apparently understood the medium as
much as she understood other media. Prior to the show, Eleanor Roosevelt broadcasted her voice via
the radio and was famous for her near-to-daily column My Day. Throughout her life, Eleanor
Roosevelt had built an international network of friends, political experts and world leaders, whom she
did not hesitate to invite for the topics of discussion in Prospects of Mankind. This unique
combination of journalistic and public skills, (inter)national fame and influential relations on screen,
was a conscious choice of producer Henry Morgenthau III.
Prospects of Mankind covered a wide variety of topics, but in order to be able to say
something about how Eleanor Roosevelt used the medium television, choosing a topic she strongly
believed in and wholeheartedly promoted would most likely give insights in her approach. Therefore,
the relatively little researched views of Eleanor Roosevelt with regard to the United Nations was
selected, in the knowledge that she noted this to be ‘her most important work’. Therefore, this thesis
questioned: How did Eleanor Roosevelt present her views on the United Nations in her television
series Prospects of Mankind and from what can this be explained?
For the first part of this thesis, the leading audio-visual primary source (the Prospects of
Mankind series) and PoM correspondence on the production process were analyzed. In the second
part, the analysis of just one episode, nr. 16 which Eleanor Roosevelt entitled: ‘Congo: Challenge to
the United Nations,’ was more extensively analyzed in the form of a case study. The same set of
questions was applied to the analysis of this episode, but in contrast to the analyses of part I, extended
with a contextual background of the Congo Crisis from 1960-1961, and the production process of this
particular episode hosted in April 1961. Important for the narrative of this story, the time of
production was in the middle of the cold war between U.S. and the USSR. In 1960, U.S. containment
politics were applied in more and more countries, including the newly independent Congo. While the
Congo was struggling for internal unity, both the U.S. and the USSR supported factions within the
country trying to increase their own influence in the region, with the aim to spread their ideologies.
The Congolese Premier Kasavubu and Prime Minister Lumumba took the initiative to call upon the
United Nations. In pursuit of international cooperation and world peace, the UN intervened.
With the combination of the DVD Collection and the transcripts and general correspondence
on the show, this thesis had the opportunity to reconstruct how Eleanor Roosevelt’s views on the
United Nations were presented throughout PoM, Through the analysis of a leading audio-visual
primary source, the way(s) Eleanor Roosevelt presented her views in Prospects of Mankind have come
to light.","['Eleanor Roosevelt', 'United Nations', 'Television', 'Congo Crisis', 'Media', 'U.S. History', 'U.S.', 'Foreign Politics', 'Cold War', 'Prospects of Mankind']"

Rotterdam is increasingly popular for tourists to visit and for companies to settle in. Regularly, this city appears in the media for its attractive atmosphere and modern architectural environment. Rotterdam is known as the ‘city of architecture’ in the Netherlands and actively started promoting this image through city marketing strategies several years ago. The motivation to use city marketing strategies is to regenerate the city and make it a more vibrant and economically active place. The city council is investing in city marketing to attract more tourists and companies to the city. In policy statements Rotterdam claims that the architecture is also valuable for the residents to create an attractive living environment. The concepts in the policy of Rotterdam concerning residents are creating identity, urban regeneration and image creation. These concepts are studied in the theoretical part of this thesis and are also reflected in the empirical part. This thesis aims to reveal the importance and value of developing iconic architecture in Rotterdam for the residents of this city. A quantitative (survey) research method was performed to collect data amongst the residents of Rotterdam and the Rijnmond region. The results support the assumption that residents appreciate the new iconic architecture in Rotterdam and that it makes the city a more attractive place to reside. This is mainly a passive appreciation; residents are rarely involved in architectural events and activities. The increasing popularity and amount of tourists is experienced as a positive element in the livability of the city center. Residents do fear to lose ‘their city’ and uniqueness when tourist rates become too high.","['Iconic Architecture', 'City Marketing', 'Urban Economics', 'Public behavior', 'Place Identity', 'Image', 'Urban Regeneration', 'Rotterdam']"

There were many individuals, informal groups and official organizations, all housed in an overarching concept called the civil rights movement, which opted for the full elimination of racist laws and practices – along the lines of the ‘Separate but Equal’ doctrine, dating from the end of the 19th century – in the United States. Although they greatly differed in means, goals and backgrounds, all members of the civil rights movement raised their voices to reach a common goal: reducing the social, economic and legal inequalities between blacks and whites in the country in which, according to its Declaration of Independence, ‘all men were created equal’. In spite of Johnson’s ambitions to eradicate racism and poverty through his Great Society Project, many poor African-Americans still suffered from unequal rights in the field of voting, education, job opportunities and police protection. An important contributor to this persisting inequality was the growing American presence in Vietnam. The enormous amount of money that was needed to finance the Vietnam War choked off Johnson’s ambitions to narrow the gap between black and white in the USA, as the president himself would later admit. ‘That bitch of a war,’ Johnson recalled toward the end of his life, ‘killed the lady I really loved – the Great Society.'

This thesis focuses on the connection between civil rights, the war in Vietnam and the Johnson Administration (1963-1969). Since the civil rights organizations – of which the most influential five will be discussed in this research – were partially dependent on the federal government for reaching progress, a compelling question comes to mind: how did the Johnson Administration, which governed the United States for a period of over five years, handle the complex intertwinements between its actions in Southeast-Asia and the groups that were preoccupied with the nation’s most pressing domestic issue? How were the opinions on the conflict in Vietnam and the treatment of the Big Five of civil rights organizations related? Through a chronological, qualitative analysis of these groups and their relationship with LBJ, this thesis aims to answer these questions.","['Vietnam War', 'civil rights movement', 'Lyndon Baines Johnson', 'Big Five', 'social history', 'race relations']"

The performance of contemporary art as an investment good,M. Kaasenbrood,2016-01-26,"['M. Vecco', 'F.R.R. Vermeylen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The art market has been the subject of academic research for decades. Research topics vary from art returns to the drivers of art prices to the relationship between the art market and the stock market. The limited accessibility of art sales data and the heterogeneity of artworks make it difficult to come to a conclusion on any of these issues. Scholars therefore come up with a variety of methods to overcome the data problems. One of these methods is an advanced application of the Hedonic Pricing method, called the Heckit model. This model decreases the selection bias that occurs in art market research by including non-sales in the sample. This thesis uses the Heckit model to obtain the Conceptual Art Index (CAI). The CAI is used to research the relationship between the Conceptual Art market and the stock market in the UK from January 2000 until October 2014. Prior researches have shown that there is a lagged relationship between the art market and financial markets. This thesis does not provide results that proof the existence of this relationship. The results show that there is no significant short-term relationship between the Conceptual Art market and the UK stock market. There is evidence indicating a long-term relationship, but the evidence is weak. Besides that, comparison of the CAI with an index obtained with a traditional Hedonic Pricing model shows that there is no significant selection bias occurring due to non-random selection. This latter result indicates that the Heckit model is not superior to the traditional Hedonic Pricing method. This thesis provides input for further research on the added value of the Heckit model as well as on the relationship between the art market and financial markets.","['Art index', 'Conceptual Art', 'Causal relationship', 'Financial markets', 'Heckit model', 'United Kingdom']"

“Zijn er verschillen in het begrijpen van de Kijkwijzer en regels die hiermee gepaard gaan tussen bioscoopbezoekers van verschillende culturele achtergronden en zo ja, op welke vlakken bestaan die verschillen dan en waardoor zijn deze verschillen te verklaren?”

Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd met een kwantitatieve methode. Er zijn ruim 200 enquêtes ingevuld, zowel online als offline. Door middel van het statistische verwerkingsprogramma SPSS zijn de gegevens verwerkt en zijn er verschillende analyses uitgevoerd, om te testen of er verschillen te vinden zijn tussen verschillende groepen. Er is gebleken dat mensen die zich verbonden voelen met een andere cultuur dan de Nederlandse, relatief beter weten wat Kijkwijzer precies doet. Uit het onderzoek blijkt ook dat ouderen en hoogopgeleiden vaker een bioscoop bezoeken ter ontspanning. Ook blijkt dat oudere en Nederlandse respondenten zich meer verbonden voelen met Nederlandse films; de cultuur waarmee de respondenten zich verbonden voelen blijkt een bepalende factor. Voor de gehele populatie geldt dat de respondenten inhoudspictogrammen en leeftijdsaanduidingen even belangrijk vinden.

For last two decades, there is a slight upward gradient in the overall sex ratio of the population, but the persistently declining Child Sex ratio is a matter of concern, threatening a stable social set up in the country.
The surprising element remains that decline is unabated despite the fact that there is no dearth of policy interventions at Central and State level, aimed to tackle the ‘son-preference-daughter aversion’ culture through (a) punitive measures against foeticide and infanticide and (b) conditional cash transfer schemes for upbringing and promoting girl child. Additionally, many policies aimed to end gender discrimination, women empowerment etc. have also been launched in the country.
The most potent policy intervention at the level of Central Government is The Pre-conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Technique {PC & PNDT} Act (1994), which aims to regulate the use of Ultrasound technology and prohibit its misuse in sex determination, leading to sex selective abortions. This research paper critically examines the extent to which this flagship policy intervention by Government of India has succeeded to address the burning issue of declining child sex ratio. To investigate this, paper has assessed implementation & monitoring mechanism and the capacity issues of the Act. The role of centuries old socio-cultural norms in whatever results the Act has produced, is also analysed.
This paper has shown that it is a case of ‘double whammy’ where the ineffective implementation, near absent monitoring and visible capacity gaps in all dimensions further exacerbated by overall socio-cultural (& gender) norms have rendered in partial success of the intervention.","['Sex Ratio at Birth', 'Child Sex Ratio', 'Foeticide (sex selective abortions)', 'Infanticide', 'Policy', 'Implementation', 'Monitoring', 'Capacity']"
The Missing Carrots and Sticks: Motivation and Accountability in the Polio Eradication Program of Pakistan,"Khan, Jahanzeb",2015-12-11,['Bergh  Sylvia'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Pakistan is one of the three countries left in the world where polio is still exists.
Non-eradication of polio from Pakistan is not only a healthcare issue for the
country itself but it is considered a threat to global health as the disease can be
transmitted to those countries that have already been given a polio free status.
Non-eradication of the disease in the context of Pakistan has become a complex
issue on account of multiple causes as reported by previous studies. However,
the role and performances of polio workers who actually administer the
vaccine have generally not been analysed properly. Since polio eradication
campaign is a human endeavour, the performance of polio workers cannot be
ruled out; this study, therefore, considers poor performance of polio workers,
as evident by the unsatisfactory campaign coverage of below than 80% and
emergence of polio cases consistently, as one of the very important causes of
non-eradication of the disease. The study finds very low level of motivation
among polio workers on account of factors such as insufficient and delayed
payment, improper security and capacity building issues along with poor accountability
due to informal induction mechanism of volunteer polio workers
to be adversely affecting the performance of staff. The study therefore recommends
formal induction mechanism, better social mobilization and decentralization
of financial powers for improvement in motivation and accountability
that will enhance the performance of polio workers and will ultimately result in
complete eradication of the disease from the country.","['Polio', 'Eradication', 'Pakistan', 'Motivation', 'Accountability', 'Capacity']"
The Interplay between Practices of Youth with Mobile Phone and Digital Capitalism. A Case Study of Kintampo Districts of Ghana,"Nuamah, Gifty Fosuaa",2015-12-11,['Huijsmans Roy'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The term ‘youth’ has been defined to mean ‘becomers’. This term connotes youth as vulnerable, innocent, irrational and dependent. Most studies on youth and mobile technologies have focused more on the construction of youth iden-tity with mobile technologies rather than on discourses between youth and the digital capitalism of companies that provide telecommunication services. This research explores how youthful performances with the use of mobile phone in-teract with the practices of telecommunication service providers in shaping each other’s practices in a market driven environment.
The research focused on the youth from the ages 12 to 25years owning a mobile phone in central Ghana. The study also examined responses from 3 tel-ecommunication service providers and the National Communications Authority in Ghana. The study adopted both quantitative and ethnographic qualitative ap-proaches.
Results from the study reveals that digital capitalism of telecommunication has an influence on youthful performances in terms of financing, ownership, privacy, gender and consumption. Results further showed that the youth are us-ing offers from telecommunication service providers in a way that negotiates benefits from the motives of telecommunication providers. This suggests an in-terplay between youthful practices and telecommunication providers with the use of mobile phone.
The findings are very important for further studies into the digital capitalism of telecommunication providers and mobile phone usage for the wellbeing and development of youth.","['telecommunication providers', 'youth', 'mobile phone', 'capitalism', 'culture', 'youthful performance', 'style']"
Remembering Wartime Violence Experiences Of Teachers And Students From Secondary Schools In Bogota,"Bermeo Osorio, Julian David",2015-12-11,['Hintjens  Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study is about the experiences of teachers and students in the production
of memory about past violence, and how they struggle to articulate these
memories with present concerns and their expectations about the future. In
doing this, they rely on some social discourses such as learning lessons from
the past which has the potential to offer a better future free from violence and
other social problems, an idea commonly attributed to the philosopher George
Santayana (1095). To find information about this I conducted research where
the voices of the participants are highlighted, and their ‘framings’ of the past
related to dominant ideas and a range of literature about collective remembering.
The goal is both to explore experiences, and to reflect on theorising about
the role of the past and of memory construction in the lives of educative actors.
One of the key findings is that when they refer to aspects of the past, these
actors do so to relate this to their present politics of everyday life. In consequence,
it is shown that memory interrelates with the past, the present and the
future and can be described as walking a thin line between these three temporal
dimensions. Those interviewed also considered that their work could contribute
to sustainable peace, but also insisted that structural violence required reforms
beyond a peace agreement, to tackle root causes of social injustice, by
reducing poverty and exclusion. The contribution of this research brings the
voices of these relevant social actors to the forefront with the understanding of
the contradictions, which impose an unusual context where the production of
memory has to coexist with different forms of mutually reinforced violence.","['Education', 'memory', 'collective remembering', 'violence', 'armed conflict', 'peace', 'Colombia', 'Bogota']"

the links between employment conditions and integration processes of
migrant workers. Analysing the narratives of Polish greenhouse workers in The
Hague/Westland region, this research tries to critically look at the precarious

Basing on the fact that there is a high mushrooming rate of care institutions in Uganda, the
reproduction of misery life among youth resettled from care institutions has become inevitable.
This study also shows how effects of institutionalization begins affecting children while still on
care and later magnifies when they exit and live on their own, limiting the existing social capital
which they give a justification for admitting children in these institutions.
The study also nuances the term used by the care institution, ‘resettled’ therefore arguing from
the findings that the youth were unsettled due to the lacking of social support networks, which
came out as the main challenge for the youths in independent living. Since this challenge and
others were rooted into their being institutionalized, the study therefore suggests de
institutionalizing and embrace alternative care so that that the cycle of these challenges can be
broken.","['Care Institutions', 'resettled youth', 'Institutionalizing', 'Alternative care', 'care givers']"
'Safe Israel and Peaceful Democratic Palestine': Discourses and Policies of Dutch Post-Oslo Development Aid in Palestine,"Zeidan, Ghada",2015-12-11,['Zarkov Dubravka'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research seeks to contribute to the academic debate on the politics of development aid in the context of violent conflict. It focuses on the Netherlands as a political and development actor in the post-Oslo context in Palestine, and attempts to understand and situate Dutch bilateral development aid policies in that specific context. It examines the convergence of Dutch foreign and development aid policies and investigates the historical and geopolitical dynamics underlying the specific policy choices. An in-depth examination of interrelated pol-icy discourses illuminates the politics of identity representations in constructing and legitimizing the policies of and discourses around Dutch development aid to Palestine. Analysing these discourses and Dutch framing of the concepts of ""conflict"", ""peace"", and “security”- and the interrelation between them in the Palestinian context- allows for an understanding of Dutch framing of Palestinian development needs and how that informs the specific policy choices. The study concludes that Dutch development policies in Palestine and policy discourses are specific political choices. It argues that this approach -- acting for ""peace"" and ""stability""-- fails to address the individual and collective injustices of the Israeli occupation, and the resulting violence and insecurities confronting Palestinian men and women. Consequently, it poses the question whether and to what extent such policy choices meet Palestinian development needs, or serve Palestinian security and social justice agendas under Israeli colonial occupation.","['Dutch development cooperation', 'aid', 'Oslo Accords', 'conflict', 'development', 'peace', 'security', 'occupation', 'Palestine', 'Israel', 'discourse', 'identity representations', 'framing']"
The Nexus between Commercialisation of Agricultural Land and Ethnic Conflict in Gambella and Benishangul-Gumuz Regional States of Ethiopia,"Gebresilassie, Melak Mengistab",2015-12-11,['Borras Saturnino M. Jr'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Ethnic conflict has been reinforced in Gambella and BG regions following the land grabbing process, because of ethnicity’s two edge role; first ethnicity provides the source of solidarity for organized action by articulating the impacts of the land grabbing. Secondly, ethnicity has been used as instrument of elites for rent seeking from the ongoing land grabbing process. In both cases, ethnically motivated interests lead to ethnic based conflicts.
Such instrumental stature has been strengthened by two interrelated factors: first the existing problematic state formation and structure associated with Ethiopia which is giving a space for manipulation. Secondly, the process of commercialization of agricultural land is creating new phenomenon such as competition over employment and power, migration , eviction, corruption, land renting, illegal settlement etc. such factors have been behind the overt and covert form of ethnic conflict between different ethnic groups.
However, it worth noting that there have not been violent outright ethnic conflict other than the Mejenger zone conflict in Gambella region. Most ethnic based conflicts are rather small, subtle and less organized.","['Land grab', 'Ethnic conflict', 'commercial agriculture', 'ethnic groups', 'indigenous peoples', 'Highlanders', 'state']"
"Young Motherhood: An explanation of the Rise of Teenage Pregnancies in Mutare Rural, Zimbabwe","Mukoyi, Jean",2015-12-11,['Heumann Silke'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This thesis specifically looks at the factors that have caused the rise in teenage
pregnancies in Mutare rural. It also analyses the sexual experiences of the
young mothers in a bid to explain the trends in unplanned pregnancy. Mutare
rural district was chosen as the study site because it is one of the districts with
high teenage pregnancy rates in Zimbabwe. The study employed a mixed
methods research approach. On the one hand quantitative data was collected
through document analysis of Sakubva district hospital’s admission registries of
April 2014 to April 2015 to show the trends of teenage pregnancies in Mutare
rural. From these records, this study found that there were seasonal trends in
teenage pregnancies in Mutare rural, with the highest peak noticed during festive
periods. Whilst on the other hand, qualitative data in the form of in-depth
interviews were carried out with young mothers who have given birth between
the ages of 15 to 19 years. Narratives from the interviews attributed the rise of
teenage pregnancies to the advent of diamond mining which transformed the
economic and social context of the Marange Community. The seasonal dimensions
of teenage pregnancies were a result of the sexual relationships which
were forged between the young women and the miners especially during
Christmas and New Year. However, not all teenage women fell pregnant to the
miners, others had relations with older men from the village and others from
boys their age. This signals cases of intergenerational relationships, peer pressure
and early marriage which are added factors to the rise of teenage pregnancy
in the area. The study found that for those teenage women involved with
the miners, the relationships were not only for financial gain but were also for
love, marriage and sexual gratification. These reasons were found to weaken
teenage women’s negotiation and bargaining power for safe sex.
Key informant interviews were carried out with representatives from 4
organisations, that is, Ministry of Health and Child welfare, Ministry of Labour
and Social Welfare, Plan International Zimbabwe and Youth Alive Zimbabwe.
The key informants provided additional knowledge since they have been
working to address teenage pregnancies in Mutare rural. Insight into the
organisation’s programs also provided the contextual background of this
thesis. The study used the concepts of gender and sexuality to analyse how the
discovery of diamonds in Marange contributed to the rise of teenage pregnancy
in the community. The central argument of the paper is that, whilst stakeholders
have implemented programmes using the ‘abstinence only’ approach, the
strategy is not only ineffective in addressing the needs of teenage women,
but it also bypasses the political economy of Marange and the different experiences
of young women as they negotiate with their sexuality. The results of
which has been the continued rise in teenage pregnancy in Mutare rural.","['Teenage pregnancy', 'diamond mining', 'sexuality', 'reproduction']"
The Vulnerable Livelihoods of Street Vendors in Uganda: A Case of Kampala Central Division.,"Nakibuuka, Margaret",2015-12-11,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study explored the extent to which the repressive policies exacerbate
street vendors’ vulnerability to poverty and examine their coping strategies in
Kampala Central Division (KCD). The study used a ‘mixed methodological
approach’ to undertake the research. The ‘business categorization’ as a theory
and ‘micro enterprise score card’ were used as a tool for business classification
of street vendors’ businesses in KCD, with income and expenditure levels,
Size of the business, working conditions, access to assets, ability to absorb risks
and business sustainability as indicators guiding the exercise. Moser’s Asset
Vulnerability Frame Work was adopted as an ‘analytical tool’ for data analysis
and identification of various assets that can facilitate street vendors’ livelihoods
in a challenging working environment. The study found that, street vendors
were differentiated, although a big number of them were ‘survivalist entrepreneurs’,
majority are women, very poor with limited capacity to save, reduce
family risks and invest to sustain their businesses. This is aggravated by repressive
street vending regulatory laws that perpetuate vendor’s working poverty
through deprivation of opportunity and freedom to operate business, characterized
by constant evictions and confiscation of goods. The paper argues that,
because street vendors are considered as homogenous businesspersons in
Kampala-Uganda, policy makers fail to design appropriate and feasible policies
in relation to the needs of concerns of specific strata thus exacerbating their
vulnerability to poverty and related risks. The main conclusion out of the study
is that the current law as implemented by KCCA to get street vendors out of
KCD is unjust and does more harm than good to the majority of the people,
but also the development of Kampala as a town. We thus recommend a more
street vendor friendly law, passed on basis of consultation with them, preceded
by a study to establish their different categories.","['street vending', 'street vendors', 'vulnerability', 'livelihoods', 'assets']"
"Anti-Human Trafficking Measures in Tigray, Ethiopia: A Human Rights-Based Perspective","Hailu, Gebreslassie Kiros",2015-12-11,['Arts Karin'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Human trafficking is the cause and consequence of human rights violation. This paper deals with measures of human trafficking undertaken in Sase’a Tsaedaemba and Atsibi Wonberta woredas in Tigray region, Ethiopia. These woredas are more affected by human trafficking than the other woredas of the region. The measures undertaken by the duty bearers to prevent human trafficking were analysed in light of the human rights-based perspective. The human rights-based principles empowerment, accountability and rule of law, non-discrimination and participation have been used as both a theoretical framework and a methodology in this paper. Most of the participants in the study agreed that peer pressure and unemployment are major causes of human trafficking in the studied woredas. Consequently, many young people are flooding into the Middle East and Gulf States where they face human rights violations such as torture, forced labour, imprisonment, disappearance, death and psychological and physical injury. A human rights-based perspective on measures against human trafficking recognizes victims of human trafficking as right holders who require support and assistance from the relevant duty bearers. In the case of Sase’a Tsaedaemba and Atsibi Wonberta woredas, the state fails to implement the international human rights principles and values relevant to victims of human trafficking. This is due to lack of capacity, commitment and good quality governance. The study results reveal that a human rights-based perspective against human trafficking is not well developed and practiced in Ethiopia. This research explains that a human rights-based perspective to human trafficking is required to address the major causes and consequences of human trafficking and to protect and empower victims and vulnerable groups.","['Human Trafficking', 'Human Rights-Based Perspective', 'Empowerment', 'Participation', 'Non-discrimination', 'Accountability', 'Rule of Law and Prosecution']"
Social Exclusionary Processes Leading to Child Marriages in Kamuli Uganda,"Namukose, Grace",2015-12-11,['Shehada Nahda'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Child marriage has been heavily frowned upon in Uganda and many other countries
because of the many social and health consequences related to it. International and
regional human rights conventions like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(UDHR), the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) all advocate against the practice as it
contravenes the human rights standards that govern the welfare of children. From a

The Paradox of Dutch Anti-Trafficking Policy: An Ethnographic Approach to how the B8 Scheme is Placing Foreign Survivors of Human Trafficking in a Perilous Situation,"Verboom, Nava Maria",2015-12-11,['Heumann Silke'],International Institute of Social Studies,"There are foreign women in the Netherlands who are vulnerable because they are survivors of human trafficking. They have often been traumatised by their experiences, cannot go back to their country of origin, and require help. How-ever, current Dutch policy is putting them in an even more vulnerable situation, as policy is focused more on the security of the state than the security of the survivor. As soon as a survivor is not qualified as a victim, they are labelled as an illegal immigrant who needs to be repatriated. There are persons who have been exploited during the migration process who need help. Right now help is not based on what these survivors need, but on what the state needs. This research paper will use an ethnographic approach to look at the mechanisms and the implications thereof on particular survivors; to how they are being put in this more vulnerable, and so perilous, situation. It is paradoxical, as Dutch anti-trafficking policy is actually harming survivors of human trafficking.","['Human trafficking', 'Dutch anti-trafficking policy', 'Dutch immigration policy', 'Victim/criminal paradigm', 'Ethnographic', 'NGOs']"
"Colombian Women and U.S. Servicemen: Encounters and Experiences from Melgar, Colombia","Lozano Arévalo, Natalia",2015-12-11,['Zarkov Dubravka'],International Institute of Social Studies,"More than 50 years of armed conflict in Colombia have permeated the entire
society with a culture of violence and war, which have left few citizens untouched.
A crucial decision in the history of the conflict was to invite U.S. to
take part in the Colombian war. What did this mean at local and interpersonal
levels? This study – the first scholarly treatment of transnational relationships
between Colombian women and U.S. servicemen – considers the case of Melgar,
the location of two Colombian military bases with a permanent presence
of U.S. military personnel, to explore through locals’ narratives the implications
of U.S. intervention in the conflict on the daily lives of Colombian women. It
addresses this topic by focussing on the sexual and/or romantic relationships
that have developed between local women and U.S. servicemen in relation with
notions and practices of gender, sexuality, race, nationality and class.

A key finding is that participants’ experiences defy traditional frameworks
for analysing the relationship between women and war, as well as oppositional
constructs that split and give an incomplete interpretation of women’s
lived experiences such as the private/public divide. This paper offers an account
of the multiplicity, fluidity and complexity of women’s lived experiences
in militarized contexts, by concluding that local women that participated in the
research embrace militarization by understanding their relationships with U.S.
servicemen as beneficial and desirable. In doing so, they contribute to the
maintenance of oppressive social orders and reinforce militarization.
Furthermore, beyond serving military ends in the context of the militarization
of Melgar, the experiences of participants are the product of the simultaneous
interaction of the international and the local, the North and the South, the material
and the emotional, the private and the public; and women’s social, economic
and physical security and support, as well as their informed consent and
agency to desire, enjoy their sexuality and make decisions while navigating
within the constraints and possibilities of their gendered, militarized, racialized,
sexualized and nationalized realities.","['Colombian conflict', 'U.S. servicemen', 'women', 'gender', 'Melgar', 'sexuality', 'race', 'nationality', 'transnational relationships', 'power relations', 'intersectionality']"
The Underlying Dynamics of Al-Shabaab’s Recruitment of Muslim Youth: A Case of Mombasa County in Kenya,"Mohamed, Miraj Hassan",2015-12-11,['Shehada Nahda'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Most Kenyan Muslim youth serving in militant Al-Shabaab have been
constructed as a threat to national security and stability in the security policing.
As a result forceful government actions to counter radicalization and
recruitment has been met with a reaction of violence in response. Little
research has been done to try and understand why these youth make the
choices they make. Within Mombasa Muslim youth have continued to live in
deteriorating structural conditions that have left them disenfranchised and at
the periphery of the society. In turn rather than acting docile, youth have
resorted to exploit their networks and connections for inclusion in Al-Shabaab.
This reaction in most cases has been violence in response to state violence thus
making radicalization a cycle. Using the life story technique and participant
observation to unpack the youth’s experiences, this paper integrates social
exclusion and social capital theories to analyse the structural challenges the
youth face.","['Radicalization', 'radicalized', 'recruitment', 'social exclusion', 'social capital']"

challenges of resettlement of Bhutanese refugees with specific attention to socio-legal research
an approach of legal consciousness, within the context of additional humanitarian crisis due to
the 2015 earthquakes in Nepal. This study examines the shifts of legal consciousness of Bhutanese
refugees and refugee agency due to the additional humanitarian crisis in Nepal. Based
on the findings, this paper concludes that Bhutanese refugees in Nepal are obliged to comply
with the existing laws relevant to the resettlement. The law is static and thus, they do not have
influence over the existing laws as interpreted by American Legal Consciousness. The lack of
proper information prior to resettlement has increased the vulnerability of Bhutanese refugees

explores how children understand and experience the space of Child Forums. While the
government and NGOs direct child participation into top ladder of participation, the children

Fostering a Critical Consciousness for Social and Political Change: A Case Study of Youth-led Organizing in The Netherlands,"Baker, Megan",2015-12-11,['Hardus Sarah'],International Institute of Social Studies,"While youth policy in the Netherlands has conventionally been characterized by a
problem-oriented approach to youth development, the contemporary shift towards a
positive approach presents a noteworthy moment for reevaluating how policy makers
and practitioners can more effectively work for and with youth in their communities.
Viewing youth development from a social justice perspective, this study argues for
approaches to youth development that aim to support youth in the process of
identifying, navigating, and combating the social and political conditions in their lives
and communities. Youth-led organizing is explored in this research as a possible
approach for doing so.
Through a case study of youth-led organizing in Netherlands, this research draws on
Paulo Freire’s notions of critical consciousness and reflects on the potential of youthled
organizing in supporting Dutch youth in the process of recognizing, and taking
action upon, the inequitable social and political conditions in their lives and
communities. The study reflects on the key processes and features within the organizing
process that support the process of critical consciousness development among youth
members, as well as their limitations. It furthermore reflects on the complex

challenge the land acquiring, it does so using social-legal approaches such as 1).
Legal consciousness aiming at finding out how women understand and interpret

laws in Uganda. 2) It also goes ahead to use a mobilization approach, this aims
at looking how the women are using the law to confront the LSLAs in this district;
and lastly is the Legal Empowerment approach which looks at how women
actually are mobilised by others, or call it empowered, to claim their rights.
Key findings from this research have shown that women are frustrated
with the legal system in Uganda: they contend that they have not been helped
enough when it comes to dealing with officials in the legal institution.
Secondly, because of the lack of trust in the legal system, they have tended
to use various methods to show their dissatisfaction in the system but all in the
name of fighting for their land rights.
Thirdly, is that there are key organizations which have identified this gap
of lack of the women’s awareness and so they have embarked on training and

"Gendered Norms, Practices and Livelihoods of Rural Poor Women in Glitame, Ghana.","Hlormdor, Elvis",2015-12-11,['Chhachhi Amrita'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Increasing poverty is one of the enormous problems the world has been grappling
with in recent years, especially that which has to do with rural poverty.
This problem is more acute in most developing countries. Ghana is one of the
countries in the Sub-Sahara that has also been in the forefront in the fight
against poverty. Although, lots of social and economic policies have been put
in place to enhance the livelihoods of Ghanaians especially rural women, invisible
gender ideologies in rural areas continue to thwart the efforts of policy
makers. To ascertain this fact, this study investigated ways in which gendered
cultural norms and practices affect the livelihoods of poor rural women in
Ghana.
The aim of this paper was to investigate the livelihoods of poor rural women,
the various norms, practices prevalent in rural areas and ways in which these
cultural norms and practices affect the work women engage in, in rural environment.
The study identified several livelihoods strategies in which there was
a gender divison of labour such as farming, strip cloth weaving/kete weaving,
animal rearing, gari processing, collection of firewood for sales, sale of dried
peels of cassava and petty trading- vending activities both stationary on table
at home in forms of cooked food and vegetables and on a mobile base. It was
also established that certain cultural norms and practices play role in rural
women’s access to livelihoods such as widowhood rites, fiashidi/trokosi practices,
patrilineal inheritance system,yeve and polygamous marriages.These practices
have been gendered and do not favor women largely in terms of the kind of
work women do. One reason for these present livelihoods of women is due to
unequal sharing of productive resources, especially land which is key in the
study area. These practices have denied women access to productive resources.
Additionally, in observing the various cultural practices such as fiashidi/trokosi,
yeve, widowhood rites, the mobility and freedom women need is hindered as
social networks and other livelihoods options are missed trapping them in low
rank jobs that are not viable reproducing their poverty. This study has also
shown that polygamous marriages rather disadvantage and endanger femalechild
in these families in their access to productive resources, positioning them
with differential livelihood opportunities that are not viable especially in the
southern patriarchal societies of Ghana. Despite constraints related to cultural
belief systems, the research has shown that women are interested in share
cropping, communal farming and informal saving mechanism/susu contribution
as self empowering strategies to improve their life chances. Policies need
to address gendered cultural norms as well as rural women’s ability to access
credit, have good markets and good social networks to fall on in times of

'Can Women Science Teachers Be Role Models?':  Challenging Gender Stereotypes of Science and Masculinity,"Mim, Shamnaz Arifin",2015-12-11,['Okwany Auma'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Despite the existing gender stereotypes associated with science and masculinity,
there are some women teachers in secondary co-education schools
in Bangladesh who are going against the grain by taking up a profession
in the science field. This research is an attempt to make visible the lived
gendered experiences of women science teachers both in urban and
semi-urban areas of Bangladesh. In addition attempts, to shed new
light on the debate of masculinity of science and the strategies women
teachers‟ use to deal with the embedded gender ideologies to become
role models. By using a feminist standpoint approach, this research unveils
married and unmarried women science teachers‟ struggle with
gender structures in schools, families and communities. The findings of
this empirical study revealed that, in a classic patriarchal society, it is
much difficult for women science teachers to be role models because
of their socially prescribed gender-roles, symbolic representation, gender-
specific norms and constraints in their institutions. Despite these
constraints the teachers have the potential to be role models and they
are coping by making different strategic choices to sustain their interest
in the science. This study contributes perspectives on how to overcome
the fabricated myth of girls‟ intrinsic incompatibility with science.","['Women science teachers', 'masculinity', 'gender stereotypes', 'role model', 'gendered', 'experience']"
"‘No Peace No War’ Situation Between Ethiopia and Eritrea: Perspectives of Eritrean and Ethiopian Students and Local People, Adigrat Town, Ethiopia","Berhe,  Yonas. B",2015-12-11,['Zarkov Dubravka'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study deals with the ‘no peace no war’ situation existed in Eritrea and Ethiopia. The study was aimed at assessing the opinion and experience of students and local people in Adigrat town. This study employed qualitative case study research design. Purposive sampling technique was used to identify a total of fourteen sample respondents from which ten are university students, two are elders and two women from the town. The study employs unstructured interview with open ended questions as a main data collection instrument which is supported by secondary sources with academic literatures including the theories of peace like the positive peace, Liberal peace and the ‘new war’ theory. Accordingly the findings, the study shows that ‘no peace no war’ situation currently existing in Ethiopia and Eritrea has an adverse effect for both peoples by prohibiting peaceful coexistence and integration to enhance their social and economic development. This ranges from separation of families, migration and economic entrapment to the absence of security and peace politically between the two countries. The finding also indicates that the historical politics of identity which widens the gap between the two peoples is starting to change with the new generation which is helpful in bringing the two peoples together. This can bring a positive peace when it gain consent from both parties of the government which is helpful to reverse the current ‘no peace no war’ situation in to cooperation and integration when the Liberal peace settlement left them with incomplete peace agreement.",
Of Gendered Identities and Aspirations: Zooming into the Case of the Middle Class ‘Educated’ Urban Youth of Dhaka,"Tabassum,  Sarah",2015-12-11,['Biekart Kees'],International Institute of Social Studies,"With about nearly half of its population within the age range of 0-24 years old and a rapidly growing urban-centric middle class, Dhaka is a city that appears to cater to those in hopes for a better reality, economically as well as socio-politically. Nevertheless, the hope gets problematized when reality reflects ris-ing occurrences of gender-based violence and discrimination against policies that claim to eradicate them through institutional help, such as education (e.g. schooling).
This research explores narratives from an emerging diverse group of ‘edu-cated’ middle class youth whose lived, perceived and aspired experiences illus-trate a reality that is far more nuanced than what statistics and state policies provide – a deep-rooted association of heteropatriarchal and heteronormative beliefs and practices that finds its way into their lives as they embark upon journeys to ‘become someone’. The association is enhanced through the insti-tutional structures of family, religion and community. Amidst micro level nego-tiations, the gendered narratives produce a set of cross-cutting agendas that are timely and significant to understand a behind-the-picture aspect of the reality of the ‘next generation’ which seems to have been normalized in the process of reproducing the unjust dominant discourses.","['Youth', 'Gender', 'Heteropatriarchy', 'Institutions', 'Education', 'Identity', 'Aspirations', 'Equity']"
"Violent Child Disciplining Practices at Home in Mekelle, Ethiopia: A Child Rights-Based Perspective","Gebrehiwot, Shewit Gebrezgabher",2015-12-11,['Arts Karin'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Violent disciplining is one of the most common forms of violence experienced by children in Ethiopia. These practices are threatening the very survival and healthy development of the children involved. This study explores the experiences of children in Adi-Shumdihun with violent disciplining at home and in the family. The local discourses used to legitimize the practices, and the responses of relevant actors to the problem of violent disciplining are also discussed from a Child Rights-Based Approach (CRBA). In doing so, this study follows a qualitative research approach. While children in Adi-Shumdihun are passing through bitter experiences of violent disciplining, such practices are culturally encouraged and legally overlooked at the national and local levels. A CRBA is yet to be introduced to the work of relevant actors in Adi-Shumdihun. The first thing that a CRBA requires is recognizing children as rights-holders. Besides, a CRBA entails the full protection of children from violent disciplining practices. It also requires the establishment of enduring structures that enable the children to equally and actively participate in the decision-making process of the relevant actors.","['Violent Disciplining', 'Child Rights-Based Approach', 'Ethiopia', 'Child Participation', 'Non-Discrimination', 'Best Interests of the Child', 'Survival and Development', 'Private Sphere', 'Violence Against Children.']"
"Developing in a Ditch? : Women, Struggling for the ‘Right to Work’ Amidst Conflict in Garhwa Jharkhand","Pandey, Shraddha",2015-12-11,['Hintjens  Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper is about structurally disadvantaged women’s struggle for the right to
work in Garwha District in India, a district affected by violent Maoist groups
in conflict with the army and other forces of the state. The paper examines the
access to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,
under which one of the largest employment-creation schemes in the world operates
in the District. Using a mixed methods approach to understanding the
reality of women’s struggles for work, the study first looks at the database of
the Act. Through painstaking analysis of the data, gender and caste disaggregated
data were cross-tabulated to produce data disaggregated along both gender
and caste lines. In qualitative terms, this study drew on semi-structured and
structured interviews with women workers of the Scheme, state officials and
experts in the development and employment field. An intersectional analysis of
the data is intended to complement the quantitative data analysis. Overall the
aim is to find out why fewer and scheduled caste women and scheduled tribal
women are being included as workers in the projects of the Scheme. Key findings
suggest that women still wish to participate, but that the database used to
plan work was not disaggregated in such a way as to facilitate these socially excluded
women’s participation in the Scheme and access to employment. The
most important finding is that caste, gender, violent conflict and government
officials are completely interdependent and can even all be found in one family.
This complex configuration of power relations serves to further socially exclude
rather than further including the women who were intended to be the
main beneficiaries of the right to employment under the Scheme.","['Scheduled Caste', 'Scheduled Tribe', 'Women', 'Employment', 'Garwha', 'MGNREGA', 'Conflict', 'Maoists', 'State']"
The Impact of Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) on the over all export and the textile and appareal products,"Habtegiorgis, Eyob Isaak",2015-12-11,['Bergeijk Peter van'],International Institute of Social Studies,"It has been almost 50 years since some of the early nonreciprocal trade agreements in the form of generalized system of preference (GSP) were initiated by developed countries to the developing world. The main arguments in support of the nonreciprocal trade agreement is that developing countries are facing severe market access problems in advanced countries and hence developed countries are agreed to abolish all the tariff barriers to boost developing countries export.
In this paper we are focused in analysing the impact of a special nonreciprocal trade agreement which is the Africa growth and opportunity act (AGOA) granted by U.S to eligible Sub Saharan African countries. The study took both aggregated products and disaggregated products from apparel and textile sector to measure the impact of AGOA on the export performance in the last twenty years for sub-Sahara countries. Our econometric results reveal that, the impact of AGOA on the overall export is insignificant although the impact is Positive. But our disaggregated data have mixed results. From the four product categories, the impact of AGOA is positively promotes the export of knit apparel and woven apparel while it negatively affect export of cotton product and insignificant for other textiles.","['Africa Growth and Opportunity Act', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'export growth', 'gravity model']"

Securities Exchange is still nascent and its contribution is not yet evident in the economy, yet many economist and researchers have accredited Stock markets for their important role in economic growth. Using quarterly data from 1998Q1 to 2012Q4, the study employed one bank (money supply) and three measures of stock market development namely Market Capitalization ratio to proxy market size, and total value of shares traded and Turnover ratio to proxy market liquidity, controlling for other factors that affect economic growth. To test for whether there exists a relationship between variables, the study applies Multivariate vector autoregressive models (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) to capture the short and long run dynamics of the relationship. The Johansen test of cointergration reveal that variables are cointergrated and the VECM reveals existence of long running relationship. The granger causality test results however were inconclusive showing no causality between stock market and growth in Uganda.

The Impact of Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth in Zambia : A study in the context of a natural resource dependent economy,"Ndaba, Sibongile",2015-12-11,['Bergeijk Peter van'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study looks at the impact of foreign direct investment on economic growth in Zambia in the context of a natural resource dependent country. With over 80% of all FDI being channelled to the mining sector, the study investigates whether this structure could have an influence on the level of impact exerted by FDI. It uses exploratory data analysis to investigate the relationship between FDI flows and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The main analysis is based on time series data from 1990 to 2013. The base year 1990 was selected specifically because this was a transition year which lead to the shift into a liberalised economy and increased FDI inflows. Prior to 2000, FDI was spread over other sectors in the economy. However, after that it is concentrated in the mining sector, averaging over 50% of total FDI. The study finds that the impact on growth is greater prior to 2000 than after. The study also finds that FDI contributed to increasing output in the mining sector due to recapitalization but this in turn has not resulted in dynamic growth for the economy. The study therefore concludes that FDI has not contributed to dynamic economic growth because it has been concentrated in mining sector. What it has done is reinforce dependence on the mining sector.","['foreign direct investment', 'economic growth', 'resource dependency', 'Zambia', 'Gross Domestic Product', 'mining sector', 'copper']"

"Informal Cross-Border Trade: Who Participates And What Is The Impact of Participation on Income? A Case Study in Entikong, Indonesia",Ristiana Malik Jani Jaleha,2015-12-11,['Wagner Natascha'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study analyzes the determinants of people’s participation in informal cross-border trade (ICBT) and to what extent household income is affected by participation in informal trade. By applying a snowball sampling method, the author carried out a survey among 77 ICB traders and 70 non-ICB traders who live all in the Entikong border area of Indonesia. The ICBT questionnaire developed by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) in 2008 was adapted.
ICBT is non-taxed but formalized in Indonesia since 1970 under The Border Trade Agreement. It allows traders within a certain area to exchange pre-specified goods below a value of Rp. 2,025,900 (RM 600). The numbers of monthly trades are also limited.
To assess the role of ICBT for the Entikong region I make use of quantitative and qualitative methods. First, a model of ICBT participation is estimated using a multivariate logit regression. The findings illustrate that gender, location, distance, multiplicity of jobs, position in a household and asset ownership affect the decision to engage in ICBT. Second, an OLS regression model was employed to examine the individual monetary benefit from ICBT. The result indicates that ICBT participation boosts income and improves the household’s economic prosperity, especially secondary income in the Entikong region results to a large extend from ICBT. Third, I assess the nature of trade and show that the major exported goods are sour eggplant and pepper. The major imported goods are sugar and cooking oil. Proceeds from ICBT are mainly used for reinvestment, for rental payments and to cover school fees.
I conclude that ICBT is needed as an important source of income in Entikong and a coping mechanism. In the absence of ICBT, the economic conditions of the households would be worse suggesting that the government would need to step in with social programs that are costly. Therefore, it is questionable whether the government would really gain from formalizing this small-scale cross-border trade.","['informal cross-border trade', 'participation', 'income', 'Indonesia', 'multivariate analysis']"

By projecting forthcoming challenges, this research examines the role of parametrical and multipillar pension scheme reform in overcoming the future deficit. It is found that the former modification could reduce the shortage but not able to distort its upward trend. Meanwhile, the latter improvement could both lower the financial insufficiency and reverse its financial trend, depending on the investment performance. Compared to Chile’s pension reform in 1981, multipillar reform also has advantage in terms of the absence of transitional cost.","['pension reform', 'multipillar scheme', 'deficit', 'welfare state', 'retirement', 'simulation']"
Does household poverty affect the participation of women in enterprises? The case of Kenyan slum dwellers,"Mariara, Shelmith Wangu",2015-12-11,['Wagner Natascha'],International Institute of Social Studies,"There are large numbers of poor women living in the informal settlements in Kenya despite of the low number of economic opportunities available for exploitation in those areas. Such women find themselves in a vicious cycle of poverty and sometimes intergenerational poverty sets in. Women are born in shanties by poor women, and due to lack of adequate education and economic opportunities, they end up in low being activities or start up small unprofitable enterprises. They thus remain poor and their children face the risk of remaining poor. The key research question that this study sought to answer was the extent to which household poverty affects the participation in enterprises by women living in informal settlements in urban Kenya. The study hypothesized that women living in poverty participate in entrepreneurship because of the need to improve their living conditions and find alternatives to unemployment. The broad objective of the study was to examine
the extent which household poverty and other covariates affect the participation of Kenyan women slum dwellers in entrepreneurship. Based on the findings, the study suggested relevant policy recommendations for improving the plight of such women. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used for analysis. The study was based on the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) 2005/6 data, complemented by a case study survey of 30 women from Kibera slum, Nairobi, who were interviewed in July 2015. Qualitative and descriptive data analysis methods, a probit model of participation in enterprises and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method were used to derive the study findings. The findings of this study showed that women living in shanties were less likely to participate in entrepreneurship compared to their counterparts living in other forms of informal settlements (Manyattas and Swahilis). Furthermore, poverty was found to be a key barrier to the participation of women in entrepreneurship. Other barriers included marital status, presence of many children and culture. Household size, transfers and education were found to encourage participation in entrepreneurship. The results also show that differences in participation of men and women in could be due to the differences in age, education, poverty and marital status. The study offered several policy recommendations for enhancing the participation of women in enterprises. First, the study recommended fostering of equity and poverty eradication
programmes, especially those targeting informal settlement dwellers. Second, there is need for policies targeting gender and vulnerable groups and the need to address gender bias and differentials in Kenya. Third, provision of functional training in finance, marketing, production and managerial skills among poor women entrepreneurs. Finally the study recommended provision of credit to poor women for both start-up and boosting of enterprises.","['poverty', 'entrepreneurship', 'women', 'informal settlements', 'small scale enterprises', 'Kenya']"
"Remittance, Foreign Aid Inflows and Dutch Disease : Evidence from South Asian Countries","Uddin, Md Bakhtiar",2015-12-11,['Murshed Syed Mansoob'],International Institute of Social Studies,"We investigate the Dutch Disease impact of migrant‘s remittances and foreign aid using a yearly panel data of five South Asian countries for the period of 1975-2013. We employ two separate regressions to examine the spending effect and resource movement effect of the transfer. The findings reveal that remittances have Dutch Disease impact through both of the effects, whereas no statistically significant impact of foreign aid is detected. An increase in per capita remittances erodes international competitiveness in the way of appreciating real effective exchange rate and at the same time leads to fall in traded to non-traded ratio, thus impacting on the traded sector. The analysis shows that South Asian countries have been experiencing premature deindustrialization and large remittance inflows might have been one of the main causes of it, since the inflows may slow down the structural transformation towards the manufacturing sector. Although remittances and foreign aid may have significant impact on poverty alleviation in this region, policy planners should pay much heed to effective utilization of remittances and foreign aid; otherwise the countries may be caught in the low development trap.","['Dutch disease', 'foreign aid', 'real effective exchange rate', 'remittances', 'premature deindustrialization']"
Nonfarm Activities and Rural Livelihood in Tanzania : The case of Njombe District,"Chamicha, Shamy Pendaeli",2015-12-11,['Pellegrini Lorenzo'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper studied the relationship between nonfarm activities and rural livelihood in Tanzania. More specifically the study examined the driving factors that enable the rural household to participate in the nonfarm activities, the linkage between
nonfarm and farm activities and identified the significance of nonfarm activities as a
livelihood strategy. A field survey was conducted at Lupembe and Matembwe villages in Njombe Districts whereby a total of 100 households 50 in each village were administered.
Unstructured interview was also used exclusively to the interview that involves the key informants in the study area.
The findings of the study were as follows, First; the household’s decision to engage
in nonfarm activities largely influenced by push and pull factors. The push factors included; low income from agriculture activities, land inadequacy, seasonality of
agriculture activities and minimizing risk from poor agriculture performance. The pull
factor involved; increased opportunities in the nonfarm sector and the growth of timber
industry. Second; there were a strong relationship between farm and nonfarm sector especially in the flow of capital and consumption between the two sectors. This
findings shows that the income obtained from agriculture activities were used as a
start-up capital in nonfarm activities and the income obtained from nonfarm activities
were used to finance farm activities. Third; the study found that there is a significant
share of the income from nonfarm activities to the overall household income. In additional the income obtained from nonfarm activities are used to purchase different household needs such as purchases of nonfarm inputs, paying school fees, buying
food, consumer consumption, buying home assets, paying house rent and health expenses.
The study concluded that rural nonfarm activities are significant livelihood strategy for the rural households.","['rural nonfarm activities', 'livelihood', 'livelihood diversification and household']"

Henceforth, the Government had intervened by executing redistributive policy through the inclusive growth strategy by social expenditures provision in the form of social assistance spending and education support spending (BOS Program). Nonetheless, little has been proven empirically concerning the effect of social expenditures to economic growth and whether such spending can be categorized as pro-poor growth and inclusive growth strategy in the Indonesian context.
Against this backdrop, this paper attempts to shed a light in this area by employing regression analysis through the Fixed Effect Model to investigate the effect of social assistance spending and education support spending (BOS Program) to economic growth in 33 Indonesian provinces from 2006-2012. After identifying the type of social spending which is able to stimulate economic growth, this paper then tries to determine whether such social spending can be categorized as pro-poor growth and inclusive growth instrument in the context of its efficacy on poverty alleviation and human
development improvement respectively. The result suggests that only education support spending (BOS Program) that statistically significant in uplifting economic growth level. Furthermore, closer investigation indicates that this particular spending can be classified both as pro-poor growth and inclusive growth instrument.","['social expenditures', 'social assistance spending', 'education support spending', 'BOS program', 'economic growth', 'pro-poor growth', 'inclusive growth']"
Footprints of the volunteer tourist: Local actors’ perception of volunteer tourism,"Sperling, Maria",2015-12-11,['Hardus Sarah'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Volunteer tourism (VT) is one of the fastest growing sectors within alternative
tourism. It sells the idea that volunteers will contribute to development, alleviate poverty
and build capacity, and claims to retain an equal, unexploited relationship with the
local host community. The popularity of VT lies in its discourse of urgency, the impression
that it is easy and that anyone can do it. The complexity of development is
reduced to a few days or weeks of helping others, set to a backdrop of exotic scenery.
South Africa offers the largest range of VT activities on the African continent and is
also ranked amongst the top ten destinations for VT in the world. VT is a significant
source of revenue for South Africa and yet there is little understanding of the potential
benefits or harms on local communities. Although the local host community is the socalled
beneficiary of VT, their perspective is of essence to the debate, yet often overlooked.
This paper explores local actor’s perceptions of VT using social exchange theory.
The investigation is a case study of a township community in Kayamandi, South Africa.
Semi-structured interviews and participant observation were conducted to understand
local actors’ needs, motivations, expectations and their evaluation of the benefits
and costs. The findings reveal that local actors attach different definitions, and meanings,
to volunteer tourists depending on their socio-economic roles. Broadly speaking,
their perception of VT is positive with factors such as level of power, dependency,
control, and trust, greatly influencing their perception. Social exchange theory served
as a useful framework. Finally, the study highlights the potential of VT to bring
change and development to a host community, especially if the communities themselves
could have more control of the VT system.","['volunteer tourism', 'residents’ perceptions', 'social exchange theory']"
"Minimum Wage and Poverty: Empirical Study on District Panel Data in Java, Indonesia",Mehdinsareza Wiriarsa,2015-12-11,['Papyrakis Elissaios'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Poverty is a problem for a society by considering the socio-political and economic considerations. Socio-political aspect of poverty underlines social exclusion in society. While, economically, poverty can decelerate development process. To alleviate poverty, economists believe that economic growth is important. This, in turn, result in a unique set of policies among government. Minimum wage is one of most popular policy to alleviate poverty. Not only because minimum wage can improve average income of society, but also because it is a low-cost policy (Card and Krueger 1995).
The objective of this research paper is to investigate the relationship of minimum wage and poverty empirically. In order to do that this research paper construct a data set of time-series data for fourteen years from 2001 until 2014 and cross section data of 119 districts in the Java. The analysis is run by using three methods of panel data analysis; pooled OLS, fixed effect and random effect method. This research paper also tries to analyze the relationship of minimum wage and poverty in the province level using sub-sample data. Result of this research papers shows that minimum wage policy in Java can reduce both poverty gap index and poverty rate. However, in the province level, the regression show more varied results.

It makes a significant effect to the country’s development, since tax takes the biggest part of the government’s revenue. This study is conducted by seeing this phenomenon as a background, and it is aimed at determining the factors that are likely to have correlation with the compliance. It focuses on the corporate taxpayers behaviour, which is divided based on two aspects; the business characteristics aspect and tax attitudinal aspect. The data sources derive from the Duren Sawit STO, and survey data are based on the taxpayer perception using six-point Likert Scale. Then, it will apply two different analyses; first, the logistic regression and second, the multiple regressions.
It is shown that the previous tax income return from the taxpayers and the corruption perception influence the compliance significantly, while the other factors are mostly ignored. Overall, it implies that all factors must be brought together as a consideration to reduce noncompliance behavior with fighting corruption as the key element that should be a main policy by the government.","['compliance', 'noncompliance', 'corporate taxpayers', 'characteristics aspect', 'attitudinal aspects', 'Duren Sawit STO', 'Indonesia']"

using the media analysis tools such as focalisation, categorization and framing
in a total of 120 articles related to those events. Moreover, using an ethnographic
orientation, he does site visits and qualitative interviews with participants
and some organizer of the protests.
The research concludes that the media representation profiled the participants
as a socio-economically homogeneous group of people, mostly youth,
poor and vulnerable. These youth are neglected on both media outlets and represented
as criminals through membership categorisation, therefore, discredited.
The media focalization were mainly on privileged politicians and opinion
makers as well as the journalists, and the events were negatively framed resulting
youth participants future dissociation from that event. On the contrary,
interviews revealed that the participants were diverse subgroups of youth willing
to express their different compelling grievances through violent protests as

Moreover, the analysis is based on five explanatory variables consisting in two demographic factors: age level and gender of taxpayers, and three other explanatory variables: service-sector taxpayers, tax return status in 2011, and tax return status in 2012. Compared to previous studies, this research paper uses internal data obtained directly from Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) of Republic of Indonesia while most of prior studies used survey method. By comparing three statistical methods, which are Probit method, Logit method, and Linear Probability Method, the analysis of this paper is divided into two models based on the inclusion and exclusion of the previous tax return status. The first model finds that all explanatory variables are statistically significant in influencing individual tax compliance. However, in the second model, only service-sector variable demonstrates statistical significance in explaining individual tax compliance.

The Functioning and Effect of a Cash Transfer Program in Indonesia,Nina Restyana Yulianti,2015-12-11,['Bedi Arjun S.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper examines the functioning, in terms of targeting, and the effect of a cash transfer program (BSM) on dropping out of school. The analysis, based on Susenas data 2013, reveals that the program has a very low reach and a number of eligible households are excluded. At the same time, there are inclusion errors and depending on the level of education, 50 to 70 percent of the beneficiaries are ineligible. Despite the low targeting performance, the analysis shows that the program has a positive effect on reducing the probability of dropping out of school at all levels education for children in the poorest quartile of the expenditure distribution. Specifically, among the poorest 25% of households, the program works towards reducing the drop out rate at around 21.8%, 29.2% and 85.4% at primary, junior and senior high school level, respectively. Based on the analysis, the paper concludes that the program should be maintained and targeting efficiency needs to be improved as the program has a meaningful effect for low-income households in terms of reducing the risk of dropping out of school.","['cash transfer program', 'poor students', 'targeting', 'drop-out school']"

This paper analyzes to what extent food safety measures implementation by the main destination countries affects Indonesia’s Fisheries exports. United States, Japan and European Union are the main importers of Indonesian fisheries and they have consistently applied the food safety measures. Therefore, the examination of the food safety measures impact to Indonesian fisheries exports is focused on these importers.
Inventory based approach employing a number of food safety regulation and border detention is analyzed using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The result suggests that even though not very significant, the food safety measures still negatively influenced fisheries exports to Japan while the falling demand of fisheries in this country was also responsible for the decline of Indonesia’s fisheries exports. Meanwhile, the negative effect was not seen in fisheries exports to the US and EU.
Furthermore, the great portion of food safety cases faced by fisheries in the recent years, shows that food safety measures in the importing market still have caused problems and risks to Indonesia’s fisheries exports. Therefore, food safety standard harmonization between Indonesia and importers as well as the consistency in the application of food safety practices is necessary to comply with the food safety measures of the importing countries.","['food safety measure', 'fisheries exports', 'sanitary and phytosanitary', 'non-tariff barrier']"
"Exploring the Nexus between Social Capital and Individual Biographies of “Care leavers” in Nairobi, Kenya: A Life Course Perspective","Ucembe, Stephen",2015-12-11,['Cheney Kristen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Young people leaving institutional care are often labelled “orphans” as children, and “care leavers” as young adults and have been widely neglected in Kenya in policies, and, consequently, excluded from support. As children, they face a mul-tiplicity of vulnerabilities resulting from a lack of necessary support to address underlying structural issues. Mis-identification of risk factors by government and non-governmental organizations often result in unnecessary institutionalization. Within these institutions their vulnerabilities are further reinforced; often socially excluded from normative socio-cultural experiences and enmeshed in abusive, exploitative and neglectful relationships that further disadvantage them when they leave institutions. Employing a life course perspective and drawing upon these young people’s stories, along with focus group discussions and views from staff, this paper explores the concept of social capital and the ways in which this influences their lives before care, in care and after care.","['institution', 'children', 'young people', 'social capital', 'Kenya']"
Indonesian Urban Farming Communities and Food Sovereignty,"Nasution, Zulfadhli",2015-12-11,['Borras Saturnino M. Jr'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper has attempted to examine how and to what extent urban farming communities and food sovereignty in Indonesia engage each other. It is done by two ways: 1) examination of two pillars of food sovereignty practised among urban farming communities namely localisation of food system and nature stewardship; 2) examination on how peasantry-based food sovereignty movements see the significance of urban farming communities in applying food sovereignty concept and to build mutual linkage between them. Case study from three cities – Jakarta, Bandung and Bogor – shows that food sovereignty discourse has not (yet) much exposed the urban farming communities because, 1) urban farming as movements has different historical background and root of emergence with food sovereignty concept that was brought by rural peasantry-based movements, and 2) so the both also have different social characters and political views. On the other hand, the representatives of food sovereignty movement suggest at least two important prerequisites to strength-en the construction of food sovereignty among urban food advocates specifically 1) building consumer conciousness on food system among urban groups, and 2) building urban and rural solidarity.
I argue that the emergence of urban farming movements can be a sign of the beginning and transition phase of food movement into urban setting that further can be a great chance for food sovereignty to fulfill the discourse on more sustainable and just food activism. For this, it needs more inclusive food sovereignty movements toward urban population, yet the urban communities should frame their activism to be critical to the existing industrialized food sys-tem. As initial research on this issue in Indonesia, this hopefully can bring in-sight and reflection – including for the global South – to enrich food sovereignty discourse as different context, setting, and geography perhaps should have different strategy and entry point.","['food sovereignty', 'urban farming', 'food movement', 'Indonesia']"
Aid Impact on Economic Growth: Donor Policy and Industrialization as Decisive Factors:  Comparative Analysis of Japan and Ghana,"Khachatryan, Meline",2015-12-11,['Nicholas Howard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study examines the link between official development assistance (ODA) and economic growth with particular reference to donor policy and industrial policies of aid recipient countries. It first outlines the historical basis of economic growth in the post-Second World War period in Japan and adopts a strategy of comparison of economic development strategies and patterns of two countries – Japan, as one of the first aid recipients and a prominent example of a late-industrialized country with a ‘miracle’ economic growth, and Ghana, as a country with one of the highest levels of aid inflows from one side and economic stagnation from another. The research analyses the necessary conditions for assuring long-term economic growth for aid recipient countries. And finally it concludes that for aid to be effective for economic growth, a proper donor policy and industrial policies have a considerable role to play. In particular, crucial structural changes in economy which emphasize growth of manufactural production along with the increasing rate of manufactured exports are very likely to help the economy to grow. In a word, it is the appropriate donor policy which will assure the necessary level of independence for aid recipient countries to choose the export-led industrialization route that would help aid to be effective for long-term economic growth.","['Official Development Assistance', 'Economic growth', 'Donor policy', 'Export-Led Industrialization', 'Manufactured exports', 'Japan', 'Ghana']"

It finds that “political space” by state reformists and the capacity of policy advocacy to work with and influence on both sides of state and society are necessary for mutually empowering interaction between state reformists and pro-reform social actors to-wards pro-poor land policy formulation. The interaction between state and society is political dynamic and not static.

Milking money: Exploring the Struggle for Autonomy from Theory to Practice,"Simula, Giulia",2015-12-11,['Borras Saturnino M. Jr'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The ‘middle farmer’ is a key figure within the food sovereignty debates. Powerful
actors within commodity chains exploit middle farmers globally while centralizing
high profits and reducing small farmers’ autonomy. Yet despite this
exploitative relationship, many farmers do not have the capacity to distantiate
from the production of export commodities. The struggle for better terms of
inclusion in commodity chains is largely unexplored by the food sovereignty
movement where autonomy is largely understood in terms of partial delinking.
This paper problematizes the idea of autonomy understood as either partial
delinking from capital and market forces or as complete subordination to global
commodity chains. By grounding the analysis on an empirical case, it is argued
that struggles for autonomy are better understood on a practical level as
they are intrinsically correlated to context specific constraints and opportunities
for action. I have analysed an agrarian movement’s autonomy and capacity
vis-à-vis industrial and financial capital in upstream and downstream markets
throughout the current important period of agricultural restructuring. This
theoretical framework moves beyond binaries and looks at demands for higher
autonomy as dynamic and fluid processes rather than static goals. The movement
taken into consideration frames its struggles in terms of delinking when it
has the capacity to do so and when this will result in higher relative autonomy.
At the same time, they also negotiate for better terms of integration in the dairy
chain to increase their relative autonomy.","['Struggle for autonomy', 'capacity', 'subordination', 'embeddedness', 'food sovereignty', 'shepherds', 'Sardinia', 'Movimento Pastori Sardi', 'financialization', 'better', 'terms of inclusion']"
"Understanding the Position of the State in Processes of Accumulation:
Exploring the Tensions Between Land Reform and Biofuels in Zimbabwe","Chademana, Talent Trishdar",2015-12-11,['Arsel Murat'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper is a study of the state-capital-society relationship in an effort to unpack
the most actor in development. The rapid expansion of capital over the last
decade with a growing presence in the agrarian sector has been a focus of several
studies. The pervasiveness of land grabbing has led many to theorize on the
state-capital alliance, but the tensions in Zimbabwe provide a unique site for
analysis. The Chisumbaje Green Fuel project was sanctioned 9 years after the
largest state led land reform process in sub-Saharan Africa had commenced. The
evident tensions in policies between the land reform and the allocation of
45,000ha of land to a single enterprise provide a site for in depth analysis on
whether the state is truly an instrument of capital or if it can serve the interests
of the poor peasant classes as well. The class conflict over land and property has
strong historical roots and by critically analysis the evidence as well as the discourse
of land reform and land grabbing, a deeper understanding of the position
of the state can be found. The framework of state theory of a strategic paradigm
that allows the discussion to not only engage with the material issues but also
engage the ideational debates in an effort to contribute to the body of literature
on land reform and biofuel exploration, and also to stimulate further discussions
on the state. This paper will question some of the dominant assumptions and
positions that make arguments without a critical consideration of the role and
position of the state. Such uncomplicated analysis can therefore lead to misleading
hypothesis that then obfuscate the real issues by omission. Using the strategic
relational approach and the Gramcian concept of hegemony, this paper will attempt
to problematize and unpack the dominant perception of the state project
to show that though accumulation is a permanent interest of the state, the interest
of capital and the lower classes are not mutually exclusive. The assumption
that in pursuing one, the other is abrogated is problematic and this thesis will
challenge and examine this view to present a more assiduous analytic lens.
Though it is an attempt to answer the question of whether the state can pursue
both interests simultaneously, this paper does not presume to categorically answer
the question, but rather it is an effort to contribute an alternative perspective
on understanding the state that may provide a richer insight into the ultimate
answer.","['Land Reform', 'neo-liberal policy', 'accumulation', 'legitimacy', 'power relations']"
Community Participation in Forest Management: A Case of Joint Forest Management and Livelihoods in Tegetero Village in Tanzania,"Magufuli, Ruth John",2015-12-11,['Arsel Murat'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Recent Tanzania government has adopted Joint Forest Management as a participatory
program which emphasizes the active participation of communities
in forest management by cooperating with the state to achieve both improvements
of forest and community livelihoods. However the program has introduced
restrictions in reserve forest which it has resulted in profound effects on

The Political Economy of Plantation Agriculture in Ethiopia: The Case of Flower Sector in Holleta Cluster,"Gebre, Bedada Beyene",2015-12-11,['Visser Oane'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The research deals with political economy of planation agriculture with the main focus on land and labour relation in flower sector. It includes the process and mechanisms of enclosure, dispossession and transformation of land use rights of famers and the labour regime following land dispossession in flower growing area in Ethiopia. The study adopted a comprehensive approach by taking into account local and international issues and the political/economic context under which flower sector is carried out. The Marxist political economy theory of class and class analysis is used to analyze nature of transformation and class relation on land and labour as well as understand the level/structure/ of accumulation.

The research findings show that domestic and international institutions (state and financial) as well as foreign and local investors played a role in establishing and strengthening flower sector investment in Ethiopia. The finding also shows that the control of land through enclosure and dispossession, changed land property relations (use rights in the case of Ethiopia) and labour relations. Land dispossession led to land concentration in the hand of capitalist investors to make profit/surplus for accumulation and reinvestment. Flower sector is a capital and labour intensive sector and has become globally competitive. Flower sector investors employed more unskilled and non-skilled workers per hectare than other plantation crops. Flower sector created employment opportunity but did not offer decent working and living conditions for workers. Workers live in the state of insecure income, poverty and precarious working conditions; low wages, absence of leaves, forced overtime work and freedom of association and bargaining. Low wages and poverty forced workers to engage in other activities such as farming and self-employment for survival. Flower investment created smallholders famer (dispossessed) who are struggling to continue farming by engaging in sharecropping and rent as well as other wage and self–employment. As a result, wage workers consisting flower workers, dispossessed people and other famers created in flower growing area. Landless and unemployed youth whose parents land is dispossessed by investors subsequently could not inherit land as well as found job as their place is occupied by migrant low wage workers emerged in flower growing area.

Power relationship between classes determined the share of benefits from flower farm and the amount of accumulation. Not all groups are equally benefited from flower farm as different class has as difference experiences. Flower investment enhanced surplus value and accumulation for the capitalist investors and benefitted few part-time and seasonal workers. However, the sector dispossessed small farmers their land and exploited flower sector wage workers. Finally, flower investment is challenged by environmental pollution, absence of farmers’ integration, inefficient utilization of land and bad working condition of labours.","['dispossession', 'property relation', 'labour regime', 'accumulation', 'power']"
Non-Farm Income: The Struggles of the Rural Poor in Malawi,"Mtocha,  Isaac Master",2015-12-11,['Visser Oane'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research aimed at exploring the nature and prevalence of non-farm income in rural Malawian communities. It also examined endogenic factors and motives for non-farm income (NFI) and how it affected livelihoods of different types of households.
The study was conducted at Kachigwada village in Mzimba, Northern Ma-lawi and at Liwonde village in Chiradzulu in Southern Malawi. The study used the Sustainable Livelihood Framework and took the qualitative perspective with acceptance of quantitative data. A total of 47 household interviews, 2 focus group discussion and 3 key informant interviews were done.
The results showed an increased dependence on NFI with 89% of house-holds benefiting from at least one form of NFI. The most dominant forms were business income and wage labor constituting 79% and 23% of household participation respectively. Few households about 9% depended on remittances and only 4% were salaried employees.
The distressful conditions ‘pushed’ most of the poor households into NFI. Poor households had so many subsistence needs, hence it was very difficult for them to accumulate. However, the drive to accumulate motivated the ‘better off’ households to enter NFI.
The poor households who had some forms of NFI were able to smoothen consumption needs. The poorest of the poor who needed NFI most faced so-cial and financial exclusion based on age, health and economic status.
Local councils can enhance NFI by improving physical assets through in-frastructural development. Adopting the sustainable Livelihood framework as a planning tool may also help to cultivate synergies among various actors. The poorest of the poor households would need consistent external support to be lifted out of poverty and break the cycle of intergenerational poverty.","['Non-farm income', 'Livelihoods', 'Poverty', 'Assets', 'Rural Development']"
Economic Asset or National Security Burden? Rethinking Kenyan Government Policies Towards Somali Urban Refugees,"Odero, Cynthia Achieng",2015-12-11,"['Bergh  Sylvia', 'Hintjens  Helen']",International Institute of Social Studies,"Despite valid security trepidations, the Kenyan government directive to counter terror known as ‘Operation Usalama Watch’ has made the Somali community previously known as excellent business people, creators of small companies, employment and opportunities for investment an easy target. This is because they are now being associated with a new set of images of violent crimes in Kenya. This research paper is based on a study carried out among Somali urban refugees in Eastleigh. The main objective of this study was to investigate the factors that have caused a shift by the Kenyan government to relabel Somali urban refugees as a security threat despite their economic contribution to the country. Drawing on a document analysis and qualitative field research, this study considers the reaction of the Somali refugees to the label of security threat and uses the theoretical approach of labelling, refugee governance to comprehend the Kenyan’s government’s narrative towards Somali urban refugees. By examining the existing policies and practices of the Kenya government in relation to the issue of Somali Refugees we see the dilemma faced by both the refugees and the government regarding security and economic benefits. Ultimately, the study highlights the necessity for directing focus towards the refugees being part of the development agenda with the government investing in their businesses and supporting their plans to be integrated into the Kenyan society or go back home and a need for the government to alter its counter-productive measure of encampment of refugees. Meanwhile, there is need to expand the evaluative space to take into account the value of refugees to the Kenyan economy as well as relational outcomes.","['Somali Refugees', 'Security', 'Economic Asset', 'Urban Areas', 'Policy', 'Kenya']"
The Impact of Multicultural Family Support Center on Social Integration of Marriage Immigrant Women in Korea,"Oh, Ga Yeon",2015-12-11,['Gomez Georgina'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The purpose of this paper is to examine that the Multicultural Family Support
Center(MFSC), which is a major implementing governmental organization of
the Korea’s immigration policy that provides supportive programs and projects
for marriage immigrant women and their families in Korea. The analysis focuses
on the impact of MFSC programs on the social integration process of marriage
immigrant women. Using the dataset from National Survey of Multicultural
Families (2012), the analysis has been proceeded with two perspectives.
From the program service receiver perspective, the analysis aims to scrutinize
current status of marriage immigrant women in Korea, such as general profile
of foreign brides and problems that they have living in Korea. From the service
provider perspective, the analysis focused on the relationship between use
of MFSCs’ programs and the degree of social integration within a conceptual
framework of various measurement of immigrant integration. The results show
that the role of MFSCs is limited for social integration of marriage immigrant
women since their programs are mostly focused on the initial stage of their adaptation,
i.e., Korean language programs, and family affairs, such as conflict
between the husband and the wife. These findings led to the conclusion that
multidimensional and two-way approaches are required for social integration of
marriage immigrant women in the process of social integration rather than
one-way process that only urging immigrants’ assimilation.","['Multicultural Family Support Center', 'Multicultural Family', 'Multicultural Policy', 'Multiculturalism', 'Marriage Migration', 'Foreign Brides', 'Social Integration', 'South Korea']"
Commercial Diplomacy on Export Performance Case Study of Indonesian Trade Promotion Centre (ITPC),Prahastuti Maharani,2015-12-11,['Bergeijk Peter van'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Promoting export is a central issue to boost country’s competitiveness. To attain this purpose, many countries including Indonesia implement commercial diplomacy (CDC). Nevertheless, scholars have been debating about the role and efficacy of CDC instruments. Some empirical evidences are being presented to support pro’s and contra’s. This paper attempts to investigate the impact of one of Indonesian CDC instruments, Indonesian Trade Promotion Center (ITPC) on export performance, in essence of whether it presence generates higher trade value. In order to reach the impact analysis, I use the gravity model of international trade and employ panel data for 19 years observations over 62 countries of Indonesian export destinations. The empirical estimation yields a positive correlation between the existences of ITPC to Indonesian export performance.
ITPC indeed gives a growing effect on exports, even though the magnitude of its impact is less sound. A further discussion is conducted to explore the challenges of CDC instruments of Indonesia in performing export promotion using qualitative interviews. In the finding, the interferences comes from internal as well as external factors. The internal issue such as limited budget, lack of staff, and coordination problem are hampering their activities. Whereas, in the external aspects, the preparedness of Indonesian industry and the channel of export distribution bring tremendous deterrents in boosting Indonesian exports. Hence, this research serves as a policy recommendation for the government in supporting export strategy by strengthening the commercial diplomacy instruments.","['export', 'export promotion', 'commercial diplomacy', 'export promotion agency', 'Indonesia']"
The impact of the digital age on knowledge formation,N. Jelles,2015-12-08,"['P. Arora', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis analyses the impact of the digital world, specifically of recent developments in the
field of metadata, on art knowledge formation. After defining knowledge formation as “any activity by
which someone learns something he or she has not known before, even if others have”, the currently
on-going debate surrounding metadata was addressed. From this, the conclusion was drawn that
metadata, both human readable and computer-readable, makes data easier to find and thus easier to
cluster, which could assist (art) knowledge formation.
To test if this theoretical conclusion held itself in the real world, a case study was conducted
into Artsy, a platform with artworks that says to be using weighed tags called genes to create new and
innovative linkages in its dataset, hence aiding art knowledge formation.
From content analysis of a variety of materials and manual analysis of a number of networks it
was found that Artsy is still presenting artists and artworks in ways relatively close to classical art
history texts, albeit with a focus on the visual contextualisation of artworks. The networks found in the
sample do not present any really innovative linkages.
Answering the research questions then, it was firstly concluded that the Artsy algorithm does,
in theory, facilitate new knowledge associations and art clusters, but that Artsy does not yet employ
this possibility because the company only adds a small amount of metadata to each artist and allows
the system to only depict a very limited number of related artists and related genes. Secondly,
addressing the second sub question on how expertise was valued at Artsy, it was concluded that
expertise was being valued in association with accredited, high-quality sources and institutions, rather
then through training and formal education. Expertise, in short, played a role in Artsy that it was
valued as a craft rather then a lesson learned.
With this, the main research question ‘how the digital age has impacted art knowledge
formation’ was answered saying that, on the one hand the digital age has created new, more efficient
IT infrastructures, thus allowing for more versatile access to different forms of expertise and, on the
other hand, that metadata allows for more diverse and innovative ways of knowledge formation. Artsy
however has only taken a few hesitant steps down this path, adding only a minimum layer of
information to content as it is already available in classical scources. Other institutions (or Artsy itself)
might in the future make more use of the possibilities available, though future research will have to
look into that.","['Artsy', 'Digital age', 'Knowledge formation', 'Metadata']"

Zo heeft het kabinet en regio’s voor de MKB-innovatiestimulering Regio en Topsectoren (MIT) in 2015 gezamenlijk 50 miljoen euro beschikbaar gesteld (TNO, 2015) Deze MIT-regeling is bedoeld om innovatieve mkb’s te laten profiteren van het sectorenbeleid. Dit beleid heeft tot doel overheid, onderwijs- en kennisinstellingen en ondernemingen (hierna: de drie O’s) samen te laten werken aan innovatie in Topconsortia voor Kennis en Innovatie (TKI) (PNOConsultants, 2015; Topsectoren, 2015). In de TKI’s zoeken wetenschappers en ondernemers van de negen sectoren gezamenlijk naar manieren om nieuwe producten en diensten op de markt te brengen (Ibid.). De samenwerking tussen de drie O’s wordt ook wel het ‘gouden driehoek’ genoemd. Dankzij zulke samenwerkingen is het mogelijk om kennis specifieke innovatie te realiseren (Ministerie van Economische Zaken, 2014:2). Dit is belangrijk voor de economische groei in de regio. De gemeenten en provincies werken nemen daarom ook deel aan deze samenwerkingsverbanden. Dit onderzoek gaat in op de samenwerking tussen deze drie O’s die in de sectoren Agri & Food, Chemie en Water samenwerken op het gebied van onder andere innovatie. Dit komt verder in dit hoofdstuk aan bod.
Nederland heeft een belangrijke kenniseconomie. Om de groei van welvaart verder te stimuleren is het bevorderen van innovatie noodzakelijk. Door ontwikkelingen als globalisering gaan innovatieprocessen sneller dan ooit en om deze bij te houden is kennis nodig. Nederlandse ondernemingen en kennisinstellingen hebben die kennis en expertise en kunnen bijdragen aan de oplossingen van maatschappelijke problemen, zoals grondstoffensschaarste (Kamp, 2014:1). Het bevorderen van onderzoek en het stimuleren van kenniscirculatie is belangrijk om op deze maatschappelijke uitdagingen in te spelen. Innovatieve mkb-bedrijven spelen dus een belangrijke rol in de samenwerking met kennisinstellingen en andere ondernemingen, omdat zij onmisbaar zijn voor meer innovatie en versterking van de Nederlandse economie. Het blijkt echter dat de samenwerking tussen mkb-bedrijven en kennisinstellingen niet soepel verloopt (Kamp, 2014:4). Verder wordt er actief naar samenwerking gezocht door decentrale overheden. Zo willen provincies en gemeenten door onderling samen te werken de regio op economisch vlak versterken. Het succes hangt onder andere af van een goede afstemming van initiatieven waarin de krachten gebundeld worden (Rijksoverheid, 2011:2,6). Het komt er op neer dat een samenwerking in de negen sectoren de opgave hebben om resultaten te behalen, zodat het een bijdrage levert aan de regionale economie. Voordat resultaten behaald kunnen worden is het van belang dat de samenwerking goed verloopt, zodat de doelen worden behaald.",

Dit maakt het onderzoek naar Voetbal International maatschappelijk relevant. De kwalitatieve insteek van het onderzoek levert verdiepend inzicht op in de manier waarop de sportjournalisten van Voetbal International betekenis geven aan huidskleur en etniciteit. De kwalitatieve analyse maakt het mogelijk om patronen te ontdekken die op het eerste oog niet zichtbaar zijn. De analyse is uitgevoerd vanuit het cultural studies perspective waarbij de strijd om betekenisgeving een belangrijk uitgangspunt vormt. Er is dus oog voor zowel het dominante discours als de alternatieve discoursen. Er zijn in totaal 10 afleveringen geanalyseerd die zijn uitgezonden in november en december van 2014. Uit het onderzoek is geconcludeerd dat het zogenaamde mentaal-fysieke discours dominant is en gebruikt wordt om tijdens de betekenisgeving onderscheid te maken in etnische groepen. De bevindingen geven een discours weer waarin de witte spelers positief naar voren komen binnen het mentale thema en de niet-witte spelers positief naar voren komen binnen het fysieke thema. De witte spelers worden omschreven in termen als slim, technisch, leiders en harde werkers. Dit zijn positieve associaties die behoren tot de categorie: mentale kwaliteiten. De niet-witte spelers worden positief omschreven in termen als snel en krachtig, kwaliteiten die behoren tot het fysieke thema. Binnen de context van sportevenementen lijken beide categorieën positief, maar het gaat echter ten koste van de erkenning die de niet-witte sporters krijgen voor hun prestaties. Als we dit binnen de sociaal-economische context plaatsen, zien we dat er bij het invullen van de ‘hogere functies’ in de maatschappij veel waarde wordt gehecht aan de mentale kwaliteiten en dat de fysieke kwaliteiten vooral tot hun recht komen in de ‘lagere functies’ van de arbeidsmarkt. Het mentaal-fysieke discours versterkt dus mogelijk op deze manier de machtspositie van de witte meerderheidsgroep in de westerse samenleving.","['sportmedia', 'talkshows', 'discours', 'huidskleur', 'etniciteit']"
Struggling with making equitable room for people in redevelopment,"Sanabria, G.P.",2015-11-02,['Morales C.'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Nowadays the role of community participation in the policy making process has been highlighted as a guarantee of success and quality of public policies. It is argued as a way to ensure transformation of existing development practice, of the social relations and institutional practices that cause social exclusion (Hickey and Mohan, 2004, p.13). UN-Habitat seems to capture the mentioned concepts by establishing participation and the equitable distribution of charges (costs) and benefits as important and key urban and territorial planning principles (UN-Habitat, 2014). This phenomenon has been extended up to all the possible fields of policy making. Thus, land management policies cannot be the exception for this. Therefore, the literature and organisations like UN-Habitat have started to highlight the benefits of the application of community participation in land instruments which are highly connected to people like Land Readjustment (LR). In this sense community participation is seen as a tool to improve the performance and outcomes of Land Readjustment as a land management instrument (Hong and Tierney, 2013).
This work explores the impact or influence that community participation can have in Land readjustment projects. In specific it analyses this relationship in one of the most important characteristics of this land instrument: the equitable distribution of costs and benefits. This study argues that community participation can have an important impact in the equity of the distribution of costs and benefits of the LR, by enhancing it or undermining it depending on the variables with which participation takes place. The outcome of a participation process is influenced by several variables because these processes are not static. The outcomes can change and influence the proposal discussed between the promoters of the instruments and the landowners, having an impact on its equitable distribution of costs and benefits. By focusing on the LR of the triangle of Fenicia in Bogotá Colombia as a specific case study, this research examines the most important variables of community participation in the case of Fenicia that influence its outcome. This illustrates how participation affects the equitable distribution of costs and benefits of the readjustment from the perspective of theory in this field and in two specific cases which are bound by Colombian law.
The study makes use of qualitative information, obtained through interviews and meeting with key informants and the review of secondary and primary documents. The analysis of the information led to the identification of how the main variables affect the outcome of the participation process, Moreover, the impact on the equity of the distribution was assessed through a qualitative analysis based on rules extracted from theory that point out in which situations or with which characteristics a readjustment can be equitable or not. The community participation process of the triangle of Fenicia results showed2 stages. Each of the stages revealed a different impact on the equitable distribution of costs and benefits. The most important one took place during the second stage. The variables type of participation, social capital, power and participatory invited space, influenced the final outcome of the process through the forms of agreements between various parts of the community and the promoter. This provoked changes on the readjustment proposal. In the case of social capital, the social relationships among the actors and their networks played an important role in the process provoking new spaces for participation and providing professional support to the community. Power played an important role through elites of the area and their features which gave them the capacity to capture the process and its benefits. In this case those benefits were spread among the community. The type of participation “partnership” was a project changer through trade-offs and agreements. Consultation and information also took place, which suggests that not any kind of participation impacts the equitable distribution of costs and benefits. Finally, Participatory invited space through specific design characteristics like participants, event format and decision criteria facilitated a type of participation that change the project´s equitable distribution of costs and benefits.
The changes to the project by participation had impact on the equity in the distribution making it more inequitable. Costs were not paid in proportion to the benefits received allocating several windfalls on the community producing what theory calls benevolent elite capture.","['Land readjustment', 'equity', 'participation', 'social capital', 'power', 'participatory invited spaces', 'Bogotá']"
Creating attractive neighbourhoods.,"Grut, K.",2015-11-02,['Ruijsink S.'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"In Rotterdam gentrification is pursued as a strategy to create attractive residential neighbourhoods and a strong urban economy. Because cities are becoming more complex, more actors have stakes and are therefore involved in urban development processes. Concerns about how places support certain ways of life or businesses makes the qualities of place important. There is a need to know more about how gentrification is perceived by the users of the city, what kind of development processes the users are involved in and how the users understand the improvement of place qualities in their neighbourhood.
In order to get more knowledge about these topics, a single case study research with an explorative approach was conducted of 13 typical urban development processes in the neighbourhood Oude Noorden in Rotterdam. The area was identified as an gentrifying area by experts. The data collection method was qualitative interviews of 15 various stakeholders and observations in two participation meetings.
The first finding was that the stakeholders´ general idea of gentrification taking place in Oude Noorden was divergent from the dominant academic one which relates gentrification to displacement of lower income resident. The second finding was that the recent urban development processes could be classified in five modes of participation where the multiple stakeholders pursued different aims and played different roles. Thirdly, the reseach showed that the stakeholders assessed social, symbolic and physical improvements of place qualities resulting from the various modes of participation. Finally, in the stakeholders´ evaluation of the place qualities resulting from one of the modes of participation, all the nine aspects of gentrification were reflected. In the other four, only one aspect was occurring.
The conclusion is that the symbolic language of the gentrification strategy in policy and practices in Oude Noorden eludes the negative consequences for the lower income population. The recommadation is therefore to address the non-neutrality of the concept into the political and academic debates and to bring evidences forth. Further, the urban development processes in the complex city are involving multiple stakeholders in more collaborative ways. The classification of five modes of participation is just a start to identify the possibilites and constrains in this kind of urban development. Knowledge can be enriched from literature and research practice in the fields of governance, self-ogranization, complexity cities and urban planning.
To increase the perspectives and reflections on how residents and other users assess and improve place qualities in Oude Noorden or elsewhere, a more comprehensive research that includes the missing stakeholders and the spatial quality dimension that were not approached in this research is recommended.","['Framing of gentrification', 'collaborative planning', 'multiple stakeholders', 'mode of participation', 'assessment of place qualities', 'spatial qualities', 'experiental knowledge']"
Exploring users' Interaction with Gendered Digital Assistant Applications,M.M. Dorgathen,2015-11-02,"['L. Mosemghvdlishvili', 'J. Jansz']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Technology has always been a part of human society and has helped us shape society into what it is today and gender has always had a large influence on the development of technologies and previous studies have focused on the masculine hegemony that exist in society and therefore as well in technology. With the rise of the information age various new technological innovations have taken a place within our society and gendered digital assistant applications (DAAs) like Apple’s Siri have added another layer of complexity into studying technology in relation to gender. This because these technological artifacts can no longer be approached as gender-neutral objects and in the same way gender influences human-to-human interaction, it also influences the understanding of and interaction of users with these technologies. These technologies open up many new academic opportunities to study technology in relation to gender and being the first stepping-stone towards artificial intelligence in our society, it is important to study these changes from the beginning. The aim of this exploratory research is to uncover how users construct meaning of gendered DAAs and how this process is influenced by gender. Therefore the following research question and sub-question were formulated: How do users construct meaning of gendered digital assistants applications? And, How is the construction of meaning of gendered digital assistant applications influenced by the gender of the users? The exploratory nature of this research urges for a qualitative approach that helps to highlight subjective experiences of individuals and therefore the method of focus groups was used. A total of 20 individuals participated in four focus groups; a heterosexual mixed-gender group, homosexual mixed-gender group, a bisexual mixed gender-group and a mixed-group, each consisting of 5 participants in total. All of the participants were selected using a questionnaire and were required to use a gendered DAA called Assistant prior to the focus groups sessions. The focus group sessions were transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparison and keyword-in-context approach. The main findings of this research suggest that users create meaning out of gendered digital assistant applications through experimentation with DAAs, previous technologies, society, gender stereotypes and artificial intelligence in science fiction. It is clear, however, that this construction of meaning is difficult for many users due to the novelty of DAAs. Gender does not directly influence the understanding of the users, but indirectly influences the understanding of the previous mentioned concepts.","['Gendered Technologies', 'Gender', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Digital Assistant Applications', 'Social Shaping of Technology.']"

To do so, this thesis uses the theoretical frameworks of liberal intergovernmentalism and multi-level governance approach which help the research-er to identify which factors matter and which do not to the case. This thesis further tests the explanatory power of these two theories to Nabucco by conducting a congruence analysis. The focus of this research is placed on the states’ preference formation along the interests of the actors involved: the EU institutions, the shareholders, Turkey and Azerbaijan. Based on this analysis, this thesis concludes that the theory of intergovernmentalism better explains the failure of the European Commission in successfully launching Nabucco.",
Framing Digital Vigilantism in the Context of the Kopschop-Incident in Eindhoven,M.J. Scheffers,2015-10-21,"['D. Trottier', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The kopschop-incident refers to the assault by eight alleged offenders on an innocent victim in the city of Eindhoven on January 4, 2013. The CCTV footage of the incident, which included the assault that was released to identify the eight suspects caused moral outrage in Dutch society. This in turn resulted in attempts by digital vigilantes to identify the suspects online using social media platforms. The suspects eventually turned themselves in but received low sentences. According to the judge the suspects were already punished by the excessive media attention and the harassment by vigilantes.
Thematic analysis allowed this thesis to analyse how aspects and patterns of digital vigilantism were manifested in the dataset and how they recurred throughout the dataset. Digital vigilantism was broken down in four themes. These four themes were; moral outrage, the call for identification, the call for justice and distrust in the police. These themes derived from various studies done on digital vigilantism. Cultural embedded framing analysis focussed on the biases of the media platforms and how they emphasised certain aspects of the kopschop-incident and its aftermath in order to construct the story of the kopschop-incident. Five types of frames; values, narratives, myths, archetypes and stereotypes, were used to analyse the dataset. Each type of frame in turn was further conceptualized using various literature.
Results of the analysis showed that GeenStijl actively participated in digital vigilantism by openly naming and shaming the suspects with disregards to their privacy. Strong language and threats were used to emphasize GeenStijl’s discontent towards the suspects and criticism to the breach of
3
privacy of the suspects was heavily criticized. The policies and actions by law enforcement were also criticized and the blog showed discontent regarding the low punishments that the offenders received.
De Telegraaf showed a more nuanced and objective tone towards the kopschop-incident. De Telegraaf condemned both the actions of the suspects and of the (digital) vigilantes. The newspaper did not use threats and bad language but reminded the audience of the nature of the kopschop-incident and the public outrage that followed. De Telegraaf highlighted criticism of the suspects and their lawyers, the victim and public figures regarding the conflicting policies of law enforcement, the privacy infringement of the suspects and the sentences that the offenders received.","['Digital Vigilantism', 'Privacy Infringement', 'Web 2.0', 'Cultural Embedded Framing Analysis', 'Thematic Analysis', 'Kopschop-Incident', 'De Telegraaf', 'GeenStijl']"
"Sexting, Snapchat & Social Norms:
Because everybody is doing it?",A. Gudmundsdóttir,2015-10-20,"['J.Jansz', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research aims to uncover what social norms Icelandic youth are developing and
applying to sexting via Snapchat; the factors that influence the norm development;
and how the norms coincide or differ across age, gender, and relational contexts. It is
one of the first qualitative studies to explore sexting from youth’s perspectives. The
focus on Icelandic youth provides an excellent opportunity to yield insights into the
relative influence of the socio-cultural context due to Iceland’s small population and
the ensuing lack of anonymity among inhabitants.
The social norms theory (Berkowitz & Perkins, 1986; 1987) is used to acquire
an understanding of the influence of social norms on engagement in sexting. It is the
guiding theory of the research because it recognizes the important role of peers in
influencing youth’s behaviours. It posits that peer influence is indirect because it is
based on youth’s subjective perceptions about social norms, especially regarding its
prevalence among peers (Berkowitz, 2005).
A total of 33 participants between 16-25 years old participated in eight focus
groups that took place in Iceland in the summer of 2015. Focus groups were
considered the best means of exploring sexting norms because they simulate the
everyday conversations in which social norms develop. Due to the sensitivity of the
topic, each focus group was composed of participants that are close friends with
another. Moreover, the discussion took place from a third-person perspective that did
not require the participants to reveal any personal experiences of sexting.
The results of the thematic analysis revealed that sexting is undeniably
prevalent, yet sexting outside relationships is more stigmatized among Icelandic youth
than commonly thought. The stigma suggests that youth do not blindly sext because
‘everybody is doing it’. Rather, their decision to engage in sexting is subject to the
influence of more complex factors than merely commonness. The argument, based on
the findings, is that the predominant peer influence is more direct than the social
norms theory posits, with social pressure being an overriding factor. The thesis
concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and policy implications of the findings,
as well as reflection of the limitations and suggestions for future research.","['Sexting', 'Social Norms', 'Social Pressure', 'Snapchat', 'Icelandic Youth']"

Bottom-Up inclusionary housing in middle-income Neighbourhoods
Of Kigali City","Ndicunguye, R. (Richard)",2015-10-01,['Keunen E.

Reviewed literatures reveal that this target to be achieved requires top-down efforts; inclusionary zoning, inclusionary housing programmes and policies, as well as incentives for private developers, being the key tools. A deeper analysis discloses that this approach has not been adopted yet in cities of the developing countries that face with rapid urbanization and affordable housing shortage for the low-income groups, due to financial limitations and housing market forces that target middle to high income groups. However, looking at some middle-income neighbourhoods of some developing cities like Kigali, a considerable number of backyard houses are observed and mainly used to accommodate low-income and lower middle-income tenants in form of small-scale rental housing market. Therefore, this research intends to explain why this process takes place and to investigate to what extent provided houses are affordable and lead to the integration of low-income groups, hence the name bottom-up inclusionary housing.","['Kigali', 'Small-scale rental housing', 'Inclusionary housing', 'affordability', 'community integration', 'motives']"

Adriaansen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Tijdens het fin de siècle (circa 1870-1914) ontstond een moderniteitskritiek die in het teken stond van de verheffing van de geest en de afkeer van het positivistische wetenschapsideaal, op basis van het argument dat de wetenschap en de samenleving onder invloed van het rationalisme ontgeestelijkt waren geraakt. Om de mensheid voor cultureel verval te behoeden, zou volgens de Nederlandse schrijver, psychiater en sociaal hervormer Frederik van Eeden (1860-1932) in de eerste plaats de vermeende innerlijke vervreemding een halt toegeroepen moeten worden. Van Eeden theoretiseerde de volgens hem overheersende invloed van het onbewuste op het bewustzijn. Het ‘onbewuste-Ik’ diende volgens Van Eeden als opslagplaats waarbinnen de nuttigheidservaringen van vorige generaties zouden worden omgezet tot een gevoelsmatig goed en kwaad, waardoor een morele evolutie ten goede voor de gehele mensheid tot de mogelijkheden zou moeten behoren. Volgens Van Eeden moest men tevens persoonlijk een innerlijke evolutie nastreven, waarbij het gevoel moest gaan prevaleren boven het verstand, het goddelijke boven het dierlijke en het onbewuste boven het bewuste. 
Een zelfnarratief is een schriftelijke of mondelinge weergave van gebeurtenissen, waarbij de lezer zich inhoudelijk gesteld ziet tegenover het ‘Ik’, of het ‘Zelf’, als schrijvend en beschrijvend subject. Het zelfnarratief biedt geen volledig inzicht in het Ik of het collectief waartoe het behoort. Het zelfnarratief biedt wel als onderdeel van een breder bronnenpakket de mogelijkheid om een genuanceerde voorstelling te krijgen van de constructie en de veranderlijkheid van het Ik binnen een sociale context. Ik zal onderzoeken op welke manier Van Eeden zijn Ik definieerde en herdefinieerde, afhankelijk van de specifieke tijd en het beoogde publiek. Wat waren de verwachtingspatronen, normen en waarden waaraan Van Eeden zich te conformeren had of zich juist verzette?
Ik zal twee verschillende soorten van Van Eedens zelfnarratieven met elkaar vergelijken. Van Eedens dagboek is mijn hoofdbron, zijn persoonlijke correspondentie gebruik ik als vergelijkend materiaal. Ik zal mij bij de analyse van het dagboek en de persoonlijke correspondentie van Van Eeden beperken tot de jaren 1885-1890, de tijd waarin Van Eeden de eerder genoemde theorie van het dubbel-Ik introduceerde. Dit is tevens de betrekkelijk korte periode in Van Eedens leven waarin hij psychiatrisch werk publiceerde.

Headed towards convergence? The development of family migration procedures in the form of 'pre-entry policies',"Bundavica, S. (Selma)",2015-09-18,"['Scholten Dr. P.W.A. (Peter)', 'Nispen Dr. F.K.M. van (Frans)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In recent years an ever-increasing set of demands regarding integration requirements for
family migrants has made its way on the political agenda of European member states
such as Germany and The Netherlands. When choosing between either a similar
(convergent) or dissimilar (divergent) explanatory framework to assess the extent of
progress that has been made on this policy field, as well as to evaluate the similarities
between these two countries in their process towards the development of restrictive
family migration policies, the convergent model proves to be predominant. In addition,
the hypothesis which explores the concept of policy transfer, where best practices
regarding migration policies are being exchanged and implemented between member
states, provides the best explanatory fit. Throughout this research, it becomes quite clear
that Germany and The Netherlands are countries that share a comparable institutional
background and a similar set of norms and values, which enables them to learn from
each other’s policies and sometimes even follow the same line of argumentation as
regards to the implementation of new family migration policies with a restrictive
character. However, this does not mean that the same means lead to the same ends, as
Germany and the Netherlands still maintain some differences in the way they voice their
motivations, justifications and preferences as regards to imposing restrictions on the
family migration policy agenda. For instance, while Germany focuses more on socioeconomic
inclusion and making less educated migrants more independent through
increasing linguistic proficiency, the Dutch feel that well-developed linguistic skills in
combination with knowledge about Dutch society should lead to socio-cultural inclusion,
or ‘assimilation’ of less-advantaged migrant groups. However, due to increased
coordination ambitions and cooperation efforts encouraged through the supranational
level by EU institutions, it is nonetheless very likely that persistent patterns of divergence
will gradually downsize over time, while patterns of convergence will be more apparent.",
(DIS)TRUST IN THE EU,"Fernandes de Sousa, F.P. (Fernanda)",2015-09-18,"['Nispen Dr. F.K.M. van (Frans)', 'Walle Prof.dr. S. van de (Steven)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Newspapers articles, magazine covers and even the evening news in Member States of the European Union often show great interest in the topic trust in the European Union as part of the widely reported developments in politics. No wonder the media focusses on these developments, because trust is a very important topic in democracies. Like any other democratic system, the European Union relies for support on its citizens’ trust in the institutions of that Union. The European Union gathers statistical information through Eurostat, which is a Directorate-General of the European Commission. Eurostat provides statistical information to the institutions of the European Union, amongst which is a survey conducted twice a year on the trust in the European Union and in its institutions.
The surveys conducted by Eurostat show that the past decade trust levels in the bodies of the European Union, specifically the European Parliament have significantly declined. Some years report strong negative figures which gives reason to study the topic of trust, particularly trust in the European Union and its causes. This research aims to analyze possible causes of the declining trust levels in the European Parliament. In order to do so, this study begins with a review of the literature on the topic of trust in institutions, governments and the European Union. We proceed with selecting possible causes for the decline in trust and laying out the research design to test the hypotheses, after which we use a multilevel linear regression test to identify which of the previously selected indicators are found to have significant influence on trust in the European Parliament.","['trust', 'European Parliament', 'European Union']"

Dit onderzoek wijst uit dat het functioneren van de raad van toezicht maar weinig invloed heeft op de veiligheid in de ouderenzorg. Ook blijkt dat grotere organisaties lager scoren op veiligheid dan kleinere zorgorganisaties. Via een internet-enquête is hiervoor de rol en het functioneren van de raad van toezicht en de veiligheid van ouderenzorgorganisaties onderzocht onder 185 zorgbestuurders. Om het functioneren van de raad van toezicht te operationaliseren zijn sociale cohesie, inspanningsnorm, gebruik van kennis en vaardigheden en transformationeel leiderschap als afhankelijke variabele gebruikt. Veiligheid is als onafhankelijke variabele geoperationaliseerd als veiligheidscultuur. Van alle variabelen blijkt dat alleen de sociale cohesie tussen de leden van de raad van toezicht ertoe doet als het gaat om de veiligheidscultuur.","['raad van toezicht', 'board dynamics', 'veiligheid', 'veiligheidscultuur', 'governance', 'ouderenzorg']"

In drie organisaties is het management geslonken. In twee organisaties is zelfs een managementlaag vervallen doordat verantwoordelijkheden lager in de organisaties worden gelegd door in te zetten op zelforganiserende teams (Abrona), zelfwerkende teams (Middin) of zelfstandige teams (Syndion). Hierdoor is de span of control van het management vergroot en kunnen deze organisaties met minder directeuren of managers volstaan. Al met al zijn dit de zes voornaamste onderzoeksbevindingen:
1. De organisaties streven naar een maximale autonomie van teams. 
2. Daarmee worden verantwoordelijkheden zo laag mogelijk in de organisaties belegd.
 3. Door verplatting en afslanking van management is de afstand van de middenmanager naar de direct leidinggevende vergroot en ervaren middenmanagers meer verantwoordelijkheid. 
4. De organisaties werken met minder middenmanagers waardoor hun span of control is vergroot. 
5. De grotere afstand tussen middenmanagers en hun teams resulteert erin dat middenmanagers meer faciliterend/voorwaardenscheppend en minder sturend richting teams opereren.","['middenmanagers', 'gehandicaptenzorg', 'zelfsturende teams', 'autonome teams', 'management', 'organisatieverandering']"
Happy Blue: The impact of water-bodies on happiness by visual perception of human defining landscape aesthetic in context of Rotterdam.,"Mahmood, T. (Tabassum)",2015-09-01,"['Wall R.S. (Ronald)', 'Budding-Polo Ballinas M. (Monserrat)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"In 2050, 70% of the expected world population will concentrate in cities creating pressure on land planning and resource management. Already, the cities of the world are taking different initiatives and projects within their economic capacity to address the challenge. Economic and Financial assessments are done to prioritize the projects and ultimately those assessments become the decision tools.
The conventional practise of cost-benefit analysis faces methodological challenges in case of assessing cultural eco-system service because of their non-marketable economic benefit. Due to this difficulty, within the assessment process some vital criteria remains unaddressed and the benefits associated with them lacks internalisation. As a result those services are devaluated, making them vulnerable in case of management and protection. Therefore, the driving decision maker of development projects mainly considers the objective wellbeing issue and subjective gain of Human remains unnoticed.
The main objective of this research is to find out a solution and built up a model to assess this intangible good. Aesthetic service of Eco-system services needs human perception and for measuring human perception the model that has been formulated for this research has taken “Water-body” as an example from the landscape elements and to assess its aesthetic service “Happiness” has been taken as the measuring scale.
Consulting Aesthetic theories it has been understood that Aesthetic services are not dispersed randomly across a landscape, but rather follow particular patterns in terms of the intensity, richness and diversity in their provision resulting hotspots and cold-spots in urban landscape. Therefore, the possibility of measuring them can be realized. Consulting and going through the previous researches conducted regarding landscape aesthetics and human perception three measurable indicators, i.e. availability, accessibility and acceptability were isolated to valuate aesthetic service in urban landscape. Therefore, the main objective of this endeavour was to explain how the availability, accessibility and acceptability of water-bodies through aesthetic service impacts happiness on the ground of “Need gratification”. Due to availability of data from “The municipality of Rotterdam” the opportunity to conduct the research has been materialized. This was an “Explanatory-Quantitative Research”, as the subject matter is “Unconscious Happiness” the result can be generalized for the human race but not only from theory from research strategy the generalizability needed to be induced. Therefore, survey as research strategy has been taken and a massive volume of data were analysed to draw conclusion.","['Visual perception', 'Aesthetic service', 'Urban landscape', 'Water-body', 'Happiness']"
Cost effectiveness analysis of low emission Iron and steel production,"Bempah, J.",2015-09-01,"['Grafakos S.', 'D’Acci L.']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The iron and steel sector is the largest industrial energy consumer and largest emission source of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) and primary air pollutants. With the growing concern over climate
change, steel makers are faced with the challenge of finding ways of lowering CO2 emissions
without seriously undermining process efficiency or considerably adding to costs. Steel is central
to Ghana’s current infrastructure, housing, manufacturing, agriculture, water and energy supply
hence the backbone of economic development. As an emerging economy whose population
continues to increase, the demand for steel in the next decade will also increase leading to the use
of more fossil fuel and emissions of GHGs and primary air pollutants. In order to minimize these
impacts and to deliver a manufacturing strategy based around “low emission”, iron and steel
industries in Ghana need to adopt a number of innovative and new technological measures that is
cost-effective and has the potential to reduce emissions of GHG and unintentionally produced
primary air pollutants.
In the following research, assessment of the most cost effectiveness of different measures that
will reduce the emission of CO2 and primary air pollutants in iron and steel industries was
conducted. This was conducted by: estimating the annual CO2 reduction capacity of each
measure; estimation of the total operational costs or investment for each pollution abatement
measure and calculating and ranking of possible pollution abatement measures based on their
cost-effectiveness ($ per year reduced kg CO2). The result was used to construct marginal
abatement cost curves (MACCs). Near net shape casting thin slab was the most cost effective
alternative climate and air pollution abatement measure. For the assessment of the current cost
effective CO2 abatement measures, IMF was found to be the most cost-effective production route
compared to EAF. Hence, the implementation of these measures will be critical to reach the
environmental objectives of low emission iron and steel production. A comparative assessment of the two major iron and steelmaking route available in Ghana
namely electric arc furnace (EAF) and induction melting furnace (IMF) was conducted against a
selection of energy consumption and emission (CO2 eq and priority air pollutants) indicators.
The results showed that, EAF has higher energy consumption requirements and emissions than
the IMF route. Thus EAF production route has the most significant low emission reduction
challenges.
The study also incorporates investigation of barriers that account for the adoption and
implementation of low emission measures in Ghanaian iron and steel industries. Results from the
barriers interviews revealed that, “lack of budget funding”, “access to capital/investment”, “high
cost of energy”, “cost of raw materials and production”, “inefficient technology” and “lack of
technical skills” are considered to be of high importance. This result provides a good insight for
future industrial policies towards low emission manufacturing.
The study recommends further studies into energy efficiency measures, which is among one of
the most cost-effective investments that the iron and steel industries could make in improving
efficiency and productivity, and reducing CO2 and local air pollutant emissions. Again further
studies into the barriers for adoption and implementation of low emission measures should
incorporate views of external stakeholders to give a more comprehensive view of the subject
studied and facilitates broad base knowledge suitable for policy implementation.","['Low emission', 'Iron and steel industry', 'Cost-effectiveness', 'Barriers', 'Ghana']"
The influence of Multi-actor Coordination on urban household Water Access,"Okok, M.O.",2015-09-01,['Gianoli A.'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This thesis brings into perspective the role of coordination in a multi-actor system; how its nature and level can influence governance outcomes, and the need for a coordination framework in an environment that involves multiple actors.
The objective of this thesis is to provide an insight on how the nature and level of coordination among multiple actors in water provision affect urban household water access, knowledge which can facilitate the development of best coordination practices and improved service delivery in urban informal settlements. The research questions of this thesis are: What is the nature and level of actors’ coordination in the provision of water in Kawangware informal settlement? What is the existing state of household water access in Kawangware informal settlement? In which ways has the nature and level of coordination of multiple actors contributed to the state of water access in Kawangware informal settlement in Nairobi?
The research strategy was a case study that focused on Kawangware, an informal settlement in Nairobi city characterised by persistent water scarcity despite active involvement of multiple actors undertaking water provision actions. Data collection methods employed were interviews and household survey using interview guide and questionnaires respectively. In addition, secondary data from reports and policy documents was also used to a lesser extent to triangulate information. The informants for the study were derived from different institutions and organizations including government, non-governmental and private sector actors working on water provision in the area. Households in the informal settlement were also sampled and formed part of the respondents. The thesis framework has been conceptualized based on a detailed review of literature. The literature discusses the rising climate induced urban water scarcity, the need for adaptation and the position of coordination of actors in the climate adaptation governance process. A review of multi-actor system and the sub-activities of coordination provides the conceptual framework for understanding the relational dynamics and its influence on governance outcome which is improved household water access in this context.
This study reveals that coordination influences water governance outcomes by acting on the intermediate factors such as resource pooling and mobilization, service delivery efficiency, technology and knowledge transfer, conflict resolution, spatial equity and ability to influence public policy and planning. As a consequence, low level of actors’ coordination in Kawangware has led to poor household water access when bench marked with national and international standards, with majority of residents lacking piped water within their household vicinity. They also experience irregular water availability, low flow rates and long waiting times before collecting water.","['Actors', 'Coordination', 'Governance', 'Multi-actor system', 'Household water access']"
The effectiveness of property tax pilot on the price of residential housing in Shanghai,"Wu, X.",2015-09-01,['Rabé P.'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"After 1998, the real estate market in China experienced many rounds of policy regulations in the following years. However, the effect on the price of residential housing is not obvious. Hence, Shanghai as a pilot introduced property tax on the residential houses. This research focuses on the effectiveness of property tax pilot on the residential housing in Shanghai. The main goal of this research is to analyse the influence of property tax pilots to see whether it can restrain the growing price of residential housing or just a value capture instrument to obtain the revenue. In this study, a combination of quantitative and qualitative research is conducted. In detail, a hedonic model and in-depth interviews are applied. It is found that the property has negative effect the housing price by decreasing the demand and increasing the supply. Besides, the property tax can be used as effective long-term tools for restrain the growing housing price. And it is a stable income to provide social housing to low-income people. At last, some advices are given. The study suggested that at least 5 years data or more are needed. And some important factors like population, employment and consumption should be included in the model and interviews. In addition, more samples are necessary for the in-depth interview.","['Property Tax', 'Housing Price', 'Effect', 'Hedonic Model', 'Policy']"
Innovative Financing for Housing the Urban Poor in Uganda,"Bahumwire, R.",2015-09-01,"['Peters Geurts E.', 'Odile M.']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Having adequate housing provides personal security, health and dignity and is a fundamental human right to all (UN-Habitat 2009), which legitimately satisfies the needs of a household and offers legal protection against forced evictions. The housing sector in Uganda like any other developing countries has undergone a paradigm shift since independence, from state sponsored, to neoleberalism (private sector provision) but the low-income population still suffers from a huge housing deficit especially in urban areas. Lack of innovative and appropriate housing finance mechanisms, which are tailored to incremental housing processes, have aggravated the low-cost housing deficit in Uganda. It is against this background that this research sought to answer the question: “What is the effect of incremental housing finance on access to a core house and its upgrading? In answering this question, a desk based review of related literature, which developed a theoretical framework for this research was undertaken followed by the field study that was conducted in the Stanbic Nam project in Mukono Uganda.","['housing provides', 'personal security', 'health and dignity', 'Uganda']"

Being closely adjacent to the Yogyakarta Municipality, Sleman receives many spill-over effects from Yogyakarta’s economic boom, especially in terms of new settlements and business areas. To support the economic development in Yogyakarta, many housing developers build their new projects around Sleman. Two of most popular sub-districts in Sleman for development are the Depok district and the Ngaglik district. For the past 5 years, these two sub-districts have been experiencing rapid new housing development. Many of these new housing areas are built within a neighbourhood. This development finally changes the built environment in the neighbourhood, risking to alter children’s outdoor activity places.
On the other hand, playing is very important for children psychological development and subjective well-being. Through playing, children develop their cognitive ability and their identity. Playing also boosts children’s confidence through their interaction with their peers It is widely agreed that children with good cognitive development and strong identity will strive more in society also have bigger chance to have a high life satisfaction score.","['children', 'subjective well-being', 'happiness', 'built environment', 'neighbourhood']"
The role and impacts of subsidy in land readjustment,"Kubo, Y.",2015-09-01,['Schechinger C.M.'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This research mainly focused on the relationship between financial effectiveness and the use of government subsidy in Land Readjustment (hereafter referred to as “LR”) in Thailand. The introduction of LR method in Thailand started in 1980s and finally established by the LR Act in 2004. As for the financial characteristic of LR in general, the result of literature review implies that self-finance principle can be achieved by selling the land called “reserved land”, which is contributed from the participants of the LR project. Since the existence of government subsidy in the LR project in Thailand is contradictory on this principle, the research tried to find out the role of the subsidy and its effectiveness by analysing the LR pilot projects implemented in Thailand.
Research method utilized in this thesis is a case study by comparing three different pilot projects as well as the individual interviews with key persons in charge of the pilot projects. Two of the analysed pilot projects were applied for the government subsidy by means of loans and grant, and the other pilot project did not apply for the subsidy.","['Effectiveness', 'Subsidies', 'Land Readjustment']"
Environment dimensions of quality of life,"Novitasari, F.",2015-09-01,"['Wall R.', 'Stavropoulos S.']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The understanding and improvement of the human living environment have been major goals of individuals, researchers, communities and governments. The overall assessment of humans’ living environment has been commonly expressed by the term quality of life across multiple disciplines. An understanding quality of life has tremendous potential implications because improving quality of life is a major policy and sustainability goal. In order to obtain the comprehensive understanding about quality of life and sustainable development aspect, recently, several global institutions used a number of standard tools to measure aspects of environmental quality in relation to quality of life.
The main purpose of the quality of life measurement is providing tangible information about what is needed for the accomplishment of a good life, value of humankind, how strong human bonds are and the relationship to the environment. As one of the prominent developing countries, Indonesia sought to expand the availability of data regarding regarding quality of life and environmental quality to support improvements on sustainable development.
Therefore, this research measure the relationship between environmental quality dimensions and quality of life in Indonesia during 2010 to 2013. There are three major environmental quality dimensions that have been used for this research, which are: environmentally responsible behaviour, physical environmental quality, and consumption of environmental services. The objective quality of life dimensions are established from good health condition and life expectancy at birth. Meanwhile, there are also several control variable derived from demographic and social dimensions.","['Environmentally responsible behaviour', 'Physical Environmental Quality', 'Consumption of Environmental Services', 'Quality of Life']"
"People, Planet, Prosperity","Rivera, A.C.",2015-09-01,"['Wall R.S.', 'Budding-Polo Ballinas M.']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The emergence of happiness economics has resulted in the increased interest to use happiness as an indicator for national development and as a basis for formulating country policies. As such, governments of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, United Arab Emirates, and China have expressed interest in using national happiness as a prime goal for policy. The same is done by the United Nations General Assembly which encouraged countries to pursue measures to reflect the importance of pursuing happiness and well-being in development.
Likewise, sustainable development has taken a major turn in the development sphere. This 2015, UN Member States will be adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which will expand and continue the efforts started in the Millennium Development goals set to expire in the same year. The SDGs, which contain 17 goals and 100 indicators, aim to achieve multidimensional development in various areas such as dignity, people, planet, partnership, justice, and prosperity for present and future generations. A key improvement in the SDGs is the inclusion of measures of evaluative well-being as one of the indicators to capture a reflective assessment of an individual’s overall satisfaction with life.
One of the hindrances in achieving sustainable development and increasing happiness levels of citizens is the limited resources of governments. Likewise, there is also an emerging need to determine if sustainable development goals on economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability really reflect the well-being and happiness of citizens of countries. However, the challenge still prevails on how countries can maximize resources to achieve greater happiness and at the same time achieve sustainable development for present and future generations. The objectives of this research, therefore, is to explore the sustainable development factors, focusing on people, planet, and prosperity indicators and how these factors relate to happiness levels of countries. The research also studied how sustainable development indicators affect the happiness of different income groups and regional clusters as there are more similarities in terms of happiness and development levels across these groups. This becomes even more important as the determinants of happiness for one income group or region is not the same for all income groups or regions.","['Happiness', 'Life Satisfaction', 'Sustainable Development', 'Happiness Economics']"
Understanding the Impact of Foreign Direct Investment on the Happiness of Countries,"Kanweri, G.",2015-09-01,"['Wall R.S.', 'Stavropoulos S.']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This research study explains the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on the happiness of countries.
The study was aimed at explaining the direct and indirect impact of inward and outward FDI on happiness of countries and the related spatial variation of such impact across different regions of the world. This explanation was achieved through answering the main research questions; to what degree does inward and outward Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) influence Happiness of countries? And the sub research questions which included; Does FDI directly influence happiness of countries? Does inward and outward FDI influence indicators of happiness implying an indirect influence of FDI on happiness? To what degree does the indirect and direct influence on happiness vary across regions?
The study used quantitative methods and secondary data to accomplish to obtain answers the research questions. It involved construction of six years panel data on happiness; the dependent (Y) variable, and independent (X) variables of inward and outward FDI as well on other variables that were controlled for, namely; unemployment, carbon emissions, electric power consumption per capita, control of corruption, percentage of total population living in urban areas, percentage of total population with access to protected source, country and population size.

The effect of the human development index on wellbeing of nations,"Didas, M.",2015-09-01,"['Wall R.', 'Stavropoulos S.']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Globally, studies concerning the Wellbeing of nations have gained much importance, because of the new approach they bring to the social science realm. They introduce the use of non-financial factors as a means of citizens evaluating their Wellbeing in view of governments’ service delivery. In developing countries however, Wellbeing continues to be a challenge because issues of human development have been given little attention than required. This can be solved by having a prosperous, healthy and skilled population that is able to handle the continent’s future challenges. It is based on the above background that this study aimed at explaining the relationship between human development index and Wellbeing of citizens in developing countries.
The major objective of this study was to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on Wellbeing and HDI globally but most importantly highlight its plight in developing economies. This was because despite there being many studies on Wellbeing, they have either concentrated on developed countries or dealt with how income, education and health separately or in a combination with other factors affect Wellbeing but literature on HDI and Wellbeing is very minimal. The study employed a survey strategy by reviewing secondary data collected by the World Bank, Gallup-Healthways, World Happiness Report 2015, UNESCO, WHO and UNDP; in addition to other several sources. Indicators for 8 years (2006-2013) were used. A total of 39 developing countries in the region were studied among three continents of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This was based on the World Bank categorisation of these countries as developing economies, under low and lower income economies.
Data was analysed using Excel, and STATA tools that modelled indicators using a linear random effects- regression to determine the significant relationship between HDI and Wellbeing. Both descriptive and explanatory methods were used to analyse, interpret and report results. This model was chosen because the data used was of panel in nature and included both time variant and invariant indicators.
From the findings, it came out clearly and strongly that the relationship between HDI is strong and evident in developing countries. The findings revealed that there is a positive significant relationship between HDI and Wellbeing irrespective of the country size, income and population. Furthermore, the findings revealed that among the variables that make HDI, health and income contribute greatly towards influencing Wellbeing. However, other factors such as demography, location and governance also play an important role towards improving citizen’s Wellbeing.
In view of the findings therefore, income, health, education, accessibility, governance, demography, and location are important factors countries should consider to transform society and attain a healthier, productive, and knowledgeable society. Although given peculiar differences between continents, this may not be generalised across the entire region but specific continental responsiveness to the model may be applied as explained in chapter four and five. Though this model can be generalised for the entire developing world, given the number of country observations per continent, it best suits Sub Saharan Africa.","['Wellbeing', 'Human Development Index', 'Developing Countries', 'Global South', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'Development Priorities']"
The influence of the urban built environment on the happiness of residents in Rotterdam,"Cajarte, T.J.G.",2015-09-01,"['Fransen J.', 'Wall R.']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"In the field of happiness economics, there is limited literature on the influence of places on subjective well-being. Much of the research on the determinants of happiness have focused on individual or life circumstances such as income, health, family and social life, and work while environmental factors relating to the spatial and built environment are less common. There is a growing number of studies which have shown that characteristics of places have an impact on people’s well-being but the empirical evidence is still scarce particularly in cities where the physical environment is a ubiquitous part of life.
The main objective of this research is to determine the characteristics of the built environment that significantly affect city residents’ happiness, life satisfaction and satisfaction in different urban life domains. The role of urban life domains in predicting subjective well-being is also examined. The research used the bottom-up model on life satisfaction and satisfaction from the urban life domains of housing, neighbourhood and the city to predict subjective well-being. The mediating role of urban life domains was also studied to better understand the effect of the built environment on subjective well-being.
A survey was conducted in two types of neighbourhoods in the city of Rotterdam, one in a highly built-up area and another in a less built-up area. Secondary data was also gathered from official sources. The data was analyzed through multiple ordered probit regressions following Baron and Kenny’s (1986) approach to mediation analysis.
The research provides empirical evidence that the built environment has a direct effect and can predict happiness and life satisfaction as well as satisfaction in urban life domains. The built environment characteristics that were found to be significant to both happiness and life satisfaction are house size satisfaction, estimated travel time from home to work, access to parks and green areas in the neighbourhood, access to medical facilities in the neighbourhood, access to sports facilities in the neighbourhood, satisfaction with city education services and city traffic perception.","['Built environment', 'Happiness', 'Life satisfaction', 'Quality of life', 'Mediation analysis']"
"Military Real Estate Welfare, Karachi","Alvi, D.S.",2015-09-01,['Morales-Schechinger C.'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The city of Karachi in Pakistan presents a unique situation in which the land that falls under the physical boundary of the city is controlled by fifteen land owning agencies. The city government controls only 31 percent of the land. Most of the highly valued land of the city falls under the jurisdiction of two agencies; the Defence Housing Authority and the Co-operative Housing Societies. DHA, being an authority rather than a co-operative, being larger in the amount of land that it controls, and established as a welfare system for the military, hence, is a more interesting and unique specimen to study in terms of land development and the real estate process. The exploratory study circles around to what extent DHA uses the different stages of the real estate process (land acquisition, land regulations and land leasing) and its resultant high value of land to provide welfare to the military officers of the country.
A case study approach is adopted to study the causal relationships in this phenomenon and both qualitative and quantitative data are used, extracted from both primary and secondary data sources. DHA phase 8 is used as the sample area and military officials who have received welfare through first hand allotment in this phase have been the primary source of information among others. The data reveals the partial success of the system through their cases in receiving welfare benefits as the initial investment into obtaining the allotment is higher than the value of the land within the first ten years. This makes the welfare exclusive to the officers from rich backgrounds that have savings to not only buy the land in the first place, but also are able to incur the development charges.
The study discusses policy recommendations that can aid in improving the efficiency of this process to make it more encompassing thus providing welfare for all.","['Military Welfare', 'Welfare', 'Real Estate Welfare', 'DHA', 'Karachi', 'land development']"
"Speculative Informal Housing Provision and its Socio- spatial Impacts on Greater Cairo Areas, A case study on ‘El-Matareya’","Tawakol, D.",2015-09-01,['Jachnow A.'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Speculative informal housing described by Sims (2012) as “one-off towers” has been a
growing urbanization mode in Greater Cairo particularly after the January 2011 revolution.
Built by profit-oriented developers they emerge, in spite of the government’s attempts to ban
illegal construction, with striking heights, fulfil a large array of housing needs, and
significantly impact informal areas where they develop.
This research aims to understand how this self-organized housing provision takes place, what
shelter outcomes it achieves and what socio-spatial impacts it triggers in the area it develops.
The study is conducted on the case of “El Matareya”, which is a typical example for the 83%
of informal settlements in Greater Cairo that have developed on private agricultural land
(Sims, 2012). In addition, “El Matareya” has witnessed recent activity of speculative housing
construction, thus socio-spatial impacts are well manifested. The main research question is:
What are the socio-spatial impacts of the informal, speculative housing provision process on
areas such as “El Matareya” since the January 2011 revolution?
The sub-questions are: Which interactions take place in the informal, speculative housing
provision process? What are their drivers? What governance characteristics affect the
provision process? How does the recent development of the area, triggered by speculative
housing provision, impact the space? What are the social manifestations of the provision
process?
A literature review is conducted on informal urbanization, particularly informal speculative
housing worldwide and in Greater Cairo, and on various self-organization concepts, from
which a conceptual framework for the study is derived. The study investigates how trust and
power relations, actors’ motivations and rule of law affect the interactions between the main
actors during the housing provision process, thus leading to certain socio-spatial
configurations.
The research uses a case study design and qualitative data collection method to ensure a deep
understanding of the complex relations between the beneficiaries of the provision process and
to capture the contextual impacts and manifestations. During the fieldwork from June 14th till
July 11th 2015,
16 semi-structured interviews and moreover discussions are conducted with developers,
residents, regulator representatives and experts to cover the subject from the diverse
perspectives. A diverse housing sample is studied, with a focus on speculative towers.
Through site visits and structured observation the quality of speculative housing, and its
relation and impact on the neighbourhood are investigated. Further on, secondary data is
collected including reports on “El Matareya”, housing studies, relevant books and researches,
law documents, papers and articles. Different data sources are used to ensure the validity of
the research.
The findings of the research show that informal speculative housing provision interactions,
between developers, residents and the local district, lead to heterogeneous socio-spatial
patterns in El-Matareya, that have positive but also a large extent of negative impacts on the
area’s development. Patterns differ from one tower to another and from one provision process
to another; however, there are general trends observable. The provision process is
significantly impacted by the factors: decreased level of trust of residents to developers;
prevailing economic motivation of the developers; power tensions but also collaborations between the local district and developers; and marginal surveillance and bureaucracy of the
legal and institutional system. A commercialized housing product is realized, that satisfies
many housing needs, but overloads and sometimes dominates the neighborhood’s services
and resources. While it adds to the modernity and residents’ diversity of El-Matareya it
decreases its social connectivity and identity.
To conclude, the self-organized provision of speculative informal housing is responsive and
adaptable to a large array of needs, yet taking place with minimal control, it often becomes
distorted. The provision process and its manifestations indicate a seemingly intended
deregulation and negligence of the state. Further on, they represent a complex continuum of
legality and illegality; combining informal practices, part of which are tolerated by the state,
or eventually become formalized and also formal and quasi-formal practices.","['Informal speculative housing', 'self-organized provision', 'socio-spatial patterns', 'trust', 'power', 'motivations', 'developer', 'rule of law', 'deregulation', 'bureaucracy', 'informality', 'El-Matareya', 'Cairo informal areas']"
The influence of human resource and electricity tariffs on operation and maintenance and its effect on the quality of electricity supply in Zambia,"Zulu, E.",2015-09-01,['brilhante O.'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Electricity utilities in Sub-Saharan Africa have been confronted with challenges of meeting electricity needs of their increasing populations and growing economies thereby putting pressure on their generation capacity and existing infrastructure. ZESCO is Zambia’s single provider of electricity which is vertically integrated at generation, transmission and distribution. Following structural adjustment reforms in the early 1990s, ZESCO was commercialized as one of the conditions for the country to attain debt relief from donors. Since its commercialization, the utility has had to contend with inadequacies in its generation capacity due to a sharp rise in demand triggered by resurgent energy intensive copper mining and a growing population. On the other hand ZESCOs transmission and distribution infrastructure has over the years suffered deterioration due to underinvestment owing to low tariffs. Furthermore, inadequate operations and maintenance due to human resource management challenges and below cost tariffs has adversely affected the performance of the utility with regards to the quality of electricity supplied to consumers.
The aim of this study was to explain the influence that human resource and low tariffs have had on ZESCOs operations and maintenance activities and how this has affected the quality of electricity supplied to consumers in Lusaka city. The quality of electricity supply has in part been affected by inadequate generation capacity which the utility has been trying to address by commissioning new power generation rehabilitation and expansion projects in an effort to meet increasing demand. However, most of these projects are long term and will take time to come on board. In the meantime the utility’s distribution and supply network remains constrained and unreliable as it suffers from overloaded lines and transformers resulting in frequent power outages. This research is therefore important as it informs decision makers on key elements of asset management and how this influences quality standards in the supply of electricity. Behavioural and management theories of organizations including the concept of strategic management were used to provide a comprehensive conceptual understanding of how ZESCO operates and provided the framework for analysis.","['Human resource', 'electricity tariffs', 'operations and maintenance', 'quality of electricity supply']"
Tragische tragedietragiek,C.M. in 't Veld,2015-08-31,['Dr. G.H. van Oenen'],Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Aanleiding voor de bachelorthesis is Nietzsches eersteling: Die Geburt der Tragödie. Dit boek is een pleidooi voor, wat Nietzsche noemt, het Dionysische. De tragedie is geboren uit de Dionysische geest van de muziek en gestorven onder de Apollinische handen van Sokrates en Euripides. Nietzsche wil de Sokratische geest breken en ziet de tragedie vanuit het mytische Gesammtkunstwerk van Wagner herleven.

Met Wagner kwam Nietzsche bedrogen uit. Maar, wat is er geworden van de Sokratische verlichtingsdenken? Mijn stelling is dat met de Tweede Wereldoorlog de Verlichting zich getransformeerd heeft tot Nietzschiaanse, Dionysische Romantiek. Helaas. Veel plezier heeft de mensheid er niet aan beleefd.

Aan het slot van de thesis verdedig ik een klassieke positie ten faveure van de tegenwoordig gangbare nihilistische casu quo postmoderne.

De hypothese was dat de verschillen in argumentatiestijl tussen beide werken ertoe zou leiden dat ze elkaar inhoudelijk zouden vermijden, ondanks het feit dat beide werken tegenstrijdige kampen vertegenwoordigen in het vrije wil debat. Peter van Inwagen hanteert in The Incompatibility of Free Will and Determinism een scherpe argumentatiestijl, waarbij de conclusie in grote mate afhangt van een heldere definitie van de begrippen vrije wil en determinisme. Daniel Dennett hanteert in Elbow Room een meer losse argumentatiestijl, waarbij de conclusie in veel grotere mate neerkomt op een intuïtief oordeel.  Gebleken is dat deze onderlinge verschillen er inderdaad toe hebben geleid dat beide werken op zeer weinig punten in direct conflict verkeren, vanwege het gebruik van verschillende concepties van het begrip vrije wil.","['The Incompatibility of Free Will and Determinism', 'Elbow Room', 'het vrije wil debat']"

Om hier zicht op te krijgen wordt filosofie met vakmanschap vergeleken. Hiertoe wordt met behulp van hedendaagse sociologen en filosofen zoals Sennett, Oosterling, Sloterdijk en Foucault teruggegrepen op de wortels van de filosofie in de Klassieke Oudheid, waarin filosofie nog een levenspraktijk was. Het is deze levenspraktijk, levenskunst of parrhêsia, die denken en handelen verenigt - doen wat je zegt en zeggen wat je doet – die van grote waarde kan zijn voor onze tijd en de wereldomspannende problemen waar we mee te maken hebben. Onderwijs speelt hierin een sleutelrol. De levenskunst van de parrhêsia moet niet beperkt blijven tot een handvol filosofen. Het onderwijs dat Oosterling en Nussbaum voorstaan is hiervoor het uitgangspunt. Zoveel mogelijk mensen moeten actief onderwijs genieten dat erop gericht is daadwerkelijk mensen te vormen, opdat ze verantwoordelijkheid voor hun leven kunnen nemen.

Het fenomeen van de ‘diagnostische inflatie’ in de psychiatrie,M.M. Boedhoe,2015-08-31,['Dr. A.W. Prins'],Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Allen Frances bekritiseert in het boek ‘Terug naar normaal’ (2013) de DSM-5, het diagnostische handboek van de psychiatrie dat hetzelfde jaar is verschenen. Hij voorziet een diagnostische inflatie, dat wil zeggen een toename aan psychiatrische patiënten, zoals hij die ook na het uitkomen van de DSM-IV heeft opgemerkt. Mensen zouden met de nieuwe criteria minder snel ‘normaal’ zijn en eerder patiënt; een fenomeen waar hij de lezer ervan probeert te overtuigen actief tegenin te gaan. Naast de DSM speelt ook de farmaceutische industrie een aanzienlijke rol in de diagnostische inflatie.
Hoewel Frances fel en niet altijd onderbouwd zijn mening kan uiten, is het een feit dat er tegenwoordig sprake is van een toename aan psychiatrische patiënten, met als gevolg medicalisering van de samenleving. Hier kunnen veel mensen schade aan ondervinden en ik ben het daarom eens met Frances dat men hier tegenin moet gaan. Wat aangemoedigd moet worden zijn het waakzaam afwachten van een psychische klacht, minimale interventie en het afremmen van de macht van de farmaceutische industrie.","['Terug naar normaal', 'Allen Frances', 'diagnostische inflatie']"
Direct-leidinggevenden en de Wet Verbetering Poortwachter,"Zanten, W.N. van",2015-08-31,"['Fleischmann Drs. M.', 'Koster Pro.fdr.

De resultaten tonen aan dat voor succesvolle re-integratie ondersteuning door professionals bij het maken van keuzes door direct-leidinggevenden essentieel is. Direct-leidinggevenden ervaren een stevige, goed ingebedde cultureel-cognitieve pijler in de organisatie als ondersteuning bij het maken van keuzes.

This
thesis
analyses
foreign
policy
behaviour
within
the
South
China
Sea
dispute
and
the
factors
that
have
influenced
it
in
a
period
ranging
from
1990
through
2014.
While
six
Southeast
and
East
Asian
states
have
expressed
varying
and
often-­‐overlapping
claims
in
the
region,
the
analysis
specifically
looks
at
the
dispute
between
China
and
the
Philippines.
Their
immense
power-­‐variation,
increasing
assertiveness,
and
varying
foreign
policies
provide
an
interesting
perspective.
Moreover,
the
U.S.-­‐Philippine
alliance
enables
us
to
look
at
the
influence
of
the
U.S.,
as
old-­‐stage
hegemon
and
stabilizer
in
the
Asian
Pacific,
on
both
China’s
and
the
Philippines’
actions.
The
case
study
research
is
executed
through
congruence
analysis,
in
which
competing
theories
are
used
next
to
one
another
to
make
sense
of
the
central
case.
Two
main
rationalist
IR
theories,
Realism
and
Liberalism,
are
chosen
to
see
which
of
them
provides
the
most
relevant
explanatory
factors
for
social
reality
in
the
Sino-­‐Philippine
dispute.
The
Realist
factors
that
have
been
deducted
from
theory
are
the
anarchic
international
structure;
relative
gains
and
power;
and
threat
perceptions.
Liberalism
has
provided
us
with
absolute
gains;
domestic
democratic
institutions;
and
economic
interdependence
as
possible
influencing
factors
for
foreign
policy
behaviour.
The
empirical
analysis
has
shown
that,
overall,
Realism
provides
more
accurate
explanations
for
both
China’s
and
the
Philippines
foreign
policy.
Due
to
its
analytical
focus
on
security
as
a
foreign
policy
goal,
states’
concern
with
relative
gains,
their
position
in
the
anarchic
international
system,
internal
and
external
balancing
behaviour
and
threat
perceptions
it
has
created
useful
insights
into
both
states’
foreign
policy.
Moreover,
its
consideration
of
states’
relative
power
position
and
the
consequent
variations
in
state
behaviour
have
proven
to
be
accurate,
as
China
being
the
stronger
state
engaged
in
different
types
of
behaviour
than
the
Philippines
being
the
weaker
one.
Liberalism
provides
a
useful
addition
by
allowing
one
to
look
at
domestic
structures
(regime
type
and
economy
type)
as
influencing
factors
of
foreign
policy.
Moreover,
while
its
focus
on
absolute
gains
and
welfare
maximization
explained
Philippine
behaviour
in
the
early
1990s,
it
was
overall
especially
hard
to
account
for
China’s
foreign
policy
using
Liberal
factors,
as
eventually
its
foreign
policy
could
be
reverted
back
to
Realist
factors.
Moreover,
Liberalism
generally
predicted
the
same
behaviour
for
China
and
the
Philippines,
with
the
exception
of
the
influence
of
their
(differing)
political
structure,
while
it
is
shown
that
their
behaviour
varied
and
was
strongly
influenced
by
their
power
position.
Lastly,
the
Liberal
thesis
could
not
explain
why
China
and
the
Philippines
fell
back
into
contentious
behaviour
at
the
end
of
the
2000s
despite
increasing
trade
relations.
Thus,
while
we
have
seen
that
more
factors
have
influenced
both
states’
behaviour,
the
core
events
can
be
led
back
to
the
Realist
thesis
with
its
influencing
factors
grounded
in
the
international
structure.
Apparently,
foreign
policy
in
contentious
situations
still
follows
Realist
predictions.
Therefore,
Realism
is
the
strongest
underlying
theory
to
explain
state
behaviour
in
the
South
China

Explaining progress towards universal primary education in India,"Roovaart, S. van den (Sebastiaan)",2015-08-28,"['Jüngen MSc. A. (Anna)', 'Haverland Prof.dr. M. (Markus)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In 2015 there are still large regional differences in terms of progress towards achieving universal primary education (UPE). In this research, political commitment, budget size and policy cost-effectiveness are considered as key factors to explain these differences. Placing these factors at their centre, three theories are formulated which each contain five propositions about expected UPE progress levels. Against the background of India’s large out of school population and interregional differences, the states of Punjab and Bihar are selected as a most-likely and least-likely case based on per capita income and urbanization rates. Next, using a congruence analysis approach the predicted and actual progress levels are compared to test the explanatory power of each theory. As a result, the main theory on budget size is considered the best predictor, as it contains the most propositions with accurate predictions and has a decent mean prediction score. The theory on policy cost-effectiveness performed best considering its overall weighted average, though variance among predictions was high. The political commitment theory consistently underestimated the level of UPE progress, and requires further adjustment. Additionally, giving proper weight to the private costs of education as an indicator for UPE progress was found to be essential for the validity of each of the three theories.","['UPE', 'political commitment', 'cost-effectiveness', 'public education expenditure', 'private cost', 'primary education']"
Does the National EU Policy Coordination System Matter?,"Vaznonytė, A. (Austė)",2015-08-27,"['Nispen Dr. F.K.M. van (Frans)', 'Haverland Prof.dr. M. (Markus)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The aim of this master thesis is to analyse the influence of domestic EU policy coordination
systems on the representation of national interests during the presidency of the Council of the
EU. The research analyses and compares four small EU member countries, having established
different national coordination systems according to Kassim’s typology: Cyprus, Ireland,
Lithuania and Greece.
The study is based on historical institutionalism, more specifically, on its two key traits: a
combination of rational and sociological aspects, and path-dependency. This theoretical
approach contributes to the presidency studies, since it addresses changes the Treaty of
Lisbon brought – the trio presidency. Four countries were selected following the rotating
order of the office. Therefore, the analysis evaluates the impact of a successive element of the
presidency, i.e. how much room for manoeuvre countries have for representing their national
interests, simultaneously addressing inherited issues on the Council agenda.
The research, examining youth unemployment issue, claims that path-dependency has a great
influence on both national coordination systems and the representation of domestic priorities
during the presidency term. Regarding the former, countries adopt new changes to existing
domestic networks, whereas the latter is related to the obligation for presidencies to follow
each other’s agenda and ensure the development of common policies.
Regarding Kassim’s framework, the analysis proves that selective systems tend to be more
efficient than comprehensive ones. The difference between centralized and decentralized
systems is rather marginal, however, former ones are more effective than the latter.",

These narratives will serve to broaden one’s understanding as to why the UK government decided not to opt into two EU Council Directives: The Family Reunification Directive and the Long Term Residents Directive. It is argued that in order to understand the final outcome of a decision, one must take into account the historical discourse which has been contested and molded by mutually constituting actors. The theoretical approaches of constructivism and Europeanisation will inform the thinking of this research. This paper aims to highlight the relevance of constructivism in analysis of domestic and EU politics, and seeks to advance the view of Europeanisation as a change in logic of action within actors.",
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions?,"Schneider, V.S. (Verona)",2015-08-27,"['Nispen Dr. F.K.M. van (Frans)', 'Scholten Dr. P.W.A.

But who is really in charge, who delivers most of the input? The following thesis has two purposes. First, it wants to analyze the opposing theories of Liberal Intergovernmentalism and Multi-Level Governance to ascertain the role of the nation state in European day-to-day decision-making. Second, it looks at the influence possibilities of an institution which is often rather neglected by media and science, the Committee of the Regions, a central forum of local and regional interests, and hence a symbol of Multi-Level Governance. The results show a growing – yet still underdeveloped – role of the regions in Europe. Nevertheless, the European decision-making process which is still partly based on national preferences also includes to a great extent supranational and subnational preferences. Therefore, Multi-Level Governance can account as a useful model in explaining the conducted case study around the Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 where the nation states are only one voice among others. The results also allow assuming that it is worth looking deeper into Multi-Level in order to explain European processes.",
Silent Voices,J.M.A. Bolloré,2015-08-26,"['C.L.A. Willemse', 'D. Douwes']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The universality and cross-cultural applicability of human rights has been vividly debated since the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Iran, as an Islamic Republic, stands as a chief opponent to the compatibility of Islamic values and human rights, particularly in the controversial area of women’s rights. Consequently, Iran is systematically depicted by Western media as a backwards country, hampered by its human rights violations. Whilst much research has been thus far devoted to the examination of Iran’s macro-level compliance to human rights standards, investigations of citizens’ perceptions on the matter appear to have been poorly documented. Accordingly, I here aimed to explore Iranian women’s lived experiences and perceptions of their rights. Iran afforded a compelling case study due to its particular historical and religious context. The country underwent tremendous changes over the course of the twentieth century, leading to the overthrow of the 2500-year monarchy and the instigation of an Islamic Republic in 1979. The research presented here was led by the research question How do Iranian women who experienced the 1979 Islamic Revolution, both those who stayed and those who migrated, perceive and rationalize changes in their rights in Iran following the installation of an Islamic Republic? Research here relied on the testimonies of twelve Iranian women. The human rights frame is deeply embedded in women’s testimonies. Although not all refer specifically to human rights, their words and thoughts on the matter reveal that human rights principles have been internalised by all women. Therefore, I would argue that human rights are not culturally specific, but rather that ‘human rights have become culture’.  Since the inception of the UDHR in 1948, Iran has not been able to remove the frame of human rights from public discourses. Women, regardless of their religious background, argue that human rights and culture are separate matters. Therefore, I conclude that human rights are the best solution so far in order to tackle the potential dangers of ‘modern nation-state, market economies, and industrialisation’.","['Iran', 'Human rights', 'Women’s rights', 'Gender', 'Lived experience', 'Historical memory', 'Collective memory', 'Migration', 'Discourse', 'Identity', 'History', 'International relations']"
Herinneringen herbergen?,E.M. van Alphen,2015-08-24,"['H.C. Dibbits', 'L.T. Slegtenhorst']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","‘En wat ik het meest gekke vind mam, is dat bijvoorbeeld het prinsenhof in Delft geen rijksmonument is geworden omdat Willem van Oranje er is vermoord, maar om wat architectonische redenen!’ Na mijn eerste afspraak, met mijn stagebegeleider van de Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed (RCE), belde ik verwonderd met mijn moeder. Hoe kon het dat zo’n bijzondere gebeurtenis in onze nationale geschiedenis geen reden was geweest om het gebouw te voorzien van de rijksmonumentenstatus? Ik ben niet de enige die vindt dat dit een reden tot aanwijzing zou moeten zijn, uit secundair bronnenonderzoek is gebleken dat dit een zeer gangbare gedachtegang is binnen de Nederlandse samenleving. Sinds de jaren ’70 is er sprake van een memory- en heritageboom in Nederland. Burgers hechten steeds meer waarde aan de verhalen, de herinneringen, en zien dit als legitieme redenen om gebouwen te bewaren. 
Deze verschuiving is ook niet onopgemerkt gebleven binnen de RCE. Zij constateert dat het argument herinneringswaarde steeds dominanter aanwezig is binnen de aangedragen tips. Dit maakte dat ik in januari jongstleden kon beginnen met mijn onderzoeksstage bij de RCE, die is uitgemond in deze thesis. Leidend in dit onderzoek was de onderzoeksvraag: “Hoe kan worden verklaard dat de rol van herinneringen in de tipgeving voor en toekenning van de rijksmonumentenstatus in mijn drie casussen enerzijds en het rijksmonumentenbeleid van de Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed anderzijds van elkaar verschilt, in Nederland in de periode 2009-2015?” 
Tijdens het onderzoek heb ik mij gericht op de standpunten van zowel de tipgevers als de toekenners omtrent het rijksmonumentenbeleid. De tipgevers zijn  burgers die zich hebben verenigd door middel van erfgoedstichtingen- of verenigingen of zich als hobbyisten hebben gespecialiseerd in erfgoed in hun directe omgeving. De toekenners worden vertegenwoordigd door de RCE. Hoewel de minister van OCW eindverantwoordelijk is voor het beleid, voert de RCE het uit. Door middel van secundair bronnenonderzoek en een analyse van beleidsnota’s en wetswijzigingen heb ik onderzocht hoe de rol van herinneringen tussen tipgeving en toekenning verschilt. Vervolgens heb ik aan de hand van primair bronnenonderzoek drie casussen onderzocht. Mijn casussen waren: Veilinghal ‘Op Hoop van Zegen’ in Blokker (NH), molen de Windlust in Burum (FR) en de Hollandsche Schouwburg in Amsterdam (NH). 
	Er kan worden geconcludeerd dat herinneringen een verschillende rol innemen omdat tipgevers en de RCE door middel van het rijksmonumentenbeleid een ander verhaal willen vertellen. Dit verschil kan enerzijds worden verklaard doordat de tipgevers andere waarden hechten aan erfgoed, zij hechten meer waarde aan een authentieke beleving in plaats van authentieke materialen. Anderzijds heeft deze verschillende rol ook te maken met spraakverwarring. Burgers en de RCE gebruiken verschillende definities voor het woord monument, wat maakt dat tipgevers vinden dat herinneringen een rol spelen bij monumenten en de RCE dit juist uitsluit. De wensen van burgers worden wel gehoord binnen het bredere erfgoedbeleid van de RCE, maar niet binnen het rijksmonumentenbeleid. Hoewel de scheiding duidelijk lijkt, wijkt de RCE bij mijn drie casussen tot tweemaal toe af
van het rijksmonumentenbeleid. Het feit dat de herinnering dominant aanwezig was in de Nederlandse samenleving, speelde hierbij een rol.
Deze masterthesis is echter verkennend van aard. Er kunnen dus geen grote conclusies uit getrokken worden. De verklaringen zijn enkel van toepassing op de drie casussen. Voor verdere conclusies zal er vervolgonderzoek gedaan moeten worden.","['herinneringen', 'rijksdienst voor het cultureel erfgoed', 'RCE', 'burgers', 'verhalen', 'monumenten', 'collectieve herinnering', 'erfgoed', 'modernisering monumentenzorg']"

boodschap voor de
toekomst",G.P.T. Kokshoorn,2015-08-20,"['L.T. Slegtenhorst', 'C.R. Ribbens']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Zeventig jaar na het einde van de Tweede Wereldoorlog speelt deze geschiedenis nog steeds een belangrijke rol in onze samenleving. Dit is ook terug te zien in de grote belangstelling voor musea, herinneringscentra, tentoonstellingen, herdenkingen, film- en theatervoorstellingen. Jongeren leren op verschillende manieren over de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Naast documentaires, films en familieverhalen is een bezoek aan historische plekken een belangrijke bron van informatie voor jongeren. 
Erfgoedplekken zijn een krachtige herinnering aan de historische gebeurtenissen van de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Een goed voorbeeld hiervan zijn de voormalige concentratiekampen en huidige herinneringscentra in Westerbork, Vught en Amersfoort. Deze erfgoedinstellingen spelen een belangrijke rol in educatie over de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Zij worden jaarlijks door een groot aantal scholen bezocht. Tijdens dit bezoek volgen de jongeren een educatief programma. Maar hoe wordt de geschiedenis van de Tweede Wereldoorlog en de Holocaust, die zo traumatisch en gewelddadig is, uitgelegd aan jongeren in deze centra? De voormalige concentratiekampen in Nederland zijn erfgoed met een gevoelige en gewelddadige geschiedenis, waardoor er voorzichtig met educatie moet worden omgegaan.
In de eenentwintigste eeuw is er een verschuiving te zien waarbij er een nadruk ligt op beleving en ervaring van de geschiedenis op historische plekken aan de hand van persoonlijke verhalen van historische actoren. De communicatieve herinnering is aan het verdwijnen en de culturele herinnering van erfgoedplekken zoals de voormalige concentratiekampen worden ingezet om jongeren te leren over de Tweede Wereldoorlog en de Holocaust. 
In oorlogsmusea wordt steeds meer ingespeeld op de belevenis, omdat verondersteld wordt dat jongeren een tastbare herinnering nodig hebben om het verleden te kunnen begrijpen. Een nadruk op de belevenis en tastbaarheid van de geschiedenis en het vertellen van persoonlijke verhalen van mensen die de oorlog hebben meegemaakt kan het verleden ook erg dichtbij halen. Dit kan zorgen voor een grote emotionele betrokkenheid. Het begrijpen van de complexiteit van de geschiedenis van de Tweede Wereldoorlog kan daardoor bemoeilijkt worden.
Dit onderzoek zal in het teken staan van de manier waarop er wordt omgegaan met het geweld van de Tweede Wereldoorlog en de Holocaust en hoe dit gerepresenteerd wordt in de educatieve programma’s voor het voortgezet onderwijs van herinneringscentra Westerbork, Vught en Amersfoort. Er is nauwelijks tot geen onderzoek gedaan naar de omgang met geweld en historische afstand in educatie in deze centra in Nederland. Deze erfgoedplekken zijn een belangrijke tastbare herinnering van de Tweede Wereldoorlog, zeker nu de communicatieve herinnering aan het verdwijnen is. Dat maakt onderzoek naar educatie in deze centra van groot belang.","['Tweede Wereldoorlog', 'Herinneringscentrum Kamp Westerbork', 'Nationaal Monument Kamp Vught', 'Nationaal Monument Kamp Amersfoort', 'erfgoed', 'gevoelig erfgoed', 'educatie', 'erfgoededucatie', 'historische cultuur', 'geweld', 'historische afstand']"

Furthermore, it assesses the role of Greenspan in this process, because Greenspan was a strong supporter of the free market and may have exerted his influence to direct the development of financial regulation. This thesis researches seven important pieces of financial regulation of that period and finds that, although during the first years the market became more regulated, the overall trend was that the financial sector was becoming more deregulated. By comparing the implications of these regulations with the views of Greenspan, as stated in his autobiography The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World, it becomes clear that Greenspan’s views were very similar to the trend of financial regulation during the period he was chairman of the Federal Reserve. This result indicates a more influential role for Greenspan in the decision-making process of financial regulation and implies a contribution of agency in the creation of financial regulation in general.","['Alan Greenspan', 'Federal Reserve', 'financial regulation', 'free market', 'deregulation']"
Coca-Cola under the Aegis of US Government,I. Pappas,2015-08-15,"['B.Wubs', 'H.A.M. Klemann']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","… And it began with a vision, of a world of Coke 

‘The story of Coca-Cola speaks to me because it opens up a window on world historical processes that are now glossed as globalization, processes that include not only business operations in a world market but also cultural, political and environmental processes that most people experience.’  Inspired from the words of Robert J. Foster, this thesis focuses on a very particular process, which includes Coca-Cola and the US government. Analytically, this paper analyzes the lobbying effort of The Coca-Cola Company, which was waged towards the US government in the turbulent postwar period (between 1945 and 1948) aiming to support Coca-Cola global activities. Since Coke is a microcosm of American History, this study can be said to be a microcosm of American Lobbying history.  In addition, current research constitutes a case study of analyzing international relations by implementing a liberal perspective.
According to Coca-Cola prominent persona, Robert Winship Woodruff ‘one of the most vital assets to selling Coca-Cola, as well as keeping his organization out of difficulty of one kind or another, lay … with the politicians.’  As it is discussed, using primary and secondary sources and prominently archives from Emory University, Georgia, Coke had great relations with politicians and governors all over the world. It was either those relations or the absence of serious problems abroad that ensured a secure position for Coke for the first postwar years, without the need to petition the US government for it. Moreover, the analysis proved that Coke eagerly manipulated the US government in hazard and extreme situations, such as the problems it faced in postwar-France. 
All of the conclusions were discussed extensively and were based on a variety of primary and secondary sources. Nevertheless, the denial of access to The Coca-Cola Company Archives, as well as the cost for acquiring some further primary sources belong to the limitations of the study and further research should be contacted for business lobbying by Coca-Cola as well as lobbying from other corporations.

Met behulp van kwantitatief en kwalitatief onderzoek is gekeken op welke manier mannen en vrouwen werden afgebeeld, of in deze uitkomsten stereotyperingen terug te vinden waren die steeds opnieuw aan de lezers van de tijdschriften werden getoond, en of de beelden overeen kwamen met de man-vrouwverhouding en genderrollen zoals beschreven in de literatuur. Uit literatuuronderzoek bleek dat de man-vrouwverhouding in deze periode niet zozeer veranderde, maar wat genderrollen inhielden wel. Binnen de man-vrouwverhouding stond de man bovenaan in de hiërarchie, en nam een leidende positie in. De vrouw had een volgende, passieve rol. Met het uitbreken van de Eerste Wereldoorlog werd de genderrol voor mannen en vrouwen een uitvergroting en overdrijving van wat dit beeld inhield vóór deze periode. In het geval van Duitsland liet Die Woche een mannelijke genderrol zien die paste binnen het beeld in propaganda: vrijwel onaantastbaar, onverschrokken, dapper de vijand tegemoet tredend, optimistisch, agressief, maar toch beleefd. Vrouwen werden afgebeeld in zorgzame en passief-volgende rollen. Het patriottisme en optimisme over een goede afloop van de oorlog moest hoog gehouden worden, en bovendien pasten zwaktes van mannen niet in het genderbeeld – negatieve gevolgen van de oorlog werden dan ook zo goed mogelijk buiten beeld gelaten. Het Leven gebruikte deze overdrijving van het man- en vrouwbeeld minder, doordat het verscheen in een land dat niet in oorlog was en in mindere mate te maken had met censuur – al kon ook het Nederlandse tijdschrift niet zomaar foto’s plaatsen en moest het altijd rekening houden met de neutrale context waarin het zich bevond. Invalide, getraumatiseerde en gedode soldaten mochten bijvoorbeeld wel worden afgebeeld, maar alleen als de zwaktes van beide kampen in beeld werden gebracht. De man-vrouwverhouding die wordt weergegeven in zowel Het Leven als Die Woche komt overeen met het beeld dat in de literatuur geschetst wordt. De foto’s lijken echter een meer verstard beeld van genderrollen weer te geven in vergelijking met literatuur.","['nieuwsfotografie', 'gender', 'man-vrouwverhouding', 'eerste feministische golf', 'Eerste Wereldoorlog', 'Duitsland', 'Nederland', 'Het Leven Geïllustreerd', 'Die Woche']"
Europees anti-Amerikanisme,A.P. de Heer,2015-08-07,"['H.B. Harmsen', 'B. Wubs']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De Vietnamoorlog zorgde voor veel maatschappelijke onrust. Aangezien de Verenigde Staten direct bij het conflict betrokken waren was deze onrust merkbaar in Amerika zelf, maar ook in West-Europa. In veel West-Europese staten, waaronder in Nederland, stimuleerde de oorlog anti-Amerikaanse gevoelens vanuit de samenleving. Deze anti-Amerikaanse gevoelens uitten zich in tal van protesten tegen het conflict, tegen de Amerikaanse inmenging én tegen de Nederlandse steun aan het Amerikaanse Vietnambeleid. Hoewel vanuit de samenleving anti-Amerikaanse gevoelens klonken, volgde de Nederlandse regering een pro-Amerikaans en Atlantisch buitenlands beleid. Daarom richt dit onderzoek zich op de vraag wat de invloed van de anti-Vietnam protestbewegingen was op het buitenlands beleid van de Nederlandse regering met betrekking tot de oorlog in Vietnam. Door te kijken naar de koers van het Nederlandse buitenlandse beleid, de visie en eisen van twee grote protestbewegingen (Aktiegroep Vietnam en Nationaal Comité Vietnam) en de diplomatieke betrekkingen met de Verenigde Staten, wordt onderzocht welke factoren de koers van het Nederlandse buitenlandse beleid tijdens de Vietnamoorlog bepaalden en welke rol protestbewegingen hierin speelden. Primair bronmateriaal, zoals Tweede Kamerverslagen, Nederlands-Amerikaanse correspondentie en pamfletten afkomstig van protestbewegingen, vormen een belangrijk onderdeel van het onderzoek.","['Vietnamoorlog', 'anti-Amerikanisme', 'Atlanticisme', 'buitenlands beleid', 'Nederlands-Amerikaanse relatie', 'protestbewegingen']"

been identified as a crucial aspect of success for sustainable development. Today’s
heritage and tourism field is so complex that it is hardly impossible for one
organization alone to make a significant difference in the pursuit for overall growth
and development. The thesis identifies and discusses the possible role of the Unesco
organization in the implementation of a collaborative approach for local site
management. The research focuses on the obstacles that prevent local actors to put
collaborative projects into action. The thesis identifies the strengths of the Unesco
organization and discusses how they could be effectively used in practice.
Furthermore, it illustrates why the Unesco organization should step in and use its
strengths to remedy the problems that local actors encounter. The thesis studies the
problems on a case study of the city of Trebic situated in the Czech Republic. One
part of the case study investigates the management style of the local heritage site
organization through interviews with employees who are in charge of the World
Heritage Sites. The other part examines the willingness of the key stakeholder, the
local community, to engage in the development of the Unesco sites through a survey.
The findings have confirmed that the heritage managers of the Unesco sites in Trebic
have problems with initiating stakeholder collaboration and involving local

"Cultural industry workers who produce Reality TV in Germany: Motivations, skills and identity work","Jansen, Christian",2015-08-05,['Michael J.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Cultural industry workers make compromises in terms of their cultural capital, their attitudes towards lowbrow culture, and their creative skills to work for Reality TV formats in German production companies with a commercial orientation. They find means to motivate themselves despite some inconvenient working conditions and also find ways to uphold their artistic integrity by either consciously or unconsciously applying identity work strategies. How they (attempt to) accomplish this in spite of possible gaps between their personal standards and the cultural products they produce is subject of this thesis and point of origin for the call of a new conceptualizations which are not only valid in the case of TV production but also transferable to all sectors of the culture industries. This can best be established with the support of concepts and theories from different academic disciplines because analyzing motivations and strategies of cultural industry workers goes beyond the scope of a single discipline. I argue that it is high time for an interdisciplinary approach which is due to the fact that the decisions persons make before starting and during the course of professional lives depend on multiple factors. For instance an individual’s cultural capital might be the trigger to enter this profession and could explain the willingness to compromise potential discrepancies. Testing to what extent cultural capital understood as possessing knowledge in the field of culture and having creative skills exerts an influence is the point of origin. Yet, the sociological concept by Bourdieu, that has been introduced to studies of cultural industries alone are not sufficient to get the full image of what motivates. I am convinced that motivation theories, generally applied in the field of psychology, can assist in exposing the incentives to work for in TV companies. Cultural capital and motivation theories are suitable enough to explain the motivations to work but on their own do not suffice to explain how to maintain artistic integrity whilst producing for Reality TV which next to their lowbrow status often receives disapprobation from the public. Particular identity work strategies complete the innovative approach, namely distancing and evaluative tweaking as well as drawing symbolic boundaries. In order to check all theories and concepts for their applicability, I conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with the creative staff, editors and authors, of TV production companies. Based on the results derived from their comprehensive replies, I make suggestions for how the findings can effectively be employed in this context and how they can their conceptualizations transferred to other domains of
the culture industries with comparable patterns. By having realized the rationale of grounded theory, this research will have contributed to invigorate interdisciplinary approaches among sociology, psychology and media studies. The cooperation will expand any type of field research.","['cultural and social capital', 'cultural industry workers', 'identity work strategies', 'lowbrow', 'motivation theories', 'Reality TV']"
Een speelbare oorlog,T.Koopmans,2015-07-30,"['C.R. Ribbens', 'R.J. Adriaansen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Tweede Wereldoorlog video games worden nog niet serieus genomen door historici. Dit gamegenre is echter wel zeer populair en heeft daardoor invloed op de manier waarop het publiek naar deze periode uit de geschiedenis kijkt. Er zijn twee populaire genres Tweede Wereldoorloggames, nameljik First Person Shooter games en Strategy games. Deze genres hebben beide een andere insteek. Bij FPS-games ligt de nadruk vooral op actie en zijn de games speelbaar vanuit een eerstepersoonsperspectief. Bij RTS-games ligt dit anders. Deze games zijn vooral gefocust op tactiek en economie. Ze zijn speelbaar vanuit een perspectief die een overzicht van het slagveld geeft.
	Deze scriptie zal vooral ingaan op de vraag: hoe wordt de Tweede Wereldoorlog in Strategy- en first persoon shooter games gerepresenteerd, in de periode 2007 tot en met 2014? En hoe kunnen de verschillen in de representatie van de Tweede Wereldoorlog verklaard worden vanuit de verschillen in gameplay? In het artikel van Evan Kingsepp, waarin zij een aantal games aan de hand van het begrip immersive historicity (een atmosfeer in de game die er voor zorgt dat de speler de game in wordt ‘gezogen’ en daardoor tijdelijk zijn omgeving vergeet) analyseert, wordt duidelijk dat Tweede Wereldoorloggames hevig worden beïnvloed door stereotypen en film. In deze scriptie zullen daarom een aantal Tweede Wereldoorlog video games aan de hand van haar structuur en het begrip immersive historicity  worden geanalyseerd. Daarnaast zal er ook, naar de ideeën van Brian Rejack, worden gekeken naar de informatie ‘buiten’ de game. De authenticiteit die ‘buiten’ de game te vinden is, heeft invloed  op de immersiveness van de game.
Aan de hand van een aantal kenmerken is ervoor gekozen om in deze thesis zeven games te analyseren. Dit zijn drie FPS-games: Brothers in Arms: Hell’s Highway, Call of Duty: World at War en Medal of Honor en  vier RTS-Games: Men of War, Order of War, R.U.S.E. en Company of Heroes 2. Deze games worden geanalyseerd  aan de hand van de categorieën: locatie, tijd, geluid, perspectief en authenticiteit.
De conclusie die uit deze analyse volgt, is duidelijk. De FPS- en RTS-genres maken gebruik van stereotypen en  een filmische ervaring die automatisch zorgt voor een herkenning. Hoe duidelijker deze herkenning is, hoe groter de immersivness van de game lijkt. Er is echter ook een verschil tussen de genres. Zo lijken de RTS games in mindere mate gebruik te maken van stereotypen en een filmische ervaring. De Tweede Wereldoorlog die in deze games worden gerepresenteerd lijkt hierdoor minder gekleurd en daardoor ook neutraler dan de Tweede Wereldoorlog die in de First Person Shooter games worden gebruikt. Daarnaast heeft ook de gameplay invloed op. First Person Shooter games lijken namelijk door hun eerstepersoonsperspectief meer immersive, terwijl Strategy games door hun perspectief van bovenaf minder immersive lijken.","['Immersive historicity', 'stereotypen', 'authenticiteit', 'video games', 'Tweede Wereldoorlog', 'representatie']"

Wat maakt een kunstenaar?,"Jansen, Judith",2015-07-29,['Eijck C.J.M. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het doel van dit exploratieve onderzoek is om patronen in socialisatieprocessen van kunstenaars inzichtelijk te krijgen. Om te onderzoeken hoe socialisatie in verschillende contexten zijn weerslag heeft op de wijze waarop iemand uiteindelijk vormgeeft aan het ondernemerschap als beeldend kunstenaar. De focus ligt op de volgende socialisatiecontexten: het gezin, de opleiding en de kunstwereld/het kunstenaarschap. Deze worden voornamelijk benaderd vanuit bevindingen uit voorgaande onderzoeken naar culturele participatie/consumptie.
Door middel van kwalitatief onderzoek wordt via een retroperspectief interview gekeken of er een rode draad loopt door de verschillende stadia in iemands carrièrevorming tot beeldend kunstenaar. Een aantal speerpunten staan hierbij voorop: ten eerste de rol en het belang van primaire en secundaire socialisatie voor het kunstenaarschap; ten tweede het in kaart brengen en verklaren van verschillende socialisatietrajecten; ten derde de invloed van cultureel kapitaal op de ontwikkeling van kunstenaarschap. 
Er wordt een analyse gemaakt om mogelijke overeenkomsten en verschillen in waarden ten aanzien van de ontwikkeling van het kunstenaarschap zichtbaar te maken. Vervolgens wordt er gekeken hoe deze waarden zich hebben gevormd gedurende de studietijd van de kunstenaar aan de academie: zijn er bepaalde waarden bijgekomen, veranderd of verdwenen? Tot slot wordt gekeken hoe deze waarden zich manifesteren in het ondernemerschap van de beeldend kunstenaar. Om antwoord te geven op de vraag: Wat maakt een kunstenaar? Oftewel de centrale vraagstelling: Wat is de rol van socialisatieprocessen vanuit het gezin en de beroepsopleiding in het ondernemerschap van hedendaagse beeldend kunstenaars in Rotterdam en omgeving?","['Kunstenaarschap', 'socialisatieprocessen', 'cultureel kapitaal', 'sociale reproductie', 'intergenerationele overdracht', 'sociale erfenis', 'socio-demografische achtergronden en conformisme.']"

Communitymanagers in de deeleconomie,M.F. Rademaker,2015-07-27,"['M. Slot', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De deeleconomie is een onderwerp waarover veel gediscussieerd wordt en wat regelmatig in het nieuws
komt. Eerder onderzoek op dit gebied richt zich vooral op de implicaties en voor- en nadelen van de
deeleconomie, met name voor consumenten. Dit onderzoek poogt inzicht te geven in hoe platforms zelf, en
specifiek de communitymanager, de community op het deelplatform zo actief mogelijk kunnen houden.
Zonder actieve gebruikers kan het platform niet bestaan. Dit onderzoek is ondersteund door ShareNL, een
kennisplatform voor de deeleconomie.
De onderzoeksvraag die in deze thesis centraal staat luidt: Wat is de rol van de communitymanager
in het actief houden van verschillende groepen gebruikers van een deelplatform? De functie
communitymanager is vrij recent, en er bestaat veel onduidelijkheid over wat deze functie inhoudt. Wat echter
wel duidelijk is, is dat actieve gebruikers van cruciaal belang zijn voor communities. Deelplatforms kunnen
gezien worden als communities, en ook zij zijn afhankelijk van (actieve) gebruikers. Het belang van actieve
gebruikers wordt in dit onderzoek onder andere duidelijk doordat communitymanagers gebruikers eerder
op basis van activiteit onderscheiden dan op basis van verschillende rollen, zoals in eerdere literatuur werd
gedaan. Het begrip participatieongelijkheid is daarbij belangrijk, omdat dit aangeeft dat gebruikers
verschillen in mate van activiteit en participatie. Gebruikers van een platform zijn niet per definitie actief en de
community van een deelplatform is geen homogene groep. De groep actieve gebruikers is vaak klein, maar
ook het meest belangrijk en waardevol. Deze groep gebruikers moet actief blijven en gestimuleerd worden,
omdat zij de critical mass en als het ware de basis vormen waarop het platform is gebaseerd. De
communitymanager speelt hier een grote rol in.
Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de communitymanager zich vooral bezighoudt met het contact met
gebruikers. Dit contact wordt via verschillende wegen gelegd, zoals via sociale media, emailcontact,
nieuwsbrieven en membersupport, maar ook via offline evenementen. Contact met hen is belangrijk om hen
actief en betrokken te houden. De communitymanager is als het ware de spil tussen het platform en zijn
gebruikers, de community. Wat over het algemeen uit dit onderzoek naar voren komt is dat het
overkoepelende en meest belangrijke doel van communitymanagers is om (actieve) gebruikers op het
platform te betrekken en actief te houden. Veel werkzaamheden binnen de functie zijn hierop gericht. Het
laten groeien of het activeren van inactieve gebruikers vallen niet in het takenpakket van een
communitymanager. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de rol van de communitymanager zich specifiek richt op de
huidige community, en op actieve gebruikers.","['deeleconomie', 'communitymanagers', 'deelplatforms', '(actieve) gebruikers', 'communities']"
Godsdienstcontroverse of politieke rel?,J.P. Rottier,2015-07-24,"['M.C.R. Grever', 'J.C. van der Vlies']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In deze masterscriptie onderzoek ik hoe de Aprilbeweging van 1853 verbeeld wordt in geschiedenismethodes voor het middelbaar en hoger onderwijs in de periode 1875-1941. In deze periode zat Nederland in een proces van eenwording. De hogere burgerij maakte toen van Nederland een politieke, economische en sociale eenheid. Hiervoor zetten ze onder andere het onderwijs in. Op scholen gingen kinderen gezamenlijk de Nederlandse taal leren en ze gingen van alles over het roemruchte Nederlandse verleden leren.
De leerlingen kregen ook les over de Aprilbeweging. De Aprilbeweging is een verzamelnaam van vele protesten van protestanten in de aprilmaand van 1853. De protestanten vonden het maar niets dat de katholieke kerk weer bisschoppen ging aanstellen. In de Tachtigjarige Oorlog was de kerk die vrijheid ontnomen, maar in 1848 had Thorbecke met zijn grondwetsherziening de kerk die vrijheid weer teruggegeven. De protestanten waren bang dat het protestantse karakter van Nederland zou verdwijnen en dat zelfs de tijden van de inquisitie weer zouden terugkeren. De protestanten begonnen een petitie en boden die aan Koning Willem III aan. Hij toonde sympathie en ging daarmee tegen het kabinet in, wat daardoor viel.
De Aprilbeweging draaide dus om hele existentiële zaken: wat maakt iemand tot een Nederlander? En wat moet hij denken, vinden of geloven? Dit zijn ook precies de vragen waar leerlingen op school antwoord op kregen, vooral tijdens de geschiedenisles. Ik was benieuwd of ik in de geschiedenismethodes ideeën over Nederland als natiestaat tegenkwam en of er een bepaalde (nationale) identiteit werd overgedragen aan de leerlingen. Ook was ik benieuwd of de inhoud van de boeken van elkaar verschilden of elkaar zelfs bestreden en of er dus sprake was van een herinneringsstrijd.
De auteurs beschrijven, soms zelfs uitgebreid, over religieuze kant van de Aprilbeweging. Ze hebben het over de aanloop naar en de aanstelling van de bisschoppen, en over de bezwaren van de protestanten hiertegen. Maar het draait in hun vertellingen vooral om de politieke kant. De Aprilbeweging is in de methodes bijna altijd onderdeel van een beschrijving van het leven van Thorbecke – op dat moment de hoogste minister. Veel methodes beginnen met een kort, lovend stukje over zijn leven en de wetten die hij tot stand heeft gebracht, en eindigen met zijn val als gevolg van de Aprilbeweging. Bijna alle auteurs benadrukken dat de conservatieven van de spanningen tussen katholieken en protestanten gebruik maakten, om tegen (in hun ogen) Thorbeckes verregaande grondwetsherziening te protesteren. Ze wijzen er ook op dat de koning bewust sympathiseerde met de protestanten om van Thorbecke af te komen. En ze beklemtonen ook dat de paus tegen Thorbecke inging, door hem niet vooraf duidelijk in te lichten over zijn plannen. 
De schrijvers zetten zich dus duidelijk af tegen de ‘tegenstanders’ van Thorbecke. Zodoende lijkt er sprake van een herinneringsstrijd. De auteurs lijken te willen bewijzen dat zij aan de ‘goede’ kant van de Aprilbeweging stonden. Ook Thorbeckes herziene grondwet staat centraal in de vertellingen. Veel schrijvers zijn er erg positief over. Hij overstijgt religieuze verschillen en verbindt alle Nederlanders met elkaar, lijken ze te zeggen. Bijna alle auteurs benadrukken ook dat de grondwet het herstel van de bisschoppelijke hiërarchie mogelijk maakte. Met de ruime aandacht voor Thorbecke en zijn grondwet proberen bijna alle auteurs een nationale, liberale identiteit bij de lezers over te brengen. Thorbecke en zijn grondwet vormen samen de verbindende schakel in het eenwordende Nederland.","['Geschiedenismethodes', 'Aprilbeweging 1853', 'Thorbecke', 'Koning Willem III', 'Hbs', 'Gymnasium', 'Negentiende eeuw', 'Natiestaat', 'Nationale identiteit', 'Herinneringsstrijd']"

Inmiddels bezetten vrouwelijke journalisten een groot deel van de journalistieke beroepspraktijk. Er heerst alleen nog sterke gendersegregatie binnen dit werkveld. Vrouwelijke stemmen worden nauwelijks opgevoerd en mannelijke waarden hebben invloed op nieuwsselectie. Toch is er al een groot verschil te zien binnen dat van oudsher mannelijke werkveld. Meer vrouwen kiezen voor een journalistieke studie en hun aandeel in de arbeidsmarkt is nog nooit zo hoog geweest. Er is binnen de journalistiek meer vraag naar buitenlands nieuws en het aantal vrouwelijke buitenlandcorrespondenten stijgt. Bovendien krijgen zij een stem binnen oorlogsverslaggeving. Gender, de sociale-, culturele- en psychologische invulling van het man- of vrouw-zijn, heeft invloed op het werk van vrouwelijke buitenlandcorrespondenten. Zo zouden vrouwelijke buitenlandcorrespondenten makkelijker bepaalde informatie naar boven te krijgen. Daarentegen worden ze soms ook als potentieel slachtoffer van verkrachting gezien, daardoor geloven sommige leidinggevenden niet in het uitzenden van vrouwelijke buitenlandcorrespondenten. Zij zouden dit werk niet aankunnen. 2014 was het gevaarlijkste jaar voor journalisten overal ter wereld. Steeds meer vrouwelijke journalisten worden opgepakt en krijgen te maken met seksueel geweld. 
 	In deze thesis wordt onderzocht in hoeverre gender invloed heeft op de manier waarop vrouwelijke buitenlandcorrespondenten hun werk ervaren. Uit diepte-interviews met elf vrouwelijke buitenlandcorrespondenten zijn thema’s voortgevloeid die deze ervaring duiden. Hieruit kan geconcludeerd worden dat gender van grote invloed is op de wijze waarop zij hun werk ervaren. Deze invloed is eerder positief dan negatief te noemen, in tegenstelling tot wat er in de literatuur beweerd wordt.","['Journalistiek', 'journalistieke beroepspraktijk', 'buitenlandjournalistiek', 'vrouwelijke journalisten', 'vrouwelijke buitenlandcorrespondenten', 'gender', 'oorlogsverslaggeving', 'diepte-interviews']"

It is common knowledge that artists often hold multiple jobs to support their artistic practice, also applying their skills in applied work in the creative industries. A recent study in the Netherlands and Belgium has observed the emergence of a hybrid artist who can no longer be said to have multiple jobs as their autonomous and applied practice blur, so that it is not possible to make a clear distinction between the two. There are different positions on what this means for the autonomy of the artist, that it is a threat to the autonomous space of the artist, or that the romantic ideal of artistic autonomy should no longer retain as much relevance in contemporary art. In order to observe whether this is not an isolated phenomenon, this thesis investigates whether hybridity can also be observed in the practices of Australian visual artists by obtaining data through an online survey distributed to alumni of a visual arts school based in Sydney, Australia. This thesis specifically focuses on whether there is an increase in the levels of hybridity in practice and in attitude for more recent graduates. The findings reveal that there is no consistent upward trend in hybridity levels over time, however it does reveal that graduates from the 1990s onwards are increasingly hybrid in practice and in attitude until the mid-2000s when attitudes shift, marking a clear opposition to the blurring of an autonomous and applied practice.","['Artists’ labour markets', 'autonomy', 'hybridity', 'multiple job-holding', 'visual arts']"

The main focus of this research was on young Dutch citizens’ political consumption and how that is linked to their web browsing activities. Therefore, the following main research question was explored: how is the political consumption of young Dutch citizens linked to their web browsing activities?
A thematic analysis was conducted after nine in-depth interviews. Furthermore, a new Google Chrome extension, Web Historian (Version 1, 2015), was used as a tool to visualize the participants’ web history to provide an in-depth analysis of their web browsing activities in relation to their political consumption. The participants were asked through a survey to enter the project in which they had to send their web history data. Hereafter, they were asked to participate in an interview in which they also reflected upon their visualizations to achieve more in-depth results.
The main findings in this research stated that young Dutch citizens actively use online news to inform themselves about politics. Social media is a big contributor to their news consumption, however their social media use was not linked to information about political consumption, in particular ‘buycotting’. On the contrary, it was linked to their information consumption regarding traditional politics and election time. Another finding regarding election time, is that the participants often use Voting Advice Applications (Stemwijzer.nl) to assist them in their final decision. Furthermore, this research found that the participants do not avoid information due to political beliefs, rather seek for opposite political views. The only thing that is avoided are immorally and unethical images or videos under the participant from immigrant backgrounds. The last important finding is that the participants did not have a sense of what average political interest means nor engagement, as they often compared themselves with their social environment.","['political participation', 'political consumption', 'buycotting', 'boycotting', 'politics', 'VAAs', 'Web Historian', 'online news', 'social media', 'young citizens']"

Het onderzoek is gebaseerd op European Social Survey data uit 2010 (N=921). Beide hypothesen vinden ondersteuning in het onderzoek. Opmerkelijk is dat mensen met een dienstverband minder arbeidstevreden zijn dan mensen werkzaam voor een eigen of familiebedrijf. Daarnaast blijk uit de regressieanalyse dat mensen met autonomie in het werk een hogere arbeidstevredenheid ervaren. Het onderzoek toont aan dat dit effect klein is voor de mensen met veel controlegeoriënteerdheid. Zij ervaren weinig baat van autonomie.

A Cultural Economic Perspective on Omnivorousness,S. Smink,2015-07-16,"['A. Klamer', 'E. Dekker']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Richard Peterson’s 1992 research on musical tastes in the US showed that the upper class, which he named cultural omnivores, exposed a more eclectic taste of music than the lower classes, the cultural univores. The research challenged Bourdieu’s elite−to−mass model, which stated that the upper class preferred a restricted amount of high status arts over low status culture and mass entertainment.
More than twenty later the omnivore is still present in our society. However post−Peterson research on the omnivore proofed it’s hard to pigeonhole the cultural omnivore into a single entity. Yes the cultural omnivore is still that person that is open to many different forms of art and culture, yet research showed that the motivations for the omnivore’s behavior are as diverse as its eclectic taste.
In contrast to Peterson’s original social stratification research this research investigates the cultural omnivore from a value−based cultural economic perspective. The aim of this research is to analyze the role of the cultural omnivore as consumer of cultural goods and services and look at its relationship with artists and cultural organization. The research shows that the cultural omnivore tries to realize sequential values through experience and spectacle. Additionally the research pleads for the use of the new label for the cultural omnivore, namely cultural traveler, an appellation that fits character of the cultural omnivore better than its original name.","['Cultural Omnivore', 'Cultural Economics', 'Taste', 'Cultural Consumption', 'Value', 'Cultural Traveller', 'Focus Group']"

The media and creative industries have been facing a new challenge in the past decade such as, but not limited to, the implementation of new digital media technologies in their digital promotional strategies. This research looks into the promotional activities in contemporary Bollywood that are visible to the consumer.  The research question: “How does Bollywood use social media for promotional activities to reach the domestic and global market and possibly strengthen their current promotional strategies?” will be answered through two in-depth case studies on Bollywood blockbuster movie ‘Happy New Year’ and a movie that did exceptionally well ‘Queen’. This research firstly touches upon the changes and the development the industry went through, followed by creating an understanding of the industry’s contemporary position. The first step of the analysis is based on creating an in-depth understanding of the cases and the corresponding data from among others Facebook and Twitter. The following step of the analysis is solely focussed on the adjoining film music industry, in which the attention is paid to the promotion of the film music and also the promotion through the official social media channels of the cases. The third area of focus being unravelled is the (global) audience of the film industry. The audience has been divided in multiple segments, in order to identify possible appealable elements in the movies’ online promotional activities.

Throughout this final section the role and influence of the celebrities on the audience and society plays an important role, as well as the role of the celebrity in promotional efforts of the movie.

Theater en het individu,M. Balm,2015-07-14,['Dr. S. van Tuinen'],Erasmus School of Philosophy,"Het boek Dialogen van Claire Parnet en Gilles Deleuze is het vertrekpunt van deze scriptie. Aan de hand van een introductie en beschrijving van een immanent theater en een uiteenzetting van het denken van Deleuze aangaande individu en identiteit, wordt het boek Dialogen gebruikt om een kritiek te vormen op het representatieve theater. Dialogen is als theatrale figuur op te vatten en vanuit dit oogpunt vormt het een mogelijke kritiek op representatieve theatrale figuren. Doordat het boek de titel Dialogen draagt, maar tegelijkertijd niet te vatten is in de traditionele opvatting van een dialoog, kan worden gesteld dat dit boek een nieuw potentieel van dit theatrale figuur (de dialoog) wil actualiseren. Het boek is niet een representatie van een dialoog op schrift, maar is juist een boek dat actief produceert. Deze scriptie concludeert vanuit dit oogpunt dat een immanente vorm van theater en theatrale figuren een nieuw potentieel kan actualiseren daar waar representatieve theatrale vormen dit niet kunnen.","['Dialogen', 'theater', 'Deleuze', 'individu']"

The Ice Bucket Challenge campaign was a global buzz on social media in 2014 and was a philanthropic success. Such a viral marketing campaign with philanthropic purposes rarely occurred in terms of the outstanding use of social media. The popularity of this campaign in China attracted attention to the Chinese specific cultural and social context. Sina Weibo was the social platform where the ice bucket challenge achieved great social engagement. In terms of the Chinese cultural and social specificity, this study focused on the social engagement and response triggering of the Ice Bucket Challenge on Sina Weibo. Two research questions led this case study: One aimed at identifying the key strategies for social engagement performed by the ice bucket challenge viral messages on Sina Weibo. The other aimed at interpreting the related attitudes and behaviors of the engaged Chinese users. This study used the viral message theory and elaboration likelihood model as theoretical foundation. 
The study applied a sequential mixed qualitative method, including qualitative content analysis on the top 100 engaging viral messages on Sina Weibo and in-depth interviews with 12 Chinese engaged users. A triangulation of the two research questions finally completed this case study. This study summarized the key strategies in the viral messages for social engagement and highlighted the theoretical dimensions including authority, sentiment and informational relevance. Analysis on the influence on related attitudes and behaviors overall indicated a shift from the periphery route to the central route with time going and highlighted the theoretical variables including source credibility, sentiment and information quality. Finally, this study clarified the gap between social engagement and response triggering in the Ice Bucket Challenge campaign on Sina Weibo. The campaign was concluded as a success raising public awareness of the rare disease in China, but a failure to gather proportional donations from the Chinese civil society.","['Ice Bucket Challenge (IBC)', 'Sina Weibo (SW)', 'Social media', 'Philanthropic', 'Chinese', 'Viral messages', 'Social engagement', 'Elaboration likelihood model (ELM)', 'Attitudes', 'Behaviors']"

nieuwswaarden, frames en bronnen. De centrale hoofdvraag binnen dit onderzoek is: In hoeverre
is de berichtgeving over de kledingindustrie in Bangladesh veranderd na het ongeluk in Rana
plaza? Deze vraag is beantwoord met behulp van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse van de
berichtgeving in Nederlandse dagbladen.
Het ongeluk waarbij de acht verdieping tellende kledingfabriek Rana Plaza instortte in
Bangladesh, vormt de casestudy binnen dit onderzoek. Dit onderzoek daagt de bestaande
theorieën die gevormd zijn over mediahypes uit. De aandacht voor het ongeluk en daarmee
corresponderende onderwerpen neemt toe, maar journalisten blijven op een tamelijk constante
manier over Maatschappelijk Verantwoord Ondernemen (MVO) en de kledingindustrie in
Bangladesh schrijven. De manier waarop onderzoekers framen verandert niet en het gebruik van
nieuwswaardige bronnen neemt juist af binnen de berichtgeving. Wel ontstaat er een golf aan
media-aandacht voor het ongeluk en de daar aan relaterende onderwerpen zoals MVO en de
kledingindustrie in Bangladesh.
Media hebben een grote invloed op het succes of falen van MVO. Omdat de berichtgeving na het
ongeluk in Bangladesh over MVO fors is toegenomen, dragen media bij aan de bewustwording
van MVO in Nederland. De invloed van media hierop was nog groter geweest wanneer zij in hun
berichtgeving schreven over ethiek in combinatie met de problematiek in de kledingindustrie en
wanneer zij de nadruk hadden gelegd op duurzaam consumeren in hun berichtgeving. Nu richten

I set out to look beyond the often-used predictors of taste such as gender, age, level of education and income. This research explains people’s preference in high art by studying the activities, motives, experiences and barriers of theatre and classical music-goers. The aim was to find out to what extent differences between these two groups could explain their taste, this in order to horizontally broaden the knowledge of highbrow art appreciation. How can we differentiate the white, highly educated elderly people with a love for theatre or classical music? In order to answer this question, sixteen in-depth interviews were conducted with regular visitors from a theatre and a concert hall, both located in the city centre of Rotterdam. 
 	It is found that the two audience groups of theatre and classical music cannot be put under the same umbrella. We cannot only make the distinction between audiences of popular and high art, but also between audiences of canonised art forms. Classical music-goers are overall older and show a less omnivorous taste. Regular visitors of classical music show higher levels of appreciation and participation, often transferred by their families. Theatregoers attach great value to the educative aspect of their night out and feel the need to take part in topical debates with their company. Regular visitors of theatre distance themselves from the elitist visitors of classical music and they feel it would take time to learn to appreciate this musical style. In this research I address multiple other conclusions that cause a clear image of both audience groups that helps to understand why and in which ways people participate in highbrow art.","['cultural taste', 'cultural preferences', 'highbrow taste', 'motives', 'art experience', 'cultural barriers', 'theatre visitors', 'classical music visitors', 'audience research and perception.']"
Festival invasion,A. Bernard,2015-07-13,['F. Chiaravalloti'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Festivalisation is a neologism that describes the proliferation of festivals all

This research investigates the festivalisation phenomenon from a new point

incurs in higher costs than having a normal program. Festivals help permanent

Betekenis van gender in de TV serie Revenge,N. Benhaddou,2015-07-09,"['J.C. van Sterkenburg', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Tegenwoordig worden we overal geconfronteerd met media; op straat, in tijdschriften, op het internet en op televisie. Media scheppen een beeld over diverse onderwerpen en deze beelden kunnen ons (on)bewust beïnvloeden in de manier waarop we onszelf zien. Een medium dat over de hele wereld vaak gebruikt wordt is de televisie. In Europa en Amerika kijken mensen 3 tot 5 uur per dag televisie en dat aantal uren zal onvermijdelijk een effect op ons hebben. Zo kan televisie bijvoorbeeld het discours over gender beïnvloeden, over hoe je je als man of vrouw hoort te gedragen. Onderzoek heeft namelijk uitgewezen dat wij via de televisie leren wat gender passend gedrag is. Het verschil in gender wordt toegewezen aan een aantal kenmerken van mannen en vrouwen die passen onder de termen masculiniteit (welke verbonden wordt aan mannen) en femininiteit (welke verbonden wordt aan vrouwen). Omdat media deel uitmaken van ons dagelijks leven en kunnen bepalen wat sociaal acceptabel is, is het interessant om te zien hoe gender weergegeven wordt op televisie, een medium dat miljoenen mensen over de hele wereld bereikt. Dit onderzoek richt zich dan ook specifiek op de representatie van gender in TV series. Eerder onderzoek heeft al uitgewezen dat er veranderingen te bespeuren zijn in films met betrekking tot het discours van gender en nu is de vraag of er ook een kentering waar te nemen is in TV series. In deze scriptie wordt dit onderzocht door middel van één case, de populaire TV serie Revenge. In het onderzoek is gebruik gemaakt van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse om de representatie van twee vrouwelijke protagonisten, Emily Thorne en Victoria Grayson, in het eerste seizoen te analyseren. Dit is gedaan door gebruik te maken van een thematische analyse, waar door middel van het coderen van data, vier dominante thema’s naar voren zijn gekomen. Deze vier dominante thema’s zijn: Het belang van familie, Emily en Victoria in controle, Emily en Victoria als intellectueel en Emily en Victoria als expressief. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat dit onderzoek gedeeltelijk aansluiting vindt bij eerdere onderzoeken naar gender op televisie. Over de betekenis die de representatie van Emily en Victoria in de TV serie Revenge krijgt, kunnen we dan ook zeggen dat bestaande discoursen rondom gender enerzijds worden bevestigd, voornamelijk op het gebied van familie. Anderzijds daagt de TV serie deze gender discoursen ook uit, doordat beide protagonisten ook veel traditioneel mannelijke eigenschappen toegekend krijgen. Daarnaast hebben zij veel macht over hun mannelijke tegenspelers, wat ingaat tegen eerder onderzoek. Bij beide protagonisten lijken vrouwelijke eigenschappen als emoties onderdrukt te worden door mannelijke eigenschappen als kracht en het niet tonen van emoties. Hierdoor daagt de serie bestaande gender discoursen uit en lijken deze representaties een uiting van bredere maatschappelijke veranderingen in het discours over gender te zijn, doordat beide protagonisten worden geportretteerd als sterk, onafhankelijk en zij in controle zijn.","['gender', 'discours', 'femininity', 'masculinity', 'TV serie', 'Revenge', 'actie genre', 'actiepersonage', 'gender stereotyperingen', 'kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse', 'thematische analyse', 'genderrollen', 'maatschappelijk discours', 'televisie']"

eulogising the proletariat:
Strategies of representation of intellectual figures
in Romanian film (1960-1989)",P. Mogos,2015-07-07,"['J.M. Engelbert', 'E. Menchen Trevino']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The present thesis aims to offer a valuable and authentic insight into the discursive
construction of representations of intellectual figures in Romanian cinema from the early 1960s
until the late 1980s. By taking into account the importance of the freedom of creation within a
totalitarian geographical space, the main interest of this thesis is to reveal the hidden and latent
meanings that stand behind cinematic representations of intellectuals during such a political
regime. In this sense, as a result of uncovering the modes of representation employed in
Romanian cinema under Communism, this research aims to trace the almost contractual
relationship between compliant filmmakers and politics on the one hand, and the genuine struggles
of power between dissident artists and the restrictive ideology, on the other hand. The novelty of
this project is granted by the adaptation of the multimodal critical discourse analysis, when it
comes to reading films through semiotics and narrative or thematic approaches, and its empirical
merger with an extended range of archival records and historical documents as a means to
produce a penetrating and genuine illustration of the Socialist micro-cosmos in the second half of
the 20th century.
The usefulness of this conceptual, methodological, and analytical combination lies in its
capacity to offer an evocative series of results with respect to the ideological relationship between
cinema and the state apparatus. If the Romanian intellectuals are found to be classified in the
collaborative, the dissident (or even apolitical), and the grey (as a consequence of their ability to
circumvent the system), their cinematic portrayals are characterised either by their nonconformity,
as a way to oppose the ideology, or their working class origin, as a means to eulogise the
proletariat and denigrate the upper classes. What is interesting is that, with very few exceptions,
the ideological conditions imposed by the system can be clearly seen in the type of cinema
produced and, subsequently, in the modes of representation employed in the case of intellectual
figures. As such, if the slender liberalising politics induce the production of dissident cinematic films
and representations, at the same time, Nicolae Ceauşescu’s dictatorial outbursts have a massive
effect on the type of cinema that is being produced. By relying heavily on Antonio Gramsci’s
concept of hegemony and intellectual organicity, Jacques Ranciére’s representational regimes of
art, and Bruno S. Frey’s affirmation of the hegemonic exchange between authoritarian leaders and
various forms of art, the present thesis represents a historical but still topical journey into the
relationship between politics and art and between ideology and culture, ultimately emphasising the
importance of cinema as a means to express the injustices of a people.","['Romanian cinema', 'modes of representation', 'intellectual organicity', 'cultural', 'hegemony', 'representational regimes of art']"
"Expectations and Perceptions 
Responsiveness, content and the issue of Mobile Instant Messaging norms",A.K. van Eldik,2015-07-07,"['J.Jansz', 'E. Menchen Trevino']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Today’s undeniable presence of social media and mobile devices has impacted ways of communicating. In communication, norms exist on which expectations may be based and to which people try to adhere. Adhering or not adhering to certain expectations can result in issues or misunderstandings. However, through the omnipresence of today’s mobile devices, these expectations are constantly present. WhatsApp’s introduction of blue ticks sparked a discussion about norms and expectations towards Mobile Instant Messenger (MIM) platforms. While studies have focused on social media, responsiveness, and Instant Messaging platforms, the topic of expectations towards responsiveness on MIM platforms has remained untouched. The question remains what the existing norms are regarding responsiveness, and what consequences these norms have. Based on these questions, two research questions and three sub questions were formulated. The question central to this study was: what are the expectations of young Dutch people (16-24 years old) regarding responsiveness on Instant Messaging platforms and what consequences does this have on IM usage and relationships? The goal of this study was to identify these expectations and consequences and relating them to age, gender, platform, and social tie strength. This explorative study used semi-structured in-depth interviews as a method. Sixteen participants between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four were interviewed. The transcripts of the interviews were coded and analyzed using Boeije’s (2002) Constant Comparative Method. It was found that a pattern of expectations existed on which responsiveness seemed to be based. Part of this was one’s WhatsApp identity – a personalized expectation largely based on previous behavior. On top of that, it was found that urgency was key and could overrule other influences in creating the expectation of a fast response. WhatsApp was chosen as the number one platform over Facebook. On top of that, tie strength also strongly influenced expectations towards responsiveness, based on a known or unknown WhatsApp identity and knowledge of one’s situation. Age was found to have an influence on responsiveness as well as expectations towards responsiveness. The influence of gender was smaller, yet it was found that women were more emotionally affected by patterns of responsiveness that did not fit their expectation.","['Responsiveness', 'Expectations', 'Mobile Instant Messaging', 'Social Norms', 'Instant Messaging', 'Young Adults', 'Social Media', 'Tie Strength', 'WhatsApp', 'Facebook']"
Finding self in literary fiction,"Bruyne, Kristian Ingmar. de",2015-07-06,['Poecke N. van'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study investigates the role of literary fiction and in particular the Bildungsroman for narrative identity construction. It emphasizes the consumption of its fans, as one can say that they are the most devoted consumers. The results of in-depth interviews with 10 international respondents demonstrate that the consumption of the Bildungsroman by its fans is a form of narrative practices. The consumption of the Bildungsroman as a form of narrative practices is based on three integral concepts. The first implies embodied reading (a potential subcategory of embodied cultural capital), which refers to potential effects of experiencing literary fiction. The second concept is the narratable self, which emphasizes the idea that one cannot narrate the self just individually, but that we also need the other in order to get a full image of who we are and what we can be. The third concept is narrative identity construction, which in this case entails the construction of the self, (partly) based on the subjective experience of fiction.  In other words, this study demonstrates that the consumption of fiction has potential effects on narrative identity construction.","['Bildungsroman', 'fans', 'reception', 'interpretative practice', 'narrative practice', 'narrative identity']"
Teleurstelling en illusie,H.W. Krijger,2015-07-06,"['R.J. Adriaansen', 'G. Oonk']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Rusland lijkt voor Westerse waarnemers al eeuwen een vreemd maar toch ook nabij land. In deze
thesis wordt nader op deze andersheid en nabijheid ingegaan door veertien reisverslagen van tien
Nederlanders reizigers naar Rusland te onderzoeken, geschreven tussen 1781 en 1830. Centraal
staat daarbij de vraag welk beeld deze reizigers in de onderhavige periode van Rusland gaven en in
hoeverre hier sprake was van demi-oriëntalisme en 'othering'. Anders gezegd, was er in de
geschriften van deze reizigers vanaf de late achttiende eeuw een imaginair 'Oost-Europa' – waarin
Rusland werd inbegrepen – zichtbaar? Een 'Oost-Europa' dus waarin Europa en Azië op ambigue
wijze samenkwamen in een mengeling van civilisatie en barbaarsheid, in een beeld dat tot stand
kwam door stereotypen te construeren van de 'Ander'? Een 'Ander'dat op oriëntalistische wijze
werd afgezet tegen het eigen Verlichte zelf. Een 'Ander' echter wel binnen hetzelfde Europa. Deze
scriptie heeft tot doel te onderzoeken of bronnen uit Nederland, een onderbelicht land bij
beeldvormingsstudies naar Rusland, tot aanvullingen of andere inzichten in het Ruslandbeeld
kunnen leiden, tegen de achtergrond van de twee grote bewegingen van die tijd, Verlichting en
Romantiek. Tegen de achtergrond ook van het Europeaniseringsproces dat Rusland vanaf 1700
doormaakte.
De tien reizigers, die voor het merendeel beroepshalve naar Rusland trokken, hadden
uiteenlopende achtergronden. Hun beroep varieerde van arts tot hofdame en van officier uit
Napoleons Grande Armée tot handelaar en regent. Ook opleiding en maatschappelijke positie
liepen uiteen. In negen van de veertien reizen werd de hoofdstad, Sint-Petersburg bezocht. In deze
scriptie wordt zowel aan de ruimtelijke als aan de culturele representatie van de reis aandacht
besteed. In ruimtelijk opzicht wordt binnen de demi-oriëntalistische theorie Sint-Petersburg
voorgesteld als de noordelijke pool van de imaginaire Noord-Zuid grens Sint-Petersburg – de Krim.
Een grens tussen enerzijds ‘Oost-Europa’ en anderzijds de 'Oriënt', een immens Tartaars gebied tot
diep in Siberië. De Krim was in deze voorstelling de zuidelijke pool en het meest oriëntaalse deel
van 'Oost-Europa' en werd door twee Nederlanders bezocht. Bijna allen moesten het grensgebied
van 'Oost-Europa' passeren, maar ver in het Oosten kwam slechts drie reizigers.
In cultureel opzicht komt in deze scriptie de vraag naar voren hoe het Ruslandbeeld werd
geconstrueerd aan de hand van de visie op de Autocratie, politieke representatie, barbaars versus
geciviliseerd, Romantiek en platteland en tenslotte religie. Het demi-oriëntalisme bleek slechts ten
dele bij de Nederlanders aanwezig. Weliswaar sprong men ambigue om met het barbaarse dan wel
het beschaafde en was het contrastdenken voluit aanwezig, maar pas vanaf de Nederlandse
Omwenteling van 1795. Vanaf die tijd werd meer nadruk op Ruslands barbaarsheid gelegd, maar
de ademloze bewondering voor de grote Hoffeesten en de classisistische gebouwen bleef evenwel.
Ook het besef van de 'Ander' binnen Europa was aanwezig, vooral ten aanzien van godsdienst. Ook
overgangen, bijvoorbeeld bij het binnentreden van 'Oost-Europa' vanuit Pruisen, werden ervaren.
Of de reizigers 'Oost-Europa' als eenheid zagen lijkt echter twijfelachtig. Daarnaast lokaliseerden zij
beschaving en barbarij zowel in de standen, zoals vanouds, als in recht en onrecht. Tenslotte
vonden velen de alomtegenwoordige schone schijn in Rusland een teken van barbaarsheid.","['Rusland', 'barbaars', 'beschaafd', 'Oost-Europa', 'Larry Wolff', 'oriëntalisme', 'reisverslagen', 'reizen', 'achttiende eeuw', 'negentiende eeuw', 'tsaren', 'Moskou', 'Sint-Petersburg', 'Napoleon', 'Grande Armée', 'Verlichting', 'Romantiek', 'othering', 'Oosters-Orthodox', 'egodocumenten', 'stereotypering.']"

Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The positive relationship between marriage and subjective well-being is a robust finding in the academic field. There is, however, a growing demand for contextualization of this relationship. It is for instance suggested that the influence of marriage on well-being varies across cultures. Although an understanding of these cross-cultural variations is lacking, existing research does provide indications of what cultural trait might play a role in these variations: national collectivism. Since authors remain ambivalent when it comes to pinpointing what role collectivism plays exactly in the well-known relationship between marriage and subjective well-being, this study aims to fill this gap. Based on a thorough review of relevant literature, this study proposes two ways in which the role of collectivism can be understood, to explain why collectivism either strengthens or weakens the well-being-effect of marriage. First, a cultural interpretation based on the normative nature of marriage is proposed based on sociological literature on social norms and conformity. Second, adopting a different theoretical approach, marriage is interpreted as a source of social support, resulting in a structural interpretation of the role of collectivism. The role of collectivism and both proposed interpretations are empirically tested using all available rounds (2002-2012) of the European Social Survey (N = 212,683). Multilevel analyses reveal that the relationship between marriage and well-being is weaker in collectivistic countries, demonstrating the importance of taking cross-cultural variations into account. The analyses also show that neither of the proposed interpretations can sufficiently explain the dampening role of collectivism. Therefore, an alternative interpretation of the findings is offered in the conclusion, to serve as a stepping stone for future research.","['marriage', 'well-being', 'collectivism', 'individualism', 'cultural context']"

Video games have gained a pivotal role in the society and such privilege position has raised questions about its impact on players. The study of violent graphicness as a trigger for real world aggression has dominated the academic sphere of video games research, but the need to understand motivations, perceptions, and reasoning of players has gained particular relevance in the study of explicit content in video games. This thesis followed the latest direction and through an experimental design, explored how violent and sexual explicit content can influence the perceptions of players and how moral reasoning and judgment of gamers can influence such perceptions. The findings showed that violent content influenced the perception of explicitness when the participants showed a strong salience on morality based on harm and care principles.  On the other hand, sexual content influenced the perception of realism, when the contestants showed a salient moral foundation based on fairness and purity principles. Furthermore, violent content influenced the perception of realism when participants considered violent content too controlled on media. And finally, sexual content influenced the perception of enjoyment when participants previously considered sexual explicit content as objectionable.","['Videogames', 'morality', 'moral foundations', 'explicit content', 'sex in video games', 'violence in video games', 'video game perceptions']"
Doing bad things can be justified?,M. Dziadkowiec,2015-07-03,"['J.Kneer', 'E.

It was already explored that such characters might influence viewer’s perception of harmful behaviors. Viewers are able to develop strong feelings towards morally ambiguous characters, and to create thorough evaluations of the character’s attributes and behaviors, such as character’s moral compass. In the light of above, it is important to investigate how these processes operate and what factors contribute in initiating positive attitudes towards morally ambiguous behaviors. The present study herby examines the importance of different influential factors in the evaluation of morally ambiguous characters and their behaviors. Specifically, it addresses the role of tendency to morally disengage, identification, involvement, enjoyment, justified violence, perceived attractiveness, and perceived successfulness in creating moral judgments. Moreover, in addition to explicit measurements, this study employs implicit measurements of attitudes towards justice and morality. The research question is: to what extent does the content presented in television series influence audience’s attitude towards morally ambiguous behavior? Participants (N = 72) took part in the experiment in which they viewed either attractive and successful character or unattractive and unsuccessful character of drama series. The experiment was divided into two phases. Phase One: Introducing explicit measurements of the attitudes toward morally ambiguous character and his behavior. Phase Two: Change in perception of morality was verified by implicit measure, a reaction time task. The findings of this study enhance understanding of how viewers process morally ambiguous characters that violate moral standards. It was revealed that evaluation of morally ambiguous characters is complex and depends not only on representations of a character and the content itself, but also on the context. Moreover, moral judgment was revealed to be a multidimensional construct, as audience’s judgment of morally ambiguous character can contrast with a judgment of his behavior. Findings also demonstrate that different character’s types are evaluated differently based on different reasons. However, although cognitive responses towards morally ambiguous characters were evaluated differently, automatic responses towards self-justice did not differ among both of the groups. Therefore, present study sheds light not only on the importance of multiple measures of moral judgment, but also indicates that implicit measurements are needed when examining attitudes.

In mijn masterthesis buig ik me over deze toch merkwaardige ontwikkeling; hierbij richtte ik mij op het geschiedenisonderwijs in het Nederlandse voortgezet onderwijs. Om een lange-termijnverklaring mogelijk te maken, koos ik onder andere voor een kwantitatief onderzoek, waarbij meer dan 100 geschiedenismethodes van na 1900 werden onderzocht. Uit dit onderzoek werd een aantal zaken duidelijk. Het meest opvallend is dat het aantal woorden dat in schoolboeken besteed wordt aan de slag bij Waterloo in absolute zin sterk is teruggelopen, vooral vanaf de jaren ’60 van de twintigste eeuw. Met deze terugloop veranderden ook de plotlijnen van de narratieven: de verhalen werden een-dimensionaler en de epische concentratie is steeds intenser geworden. Vanaf medio jaren tachtig komen er ook schoolboeken op de markt waarin de slag in het geheel niet meer wordt vermeld. Aan de hand van een kwalitatief onderzoek van vijf uitgelichte methodes bleek dat de auteurs Waterloo zeer verschillend beschreven. De hoofpersonen, de keerpunten en de oorzaken die de schrijvers aandroegen voor het verlies der Fransen zijn weinig uniform. 
Voor deze ontwikkeling draag ik in mijn thesis een aantal verklaringen en oorzaken aan. Allereerst heeft in de twintigste eeuw het schoolvak geschiedenis verschillende transformaties ondergaan. Van een vak dat de natiestaat op essentialistische wijze benaderde, werd het na de Mammoetwet (1968) veel meer een thematisch vak, gericht op historische vaardigheden, waarbij leerlingen leerden zoeken naar ‘eigen’ waarheden. Voorts werd na 1968 het vak geschiedenis minder belangrijk geacht en verminderde het aantal lesuren drastisch; ook was de chronologische aanpak niet langer het dominante kader. De slag bij Waterloo was in deze nieuwe context minder functioneel. Eveneens is de temporele afstand tot 1815 gegroeid en waren er andere ontwikkelingen in de wereldgeschiedenis die veel ruimte in de lesmethodes opeisten. Dit ging ten koste van andere, eerdere ontwikkelingen in de geschiedenis.
Vanaf het einde van de zestiger jaren is het wetenschappelijke paradigma van de natiestaat onder druk komen te staan. De vanzelfsprekendheid ervan werd betwist en er kwam een denationalisering op gang die het natiebesef deconstrueerde en ontmaskerde. De ‘dapperheid’ van de Nederlanders en de kroonprins, in vooral de oudere schoolboeken zeer prominent aanwezig, waren elementen die zeer geschikt waren om een nationalistische geschiedenis te schrijven, en dat was nu juist wat op de schop ging. Als gevolg  van de denationalisering – en mede door andere ontwikkelingen, die in mijn studie worden beschreven – is aan de behandeling van Waterloo veel ‘oorlogsschade’ toegebracht.","['Waterloo', 'geschiedenisonderwijs', 'schoolboeken', 'schoolboekonderzoek', 'collectieve herinnering', 'nationalisme', 'natiestaat', 'temporele afstand', 'narratieve constructies']"

Yet little research was done on this subject. Motivation and enjoyment have positive influences on gaming in general and on learning processes. The exact relationship between the components of motivation (competence, autonomy and relatedness according to the Self Determination Theory) and the three types of learning outcomes is examined in this research for the first time. 75 pairs of questionnaires (namely a pre- and posttest around the game SMS Racing) revealed mainly perceived learning, behavior was also significantly changed by playing the game. Autonomy, relatedness and enjoyment appeared to be significant predictors of most learning outcomes. The strongest predictor was enjoyment – an interesting finding since the role of enjoyment (as predictor versus outcome) is discussed in literature. Woman and respondents with less gaming experience scored higher on some learning outcomes, something that needs more research. Findings in this thesis are relevant to both commercial operators and to parties like governments and educators that want to influence targetgroups by games.","['Serious games', 'entertainmentgames', 'games and learning', 'motivation theory', 'Self Determination Theory (SDT)', 'fun', 'enjoyment']"
Millennials and Brands,A.C. Nwatarali,2015-06-26,"['J.H.

While millennials are sometimes viewed as active and engaged consumers who purposely seek out brands to connect, interact and in some cases collaborate with brands (Tanyel et al., 2013; Gurau, 2012; Moore, 2012; Lantos, 2014). Fournier and Avery’s (2011) perspective suggests that, brands are in a way invading the social space of consumers, and that social media was created for people and not for brands. This study aims to find out the role brands play in the lives of university-aged millennials through social media. 
	The literature review discusses relevant literature, which partly helped guide the analysis of the thesis. A qualitative content analysis approach through a hybrid thematic analysis method was used to answer the research question. 
	The findings of the research suggest that brands play a role in the everyday lives of millennials through informing, inspiring, and connecting them with others. Through the use of brand marketing strategies such as relational and (virtual) experiential and in some cases collaborative marketing, brands are able to engage with their consumers and vice-versa. The findings adapt these strategies to social media elements and reveal which techniques work best or were more prevalent in the findings of the study. In general relational marketing strategies such as financial, social, and structural bonds were found to be a way to highly engage students. Experiential marketing strategies were also found as an important aspect especially when connected to inspiration and motivation as a role in the lives of students. In regards to consumers connecting with others through brands, co-creation of value for the brand can be formed through eWOM.
	The implications towards theory and practice are discussed in detail.","['Millennials', 'Consumer engagement', 'Social media', 'Brand marketing strategies']"
At a crossroads: Journalism and entrepreneurship in the Balkans,M.S. Nacheva,2015-06-26,"['P.M. Leendertse', 'J. Jansz']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the past decade, many have debated over the future of news journalism, the decline
of print and the imminent rise of online media. In fact, hardly anyone would deny that
the Internet has brought about fundamental changes to media markets around the world,
including in the rather small, yet culturally diverse Balkan region. With increasing
competition, established news outlets in the region have been struggling to innovate fast
enough to keep their revenues from dropping, and many media newcomers have faced
the hard task of creating sustainable business models from scratch. As a result, media
professionals in the Balkans have identified the need to become more opportunistic and
entrepreneurial, while preserving the journalistic integrity of their work.
At the heart of entrepreneurship is the ability to generate unique customer value.
With ongoing challenges to their independence as well as the small and fragmented
markets unable to fully support their operations, online news media in the Balkans are in
need to create unique value and stand out from their competition in order to make it in
the long run. The current study takes a qualitative approach to investigate the extent to
which digital news publications in the Balkans are being entrepreneurial in their strife to
produce sustainable and independent journalism. Derived from eleven semi-structured
expert interviews, the results indicate that although the level of entrepreneurship is still
quite low, journalists and media owners in the Balkans are starting to understand the
new dynamics of the media market and the role that the Internet plays in it. Many have
already taken the first step of embracing technology and updating much of the value that
they have traditionally been offering to their audiences, yet what is still needed to create
entirely new propositions from the bottom up.","['entrepreneurial journalism', 'business model innovation', 'online news media', 'online journalism', 'value creation', 'Balkans']"

Door middel van crowdfunding en crowdsourcing wordt het publiek bijvoorbeeld ingezet om kennis en financiële middelen te verschaffen om deze kostbare vorm van journalistiek te stimuleren. Hierdoor komen journalisten in contact met een nieuwe journalistieke vorm waarbij de band met het publiek steeds belangrijker wordt. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om deze relatie tussen de donateur en journalist inzichtelijk te maken door verwachtingen en behoeften van beide partijen in kaart te brengen. Doormiddel van een kwantitatieve vragenlijst is de motivatie en het geefgedrag van de donateurs geanalyseerd. Met kwalitatieve diepte-interviews onder Yournalism journalisten wordt nagegaan of de wensen en behoeften van de donateur aansluiten op het perspectief van de journalist. 
	Het onderzoek laat zien dat er drie verschillende profielen van donateurs bestaan. Het profiel dat het meeste voorkomt onder Yournalism donateurs, is het altruïstische profiel waarbij de extrinsieke motivatie om de maatschappij te verbeteren en onderzoeksjournalistiek te stimuleren, domineert. De vragenlijst laat verder zien dat de meeste donateurs niet verwachten dat er een band ontstaat met de journalist, maar wel op de hoogte gehouden willen worden over de voortgang van het onderzoek. Dit blijkt in de praktijk lastig te realiseren omdat journalisten geen informatie of inzichten willen blootgeven die gebruikt kan worden door anderen. Deze toenemende interactie tussen de journalist en het publiek is herkenbaar voor de nieuwe journalistieke norm waarbij ook profilering van de journalist en het opbouwen van een achterban worden gezien als capaciteiten waar de moderne journalist over moet beschikken.","['crowdfunding', 'onderzoeksjournalistiek', 'motivatiefactoren', 'capaciteiten van de journalist', 'verwachtingen donateurs', 'relatie journalist en donateur', 'interactie', 'nieuwe journalistiek', 'journalistieke verdienmodellen']"

The commodification of street art,T.N. Ilcheva,2015-06-26,"['J.L.D. Neys', 'I. Awad Cherit']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The graffiti subculture is a global phenomenon often placed in socio-cultural and media academic contexts. In recent years, significant changes occurred in respect of the distinctiveness of subcultures from mass culture, and the graffiti subculture as such. Its prospering coexistence with institutional forces such as the government or the market gradually erases its ideological primacy as an illicit practice (Borghini et al, 2010). The formation of a graffiti art marketplace and a semi-formalised global street art economy (Schacter, 2013) confronts graffiti subculture’s initial purpose to challenge cultural hegemony (Hebdige, 1979). Economic and media forces intensify the processes of commodification, mediatization and commercialization of graffiti arousing graffiti artists to consider this renovation of graffiti’s social implications.
The subculture’s incorporation in mass culture was here examined in regard to the graffiti community in Bulgaria. As the increasing acceptance of graffiti by the mass are effects of the rise of a neo-liberal form of political–economic governance (Lombard, 2013) a developing country such as Bulgaria where neo-liberal governance has been recently applied arrives to give an interesting perspective on the global movement of graffiti’s commodification. Hence, addressing the research question How does the commodification of street art affect the graffiti community in Bulgaria? fifteen qualitative semi-structured interviews with graffitists from Bulgaria were conducted. Data analysis revealed the emerging challenges graffiti’s commodification creates for the Bulgarian graffiti community and the emanating ways they find to tackle them. Key findings demonstrated the authenticity of graffiti subculture to be in question as graffitists were rather open to use the graffiti skill for commercial purposes and might even compromise their personal artistic expression. Alternatively, in order to preserve the original nature of the subculture, Bulgarian graffitists argued a mission to establish a clear distinction between genuine graffiti and commercial graffiti which would then be a potential method for the subculture to remain its existence as such.","['graffiti', 'street art', 'commodification', 'mediatization', 'subculture', 'interviews']"

In dit onderzoek worden theorieën over stagnatie gebruikt om de problematiek van de Nederlandse filmindustrie te kunnen analyseren. Het Business Model Canvas van Osterwalder et al.

De alternatieve businessmodellen voor de Nederlandse filmindustrie zijn besproken met professionals uit verschillende distributielagen. Uit de analyse van deze interviews zijn drie kernthema’s naar voren gekomen die de stagnatie van de Nederlandse filmindustrie kenmerken. Bij het eerste kernthema gaat het er om dat alle rechthebbenden hun content willen verkopen op zoveel mogelijk verschillende platformen. Vanwege de onmogelijkheid om samen te werken wordt er, met name in de nieuwe digitale wereld, gezocht naar niches, waarbij er vastgehouden wordt aan exclusiviteit. Bij het tweede kernthema gaat het er om dat elke distributielaag bestaat uit bedrijven met bepaalde expertises. Het is niet mogelijk om dergelijke verschillende expertises binnen één bedrijf uit te voeren. Bij het derde kernthema gaat het er om dat de release windows in stand gehouden worden door het belang van twee vaste pijlers: de bioscoop en de televisie. Alle innovaties die op dit moment plaatsvinden in de Nederlandse filmindustrie hebben te maken met de windows die daar tussenin zitten, waarbij het niet de verwachting is dat er een platform komt waar de consument alle content kan vinden. Samengevat zijn deze niches, expertises en release windows de belangrijkste oorzaken van de stagnatie in de Nederlandse filmindustrie.

Abstract

Nowadays there are many online possibilities to borrow, swap, lend, and rent. Although sharing is as old as mankind, the internet provides a platform on which sharing can happen on a large scale and with greater ease. For sharing platforms, encouraging meaningful interactions and trust between members are important aspects and when platforms do not succeed in this, members are not willing to share. However, many sharing organizations are struggling with stimulating interactions and trust and therefore have difficulty with getting an engaged online community. This master thesis explores how offline meetings for suppliers and demanders, initiated by a sharing platform, can stimulate more online community engagement. The three main building blocks of this thesis are online community engagement, offline meetings and the relation offline meetings and the online community. 

Literature on these three elements already indicates offline meetings are still important in forming a more closely tightened community. By means of qualitative interviews among eleven members of four platforms, this thesis shows generalized norms and trust are encouraged by offline meetings and in this way stimulate online community engagement. Moreover, members also get more life contentment by visiting events, as their knowledge grows and they enjoy the social contact with like-minded members. By using the theory of social capital, generalized norms, trust, and life contentment were expected to play in stimulating online community engagement. In addition, this thesis found two other elements that also stimulate more online community engagement that were not present in the literature about this topic. These elements are trust in the organization and the relevance of the platform. After an event, these two concepts together with generalized norms, trust, and life contentment will create a boost for members to engage with the online and offline community again.","['Sharing economy', 'online community engagement', 'offline and online interaction', 'offline meetings', 'trust', 'social capital theory', 'online platform']"

information and the requirements which are necessary for the vacant position that could be of
influence on future performance of an individual. However, in practice there are several other
subjective influencing factors (e.g. ethnicity, physical appearance and gender). This research
aims to assess how and why recruitment professionals perceive a job candidate as credible when
screening LinkedIn profiles for future candidates. This study is conducted by qualitatively
exploring the three components of Ohanian’s (1990) perceived credibility: attractiveness, trust
and expertise. By means of the think-aloud method in interviews and photo elicitation, that is
showing visualisations of seven different visual cues (e.g. smiling, formal attire) eleven
recruitment professionals are questioned about their underlying motives and thoughts while
judging the job applicants. A nuance in business sector is applied as this study focuses on a
marketing consultant. The findings of this study suggest that recruitments professionals make
an effort to systematically and rationally judge job applicants, however unconsciously, their
online information processing is led by simple judgmental heuristics such as visual cues in a
profile picture. Especially the cues of smiling and eye-contact appear to have a positive
influence on the perception of perceived credibility. In addition, the findings indicate that the
visual cue of attire can be used by job applicants to express the perceived fit with a type of
organisation, formal (e.g. corporate organisation) or informal (e.g. start-up). With this
knowledge, the likelihood to obtain a job interview for starters or graduates is just a few visual
cues away.","['Online Personal branding', 'LinkedIn', 'E-recruitment', 'Social Information', 'Processing', 'Self-presentation']"

Ruigrok', 'S.F. van der Land']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het Jodendom is een veelbesproken religie die vanaf de Tweede Wereldoorlog op veel manieren een rol heeft gespeeld in de mondiale en Nederlandse geschiedenis. Daarnaast speelde deze religie een belangrijke rol bij de stichting van de staat Israël en het conflict dat daaruit volgde met de Arabische landen om Israël heen en met name Palestina. De manier waarop burgers tegen het Jodendom aankijken wordt voor een groot deel bepaald door de berichtgeving in de media (Ruigrok, Van Atteveldt, Takens, 2012a), waardoor juiste berichtgeving essentieel is. Dit onderzoek richt zich op de ontwikkeling van de representatie van het Jodendom in De Telegraaf, met als onderzoekvraag: In hoeverre is de framing van het Jodendom in De Telegraaf veranderd in de periode van 1949 tot en met 2014? Aan de hand van een automatische en handmatige inhoudsanalyse is onderzocht welke nieuwswaarden ten grondslag liggen aan de berichtgeving van het Jodendom, hoe het slachtoffer-frame en het dader-frame zich hebben ontwikkeld en de mate van objectiviteit van De Telegraaf door middel van hun brongebruik. 
	Het Jodendom blijft anno 2015 nieuwswaardig, mede door het conflict wat gaande is tussen Israël en Palestina. Conflict-nieuws voert hier de boventoon. Het slachtoffer-frame wat is ontstaan na de Tweede Wereldoorlog en zeer veel aanwezig was neemt af en Joden komen steeds frequenter als dader in het nieuws. Van een omwenteling komt het echter niet, maar de houding tegenover Israël is veranderd en een steeds kritischere blik ontstaat. Toch blijft er een bias van de journalisten tegenover het conflict in Israël. Palestijnse aanslagen worden geframed als terrorisme, waar Israëlisch geweld als legitiem wordt gezien. Daarnaast komen Israëlische bronnen ruim drie keer vaker aan het woord in De Telegraaf dan Palestijnse bronnen en gemiddeld wordt er maar 1,54 bronnen per artikel genoemd. Van hoor en wederhoor lijkt in het conflict-nieuws geen sprake. De rol van de media is weliswaar veranderd van slechts informatief naar een kritische blik als waakhond, maar schieten tekort in hun objectiviteit.","['Jodendom', 'Conflict', 'Israël', 'Palestina', 'Framing', 'Nieuwswaarden', 'Brongebruik', 'De Telegraaf', 'Journalistiek', 'Rol van de media']"
Public Relations: Er bestaan meerdere sleutels tot succes,V.C. Kowalski,2015-06-25,"['B.C.M. Kester', 'A.F.M.

Dit doen zij omdat een groot deel van hun reputatie afhankelijk is van berichtgeving in de media. Zo ontstaat een ‘aandachteconomie’ waarin bedrijven steeds meer met elkaar concurreren om de aandacht te trekken van de consument. Een groot deel van onze informatievoorziening bestaat hierdoor uit de commerciële informatie afkomstig van bedrijven.
Dit onderzoek laat zien hoe twee bedrijven, Stedin en Douwe Egberts, de media en het publiek proberen te beïnvloeden door de inzet van corporate communicatie en public relations (PR). Er wordt getest of de ‘algemene’ theorieën over de invloed van PR ook gelden voor de twee desbetreffende bedrijven. Door middel van een specifiekere invalshoek wordt gekeken hoe groot de invloed van bedrijven op de media is en welke verschillende vormen communicatiemanagement kent. Dit onderzoek tracht hiermee inzicht te krijgen in waarom sommige bedrijven ‘succesvoller’ zijn in de media dan andere.
Door middel van mixed methods wordt onderzocht hoe de PR activiteiten van bedrijven de media en het publiek kunnen beïnvloeden. De media-aandacht die bedrijven weten te genereren en de manier waarop journalisten met deze informatie omgaan staan hierbij centraal. In het onderzoek wordt bijvoorbeeld gekeken in welke mate journalisten PR berichtgeving letterlijk overnemen of juist aanpassen voordat het in de media verschijnt. Daarnaast laat het onderzoek zien aan de hand van welke onderwerpen en op welke toon bedrijven in het nieuws komen.
In het onderzoek wordt vervolgens gekeken naar de manier waarop corporate communicatie en PR uiteindelijk, via de media, bij het publiek terecht komen. De manier waarop het publiek via social media reageert op bedrijven bied inzicht hoe het publiek met commerciële informatie omgaat. Door middel van verschillende kwantitatieve analyses wordt gekeken hoe het publiek, en de reacties die zij geven op social media, een rol kunnen spelen bij het ‘succes’ van PR.","['PR', 'public relations', 'corporate communicatie', 'social media', 'Stedin', 'Douwe Egberts']"
Serious games and branding,M. Karaki,2015-06-24,"['P. Arora', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The gaming market is expanding to include not only traditional nonprofit firms but also for-profit and hybrid entities that have strong social values and missions. Specifically, due to high pressures from the part of social activists, companies are trying to respond through developing CSR strategies in order to appear more legitimate to their publics (Van Cranenburgh, Liket, & Roome, 2013). While previous papers have documented the trend of INGOs using serious games (SGs) for education-entertainment (Arora & Itu, 2010) the phenomenon of companies branding themselves and their causes through SGs have not been adequately addressed to this day. This thesis examines a wide array of SGs, developed from various types of organizations, aiming at raising awareness and stimulating activism. This taxonomy aims to shed more light on the ways branding differs not only among the non-profit and commercial sector but also among larger and smaller companies, generating patterns that will not only contribute to the existing SGs’ research but bring a real life perspective of how the CSR sector and the SG entwine. In addition, as social issues require far more resources than any single organization is capable of mobilizing independently, my main focus will be to investigate potential emerging partnerships and social alliances that span the non-profit and for-profit boundary and create hybrid entities of professional and educational pillars working in tandem. Therefore, through analyzing with a content and comparative analysis the ways in which each organization promotes their SGs and through exploring their design and narratives through auto-ethnography, this paper highlights the various schemes leading to activism, portraying different and novel branding patterns.","['Serious games taxonomy', 'branding', 'activism', 'CSR', 'hybrid organizations']"

Dit gezelschap heeft een koerswijziging ondergaan door de komst van een nieuwe artistiek leider, waardoor er veranderingen zijn geweest in de identiteit van het gezelschap. Daarom biedt dit onderzoek uitkomst op de vraag hoe het publiek van Theater Artemis de promotiemiddelen van het gezelschap interpreteert en hoe dit is gerelateerd aan de intentie om een voorstelling te bezoeken.
Dit onderzoek heeft de marketingstrategie in de culturele sector als uitgangspunt genomen waarbij het product centraal staat in plaats van de consument. De marketingstrategie van het gezelschap is onder de loep genomen door het afnemen van interviews met medewerkers van het gezelschap en met bezoekers van Theater Artemis. De interviews met het gezelschap hebben zich gericht op de identiteit van het gezelschap, op de keuzes binnen de marketingstrategie, en op het verdelen van verantwoordelijkheden voor de promotiemiddelen. In de interviews met de bezoekers zijn verschillende promotiemiddelen voorgelegd en besproken en er is beeld ontstaan van de belangrijke elementen van promotiemiddelen in de jeugdtheatersector. Daarnaast is er aandacht besteedt aan de identiteit van het gezelschap zowel uit het oogpunt van de bezoeker als dat van het gezelschap zelf. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat binnen de jeugdtheatersector de thematiek van de voorstelling voorop staat. Deze moet dan ook duidelijk naar voren komen in de promotiemiddelen die het gezelschap gebruikt. Het is ook belangrijk dat de vorm van de voorstelling naar voren komt in de middelen. Dit kan bewerkstelligt worden door het decor of de acteurs in de promotiemiddelen naar voren te laten komen. Er moet een balans gevonden worden in het delen van de vorm van de voorstelling en de inhoud. In het geval van Theater Artemis wordt er geen eenduidig beeld overgedragen aan de bezoeker, doordat de thematiek en de vorm niet altijd naar voren komen in de middelen. Hierdoor worden de middelen wisselend ontvangen door de bezoekers. Dit kan ten grondslag liggen aan de duale structuur van het gezelschap waardoor de verantwoordelijkheid voor de marketingstrategie verspreidt is over verschillende medewerkers. De bezoekers willen daarnaast graag verrast worden over wat zij kunnen verwachten in een voorstelling, veel informatie hebben zij dus niet nodig. Voor informatie over een voorstelling gaan ze af op mond-tot-mondreclame, brochures, recensies, en de tekst over de voorstelling. De analoge promotiemiddelen blijven dus populair. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat er een eenduidige identiteit moet worden bepaald voor het gezelschap en dat er meer scheiding zou moeten zijn in de verantwoordelijkheid voor de promotiemiddelen.","['Artemis', 'Theater', 'Marketing', 'Identiteit', 'Media']"
Streaming: New ways to save time or procrastinate even more?,E.Stoyanova,2015-06-23,"['J.Kneer', 'I. Awad Cherit']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study addresses the interactivity of streaming and the changes that have been brought to how people watch television. The main goal of this research is to find out how streaming in general influences procrastination. Using a previous study as a model, relationships between ego depletion, procrastination, guilt, enjoyment, vitality, recovery experience, passion, and intrinsic needs satisfaction were tested using data from an online survey (N = 473). Results suggest that although an individual may procrastinate more after streaming (interactive media use) than after watching traditional television (noninteractive media use), subsequent negative effects typically associated with procrastination such as guilt and obsessive passion are lower in comparison to traditional television. Positive effects, such as recovery experience, harmonious passion, and enjoyment, are also more prevalent in streaming than in traditional television. Furthermore, not only have popular streaming platforms provided thousands of hours of TV content to be watched online at anytime, hit shows like Orange Is The New Black and House of Cards can only be watched online.  With streaming giving more control to the viewer than ever before, this thesis will focus on whether this way of watching television will help users save time or procrastinate even more. These findings are an important step in understanding the role of streaming in a world where television is increasingly watched online and the user is in control rather than depending on traditional linear programming.","['Streaming', 'procrastination', 'video-on-demand', 'traditional television']"
Why Dutch media start-ups in the screen-based industry locate in Amsterdam,N. Duijndam,2015-06-23,"['H.J.C.J. Hitters', 'A.F.M.

Therefore, this research examines why young media companies(founded in 2010 or later), operating in the screen-based industry, want to be located in Amsterdam. Based on previous theory and research, there already exist some factors that could be of possible influence on why young media companies want to locate in Amsterdam, such as soft location factors and residential quality. However, this research is an addition to literature by diving into these concepts and trying to understand why they are possibly important and how they work. Ten in-depth interviews among a variety of young media companies operating in the screen-based industry in Amsterdam were conducted. Results indicate that young media companies want to be located in Amsterdam because they can be close to each other, experience the competition around them as beneficial, gain knowledge out of the city, have easy access to a social network, are surrounded by a specialized pool of labour, the image of the city reflects on the image of their company in a positive way, the diversity that the city offers, the dynamics of the city, the ‘real life’ face to face interaction that the city offers and finally because Amsterdam is the place to be for (partially) digital media companies. Moreover, the results provide insights on why Amsterdam is chosen over Hilversum and possible explanations for the current movement that is going on.","['Media cluster', 'start-ups', 'screen-based media industry', 'soft location factors', 'residential quality', 'digital developments on colocation', 'Amsterdam', 'in-depth interviews']"

The Sweetie campaign aims to generate awareness on the growing issue of web-cam sex tourism (WCST), advocating for changes in policies in order to fight this problem in the Philippines. The thesis examines how the message of the campaign has been represented in British and Australian media by uncovering the frames used by the media. Moreover, the thesis explores the media discourse of WCST and how this discourse shapes its changing definition. Employing a qualitative content analysis, the study explores the frames used in news reports that concern the Sweetie campaign. The results indicate four emerging frames. The most employed frame was the positive frame, followed by the negative frame, the responsibility frame and the collective frame. Additionally, the findings were discussed on the levels of social change and policy change. Finally, as the aim of the thesis is to reveal the frames used by the media, the findings contribute to the field of framing analysis in media studies, with special attention given to public will campaigns.","['Media', 'NGO campaign', 'social change', 'policy change', 'framing analysis', 'discourse analysis']"

examined
how

ages
of
eighteen
and
twenty-­‐five
years
old,
construct
meaning
of
the
female
role
and

Previous
studies
in
the
field
of

suggest
that
most
of
the
time
women
are
represented
as
sex
symbols
that
have
a
submissive
role.
According
to
feminist
theories
this
representation
has
a
negative
effect
on
gender
ideologies
in
society.
There
is,
however,
a
shift
visible
in
contemporary
feminism
that
posits
that
the
sexual
role
of
women
in
the
media
is
a
form
of
female
emancipation.
This
is
also
known
as
postfeminism.
According
to
this
movement,
gender
equality
can
be
achieved
by
seeking
for
sexual
freedom
of
women.
As
many
studies
argue
that
postfeminism
fits
in
contemporary
postmodern
society,
this
thesis
also
examined
whether
young
adults
give
meaning
to
the
female
role
and
sexuality
in
a
postfeminist
way.
To
investigate
this,
qualitative
research,
namely
interviews,
was
used.
During
these
sixteen
interviews
with
young
men
and
women
three
music
videos
were
shown.
The
results
of
the
current
study
show
that
the
way
young
men
and
women
give
meaning
to
the
female
role
and
sexuality
in
music
videos
is
complex.
There
is
both
a
postfeminist,
as
well
as
a
traditional
feminist
interpretation
possible.
On
the
one
hand,
a
postfeminist
interpretation
entails
that
women,
according
to
the
participants,
have
agency
in
showing
their
female
sexuality
and
as
such
they
are
described
as
beautiful
and
strong.
On
the
other
hand,
a
feminist
interpretation
is
possible,
because
the
women,
according
to
the
participants,
have
a
sexual
role
in
the
music
video
and
show
too
much
nudity
which
negatively
affects
their
image.
In
addition,
the
participants
think
that
this
sexual
and
nude
role
for
women
leads
to
a
distorted
view
for
children
in
how
women
should
behave
or
dress
in
society.
The
participants
did,
however,
indicate
that
they
understood
why
women
in
the
music
videos
are
represented
like
this.
According
to
them,
it
will
lead
to
more
attention
towards
the
music(video).
Participants
also
were
critical
of
the
way
the
media
messages
were
constructed.
Their
construction
of
meaning
can
be
described
as
referential
and
critical.
And
while
the
way
young
adults
constructed
meaning
around
the
female
role
and
sexuality
in
music
videos
in
a
complex
way,
it
also
seems
that
when
women
show
their
sexuality
it
is
not
experienced
as
something
negative.
It
seems
that
the
postfeminism
idea
that
women
should
be
sexually
free
is
gaining
more
popularity
among
youngsters,
especially
in
an
economic
sense.
According
to
the
participants,
it
has
a
commercial
value

Whether
this

is
also
a

remains
questionable.","['representations', 'of', 'women', 'female', 'role', 'female', 'sexuality', 'postfeminism', 'popular', 'music', 'videos']"

The current research aims to legitimize the inclusion of negative experiences in the existing theoretical framework, which suggests that certain types of positive touristic experiences facilitate one’s authenticity. Based on original existential theory and current developments in the field, this study engages qualitative content analysis of travel blogs to detect the categories of negative touristic experiences that that evoke individual’s sense of self. As a result, a set of such categories emerges and demonstrates that, first, negative and positive contributing experiences may be classified similarly and, second, that negative experiences catalyze the sense of liminality, which, in turn, is a necessary requirement for the comprehension of existential authenticity. The result suggests that previously exclusion of negative experiences from the studies on authenticity in tourism is invalid and limits the understanding of the phenomenon.","['authenticity', 'liminality', 'touristic experience', 'travel blogs', 'existentialism']"

Deze gezondheidsbeweging bestaat uit ‘gezond’ eten en veelvuldig sporten en is enorm populair. Hierdoor wordt er veel over gepraat in de hedendaagse media, zoals in dagbladen of in televisieprogramma’s. Er zijn tevens gespecialiseerdere media die dieper ingaan op de huidige gezondheidsbeweging, zogenaamde fitblogs. Deze gezondheidsbeweging blijkt echter zowel voor- als tegenstanders te hebben, ook wel fans en anti-fans genoemd. Omdat verschillende mensen, verschillende betekenissen geven aan dezelfde gezondheidsbeweging (er zijn immers fans en anti-fans van hetzelfde fenomeen), gaat dit onderzoek ervan uit dat het publiek actief is. De manier waarop fans en anti-fans betekenis geven aan de huidige gezondheidsbeweging hangt samen met de mate waarin ze een actief publiek zijn (structure en agency), de mate waarin ze zich verbonden voelen met andersdenkenden en gelijkdenkenden en de mate waarin ze hun betekenisgeving omzetten in productiviteit. Van tevoren werd gedacht dat de betekenisgeving van de fans en anti-fans ver uit elkaar zou liggen.
Voor dit onderzoek zijn zestien diepte-interviews afgenomen met fans en anti-fans van de huidige gezondheidsbeweging. Uit de data van deze interviews blijkt dat de mate van verbondenheid en de manieren waarop fans en anti-fans produceren, redelijk van elkaar verschillen. Het verschil in betekenisgeving tussen de fans en anti-fans ligt echter minder uit uiteen, dan van te voren werd gedacht. Fans zijn niet alleen positief en anti-fans zijn niet alleen negatief over de huidige gezondheidsbeweging. Eigenlijk vinden beide partijen dat de huidige gezondheidsbeweging een positieve ontwikkeling is, omdat mensen bewuster bezig zijn met eten.

Police Communication and Citizen Initiatives on Web 2.0,V.J. Koutstaal,2015-06-19,"['D. Trottier', 'I. Awad Cherit']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research provides an exploratory overview of the connection between the police, citizens participating in crowd-sourced policing and/or digital vigilantism on Web 2.0 and the concept of visibility in the context of the Netherlands. These concepts – policing, citizen policing, and visibility – can be considered as interwoven, however, in which ways has remained unclear so far. Based on the idea that the online world provides new effortless ways of communication and thereby stimulates citizen activities such as digital vigilantism and crowd-sourced policing, this thesis looked into how the police, an organization that only recently embraced the potential of Web 2.0, responded to this development in the Netherlands, and how this interaction and the activities by each group have impacted the social visibility of the police, these citizens, as well as that of suspects and/or missing persons. The central question for this research therefore was: In which ways do citizens initiatives – such as crowd-sourced policing and digital vigilantism – and the police influence each other’s actions as well as the social visibility of the police, suspects and/or missing persons, and citizens themselves, through their Web 2.0 communication? Data gathering through qualitative interviews with six Rotterdam police representatives as well as four citizens involved in crowd-sourced policing and thematic analysis of this data led to four main themes, namely Web 2.0, police communication, citizen participation, and visibility. The themes confirmed that Web 2.0 stimulated citizen’s willingness to help out the police, either by responding to their call for help or starting a supplementary action themselves, while at the same time showing that it has led to an increase in the police’s willingness to share information and ask citizens for help. Due to this increase in deliberate police communication as well as in citizen actions due to the lack of effort and time it requires, the police and suspects and/or missing persons have moreover become more visible as information on these groups has increased, is visible on several platforms, and is shared more often. Additionally, activities on Web 2.0 by citizens have also increased the visibility of these citizens despite the possibility of anonymity.","['Web 2.0', 'Visibility', 'Citizen Initiatives', 'Digital Vigilantism', 'Crowd-sourced Policing', 'Online Communication', 'Police', 'Suspects', 'Missing Persons']"

Product reality as an opportunity for corporate reputation?,N. Driftschröer,2015-06-19,"['V. Chaudhri', 'E. Menchen Trevino']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In light of the rising numbers of product recalls, this research analyses how consumers in Germany perceive the impact of a product recall on corporate reputation. In contrast to the traditional perception of product recalls as a threat to corporate reputation, this thesis takes a modern perspective to recalls, considering them as an opportunity for corporate reputation. As such, the study examines how and under which conditions a product recall can enhance consumers’ perception of corporate reputation. Results of four focus group discussions and an inductive thematic analysis suggest that emotions and associations greatly impact consumer perceptions of a corporation during a recall. Therefore, corporations can shape consumer judgment during a recall by leveraging on priming and framing effects of consumers’ past experiences with the corporation. More specifically, the research found that a recall can – under certain conditions – pose an opportunity for a corporation and improve perceived corporate reputation among a subset of participants. These conditions include that (1) the corporation recalls the product voluntarily and out of caution. Also, the corporation should enjoy (2) positive prior reputation among consumers and (3) not be perceived as responsible for product harm, (4) while the product harm should be low. Finally, the corporation should employ ethical behaviour, by (5) apologizing for the inconveniences, (6) using honest communication and (7) displaying transparency. Hereby, a product recall can serve as an opportunity for perceived corporate reputation among a subset of German consumers. 
	 Moreover, the results propose that corporations can enhance perceived corporate reputation by employing ethical communication and adhering to CSR during a recall. Thus, corporations’ may generate reputational benefits by considering a product recall as part of an overall CSR strategy. In this sense, a corporation could use a product harm incident to display its social responsibility, which can improve a corporation’s credibility and reliability. Yet, as an open and transparent behaviour might imply reputational risks and costs, corporations need to evaluate the benefits of such an approach for the corporation in each recall situation.","['consumer perception', 'corporate reputation', 'corporate social responsibility', 'opportunity', 'product recall']"

In

the
topic

high
potential
for
debate.
The
growing
interest
in

sector
has
thus
triggered
the
author
to
investigate
how
the
consumer
makes
sense
of
sustainability
in
the
luxury

So
far
literature
suggests
one
consumer
perception
to
exist
concerning
the
chosen
issue,
which
can
be
referred
to
as
‘the
paradox’.
This
can
be
defined
as
consumers
having
a
conflicting
image
of
the
two
concepts,
luxury
and
sustainability,
perceiving
them
to
be
opposing.
On
the
other
hand,
recent
scholarly
works
that
do
not
take
the

talk
about
a
possible
convergence

To
be
able

provide
an
in-­‐depth
understanding
of
the
sense
making
process,
the
author
specifically
looked
at
three
major
aspects:
1)
the
existing
knowledge
about
the
paradox,
2)
whether
or
not
an
attitude-­‐behaviour
gap
exists
and
3)
the
benefits
of
improved

strategies.
This
research
does
acknowledge
consumer
recognition
of
the
paradox.
However,
the
most
important
finding
is
a
more
nuanced
way
of
seeing
the
relationship.
A
second
consumer
perspective
is
added
to
existing
literature,
namely
a
positive
correlation
between
the
two
concepts,
which
makes
the
luxury
industry
a
candidate
for
acting
as
a
pioneer
for
sustainability.
By
adding
the
second
consumer
perspective
this
research
acts
as
a
bridge
between
the
scholarly
viewpoint
and
the
consumer
viewpoint
and
evidently
predicts
a
possible
future
for
the
concept
of
sustainability
in
the
luxury

industry.
This
future
is
mainly
based
on
intensified
communication,

helps
the

to
fade
away

can

Entrepreneurial journalism,C.C. Wirabangsa,2015-06-19,"['C.E. Aalberts', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis presents the results of the market adjustment of journalists to the digitally, mediated news landscape. Digitalisation has led to budget cutbacks in journalism productions, dismissal of fulltime editorial staff, shortage in journalism jobs and free content. Fierce competition from the abundance of (freely accessible) content and freelance journalists has changed the work process, responsibilities and (public) roles of journalists and correspondingly the labour market. There is no automatic legitimacy anymore both for journalism organizations and the individual journalists.
The adjustments to such a competitive market were explored through personal interviews with freelance journalists. The interview transcripts were analysed through open, axial and selective coding in an inductive grounded theory approach. The main findings include an explanation about why market adjustments were necessary in such ways and a description of what entrepreneurial journalism is in the field. The experiences, adjustments, the interpretations of entrepreneurial journalism and the expectations for the future of journalism are thoroughly discussed. 
The main outcome is that journalists should not only provide content, but also be involved in ensuring the probability of creating good journalism by taking action of the business side of journalism. The business involves the distribution/publishing, marketing, sales and budget management of editorial content and other events around it. This is what is considered to be entrepreneurial journalism. Reacting and adapting is not enough anymore, the journalist should take initiative and action for reaching an audience and making money with their journalism products by taking financial risks. However, Internet provides ample opportunities to lower the financial risks, which is why most entrepreneurial journalists find their successful business model for their journalism product online. 
Furthermore, journalism does not pay the bills anymore and therefore journalists have commercial jobs on the side that are non-journalism related. A discussion is whether or not the commercial side jobs in which journalism independency is not always kept intact are good or bad for journalism. Journalism is also considered to be a craft instead of a profession in which additional responsibilities and new roles have been added to the traditional job description: the role of the journalist is shifting from news provider to information specialist and entrepreneur with the main responsibility of reaching an audience in a profitable way. Moreover, journalists will have to be willing to learn new (entrepreneurial) competences, in order to survive financially as a journalist. 
Thus, even though it was traditionally not expected of journalists to be involved in business, the financial circumstances of traditional media (mainly) due to digitalisation have redefined this understanding. It has led to a new term that is used to stipulate what the future of journalism may look like: entrepreneurial journalism, which refers to the need for journalists to act in an economic sense.","['entrepreneurial journalism', 'commercialisation', 'information specialist', 'market adjustments', 'business models', 'new labour market', 'journalism responsibilities', 'financial survival']"
"Vrouwen, voetbal en sociale media",N.A. Davidse,2015-06-19,"['J.C. van Sterkenburg', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het doel van dit onderzoek is om de betekenisgeving aan vrouwenvoetbal van jonge vrouwelijke voetballers van 15 t/m 20 jaar, en de rol die sociale media hierin spelen, te onderzoeken. Momenteel is het vrouwenvoetbal de snelst groeiende teamsport in Nederland. Ondanks deze ontwikkeling wordt voetbal voornamelijk gezien als sport voor mannen. Ook sportmedia zijn overwegend gericht op mannensporten. Hierbij worden vrouwensporten niet geheel buitengesloten, maar worden ze wel regelmatig gemarginaliseerd en onzichtbaar gemaakt. Het heersende media discours is dat mannensporten dominant aan vrouwensporten zijn. Dit heersende discours is van invloed op wat vrouwenvoetbal betekent in de maatschappij. Dit kan zich bijvoorbeeld uiten in dat het vrouwenvoetbal er niet toe doet en dat vrouwen geen deel uitmaken van de sportwereld. Tevens kan het discours ook grotere maatschappelijke discoursen bevestigen of versterken, zoals bijvoorbeeld de gelijkwaardigheid tussen man en vrouw in de samenleving. In dit onderzoek wordt een cultural studies perspectief gehanteerd waarbij jonge vrouwelijke voetballers over de door hun beoefende, en door de media gemarginaliseerde sport, aan het woord worden gelaten. Hierbij staat de betekenisgeving die zij als jonge vrouwelijke voetballers aan vrouwenvoetbal geven centraal. Ook wordt bekeken welke rol sociale media hierin spelen. Er zijn vier focusgroepen georganiseerd en aan de hand van een kwalitatieve thematische inhoudsanalyse zijn deze focusgroepen geanalyseerd. Uit de analyse zijn twee hoofdthema’s naar voren gekomen, namelijk ‘sociale media als informatiebron’ en ‘mannenvoetbal als norm’. Daarnaast is een ander belangrijk resultaat uit dit onderzoek dat er tussen en binnen de verschillende focusgroepen een grote diversiteit aan vertogen heerst. Aan de hand van de thema’s kan worden geconcludeerd dat de betekenisgeving van jonge vrouwelijke voetballers aan vrouwenvoetbal beïnvloed wordt door machtige discoursen. De media en hun directe omgeving zijn beiden bronnen die discoursen verspreiden en van waaruit de geïnterviewde meisjes betekenis toekennen aan vrouwenvoetbal. De rol van sociale media hierin is dat ze deze machtige discoursen kunnen veranderen of tegenwerken. Doordat de geïnterviewde meisjes zelf foto’s, berichtjes of filmpjes posten over hun eigen voetbalprestaties, wordt er een alternatief discours geproduceerd ten opzichte van het mannenvoetbal, dat desondanks dominant aanwezig blijft op sociale media. Daarnaast vormen ook de eigen sportbeoefening en de eigen ervaringen van meisjes met vrouwenvoetbal een alternatief discours. Echter, ondanks dat sociale media een relatief eenvoudige manier zijn om een ‘counter-femininity’ te produceren en eigen ervaringen ook belangrijk zouden moeten zijn, kan worden geconcludeerd dat het lijkt alsof de meisjes over het algemeen nauwelijks afwijken van het heersende media discours in hun eigen vertogen over vrouwenvoetbal.","['Vrouwenvoetbal', 'Gender', 'Sociale media', 'Discours', 'Audience']"
Beeldvorming en online othering op een Nederlands-Marokkaans forum,M.I. Kock,2015-06-19,"['A.G. Fokkema', 'H.J.C.J. Fokkema']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Deze thesis onderzoekt welke mechanismen van beeldvorming gebruikt worden in de discussies op het forum Marokko.nl. Dit is relevant omdat moslims, allochtonen en minderheden ondervertegenwoordigd zijn in de samenleving, media en in onderzoek. Ook blijkt er beperkt onderzoek te zijn over de beeldvorming door deze groep op online fora. Door middel van een open benadering van de critical discoursanalyse gebaseerd op de analysemethode van Machin & Mayr (2012) is antwoord op de onderzoeksvraag gegeven. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat de mechanismen stereotyperen, generaliseren en othering toegepast worden op het forum. Deze mechanismen worden ondersteund door lexical absences, structural oppositions en overlexicalisation (Machin & Mayr, 2012). Hierbij is overlexicalisation tevens een sterk mechanisme gebleken dat ingezet wordt om groepen te typeren, waaronder “de Nederlander”. Door middel van overlexicalisation koppelen forumdeelnemers de kenmerken blank, autochtoon en atheïstisch aan Nederlanders. Uit het onderzoek blijkt ook dat othering voornamelijk plaatsvindt ten opzichte van deze getypeerde Nederlander. Stereotypes over Nederlanders op het forum zijn dat zij pedofielen, tokkies en asociaal zijn. Het stereotype dat Nederlanders pedofielen zijn is het sterkst aanwezig. Daarnaast wordt er op het forum ook gesproken over andere groepen, zoals pedofielen, het Westen, joden en Palestijnen. De manier waarop er over het Westen gesproken wordt, is gebaseerd op een occidentalistisch discours (Buruma & Margalit, 2014). Overkoepelende denkbeelden die gevonden zijn op het forum zijn het denkbeeld waarin joden als benchmark gebruikt worden het denkbeeld waarin kritiek op de media gegeven wordt. In de thesis wordt beargumenteerd dat de kritiek die de forumdeelnemers uiten op de media een mogelijk gevolg is van de toegenomen focus van de media op moslims na de aanslagen van 9/11 (Mamadouh, 2003; Abdullah, 2007; Abrahamian, 2003; Saeed, 2007; Smets & Kreuk, 2008).

Distinction and Presentation with #guiltypleasure,"Vlegel, Liesbeth. van der",2015-06-19,['Berkers P.P.L.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Guilty pleasure is a manner by which people can legitimacy appropriate ‘bad’ popular culture 
without losing face. As a style of consumption, guilty pleasures,  enable consumers to cross 
and uphold symbolic boundaries between their ‘real’ taste and ‘bad’ taste. By using the phrase, 
consumers are able to pursue distinction between themselves and the product and between 
those who consume the product seriously. By analyzing 9605 tweets, this research combined 
the theoretical concepts of distinction (Pierre Bourdieu, 1984) and presentation (Erving Goffman, 
1959), to uncover how Twitter users apply guilty pleasures to present their taste.
Sharing your guilty pleasure on Twitter is a contradiction. The phrase entails that the Twitter 
user is embarrassed about the consumption, but by publicly displaying a guilty pleasure the 
product is elevated and given attention. By distancing themselves from a guilty pleasure product 
through communicating how they consume it, Twitter users are able to enjoy popular culture 
without endangering their ‘real’ taste and desired identity. This performance helps consumers 
to maintain the impression of ‘good’ taste in the presence their imagined online audience. The 
following research question is addressed: In what ways do people present their guilty pleasures 
on Twitter about different cultural products and practices and how do they aim to distinguish 
themselves?
This question is answered with a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of tweets. Tweets 
were gathered by using the sampling technique of the constructed week. After the data cleaning, 
9605 tweets were analyzed by using topic modeling (LDA), topic browsers, semantic networks 
and frequently used nouns, adjectives and hashtags. The analysis is done on the complete 
sample and several different content categories, that were created by coding all the tweets 
with AmCAT. As a results, this research identified three strategies to present a guilty pleasure 
and create distinction: distancing by describing the product, distancing by using time and 
distancing by attitude. Additionally, this research found three main types of attitudes: defensive, 
offensive and the confessional presentation. The findings are presented in a tentative model. 
The research concludes by summarizing the main findings, contributions and suggestions for 
future research.","['guilty pleasure', 'Twitter', 'Bourdieu', 'Goffman', 'presentation of self', 'ironic consumption', 'consumption', 'styles', 'Distinction', 'imagined audience', 'hashtags', 'topic modeling', 'topic browser', 'semantic', 'network.']"
Gedifferentieerd HRM beleid: op weg naar duurzame inzetbaarheid,"Hoek, T. (Tim)",2015-06-17,"['Steijn Prof.dr. A.J. (Bram)', 'Buuren Dr. M.W. van (Arwin)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"De Rijksoverheid wordt geconfronteerd met een personeelsbestand waarvan over zes jaar één op de drie rijksambtenaren 55 jaar of ouder is. De vergrijzing van de komende jaren zorgt ervoor dat het thema duurzame inzetbaarheid steeds relevanter wordt. Neem hierbij de transitie die de afgelopen jaren is opgetreden bij de werkgever Rijk in het loopbaanbeleid: van lifetime employment naar lifetime employability (Feenstra, 2014). Waar werknemers voorheen dachten hetzelfde werk tot aan hun pensioen te kunnen doen wordt er nu juist van hen verwacht dat zij zelf aan hun inzetbaarheid denken, functieroulatie wordt vanaf heden gestimuleerd waarbij de functieverblijfsduur niet mag leiden tot ‘vastgeroestheid’(Hervormingsagenda Rijksdienst, 2013). De grote groep oudere werknemers wordt geconfronteerd met een verschuiving van verwachtingen waarbij zij geacht worden nog aan hun inzetbaarheid te werken en eventueel nog een stap te maken, waarbij een krappe arbeidsmarkt ook nog om de hoek komt kijken.
Deze ontwikkelingen zorgen voor een verschuiving van verwachtingen die werkgever en werknemer van elkaar hebben. Bepaalde ongeschreven verwachtingen vormen een psychologisch contract. De verandering van het psychologisch contract wordt omschreven als een verschuiving van het zogenaamde oude naar het nieuwe psychologisch contract. Voornamelijk voor oudere werknemers zijn bepaalde verwachtingen gedurende de ontwikkelingen voor een groot deel veranderd. De oudere werknemers kunnen niet meer vroegtijdig met pensioen, zij zijn niet meer zeker van hun baan en er wordt van hen verwacht dat zij hun eigen employability op peil houden. Hier kan dus sprake zijn van een schending van het psychologisch contract (Robinson & Rousseau, 1994). De mogelijke schending van het psychologisch contract kan eventueel leiden tot minder motivatie en inzetbaarheid onder werknemers. De vraag die dus relevant is, is hoe men deze groep werknemers gemotiveerd en inzetbaar houdt? Logischerwijs dient het psychologisch contract dus ‘geheeld’ of in stand gehouden te worden. Maar hoe kan men dit bewerkstelligen?
Verwachtingen die werkgever en werknemer van elkaar hebben zijn per groep werknemers of op individueel niveau verschillend. Zoals besproken is de oudere generatie werknemers met hele andere verwachtingen gaan werken dan de nieuwere generatie werknemers. Door verschillende benaderingen te hanteren voor verschillende groepen kan er in ieders behoefte worden voorzien en kunnen ook de verschillende verwachtingen, die onder groepen erg uiteen kunnen lopen, gemanaged worden. Binnen de HRM literatuur behandelt men een nieuw concept dat hierop inspeelt: gedifferentieerd HRM beleid (Marescaux, De Winne & Sels, 2013). Dit houdt kort gezegd in dat er bij verschillende mensen verschillende HR praktijken en HRM beleid gehanteerd worden: HRM beleid op maat. Groot vraagstuk dat hierbij optreedt is of dit als rechtvaardig wordt gezien door andere groepen, willen zij een gelijke behandeling voor iedereen of zien zij de eventuele voordelen die gedifferentieerd HRM beleid kan opleveren voor de organisatie als iets positiefs?","['gedifferentieerd HRM-beleid', 'psychologisch contract', 'duurzame inzetbaarheid']"

Uit interviews met consultants blijkt dat de legitimiteit en betekenis die zij geven aan het nieuwe werken volgens hen niet terugkomen in de uitvoering ervan door organisaties. Respondenten blijven vasthouden aan de legitimiteit van het nieuwe werken als manier van werken, ondanks dat organisaties de managementtrend minder legitiem vinden. Volgens respondenten wordt de veronderstelde kritiek op het nieuwe werken verklaard doordat organisaties de managementtechniek verkeerd invoeren.

Price elasticity and other factors of demand for a Dutch theatre,J. van Seeters,2015-06-17,"['E. Dekker', 'C. Langeveld']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Using the 2004-2013 sales data of a Dutch theatre, I estimate demand for the performing arts. Particularly, I investigate ways to derive Price Elasticity of Demand (PEoD) from revealed preference using panel data and analyze the data on different levels of aggregation (i.e. per month, per performance and per artist). First, I examine the effect of performance characteristics (i.e. nth time performed, premiere, uniqueness, reprise, weekend) on demand. Secondly, in an attempt to find a more detailed explanation for the decline in theatre visits since 2008, the start of the financial crisis, I find that consumer trust does not significantly influence demand. Because during this crisis the government applied a higher VAT on performing arts, I was able to estimate the decrease in theatre visits in the short runas a consequence of the overall higher VAT, ignoring heterogeneity, in determining price of theatre. Finally, I attempt to control for the heterogeneity of the performances (in terms of popularity and artist) and succeed to some extent; by constructing a measure for popularity from search engine data and using a weighted average of PEoD estimates per artist, the quality differences between performances are partially included in the model for estimating demand.","['theatre', 'determinants of demand', 'price elasticity of demand', 'popularity', 'consumer trust']"
De houdbaarheidsdatum van ambitie,"Feddachen, S. (Souhaila)",2015-06-12,"['Homburg Dr. V.M.F. (Vincent)', 'Dulk Dr. L. den (Laura)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Met dit onderzoek wordt getracht om arbeidsmotivatie onder ambtenaren met de leeftijd 52 jaar en ouder te meten en verklaren, door bestaande hypotheses uit de literatuur te confronteren met data uit de survey, te houden onder oudere medewerkers binnen de gemeente Leiden. De vraag die centraal staat in dit onderzoek is: ‘hoe kan arbeidsmotivatie onder ambtenaren met de leeftijd van 52 jaar en ouder worden verklaard?’. Wanneer de motiverende factoren gespecificeerd worden voor de doelgroep ouderen en ambtenaren, komt uit de literatuur naar voren dat voor ambtenaren een Public Service Motivation geldt (Buelens en Van den Broeck, 2007, Steijn, 2008, Wright, 2001 ). Uit de literatuur is gebleken dat interessant en betekenisvol/ belangrijk werk van invloed is op de werkmotivatie onder oudere ambtenaren. Deze twee kenmerken van het werk zelf zijn onderdeel van de public service motivation onder ambtenaren. Public service motivation bevat elementen zoals de mogelijkheid om een impact hebben op de publieke zaak, het hebben van toewijding aan het dienen van het algemeen belang, en een belang in het bereiken van sociale rechtvaardigheid (Buelens en Van den Broeck, 2007). Verantwoordelijkheid en de mate van invloed die een werknemer heeft, liggen volgens Deci en Gagne (2005) ten grondslag aan de intrinsieke motivatie. Mensen hebben het nodig om zich bevoegd en autonoom te voelen om hun intrinsieke motivatie te behouden (Deci en Gagne. 2005). Ouderen zouden volgens de literatuur meer belang hechten aan onafhankelijkheid en autonomie (Busch et al, 2010) en dit zou een grotere invloed hebben op de arbeidsmotivatie. Volgens de literatuur naar de motivatie onder ambtenaren kan een soortgelijk verband gevonden worden. Ook ambtenaren zouden meer waarden toekennen aan het hebben van autonomie op werk (Houston 2000, Buelens en Van den Broeck 2007). Ouderen hechten naast autonomie ook een sterk belang aan samenwerking met anderen op werk (Busch et al, 2010). Positieve sociale contacten en social support zijn belangrijke eigenschap voor oudere werknemers in organisaties (Busch et al, 2010). Ook komt naar voren dat oudere werknemers het belangrijk vinden om voldoening aan het gebruik van hun vaardigheden te krijgen en om te genieten van de kansen om creatief te zijn (Busch et al, 2010). Zelfactualisatie is specifiek voor ouderen een motivator, hoe meer men hun persoonlijke vaardigheden kan inzetten en kan ontwikkelen des te meer men gemotiveerd zal zijn..Naar mate een werknemer ouder wordt, hoe meer de perceptie van de eigen prestaties belangrijker wordt. Erkenning en waardering zijn centraal motiverende factoren voor het werken op een oudere leeftijd, hierbij gaat het om immateriële erkenning (Busch et al, 2010). Dit geldt ook voor ambtenaren, zij zijn meer gemotiveerd door het krijgen van erkenning op werk (Houston 2000, Buelens en Van den Broeck 2007). Uit de resultaten van dit onderzoek blijkt dat enkel voor PSM, zelfactualisatie en social support genoeg bewijs is om vast te stellen dat zij een verband hebben met arbeidsmotivatie. Voor autonomie, sociale relaties en erkenning is geen bewijs gevonden voor een verband met arbeidsmotivatie.","['arbeidsmotivatie', 'motivatie', 'ouderen', 'ambtenaren', 'publieke sector en gemeente Leiden']"

(Jose)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Initiatieven van bewoners en (sociale) ondernemers worden steeds belangrijker om de samenleving goed te laten functioneren. Het zijn niet alleen meer  initiatieven, het zijn vooral initiatieven die meer omvatten dan alleen een buurtactiviteit of een verbetering van een bestaande situatie. Bewoners denken na over hun rol in de wijk als één werkend geheel. Dat gaat over zorg, werk en samenleven, taken waar de overheid en de professionals tot op heden zelf het beleid bepaalden. Dit veroorzaakt een (wederzijdse) zoektocht naar nieuwe vormen van samenwerking of overdracht van taken. De vragen voor de overheid daarbij zijn: ‘vasthouden, loslaten of samenwerken?, wat is de motivatie van de burger om de taken van de overheid over te nemen?, wat is het effect van  overheidssturing op initiatieven?, wanneer heeft de overheidsprofessional bemoeienis bij een burgerinitiatief?’. Het onderzoek beoogt met theorieën over netwerksturing, participatiemotivatie en doe-democratie, inzicht te geven in de Barendrechtse participatiepraktijk. De focus van het onderzoek richt zich op
het handelingsperspectief van de Barendrechtse samenleving, participatiemotivatie. Participatiemotivatie wordt in dit onderzoek onderbouwd met de Self-Determination Theory van de Amerikaanse onderzoekers Deci en Ryan. Deze theorie baseert zich op de drie basisbehoeften van de mens die nodig zijn voor zelfontplooiing: competence, relatedness en autonomy. Uitgaande van deze basisbehoeften is onderzocht wat voor effect, de drie typen netwerksturing: stimuleren, faciliteren en coproductie, hierop hebben. Tot slot wordt onderzocht of de gehanteerde sturingsstijl heeft geleid tot actief burgerschap en doe-democratie. Voor het onderzoek zijn voor iedere sturingsstijl twee, en in totaal zes casussen geselecteerd. Op deze manier is er sprake van ‘contrasterende cases’ waardoor de oorzaak-gevolgrelatie beter vastgesteld kan worden. Met de betrokken initiatiefnemers of participanten zijn diepte-interviews gehouden en er is een SRQ-test (Self-Regulation Questionnaire) afgenomen. Uit de analyse van de empirische resultaten blijkt dat de casussen binnen de sturingsstijl  faciliteren, het hoogst scoren op het bereiken van actief burgerschap en doe-democratie. De basisbehoefte autonomie blijkt daar grote invloed op te hebben, beide respondenten scoren daar hoog. De casussen, binnen de sturingsstijl stimuleren, scoren matig tot laag op het ontwikkelen van actief burgerschap en doe-democratie. Daarbinnen laat de casus Buurt Bestuurt potentie zien voor het ontwikkelen van actief burgerschap en doe-democratie, en de casus Buurtpreventie minder. De casussen binnen de sturingsstijl coproductie, laten beiden een geringe score zien op het bereiken actief burgerschap en doe-democratie. In dit onderzoek is naar voren gekomen, dat het bieden van ruimte de beste resultaten oplevert om actief burgerschap te laten ontstaan. De sturingsstijl die daar het best bij past is faciliteren. Het maximale effect wordt aldus behaald met beperkte grip. Door gebruik te maken van de ‘Self Determination Theory’ is inzicht verkregen, waarop de sturing zich het best kan richten en wat de invloed is op de drie basisbehoeften. De inzet van sturing vereist van de gemeente meer bewustzijn en alertheid.","['Netwerksturing', 'Participatiemotivatie', 'Doe-democratie']"

Dekker', 'C.W. Handke']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study reports three distinct analyses of consensus on literary quality: consensus between expert juries, between expert juries and consumers (non-experts), and between experts over time. The study looks into the verdicts of three American juries (Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, National Book Award for Fiction and the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction) and three Dutch/Flemish juries (AKO Literatuurprijs, Libris Literatuurprijs and the Gouden Boekenuil) that annually award books and investigates whether they nominate/award the same books in a given year. This research recognizes the argument raised by Dekker and Popik (2014) which states that this type of interjury consensus cannot be appropriately measured by the means of reliability analysis and the Cronbach’s alpha composite. Following Dekker and Popik, different aspects of consensus are discussed, after which the measure (β) is used to assess the level of agreement. Deviations from the overall consensus by particular juries are also indicated. This is followed by an examination of the accordance between the juries’ judgments and consumer preference. The latter is indicated by bestseller lists on the one hand and online ratings on the other hand. Finally, this research employs a test-of-time analysis. It examines whether books that are honoured by the expert juries appear in anthologies too. The analyses reveal an interjury tendency towards dissensus rather than consensus, which contrasts with findings for the film industry reporting moderate to high levels of agreement. Theoretical reasons for this inter-industry difference are put forward. Moreover, results on the level of consensus between expert juries and consumers suggest that consumers also find that the nominated/awarded books are superior to general books. This does however not persuade them to buy these honoured books in great numbers. A final finding is that experts over time agree moderately with each other on literary quality",['Cultural economics \uf0a0 Awards \uf0a0 Expert juries \uf0a0 Literary prize \uf0a0 Interjury consensus \uf0a0 Product quality \uf0a0 Book sales \uf0a0 Test of time analysis']
' Perception of Visual Art',M.S. van Engelen,2015-06-08,"['C.J.M. van Eijck', 'L.E. Braden']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In modernity, art experts are considered as a separate group of art viewers that experience art in a distinctive manner (Savazzi et al., 2014). It is assumed that one must learn how to interpret a work of art. In art schools and art history classes , future artists and experts on art are trained to pay attention, beyond the figurative elements of a painting, to other aspects of the paintings (e.g. the historical context, different painting styles and the composition of objects, forms and colour; Pihko et al., 2011, p. 1). Consequently, it is a common belief that art experts can perceive more in paintings than non-experts. They are thought to guide their gaze through their internal cognitive schemes or strategies which enable them to look beyond such figurative elements. However, this belief lacks experimental evidence. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating, by means of an eye-tracking device, the visual explorative behaviour of people with differing level of expertise of art, in “bottom-up saliency regions” and “top-down saliency regions”, while looking at paintings. I have created and conducted, an experiment to measure to what extent someone’s familiarity with art influences his or her eye fixations during the perception of paintings. The experiment consisted of gathering physical data (recoding participants’ eye-movements) and survey data (e.g., registration of background variables and cultural capital of the participants) regarding the observation of paintings. Because I particularly focused on the difference in top-down and bottom-up perception during art-viewing instead of natural scene-viewing, the use of actual original paintings was required. Therefore, the experiment took place in an exhibition context (i.e. Museum Boijmans van Beuning) which meant that the data-collection tools (SMI-ETG device) had to be flexible and work in an indoor environment. It also meant that I had to reconverted the raw data in many different ways in order to make the data usable for interpretation. Results revealed that there was no strong evidence of differences between the eye-movements of people with differing level of expertise in art, viewing works of art. Hence, results did show there was a difference in appreciation of art among people with differing level of expertise in art, however this also didn’t correlate with differences in eye-movements.","['Paintings', 'Bottom-up Saliency', 'Top-down Saliency', 'Familiarity with Art', 'Art Appreciation']"
"Cultural industry workers who produce Reality TV in Germany:
Motivations, skills and identity work",C. Jansen,2015-06-08,"['J. Michael', 'P.P.L. Berkers']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Cultural industry workers make compromises in terms of their cultural capital, their attitudes towards lowbrow culture, and their creative skills to work for Reality TV formats in German production companies with a commercial orientation. They find means to motivate themselves despite some inconvenient working conditions and also find ways to uphold their artistic integrity by either consciously or unconsciously applying identity work strategies. How they (attempt to) accomplish this in spite of possible gaps between their personal standards and the cultural products they produce is subject of this thesis and point of origin for the call of a new conceptualizations which are not only valid in the case of TV production but also transferable to all sectors of the culture industries. This can best be established with the support of concepts and theories from different academic disciplines because analyzing motivations and strategies of cultural industry workers goes beyond the scope of a single discipline. I argue that it is high time for an interdisciplinary approach which is due to the fact that the decisions persons make before starting and during the course of professional lives depend on multiple factors. For instance an individual’s cultural capital might be the trigger to enter this profession and could explain the willingness to compromise potential discrepancies. Testing to what extent cultural capital understood as possessing knowledge in the field of culture and having creative skills exerts an influence is the point of origin. Yet, the sociological concept by Bourdieu, that has been introduced to studies of cultural industries alone are not sufficient to get the full image of what motivates. I am convinced that motivation theories, generally applied in the field of psychology, can assist in exposing the incentives to work for in TV companies. Cultural capital and motivation theories are suitable enough to explain the motivations to work but on their own do not suffice to explain how to maintain artistic integrity whilst producing for Reality TV which next to their lowbrow status often receives disapprobation from the public. Particular identity work strategies complete the innovative approach, namely distancing and evaluative tweaking as well as drawing symbolic boundaries. In order to check all theories and concepts for their applicability, I conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with the creative staff, editors and authors, of TV production companies. Based on the results derived from their comprehensive replies, I make suggestions for how the findings can effectively be employed in this context and how they can their conceptualizations transferred to other domains of the culture industries with comparable patterns. By having realized the rationale of grounded theory, this research will have contributed to invigorate interdisciplinary approaches among sociology, psychology and media studies. The cooperation will expand any type of field research.","['cultural and social capital', 'cultural industry workers', 'identity work strategies', 'lowbrow', 'motivation theories', 'Reality TV']"
Happily ever after in Cyprus,A. Dimitriou,2015-06-08,"['A. Kersten', 'S.L. Reijnders']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis is a qualitative research on the discourses about romantic love of young Cypriot women who are either heavy or non heavy viewers of romantic comedies. Cyprus is an interesting place to undertake such a research about romantic love because despite the fact that its culture is being progressively westernised, it still has great links with traditional values including ideas about romantic love. The research question being addressed is how the discourses of heavy and non-heavy viewers of romantic comedies can be distinguished and typified. In order to answer the research question 14 qualitative interviews were conducted with young Cypriot women. Following a cultivation theory approach the participants were separated into 7 heavy viewers and 7 non-heavy viewers of romantic comedies. A main assumption of this thesis was that heavy viewers hold more idealistic views on romantic love than the non-heavy viewers of romantic comedies. The analysis of the transcribed interviews which was conducted to answer the research question followed a discourse analysis approach. Several concepts of romantic love are being discussed including the distinction between the prosaic notion of love and the idealistic notion of love. Romantic ideals that are being depicted in romantic comedies and are found in the discourses of heavy and non-heavy viewers are also been discussed. Romantic comedies in this thesis are valued as a global product and are being discussed in terms of global and American media culture.","['Cyprus', 'Heavy viewers', 'cultivation theory', 'romantic love', 'romantic comedies']"
So You Think You Can Appreciate Dance?,M.C. Boelee,2015-06-08,"['A. Kersten', 'C.J. van den Dool']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the past years cultural institutions like the Dutch National Ballet are facing the problem of a decreasing trend in participation, a lack of diversity and the aging of the current loyal audience members. There is a need for a younger audience to visit ballet performances more loyally. Young adults with a university background were interviewed in in-depth interviews to get insights into their motivators for visiting ballet (Swanson, Davis & Zhao, 2008), their taste patterns (Van Eijck & Lievens) and the nature of the appreciation for ballet: which is informed by flow theory (Nakamura & Csikzentmihalyi, 2002), intrinsic motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2000) and the need for cognition (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982), in the light of their assumed accumulated cultural capital (Bourdieu, 1985; 2008), to uncover the underlying motivations of the visiting behavior of young adults with a university background attending ballet performances of the Dutch National Ballet. Young adults with a university background all have accumulated enough cultural capital to appreciate ballet (Bourdieu, 1985; 2008) and to experience flow (Nakamura & Csikzentmihalyi, 2002; Ryan & Deci, 2000), all have an omnivorous cultural taste with preferences across the highbrow and pop schemes (Van Eijck & Lievens) and are motivated by recreational, artistic and educational motivators to visit ballet performances (Swanson, Davis & Zhao, 2008). They differ however in the extent of dominance of their pop and highbrow cultural scheme (Van Eijck & Lievens) and some are motivated by an escapist and social motivator too. And two kind of subgroups emerged within the group of young adults with a university background: (1) currently active dancers and (2) young adults who have a preference for ballet versus young adults who appreciate modern ballet (at least) as much as ballet. Currently active dancers seem to be motivated by an inspirational motivator and they are also very likely to experience a special kind of additional appreciation of ballet through a bodily sensation of inner mimicry due to interaction of their movement vocabulary and mirror neurons (Cross & Tricini, 2011; Calvo-Merino et al., 2008). And the young adults with a university background who have a preference for ballet most probably didn’t have had the childhood exposure to modern ballet pieces, and are less likely to possess an explicit need for cognition. The young adults with a university background who appreciate modern ballet and ballet have had the childhood exposure to modern ballet pieces, enjoy a higher amount of complexity and value abstract ideas and novelty, are more likely to have a dominant highbrow scheme than a dominant pop scheme, and are the ones who are most likely to possess a high need for cognition. This study thus informs the National Ballet and other cultural institutions through what factors these young adults with a university background (subgroups: active dancers and preferring ballet / appreciating modern ballet and ballet) could be stimulated into visiting ballet performances more loyally.","['ballet', 'Dutch National Ballet', 'cultural capital', 'distinction theory', 'motivators', 'motivation', 'visiting behavior', 'cultural taste', 'omnivorousness', 'cultural omnivore', 'attendance frequency', 'flow theory', 'intrinsic motivation', 'and need for cognition']"
Differentiation within highbrow art appreciation,R. van Randwijk,2015-06-08,"['C.J. van den Dool', 'L.E. Braden']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Differentiation within vertical highbrow taste is researched by giving more insight into the regular visitors of theatre and classical music. I set out to look beyond the often-used predictors of taste such as gender, age, level of education and income. This research explains people’s preference in high art by studying the activities, motives, experiences and barriers of theatre and classical music-goers. The aim was to find out to what extent differences between these two groups could explain their taste, this in order to horizontally broaden the knowledge of highbrow art appreciation. How can we differentiate the white, highly educated elderly people with a love for theatre or classical music? In order to answer this question, sixteen in-depth interviews were conducted with regular visitors from a theatre and a concert hall, both located in the city centre of Rotterdam. 
 	It is found that the two audience groups of theatre and classical music cannot be put under the same umbrella. We cannot only make the distinction between audiences of popular and high art, but also between audiences of canonised art forms. Classical music-goers are overall older and show a less omnivorous taste. Regular visitors of classical music show higher levels of appreciation and participation, often transferred by their families. Theatregoers attach great value to the educative aspect of their night out and feel the need to take part in topical debates with their company. Regular visitors of theatre distance themselves from the elitist visitors of classical music and they feel it would take time to learn to appreciate this musical style. In this research I address multiple other conclusions that cause a clear image of both audience groups that helps to understand why and in which ways people participate in highbrow art.","['cultural taste', 'cultural preferences', 'highbrow taste', 'motives', 'art experience', 'cultural barriers', 'theatre visitors', 'classical music visitors', 'audience research and perception']"

economy. The labour market for designers shows a somewhat different picture. Low
earnings, short-term, part-time or self-employed forms of work, multiple job-holdings and a high
level of unemployment dominate the labour market. In this market designers are a vulnerable
group of workers that are trying to balance the competitive environment with their personal
motives regarding work. This thesis investigates the labour market for graduated designers who
are working in the Netherlands. By a quantitative method the relative importance of factors that
influence the profession that these designers carry out is being researched. By a multiple linear
regression the influence of economic, work-related and socio-demographic factors are tested on
the time that designers spent working in one or multiple fields. A combination of these three
factors is found to effect the profession that designers carry out. Next to the economic aspects of
income related to study, the application of creative skills outside the core creative field and job
satisfaction are found to be influential. The results of this empirical study reflect that designers
not only work in different fields out of economic motives, but also in order to apply creative skills
more widely and to create a profession that matches their personal satisfaction.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepeneurship']"

to analyse the economical and managerial situation of the six teatri di tradizione within the
region Emilia Romagna (Italy). In order to provide a clear analysis, the research is divided
into two main sections: the theoretical framework (chapter 2) which is a guideline for the
reader to understand the world of performing arts, an outline to the main problematic
features that theatres face every day (with a focus on the Italian situation) and possible
strategies to overcome the difficulties, including the current financial crisis. Chapter 4
focuses only on the six teatri di tradizione. The examination of the theatres is carried out
through the analysis of 7 semi-structured interviews. These interviews have been conducted
by the researcher to 7 relevant workers of the theatres under analysis. |The interviews have
taken the research into providing several responses to the research question: “Why does the
condition of all the six teatri di tradizione have to be considered not sustainable in the long
term?”. The results demonstrate that even if these theatres are able to reach the break-even
point yearly, their situation cannot be considered sustainable in the long run. The weak
interactions with the societal, market and oikos spheres (Klamer, 2014) are one of the
reasons of this unsustainability. Chapter 4 and 5 (conclusion) give broader clarifications on
these matters, while chapter 6 discusses the limitations and constraints, which occurred

‘What’s in it for me?’,L. Baas,2015-06-08,['M.

With financial pressure rising due to subsidy cuts, philanthropy becomes more important. Volunteering is one form of philanthropy that enables organisations to make use of free labour supply. But to manage this labour supply better, we need to understand what drives volunteers to work for cultural heritage without rewards in monetary form. Previous research shows us different motives to volunteer, based on quantitative research. But no attention have been given to volunteers in the cultural heritage sector in particular. This paper aims to be an introductory research into this topic.	The research was carried-out using a qualitative research strategy with a cross-sectional research design. It was conducted by talking with 12 volunteers varying in age from 5 cultural heritage organisations in Schiedam, the Netherlands by means of semi-structured interviews. The motives of these volunteers were collected and categorised in one of four quadrants. These quadrants were formed by the combination of two categories of motivation. The first categorisation is the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The second is the distinction between the personal and interpersonal nature of the motivation. The results of this research show that volunteers in the cultural heritage sector are mostly motivated by intrinsic motivation, both of personal and interpersonal nature. Extrinsic motivation was hardly a reason for volunteers to provide free labour, personal being less important than interpersonal motivations.","['Cultural heritage', 'volunteers', 'motivations', 'motives', 'qualitative', 'cultural economics', 'philanthropy', 'gift of time', 'intrinsic motivation', 'extrinsic motivation', 'personal motivation', 'interpersonal motivation']"

In spite of the ongoing debate regarding hard and soft location factors, knowledge on the location factors for workplace decision by creative organizations is limited. By conducting a quantitative research, this thesis aims to test the relative importance of hard, cluster and soft location factors for creative organization in Amsterdam. In contrast to the expectations, survey results show that the majority of respondents work at home or office buildings. Data analysis of 176 respondents’ scores showed significant differences in the relevance of hard, soft and cluster factors. Limited significant results were found in the comparison of workplaces. Social capital and urban location factors are the most dominant factors in determining the decision to locate in Amsterdam. The choice for location within the city, the workplace, is determined by a combination of hard and soft location factors. Creative organizations appreciate the urban characteristics of the greater Amsterdam cluster more than they attach importance to proximity of others in the workplace. When it comes to workplace decisions, economic rationale and practical considerations are dominant. As a result, most of the self-employed creative freelancers in Amsterdam stick to their home offices instead of the flexible and creative workspaces Amsterdam offers.","['location decision', 'creative organizations', 'location factors', 'creative clusters', 'Amsterdam', 'hard factors', 'soft factors', 'cluster', 'factors', 'workplace', 'coworking spaces', 'home office.']"
Programming by public theatres: a complex system for new producers,M.E. Rolleman,2015-06-08,"['A. Mignosa', 'A. Klamer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the performing arts industries, gatekeepers play an important role due to the experience goods that are exchanged of which also potential audience struggle to determine the opportunity cost. Vital stakeholders for public theatres are funding bodies, such as local city councils. Due to a financial downturn the available subsidies have decreased, suggesting a shift from artistic quality to a more commercial approach within theatres in order to generate more income. This thesis was written with the aim of exploring the public theatres' programming process, the involvement of funding bodies, room for experimentation with new types of theatre, and the chances of new producers. The following research question forms the guideline of this study: What is the role of governmental funds in the programming of public theatres in the Netherlands, and does this influence the possibility for experimentation and new makers in the theatre programme? The research question has been approached by means of five qualitative, semi-structured interviews with renowned theatres in the Netherlands, which have been selected after sampling public theatres that receive both local city council next to programming funding from the Performing Arts Fund (Fonds Podiumkunsten) in the period 2013-2016. Further on in the research process, two festivals have been included through correspondence. The final sample consisted of: Chassé Theatre Breda, Parkstad Limburg Theaters, Rotterdamse Schouwburg, Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam, Festival Noorderzon and Festival Boulevard. All collected data has been analysed and structured according to: Council involvement, theatre's goal, freedom of programming, programming steps, popularity among public and generating income, quality of productions, and risk taking. It turned out that the expected shift from artistic quality to commercial productions has not been evident in the included theatres, however funding bodies do take a prominent role. Due to the high risk that comes along with programming unknown experience goods, public theatres are cautious and selective during their programming process such as focusing on performances by theatre groups they are familiar with. This emphasised the importance of developing a network in the industry and the challenge new producers face when trying to enter the theatre market. Also the relevance of cooperation and young talent initiatives have been emphasised to encourage development of the theatre industries, leave room for performances offered outside the theatre's networks, next to offering new producers the opportunity to develop themselves within the theatre industries. The purpose of the results is to provide a better understanding of the public theatres' programming process and potential pitfalls caused by risk reduction and stakeholder involvement. The recommendations at very end can be used by theatres to ensure room for experimentation and diversification of their programme. For new producers who are trying to enter the complex theatre market, an overview of potential solutions has been drawn up to provide them with a starting point.","['Performing arts', 'public theatres', 'gatekeepers', 'funding bodies involvement', 'programming considerations', 'entering the theatre market']"
Vinyl Resurgence,B.Remic,2015-06-08,['E. Dekker'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Vinyl resurgence is a term that has come to be used for the phenomenon of the significant, and as of yet uninterrupted, yearly growth trend in sales of vinyl records from 2006 onwards. As such, it is one of the two sole growing segments in the music market today, the other being on-demand streaming. The growth have resulted in the challenges for adequate supply, due to the outdated production facilities; therefore, it is important to understand what the trend is all about, in order to be able to decide whether to invest in the prohibitively costly production facilities. While the explanations with regard to the vinyl’s symbolic qualities abound in the music press, it is nevertheless not clear at all why would a medium that has been practically discarded a quarter of a century ago, suddenly experience such a growth in the current times of prevailing dematerialized digital delivery of music. This paper first shows that standard economic explanations, including the recently proposed identity economic framework, cannot adequately describe what is going on in the market, and then proposes two alternative explanations, one being based on vinyl’s social and symbolic and the other on physical qualities, that we derive from a field study performed on a set of 63 interviews with vinyl users. This enables us to develop the vocabulary and justifications to support our argument that vinyl use is driven by two main factors: on the one side it has strong capacities to signal information about a desired social status; on the other, it is the very materiality of the medium that play the decisive role. The specific physical practice of use enabled by this materiality, enables people to engage more deeply with the world around them, and this is seen as the key motivation for the vinyl consumption in the dematerialized world of digital information. Thus, we argue, materiality affects economic outcomes. The findings developed through the research in this thesis provide a thorough understanding of an economic phenomenon, which can serve as a basis for an informed decision-making process that is needed for the stakeholders in developing the market in the future.","['Vinyl resurgence', 'materiality', 'consumption', 'engagement', 'theory of practice']"

The Cox proportional hazards model is used. Winning primary Olivier Awards and WhatsOnStage Awards are associated with a longer run for a show. Being nominated for a WhatsOnStage Award and then losing is related to a shorter post award run. The results for the percentage of subsidies a theatre receives, and whether a show is a revival or a borderline case are mixed. No firm conclusions can be drawn. Though it seems that receiving subsidy, being a revival or a borderline cases influences the longevity negatively. The review in The Guardian, the opening month and whether a show is a transfer from Off West End are not predictive for longevity. The models testing for the WhatsOnStage Awards were stronger and more convincing. Next to that, a limited amount of variety was found compared to other cultural industries. So, the data showed that the musical market is more dominated by a common-opinion regime than the expert-opinion regime. This raises critical questions about the purpose awards serve within the musical market.","['Musicals', 'West End', 'Olivier Awards', 'WhatsOnStage Awards', 'Success']"
"Ramp, rouw en redactionele keuzes",R. van Bennekom,2015-06-05,"['A.G. Fokkema', 'J.Jansz']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Deze masterthesis onderzoekt welke rol tabloidization en framing spelen bij de berichtgeving over rampvlucht MH17 in de Volkskrant en De Telegraaf. De vliegramp is in alle opzichten bijzonder. De ramp kwam volkomen onverwacht, niemand heeft de ramp overleefd, het vliegtuig werd onvermoed neergeschoten boven een oorlogsgebied en de daders zijn vrijwel niet te achterhalen door de complexe politieke situatie ter plekke. Ook de berichtgeving was bijzonder: de nadruk lag op de slachtoffers en hun nabestaanden. Daarom focust dit onderzoek op human interest. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd aan de hand van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse waarbij zowel tekst als beeld geanalyseerd is. De reden dat niet alleen tekst, maar ook beeld is geanalyseerd, is dat deze elkaar kunnen versterken. De tekstuele analyse bestaat uit twee belangrijke theoretische deelgebieden: tabloidization (Kurtz, 1994) en framing (Semetko en Valkenburg, 2000). 
Er zijn drie frames geanalyseerd: het human interest frame, het conflict frame en het responsibility frame. Opvallend is dat in beide kranten het human interest frame het sterkst terugkomt. Dit kan in relatie gelegd worden met de toenemende mate van personalisering van het nieuws (Ulribe en Gunter, 2000), wat leidt tot tabloidization. Dat het human interest frame overheerst komt ook overeen met de theorie van Vasterman (2008), waarin hij stelt dat één of twee dagen na de ramp (de secundaire nieuwsgolf) de focus van het nieuws verschuift: minder harde feiten en meer aandacht voor het leed en de emoties die de ramp met zich meebrengt. De beelden die gebruikt zijn pasten niet altijd bij de tekst en hadden vooral een symbolische functie. Dit was voornamelijk in de artikelen van de Vokskrant het geval. Tekst werd dus niet altijd versterkt door beeld. Uitzondering daarbij is de artikelen waar foto’s van de slachtoffers ingestuurd werden. 
In deze thesis is dus gekeken naar de rol van tabloidization en framing bij de berichtgeving over rampvlucht MH17 in een kwaliteitskrant en een populaire krant. Dit is gedaan om te kunnen ontdekken of er verschillen tussen deze twee kranten te herkennen zijn. Uiteindelijk is geconcludeerd dat er sprake is van een verschil tussen kwaliteitskranten en populaire kranten, maar dat daarin wel een verschuiving te zien is met betrekking tot het onderwerp MH17. De stelling van Kurtz (1994), dat tabloidization steeds vaker voorkomt in kwaliteitskranten en dat het onderscheid tussen populaire en kwaliteitskranten daardoor vervaagt moet iets genuanceerd worden. In het onderzoek naar de berichtgeving rondom rampvlucht MH17 is gebleken dat zowel in de Volkskrant als De Telegraaf de meeste aandacht wordt besteed aan het onderwerp ‘slachtoffers en nabestaanden’. Deze focus op het persoonlijke is een kenmerk van tabloidization (Kurtz, 1994, Ulribe en Gunter, 2004). Ook past het binnen het concept journalism of attachment (Bell, 1997), omdat er meer of minder aandacht wordt besteed aan bepaalde gebeurtenissen (Ruigrok, 2010). Slachtoffers en nabestaanden worden uitgebreid in het nieuws gebracht, terwijl er minder aandacht is voor het geopolitieke conflict. Toch is niet op alle punten een vervaging tussen populaire en kwaliteitskranten te zien. Zo gaat de Volkskrant vaak dieper op het verhaal in en worden er meer details gegeven, waar de berichtgeving in De Telegraaf enigszins oppervlakkig blijft. Dit was met name het geval bij artikelen die onder het conflict en responsibility frame vielen.","['MH17', 'populaire- en kwaliteitskranten', 'tabloidization', 'framing', 'rampberichtgeving']"

specifieke kennis in verschillende historische periodes mogelijk maakt. Foucault ‘ontdekt’ op
deze manier uiteindelijk de herkomst van de menswetenschappen zoals wij die kennen. Ook
doet Foucault de belangrijke ontdekking dat het menselijke subject als epistemologische
gestalte, die aan de kennisproductie in de Moderne tijd ten grondslag ligt, een historische en
eindige dimensie kent. Sterker, deze is een moderne uitvinding met een beperkte
houdbaarheid. In deze bachelorthesis wordt een weergave gegeven van de rode draad van De

The Ignorant Mind,A.H. Prins,2015-05-26,['Dr. T. de Mey'],Erasmus School of Philosophy,"The thesis deals with the phenomenon we call ‘consciousness’. In it, three ways of looking at consciousness – what it is, where it comes from – are discussed. The first is the way René Descartes saw the phenomenon, and the influence he has had on our thinking about it. Next is Daniel Dennett’s way of explaining consciousness, using his work Consciousness Explained to explain his ‘Multiple Drafts’ model. Third is Alva Noë’s view of consciousness, which focuses mainly on interaction and meaning. 

Descartes teaches us the dualistic way of thinking, which I have adapted in the thesis; with it, I make a connection between Dennett’s brain-focused consciousness and Noë’s interaction-focused consciousness. 
The three views are, in the end, a way that shows how consciousness is not something otherworldly – it is, in short, a coping mechanism for the brain to simplify the world and interpreting it as efficient as possible.","['consciousness', 'Descartes', 'Dennett', 'Noë']"

Het doel van dit programma is het creëren van onderling begrip, het vergroten van wederzijds respect en middelbare scholieren nader tot elkaar te laten komen, om zo pesten te voorkomen en te verhelpen. Het huidige mediagebruik van kinderen zorgt voor nieuwe manieren om te pesten, maar ook voor nieuwe manieren om het probleem aan te pakken. Om pestgedrag tegen te gaan moet de kennis, de houding en het gedrag van kinderen veranderen. De kennis gaat over de het inzien van oorzaken en gevolgen, de houding gaat over het aannemen van een nieuwe rol. De pijler gedrag gaat om de intentie tot, dan wel het daadwerkelijk veranderen van het gedrag, ten opzichte van pesten.
 Over de Streep heeft een duidelijk doel voor ogen voor de deelnemers aan het programma, maar hoe zit het met publiek?  Om daadwerkelijk een groot verschil te maken moet er aandacht worden besteed aan de invloed van het programma op het publiek. In dit onderzoek zijn in een zestal focusgroepen 25 vrouwelijke middelbare scholieren in de leeftijd 12 tot en met 16 jaar geïnterviewd. Er is gemeten of het kijken naar Over de Streep enige invloed heeft op de kennis, de houding en het gedrag. De uiteindelijke resultaten zijn verkregen via open codering. In de resultaten worden naast kennis, houding en gedrag, vier andere centrale thema’s besproken. De invloed van media, Over de Streep en Challenge Day, mediawijsheid en leeftijd. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat Over de Streep vooral van invloed is op de kennis van de participanten.","['kennis', 'houding', 'gedrag', 'pesten', 'focusgroepe', 'cultivatie', 'sociale leertheori', 'verandering']"
Autonomie in het werk: hulpbron of bron van stress?,"Kreeft, J.M.",2015-04-21,"['Koster Prof.dr. F.', 'Dekker Drs. F.']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Work autonomy is mostly associated with positive work outcomes such as job satisfaction, internal motivation and increased work performance. However, recent research shows that autonomy may also be related to negative outcomes such as work stress. This study examines whether work autonomy is positively or negatively correlated with work stress and attempts to explain earlier contradictory findings on this relation by investigating the change orientation of employees. This is done utilizing the Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVQ) of Schwartz as found in the European Social Survey (2010), focusing specifically on the openness to change. Results show that both work autonomy and openness to change are negatively related to work stress. But openness to change does not seem to affect the relationship between autonomy and work stress. The expectation that a change-orientation would strengthen a negative relationship between work autonomy and work stress could not be confirmed.","['Work stress', 'work autonomy', 'change orientation', 'Portrait Value Questionnaire']"

(Markus)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This thesis researches the rationale behind China’s decision in 2013 to co-draft United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094 with the UN right after North Korea performed its third nuclear test, here known as the Third Nuclear Crisis. The cooperation between the US and China was remarkable, because such conjunction between the two countries on resolution-drafting on the North Korean nuclear issue was unprecedented. To answer this question, I analysed China’s position within the global sphere from a constructivist perspective, adding the elements ‘normativity’ and ‘ethics’ by applying constitutive theory. I analysed China’s interests, the effect of the Six Party Talks, and the role of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Lastly, I determined whether China’s foreign policy can be considered as ‘normative’. I established that China’s interests have not altered much since the Second Nuclear Crisis, making ‘interests’ a weak indicator for explaining China’s decision-making. The failure of the Six Party Talks is most probably not the direct reason for China’s decision to co-draft, as the last Talk took place in 2009. However, the failure itself did give the Chinese food for thought on new strategies on how to cope with North Korea. A notable change before and after North Korea’s nuclear test is the change of leadership. A new president alone does not present enough evidence to conclude that Xi Jinping is responsible for China’s cooperation with the US. However, the fact that he has enabled sole decision making via reforms, making it possible for Xi to make decisions on ‘deadlock’ issues such as the North Korean Nuclear Crisis, is indeed of interest. In theory, this means that Xi Jinping could have made the deliberate decision to co-draft Resolution 2094. In addition, China’s foreign policy is not normative pur sang, but rather positioned between ‘imperialist’ and ‘status quo’. I conclude that China’s decision to co-draft United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094 was driven by a combination of China’s need to establish itself as a bigger and responsible player in order to achieve continued economic growth and more importantly, a new ‘reform-hungry’ leader who managed to ‘simplify’ decision making on pressing issues, making himself truly paramount among ‘equals’.","['“China”', '“North Korea”', '“DPRK”', '“International Relations”', '“Constructivism”', '“Constitutive Theory”', '“Nuclear Crisis”', '“Non-Proliferation”', '“Normative”', '“Six Party Talks”']"

Technical fixes to political problems?,"Horst, K.D. ter (Karin)",2015-04-10,"['Dijkstra Prof.dr. A.G. (Geske)', 'Nispen Dr. F.K.M. van (Frans)']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Over the last two decades, international donor agencies have started to design and implement interventions aiming to foster good governance in recipient countries. While results of aid promoting good governance at macro level are overall not very positive, results at micro level remain largely unclear due to a lack of rigorous research. This study aims to address this knowledge gap through a systematic assessment of governance interventions implemented in Rwanda in the area of justice and decentralization with support of Dutch Official Development Assistance (ODA). The central research question guiding this study is: How do interventions fully or partly supported by Dutch ODA and implemented between 2007 and 2013 contribute to good governance in  Rwanda?
In order to answer this question, various steps have been undertaken. First, a comprehensive literature review has been conducted that revealed that results of both rule of law and decentralization interventions are often inconclusive and mixed at best. In addition, four conditions have been identified considered most conducive toward the effective implementation of interventions, including: 1) sufficient organizational capacity of local implementing partners; 2) the presence of political will; 3) a context-sensitive design of the intervention; and 4) a long-term perspective deployed by the donor. These four conditions formed in turn the basis for the formulation of hypotheses. Second, the results of the 13 selected Dutch-supported governance interventions have been systematically assessed based on existing evaluations, project documentation and academic literature. Third, a Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) has been conducted in order to test the theoretically informed hypotheses and identify the conditions, or combination of conditions, accounting for the results achieved. The outcome and condition variables were scored based on: 1) a desk-review of Rwandan policy documents, project documentation, and academic literature; and 2) semi-structured interviews conducted during fieldwork in Kigali in March and July 2014. The study found that whereas results of Dutch-supported interventions appear to be relatively effective at output level, results at outcome level are mixed, and results at impact level remain largely unclear. The condition political will was found to be semi-necessary for results at outcome level, whereas two combinations of conditions were found to be sufficient: 1) the presence of political will combined with organizational capacity; and 2) the presence of context-sensitivity along with the presence of a long-term perspective and organizational capacity. The fsQCA indicated that the first configuration has the largest empirical relevance and has thus the largest explanatory power with respect to the realization of good governance outcomes.","['Rwanda', 'Qualitatice Comparative Analysis']"

Uit het kwalitatieve onderzoek blijkt dat er twee ideaaltypische ondernemers te onderscheiden zijn: een lager opgeleide ondernemer die voornamelijk behoefte heeft aan functionele coaching en een hoger opgeleide ondernemer die voornamelijk behoefte heeft aan psychosociale coaching. Daarnaast blijken de verschillende typen ondernemer een andere definitie van ondernemerssucces te hanteren, waarbij de lager opgeleide ondernemer meer gericht is op het behoud van de onderneming en de hoger opgeleide ondernemer zich meer richt op het uitbouwen en laten groeien van de onderneming.","['Coaching', 'Menselijk kapitaal', 'Sociaal kapitaal', 'Ondernemerssucces']"

In de eerste plaats is het van belang dat de betrokken actoren het nut inzien van adaptiviteit in de besluitvorming. De noodzaak tot hele gedetailleerde en concrete afspraken bemoeilijkt adaptiviteit. Redenen voor detaillering zijn een laag onderling vertrouwen en afspraken over financiële zaken. Verder werkt het koppelen van onderdelen aan elkaar ook slecht voor adaptiviteit, omdat dit alles van elkaar afhankelijk maakt. Daardoor wordt alles minder flexibel. Daarnaast blijkt ook dat er vaak conceptuele onduidelijkheid is over het begrip ‘adaptiviteit’. Men spreekt dus over adaptiviteit, maar heeft het feitelijk over iets anders. Als laatste moet de logica van adaptie ook concurreren met andere logica’s, zoals integraal werken, snel scoren, de wens voor zekerheid en de noodzaak tot verantwoording.

address controversial political events and their contribution in the transmission of
collective memory. The study proposes to research why and in which ways
filmmakers use documentaries to talk about the country’s contested past. Two
documentaries about the Portuguese dictatorship were selected to examine the
influences of the author in the representation of this controversial period. The content
of the documentaries was analysed with a qualitative method, using three distinct
models of analysis, regarding the image (Aumont, 2005; Goliot-Lété & Vanoye,
2012; Jullier, 2013), the narrative (Chatman, 1978; Aumont & Marie, 2004) and the
themes (Opler, 1945; Bernard & Ryan, 2003). Additionally, in-depth semi-structured
interviews with the documentaries’ filmmakers, Inês de Medeiros and Susana de
Sousa Dias, were conducted to obtain their perspective on the choices they made and
the importance of their artistic preferences, political views and biographical
experiences in the construction of documentaries. The results present the filmmakers’
motivations, decisions, opportunities and constraints in the process of filmmaking,
which influenced the way they represent the Portuguese dictatorship in their work and
ultimately have the potential to contribute for the country’s interpretation of their own

Ook wordt – Derrida’s opvattingen over schrift en interpretatie indachtig – beschouwd welke rol Nietzches teksten in Derrida’s betoog spelen. Uiteindelijk zal blijken dat Derrida, ondanks de inhoudelijke overeenstemming tussen Derrida en Nietzsche, Nietzsches geschriften over de vrouw uiteindelijk vooral inzet ter illustratie van zijn deconstructieve manier van lezen: de vrouw blijkt bij Derrida niet meer dan een naam te zijn voor de différance.","['Nietzsche', 'Derrida', 'Vrouw']"
Tackling Waste Issues: Eco Island Krk – A Case Study,"Vučković, Božena",2014-12-12,['Arsel Murat'],International Institute of Social Studies,"There is no single place on this planet which is not faced with the problem of waste. The modern way of life together with rising numbers in population are culprits for the growing amounts of waste generated in cities and locations all over the world. This paper explores the issue of waste in the touristic setting, within a small locality, an island in Croatia, which has decided to tackle the is-sue of waste on its own. The study was motivated by the example of Krk is-land, which seemed to have found a way to manage its waste in an ecological and sustainable way.
In order to preserve the environment, it is of utmost importance for every locality to find a solution to waste problems. However, solving the issue of waste is often faced with numerous obstacles. There are often difficulties with policy design and implementation on local levels. Local governments are often unable to solely resolve waste problems and the divergence that is often present between local governments and the state are making the search for solutions even more difficult. By looking at the case of Krk island and the way it tackled the issue of waste, this paper explores the innovations in local governance, policy design and implementation, and the role of political will in solving issues of the 21st century in the context of sustainable development.","['Sustainable Municipal Solid Waste Management', 'Local Government', 'New Public Management', 'Policy Design and Implementation', 'Sustainable Development', 'Ecotourism', 'Krk island (Croatia)']"
Sites of Sovereignty: Exploring Convergence and Competition in the Global Construction of Food Sovereignty,"Roman-Alcalá, Antonio",2014-12-12,['Borras Saturnino M.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study develops and presents a conceptual framework to help clarify the
dynamics of the ‘multiple sovereignties’ that exist in the construction of food
sovereignty. By deploying the concept of ‘sites of sovereignty’—which operate
at local, national, and supranational levels, and across state, market, and civil
societal sectors—the paper illuminates how competition and convergence between
these sites constrains, constructs, and redefines food sovereignty. Although
the paper leans heavily on social movement literature, and features food
sovereignty movements themselves as key players in this process, it also emphasizes
the important roles of state and market actors. In particular, the role
of the state has become more central as national governments begin to adopt
food sovereignty policies. The paper unpacks the components and conditions
of actually existing sovereignty, the aspirational sovereignty that movements indicate
as necessary to achieve food sovereignty, and the tactical sovereignties that
are pursued in search of these aspirations. In conclusion, the paper argues what
this analysis means for movement strategies, state policy, and future research
on the trajectory and attainability of food sovereignty.","['food sovereignty', 'sovereignty', 'social movements', 'agrarian policy']"

However this phenomenon gains certain particularities and interest when it happens within the current context of climate change policy initiatives and the global land rush. This nexus produces a new set of political processes containing new actors and alliances, legitimizations, and mechanisms of dispossession that set off a different pace for land grabs. This study explores this nexus which has the potential to swiftly reboot spatial, institutional and political land arrangements in poor communities on a large scale, globally.
The gap in the scholarly literature found in the disaster - global land rush – climate change nexus was examined from the perspective of a local community devastated by the 2013 super typhoon Haiyan in central Philippines. Using a political economy lens, the study revealed that along with the dynamics of the structural and institutional environment, the interaction between the pro-reform social and state actors determine the nature, pace, extent and trajectory of the land struggle. The ‘state-society interactive’ approach highlights the political agency of both the state and social actors, particularly how they exercise their autonomy and capacity, and maximize channels within and external to the state to advance their claim. How the interplay of different institutions of climate change mitigation, land grabs and disasters interact with the political processes of current land grabs is the focus of this study.","['land grabs', 'climate change', 'disasters', 'Philippines']"

got involved in offshore agricultural development investment. The second section
asks 'how' their agro-food strategy appear on the ground, under the nexus
of aid, changing food regime, and different agrarian context of partner countries.
The paper argues that ‘aid,’ which was the very factor that created Japan’s
dependency structure, became the tool for Japan to promote investment and to
create new dependencies. During the postwar food regime, intersection of Japanese
development scheme and US food aid created a condition where Japan
had to achieve food security through trade. After the global food crises, the
same ‘aid’ scheme served as a tool to bridge barriers for accumulation by facilitating
and legitimizing ‘profitable’ investment.","['Japan', 'offshore agricultural investment', 'ProSAVANA', 'Brazil', 'Mozambique']"
Determinants of Food Security in Rural Farm Households in Ethiopia,"Astemir, Hiwot Yirgu",2014-12-12,['Wagner Natascha'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Literatures on determinants of food security in rural farm households in Ethiopia are region specific based on cross sectional data. Studies that examine these determinants covering at least two regions remain scarce. Using panel data from ERHS, collected from four different regions, and controlling for woreda (district) heterogeneity the current study analyzes the determinants of food security in rural farm households in Ethiopia. Nutritional status or sufficiency of calories intake is also analyzed as a sub component.
Conditional logit and fixed effect models are used to refer to the significant determinant variable as these models basically capture the panel nature of the data. Thus, based on the results of the conditional logit model, among the priority variables fitted in to it, rainfall shock and household size negatively and significantly determine food security. While farmland size, land quality and credit access positively and significantly determine food security at varying levels of significance. In the fixed effects model these same sets of variables significantly determine nutritional status in the same sign as they determined food security with only differences in magnitude and significance of the coefficient estimates. Additionally, off farm income, fertilizer use and oxen ownership are priority variables that are found to be significant in this model. The results of the ordered probit model also reinforce the findings in the two models with only differences in magnitude and significance.
Examination of food security status indicated that majority of the farm households are food insecure. In fact there is some improvement over time, even if that is not that much significant. Analysis of regional mean values for food secured households suggested that, majority of the households in Tigray region experienced rain fall shock and occupied infertile land than other regions else. Hence, even the food secured farm households in Tigray region seemed only marginally secured.
For a better endurance to the adverse consequences of entitlement failure to the identified determinant factors, sound policy interventions must take in place. Policies on the areas of irrigation, climatic adaption strategies, land improvement, relocation and resettlement and other related interventions are “externalities” to the farm households. However, as farm households are decision makers who want to maximize their wellbeing, interventions should consider the net benefit to them. Besides, policies should start from the more disadvantaged area.","['Food security', 'determinants', 'households', 'per capita calorie intake', 'sufficiency of calorie intake']"

This tax, which accounted for 20 percent of the wage bill, was levied on employers and financed social security programmes. This study is based on administrative records from the Brazilian Ministry of Labour which contained information on formal employment contracts. Exploring the fact that the tax reform only covered firms not under a special tax regime for micro and small firms, a difference-in-differences approach with firm fixed effects was imple-mented to compare covered and uncovered firms controlling for sector, region and other covariates. The estimates suggest that, on average, the policy led to a 15 percent increase in employment, total labour input measured by contracted hours of work rose by 9 percent, and wages increased by 2 percent. These re-sults indicate that in its first year of implementation the policy had positive employment effects and a partial shifting of the tax benefit onto labour.","['Payroll tax', 'labour demand', 'employment', 'wages', 'Brazil', 'social security']"
Effects of the Real Exchange Rate on the Trade Balance in Kenya,"Ogutu, Grephas O.",2014-12-12,['Bergeijk Peter van'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The trade balance is one of the main components of the current account bal-ance and hence the balance of payment. This study established the long run relationship between the real exchange rate and the trade balance in Kenya us-ing annual time series data from 1963 to 2013. Also, the real exchange rate had a positive and significant effect on both the long run period and the short run adjustment mechanisms on trade balance. Therefore, depreciation of the real exchange rate affects trade balance in the long run, even though the deficit continues but depreciation may have played a role to manage the decline. This study adopted the two-country imperfect substitute model of Rose and Yellen (1989) which analyses the relationship of the real exchange rate and the trade balance. The model also incorporates the elasticity, absorption and monetary approaches by simultaneously considering the real exchange rate, domestic and foreign income, money supply and exchange rate regime. The approach as-sumes that there is a linkage between the real exchange rate and the trade bal-ance. Studies in both developed and developing countries show different re-sults on the relationship of the real exchange rate on the trade balance. This study applied Cointegration Vector Autoregressive and Vector Error Correc-tion modelling and established the relationship and the effects of the real ex-change rate and other variables on the trade balance. The exchange rate regime had no effect on the trade balance. Policy makers thus need to ensure the sta-bility and competitiveness of the real exchange rate for favourable trade bal-ance in Kenya.","['Kenya', 'Trade Balance', 'Real exchange rate', 'Cointegration', 'Vector Error Correction Model']"
"Logic of Appropriateness in Football Commercialization:
The Case of UEFA Champions League","Mariotti, Francesco",2014-12-12,['Knio Karim'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Can football be minimized to a lucrative business where stakeholders are suitable representation of the homo economicus following efficiency of cost benefit analysis? Or is there an active role underneath the incredible flows of capital characterizing this sport? This paper aims to investigate on the process of football commercialization in order to find possible examples of non-economic rationality behind what is nowadays identified as a lucrative business rather than a sport. In order to do so the paper firstly traces what the literature identified as the main drivers of football commercialization. Then relying on theoretical arguments offered by Neo Functionalism and New Institutionalism, football commercialization is presented under two contrasting interpretations reflecting different logics behind human and institutional agency: logic of consequentiality and logic of appropriateness. If the former describes football and related stakeholders as naturally inclined to develop under profit maximization rationales, the latter includes the possibility for human and institutional agency to follow logics of legitimacy rather than efficiency. Applying both interpretations to illustrative case of the UEFA Champions League the research will argue that football commercial development is not the outcome of pure economic rationality automatically vesting individuals‟ action but rather the product of a complex interaction among different actors animated by different rationales. Main findings from the research report how the literature on football commercialization seems to ignore the presence of adaptation mechanisms led by football governing bodies to embrace external financial impulses inside the game dynamics in a socially legitimized way.","['Football commercialization', 'Champions League', 'New Institutionalism', 'consequentiality', 'appropriateness', 'institutions']"
"Artisans of the world, unite: the ‘peasant way’ and alliances for an artisan mode of production","Thiemann, Louis",2014-12-12,['Spoor Max'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The aim of this thesis is to search, from a class perspective, for the ‘natural al-lies’ of peasant movements today. What is the conceptual glue that could pit different sectoral movements together, and mutually attentive to their respec-tive causes? I argue that by extrapolating the proposition of a ‘peasant way’ or peasant mode of production, governed and dynamically reproduced by its in-trinsic laws and forces, into general political economy terms, the boundaries of a particular sector – agriculture – can be breached. Thus defining the quest for a peasant existence as the inverse of the proletarian existence – individual con-trol over the means of production, and hence individual decision-making capa-bility over production – we can search for the peasant-like producers of other sectors. From this search emerge fascinating similarities across diverse sectoral struggles. It suggests that the ‘peasant way’ is only one image of an ‘artisan mode of production’ which incarnates in all sectors from housing and educa-tion to the sectors of material and intellectual production.
Far from being represented by Marx’s theory of the ‘petty producer’, and hav-ing shown their ability to secure economies of scale through cooperation, these ’outliers’ of the classical Marxist class system must realize their common class position and interests. Their ‘artisanism’ is characterized by disenchantment with both the reality and the ideal of being proletarian, i.e. with lacking direct control over one’s means of production, and thus lacking the capability to di-rectly make production decisions, a view that resonates with a long history of Marxist currents beyond, besides and sometimes against the proletariat. In that sense, artisan-class alliances are, similar to the cross-sectoral alliance of wage workers that characterized anti-capitalist politics in the 20th century, more than mere tactics or mutual solidarity, and depend on a common economic logic of subsistence. Finally, the paper analyzes implications of this perspective on the ongoing debate over non-capitalist institutions and mechanisms of governance.","['peasant way', 'peasant principle', 'class definition of peasantry', 'non-capitalist modes of production', 'artisan class']"
Challenges of Access to Justice in Tanzania to Obtain Legal Assistance for Street Children Facing Physical Violence by Police,"Sanga, Evelina Hans",2014-12-12,['Handmaker Jeff'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Having access to justice in obtaining legal assistance and representation is a fundamental right of every child without bias and discrimination of any kind. However, premised on several factors that push children into the streets and the prevalence of violence against them, obtaining legal assistance and legal representation seem crucial to access justice when their rights are being violated. Street children who are victims of violence are entitled to legal assistance for the purpose of justice attainment in rights violation (OHCHR 2011:20 ), which indicates that street children deserves equal right in obtaining access to justice. But the lack of access to justice in respect of having adequate legal assistance and representation for street children when encountered with physical violence remains questionable in Tanzania as the observed gap in child protection laws unintentionally limits their access in obtaining legal assistance and representation.","['street children', 'physical violence', 'legal representation', 'access to justice', 'legal assistance', 'Tanzania']"

The Effect of Maternal Education on Under-five Mortality in Ethiopia,"Hassen, Kedir Yesuf",2014-12-12,['Bedi Arjun S.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper aimed at contributing for the understanding of factors determining child health by investigating the effect of maternal education on occurrence of under-five mortality.
The objectives of the study were to determine the effect of formal mater-nal schooling on under-five mortality and identifying channels through which maternal education may affect under-five mortality for the period between 2000 and 2011. The data was obtained from the 2000, 2005, and 2011 EDHS. The total number of observations used in the LPM regressions are 9765, 9532, 10975, and 25829 for the years 2000, 2005, 2011, and the pooled regressions respectively. Set of factors related to socio-economic status, use of health care services, reproductive behaviours of women, mothers’ empowerment, and ma-ternal employment status were included in the regressions made to find the partial effect of maternal schooling on incidence of under-five mortality. On the other hand, these variables were tested for their mediation of the effect of maternal education on under-five mortality.
Mean of incidence of under-five mortality has decreased from 2000 to 2011. It also decreases with increasing levels of maternal education. Similarly, significantly higher mean of years of schooling was obtained for mothers whose children are alive. In addition, children alive are better off in other fami-ly and maternal characteristics including family wealth index, pre-birth interval, type of floor materials, sanitation services, drinking water, visiting health facili-ties, modern contraceptive use, antenatal visit, and delivery in health facilities.
In all 2000, 2005 and 2011, formal maternal education had significant total effect on under-five mortality. In 2000 and 2005, part of its effect was mediat-ed by other factors. In 2000, almost 50% of the total effect of maternal educa-tion was mediated through socio-economic factors. In 2005, both socio-economic factors and attitude towards health care service utilisation were the channels through which maternal education affect under-five mortality. For 2011, no pathway mediated its effect. This could be mainly due to the universal access to health facilities and health knowledge created for the people of Ethi-opia after the introduction of Health Extension Program (HEP) from 2003. But, there is significant direct effect of years of maternal schooling in 2011, which may have happened due to the difference in the impact of HEP with difference in maternal education. Though, the total effect from maternal edu-cation has decreased, more educated mothers are better off in absorbing the benefits of health infrastructure and health knowledge that are universally available.
The results imply that big part of the effect of maternal education can be substituted by investing in other factors that can improve socio-economic sta-tus, use of health services, and health behaviours of women. It is seen by the change in the effect of formal maternal schooling after the introduction HEP. But, investment in girls’ schooling is still one of the important ways to contrib-ute for child health improvement in the long run.","['Channels', 'Determinants', 'Ethiopia', 'Maternal Education', 'Linear Probability Model (LPM)', 'Under-five mortality']"
The Influence of Private-Corporation Operationalized Large Scale Copper Mining on Local Development: A Case of Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) in Chingola District of Zambia.,"Nsama,  Priscilla",2014-12-12,['Arsel  Murat'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Zambia’s main economic activity of Large Scale Copper Mining, which accounts for 75% of foreign exchange, is guided by policies that date back to its days of colonialisation under the British. The attempt to spur local development and livelihood improvement by the state, during the Post-independence period of nationalized mining industry, via subsidized social services and the incorporation of CSR yielded negative results due to state inefficiencies. The attained debts in attempt to sustain a failing mining industry led to Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPS) that encouraged privatization.
This study highlights that the indicated growth in the mining industry since 1991 is not matched by livelihood improvements for the local communities where mining occurs mainly due to the insistence of some private corporations to adopting CSR inclusive business strategies in a context that lacks the proper guidance of CSR policies. Points of focus in this paper include the exploration of how business through private corporation in large scale copper mining has transformed livelihood, the understanding of mechanisms employed by corporations in an attempt to meet the expectations of other stakeholders in mining (especially the local community whose livelihoods are directly affected by mining activities) and the examination of how frequent shifts in the government policies on large scale copper mining have harmonised and allowed inclusiveness of the local community into the value chain.
The findings from this study show that, social economic development obligations in the public- private partnerships strategy are met through formulation of policies to guide private corporations and also through implementation of CSR initiative. Though in most cases implemented on a smaller scale, CSR is a useful tool to spur development, which in turn improve the standard of living for the local community.
For effective livelihood transformation, corporations implement their CSR activities through contextually appropriate mechanisms and structures that call for participation among all stakeholders at company and local level. Fair inclusion of the local community into the value chain is ensured by the corporations close monitoring of developmental projects done under the all-level (national, provincial, district and local), non-politically affiliated institutional structures set up by the state.","['large scale mining', 'corporate social responsibility', 'local community', 'stakeholder management', 'regulations', 'corporations', 'Zambia']"
"Financial Development and Armed Conflict
A Cross-country Analysis","Hasan, Md. Rashel",2014-12-12,['MurshedMansoob'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In this paper we have examined how armed conflict and financial development is associated using a panel of 66 developing countries for the period 1985-2010. Financial development has been measured by two proxy indicators: M2 as a share of GDP and credit allocated to private sector by banks as a share of GDP. Our findings suggest that armed conflict has significant adverse effect on financial development. In addition, quality of governance is found highly significant and conducive to the financial development. In one hand, govern-ance quality appears with greater impact towards credit allocated to private sec-tor as the effect of armed conflict seems insignificant. On the other hand, ef-fect of armed conflict towards M2 as a percentage of GDP gets smaller; however, significant in the presence of governance quality. This paper also ex-plores that the negative effect of armed conflict increases as armed conflict intensifies. However, governance performances seem trading off with low and medium intensity of armed conflict. That implies governance quality does mat-ter but cannot offset entirely the effect of high intensity armed conflict and its effect by retarding M2 as a share of GDP.","['Armed conflict', 'financial development', 'governance quality']"

The case study is PDC Muntay, a mixed community of Mus-lims and Christians, where former MNLF rebels integrated themselves into mainstream society, and established a PDC. The case study is interesting from a gender perspective because of the mix of Muslim and Christian, and the in-clusive approach adopted. Moreover, in order to examine the visibility, identity and engagement of women in the PDC, a mixed of ethnographical and partici-patory research methods proved a useful starting point for collecting data. In-depth discussions took place in both formal and informal settings. The ques-tion of representation of women in peace building will mainly understood from the point of view of the women themselves, using relevant literature and policy documents.

Analyzing the determinants and the effects of income diversification in rural Ethiopia,"Gagabo, Tesfaye Yohannes",2014-12-12,['Bedi Arjun'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study analyses the determinants and effects of income diversification in
rural Ethiopia using data from various rounds of the Ethiopian Rural
Household Survey. The survey incorporated four big regions of the country
which represent the majority of the country’s population. A double censored
Tobit model is applied to analyze the initial determinants of income
diversification in rural areas. To examine changes over time a fixed effect
model is applied. Finally, an indirect approach was used to explore the effect of
income diversification on total income of the household. Based on the results
of the analysis human capital, education, access to credit and other private
assets helped increase the engagement of the household in income diversifying
activities. The existence of access to credit and savings are the other variables
that have an impact on household’s ability to diversify income. The impacts of
household characteristics and farm size are also analyzed. In a nutshell, polices
that aim to enhance income diversification need to consider these different
factors that affect the lives of rural household by affecting their income

Access and Contention in Woodland Properties: Implications for Rural Futures in Northern Spain,"Bourguignon, Robert Nicholas",2014-12-12,['Spoor Max'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper explores depopulation and deagrarianization in Northern Spain. The methodological approaches included multisital ethnographic research in wood-land properties under different types of property regimes, followed by an analysis of the fieldwork using a framework derived from Access theory and Powers of Exclusion. The research focuses on social relations of property and contesting claims on woodland properties, and associated labour and conservation themes. Approaches from agrarian transformation are used to frame competing explanations. Property theory is used to deconstruct discourses on private property. Accumulation by dispossession and internal territorialisation are used to problematize the role of the state. The theories and fieldwork combine to argue the following points: that formalised private property rights are no guarantee against dispossession; that all regimes, private or common, experience rural depopulation due to break-downs of the inheritance mechanism; that state participation in properties through subsidies structurally and relationally drives deagrarianization.","['woodlands', 'property', 'ruraldDepopulation', 'deagrarianization', 'Spain', 'Asturias']"

Towards Realizing the Human Right to Health Care for Rwandan Rural Communities through Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI): The Case of Gisagara District,"Sibomana, Gregoire",2014-12-12,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study is about the contribution of Community-Based Health Insurance Schemes (CBHI) to realizing the human right to health care in Rwanda. Through the example of Gisagara District, the study explores experiences of rural community households with the CBHI scheme in Rwanda. The study uses a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches, drawing on interviews with twenty rural households, and a number of interviews with officials and health workers from the District and Ministry of Health. The key findings of this study were that the rate of enrolment is high, and this has helped many rural Rwandans access health care. However the study also found a challenge of sustainability, since around a quarter of rural households were found not to be enrolled, due to their limited financial means. One finding was that the local communities contribute over 65 per cent of all contributions, and donors and government only 35 per cent. For most rural people, although the CBHI system is compulsory, they support it. This includes those who cannot pay because they lack means; this suggests that CBHI seems to be genuinely viewed by those in rural areas as being of importance for their own access to health care. Another finding was that there was a strong political will on the part of government, aimed at improving the existing system. Some modest recommendations at the end of the study seek to improve levels of access in rural communities like Gisagara and elsewhere in Rwanda.","['right to health care', 'community-based health insurance', 'local community', 'poor', 'Rwanda', 'Gisagara district']"

in Indonesia is deteriorating. Furthermore, there is a relatively big gap in the budget
allocated and budget needed in the infrastructure development. Therefore, the government
decided to use the Public Private Partnership (PPP) as an alternative for infrastructure
financing.
However, there are challenges in the implementation of PPP. It needs certain
requirements to ensure that there is a strong foundation on the ground for PPP to
grow. This becomes the basic reason for the government to initiate the reform strategies,
including regulatory and institutional reform. Moreover, as part of the reform,
the government also established the Indonesian Infrastructure Guarantee Fund
(IIGF) in order to make the infrastructure project more attractive to the investor.
The research paper examines the impact of the reform strategies taken by the
government by looking at the performance of IIGF, whether it can fulfill its mandate

The Dutch Decriminalization of Sex Work Policy and the Marginalization of Nigerian Female Migrant Sex Workers,"Taiwo, Olabisi Oluwatoyin",2014-12-12,['Kurian Rachel'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The Dutch Government rescinded the law on prohibition of brothel in 2000 as the outcome of the decriminalization policy that had begun in 1997. The law aspired to control and co-ordinate the abuse of voluntary sex work, to ensure the non-participation of minors in the sex market as well as to eradicate sex-work by non-European women in the Netherlands. The net effect is that non-European sex workers even in year 2014 are still refused the legitimate right to work in the sex industry making them susceptibility to trafficking for sexual exploitation as traffickers take advantage of the illegal status of sex workers as well as their inability to access social services and benefits.
With a focus on Nigerian migrant female sex workers, this paper examines the effects of the marginalization of Non-E.U nationals from the policy as well as mechanisms that create their vulnerabilities. It underscores the need for the state to create structures of inclusion that would prevent trafficking and respect the professional path chosen by these women by granting them access to offer their services to clients without discrimination, fear and intimidation.","['Nigerian migrants', 'sex workers', 'decriminalization policy', 'exclusion']"

The case of small-scale and artisanal mining in Madre de Dios","Ginocchio, Francesco",2014-12-12,['Knorringa Peter'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper problematizes the role of informal mining in the environmental de-pletion of Madre de Dios through the analysis of the institutional dynamics that shape the miners actions. It answers the question of how the State's be-haviour influences the causal relationship between small-scale and artisanal mining and environmental depletion. By using an analytical framework built from the theoretical debates about the structural approach of informal econo-my and natural resource-led development, three concepts such as institutional change, informalization and conflicts are identified to interpret the dynamics that led to the deforestation and loss of biodiversity in the region. Under these analytical considerations, qualitative research techniques were employed in or-der to find the connectivity among the three concepts within the public sec-tor's actions. Thereby, the findings of the research conclude that there is a his-torical causal relationship between the role of the State and the harmful behaviour of small-scale and artisanal gold miners regarding the environment. In this sense, regulations have sought to ensure the sustainability of a natural resource-led development model under the competitive dynamics of the mar-ket economy.","['Environmental depletion', 'informal economy', 'mining', 'natural resource-led development', 'market economy', 'State']"
Judicialization of health care in Colombia? Insights of the role of courts in the political dynamics of social provisioning,"Rodriguez Orrego, Claudia Fernanda",2014-12-12,['Fischer Andrew'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The judicialization of social demands is a phenomenon that increasingly is be-coming the pathway to access social goods such as health and education. With the incorporation of comprehensive bills of rights into states’ constitutions, judges and courts in both the global North and South have become key actors in the distribution of resources through the protection of human rights. Judicial intervention as a distributive mechanism of social goods and its potential to bring social integration and challenge commoditized forms of social provision-ing is a subject that still being studied today. This paper seeks to explore how the intervention of courts and judges are changing the political dynamics in so-cial policy articulation in light of the political nature of social policy and its power to influence not only access to social goods but also social inequality and citi-zenship. The case of judicial decision T-760 of 2008 issued by the Colombia Constitutional Court to reform Colombia’s health care system (Law No.100 of 1993) is used to reflect on the political importance of social policy choices and potential of judicial settings to address distributional conflicts.","['social policy', 'inequality', 'politicization', 'rights', 'courts']"
Demystification of stock markets: The economic and social benefits? The case of Thailand,"Laowong, Pataraporn",2014-12-12,['Nicholas Howard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper examines two functions of the stock market- a source of investment finance to businesses and a source of supplementary income to individuals concentrating on equity pension funds. The main finding is that the long-standing premise about the role of the stock market as of the orthodox economists seems untrue for Thailand. The evidence presented suggests that the stock market provides at most about 10% of gross fixed capital formation and 15% of long-term capital expenditure of companies. In fact, and reinforcing findings in the literature, companies appear to rely much more on the internal source (retained earnings). The findings do point to the stock market having a greater role in investment financing in the post-financial crisis period, but this is still a limited role.
Second, the literature reviews undermine the efficient and rational market assumed by neoclassical economists. Therefore, involving pension funds with equity comes with conditions on sufficient knowledge and disciplines to get updated about the market so that the right type of funds is selected at the right time.","['stock market', 'investment financing', 'supplementary/alternative income', 'retirement security', 'pension fund', 'retirement mutual fund', 'Thailand']"
Universal primary education under decentralization: An asset or liability to quality education in rural Uganda?,"Kawala, Agnes",2014-12-12,['Cheney Kristen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Since the early 1960s, the structure of Uganda‟s current education system has been in force consisting of seven years of primary education, four years of lower secondary cycle, two years of upper secondary cycle and three to five years of university studies. In January 1997, the National Resistance Movement (NRM) introduced Universal Primary Education (UPE) with a main goal of providing the minimum necessary facilities and resources to enable Ugandan children of school-going age to join, remain in school and successfully complete the primary cycle of education. This led to an increase in the provision of free primary education for four children in every family, and later to all children of school going age. School enrolment increased from 2 million pupils in 1986, over 6.8 million pupils by 2000 (MoES 2001: 6-11), and 8.3 million in 2012 according to Ministry of Education and Sports factsheet (2000-2012), with the majority of children being enrolled in rural Uganda. At the same time, the government decentralized UPE by devolving powers from central government to district councils and to lower local councils with the main aim of involving local communities in implementing UPE, democratization, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness in accordance with quality education. Sector Budgetary constraints between what is planned and provided is a common occurrence in primary education in Uganda today, hence leading to a cutback in the way education services are provided coupled with Insufficient teaching and learning materials that affect quality and equitable education (MoES 2012: 69). The rampant power struggles under decentralization has made many primary schools lag behind with a lot of time spent between the drawing of budgets, their approval and provision of funds, let alone some budgets being reduced at district level based on political interests. The quality of primary education provided therefore illuminates a divide between urban and rural schools. The standard of education is questionable especially in rural primary schools of Uganda under a decentralized UPE system, with a concern of whether it offers useful Education for disadvantaged groups especially in rural areas, let alone its impact towards provision of quality education (MoES 2001: 11). As such, my paper presents how a decentralized UPE system has impacted on quality education in rural Uganda today with the realities versus fallacies of a decentralised UPE system.","['decentralization', 'quality education', 'community participation and power in decision making']"
Teetering on the brink: Locating the voices of children:  Albinism in the discourses of disability and albinism in Kenya,"Nyamu, Irene Katunge",2014-12-12,['Okwany Auma'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Group identities are not sacred glue- nor are they corrosive to it. Instead, they are some of the material affording people a sense of self and purpose in and out of the process of shaping a collective future (Minow, 1997:146)
This qualitative study with an ethnographic orientation examines the discourses of disability in the context of albinism in Kenya by foregrounding children’s voices in a highly politicised debate. By applying the concept of agency, the study considers how lived experiences of children with albinism reveal the desire for autonomy in spite of shared threats that call for solidarity among members of an oppressed group. While the dominant discourse presented at the macro level by adults is that of disability and a tenuous existence, to the contrary, this unification is contested. Children and their families present more nuanced narratives and counter narratives. These show diversity within the albinism community, but which are nevertheless muted because the group affiliations confer social, economic and political state benefits. Ultimately, findings show that group identity and that of the individual serve different but nevertheless important and mutually reinforcing purposes. This calls for redefining children’s contributions in the design of programs aimed at including marginalised groups in society- especially by civil society organisations.","['albinism', 'ableism', 'disability', 'social exclusion', 'identity politics', 'occult economy', 'discourse']"
The difficulties of ending Female Genital Mutilation (FGM): Case of Afar pastoralist communities in Ethiopia,"Andarge, Masresha Yazew",2014-12-12,['Harcourt Wendy'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is a widespread health risk and violation of the rights of women and girls in many African countries including Ethiopia. The RP focuses on the Afar region where the worst form of FGM is being practiced in Ethiopia. The RP examines how FGM is perpetuated in Afar by looking at the role played by the community- parents, Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs), that perform child delivery services and in the process practice FGM, religious and clan leaders. The RP points to the limited scope of the Ethiopian government to put in to practice policies and legislations to prevent FGM due to lack of budget allocation and human resources specific to fighting FGM. The RP points to how NGOs have taken up the struggle to fight FGM but in an incomplete way, largely due to financial constraints to cover the entire region. The RP analysis the current attempt to eradicate FGM showing how the focus is on health issues, rather than on a right based approach to the violation of the rights of women and girls. The RP findings reveal that it is the community- the mothers, fathers and religious leaders as well as the TBAs who play a significant role in the continued practice of FGM. The RP suggests that in order to eradicate FGM it is important to understand how deep the cultural influence is in continuing FGM in the name of sustaining culture and preserving religion despite lack of reference to it in religious scriptures. Dagu, the fast information transmission culture which is unique to the people of Afar, is also suggested to be well recognized in the efforts of fighting FGM.","['Female Genital Mutilation', 'culture', 'women', 'girls', 'Traditional Birth Attendants', 'religious leaders', 'clan leaders', 'government', 'NGOs', 'approaches', 'rights']"
Unveiling a paradox: The persisting discrimination against black LGBT workers amidst progressive policies in South Africa,"Dhatemwa, Michael Mawambi",2014-12-12,['Staveren Irene Van'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research report focuses its attention on findings from a qualitative re-search study conducted in South Africa about the persisting discrimination in the workplace against black LGBT workers. This paper unveils an intriguing paradox that exists in South Africa’s workplaces, where the legal framework and political climate promotes anti-discrimination against LGBT workers while a complex social system sets realities of the lived experiences of black LGBT employees within the South African labour market.
This research explores deep and untouched areas of the lived experiences of Black LGBTs workers by drawing respondents about a variety of issues re-garding inclusion and exclusion in workplace, but also looks through the lens of the national policies and laws aimed at protecting such groups and the actual facts on ground about people’s perceptions, attitudes and behaviours towards LGBTs workers.

Troubling paradox: Child poverty and child wellbeing in India,"Chanda, Pranab Kumar",2014-12-12,['Chachhi Amrita'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study seeks to address a paradox - despite many laws, policies and programmes for ensuring child wellbeing and reducing child poverty, the indicators for children show an alarming situation of deprivation. In order to find the answer, this study has taken a new path by looking into the underlying assumptions of child focused policies, their interpretation by various stakeholders at different levels of policy implementation chain and prioritisation in budgetary allocations. As an answer to the paradox, the study found that at one end Government’s intent in translating the policy assumptions into reality is low and at other end children in India seems to be not recognised as right holding citizens. Moreover, the study also argued that both the ends are interrelated.","['child wellbeing', 'childhood', 'social policy', 'child sensitive social protection', 'translation']"
Human security under construction: Exploring social consequences for labour migrants in an enlarged European Union,"Ahlstrand, Rasmus",2014-12-12,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The geographical enlargement of the European Union (EU) in 2004 and 2007 made it possible for millions of workers to move across the EU in search for work. Considering the regional variation of social and economic stability, the free movement of labour had a big impact on the European labour market, especially the deepening of segmentation and thereby undermining of national labour standards, often leaving migrant workers without protection. This study investigates the dynamics behind intra-EU labour migration by citizens of EU member-states resulting from the inclusion of new member states in 2004 and 2007. The case of Polish migrant labourers into the Netherlands’ construction sector is examined to show how the generations of policy measures that aim to protect the working conditions of labour migrants may not have reached their objectives, but instead generated novel forms of precariousness and insecurity in workers’ everyday lives.
To bring to the fore the specific meanings of insecurity, the paper draws insights from the human security framework, itself being derived from human rights theory endorsed by the EU as a community. By bringing migrant workers’ subjective notions of, and responses to, (in)security and precariousness in relation to policy changes, the paper queries the assumptions behind the policy measures. It argues that current policy debates on intra-EU labour migration may be misdirected due to the tendency of treating labour migration in an abstract form of labour as a commodity, according to which the costs and benefits of particular policies are evaluated, and comparisons with other groups in society are made. The paper argues that a perspective of human security helps to bring to light human features such as feelings, dreams and other attributes related to non-materialistic well-being, and that it can help policy makers to appreciate the deeper meanings of insecurity and precariousness so as to recognise migrants’ subjective responses to their changing situation.
If inclusion is indeed the main goal, policies cannot afford to focus only on the dynamics of labour markets, but must be accompanied with an understanding of identity-making and subjectivities of labour migrants. Methodologically, a review of existing literature reveals a socially and economic stratified labour market, pointing towards certain structural dynamics of particular significance within the construction sector. The seasonal character of construction work, together with flexible employment arrangements and deskilling processes as a result of this, is in combination with life stories from migrant workers as well as discussions with trade unionists, presenting the free movement of labour within the EU as a complicated political issue with substantial social and economic challenges.","['labour migration', 'transnational lives', 'Polish', 'construction', 'human security', 'precariousness', 'life-story methodology']"
"Unseen conflict, unnoticed victims: The critical assessment of government and non-state actors response to the effect of ADF cross-border violence on children and youths in Kasese district of Rwenzori region of Uganda.","Kabatalya, Mabel",2014-12-12,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In the dominant discourse, the locus of war and conflict in Uganda is in the north that involves the Joseph Kony Lord Resistance Army. Despite the fact that the impact of ADF rebellion in the West is equally devastating compare to that of LRA in the North. ADF conflict relatively remains “an unseen conflict” with “unnoticed victims” that has been abandoned. This study explained why?, most importantly the reason why government interven-tion programs to alleviate the suffering of children affected by the conflict have little impact in comparison to that of the non-state actors on the children and youths affected by the conflict in Rwenzori region. We critically analyse various agencies’ and actors’ responses to young people's vulnerability and needs following the ADF rebellion in Western Uganda, Kasese in particular. The various actors considered include international and local NGOs, and Ugandan government bodies. Using resilience and vulnerability and targeting as 'frames' through which the NGOs and government and other actors view young people in conflict, the study end up to show why intervention in Kasese District has been relatively lacking, and has attracted little or insignificant attention. Before this assessment of the intervention policies, however, the procedure used by government and NGOs as a response to the plight of children and youths in conflict was put to test by drawing on the toolkits for facilitating Transitions for Children and Youth in conflict zones by the Post-Conflict Funds Project (PCF). In conclusion, I argued that for any successful intervention, there is a need for a community based approach that prioritized the beneficiary’s voices and participation in the designing of the intervention program.","['ADF', 'LRA', 'Rwenzori region', 'Uganda government', 'Kasese', 'conflict', 'youth', 'children', 'vulnerability', 'resilience', 'FCDE', 'NAYODE', 'NGOs', 'intervention']"
Livelihood impacts of challenges in accessing pension benefits: A case of civil service teacher retirees in Kapiri-Mposhi district Zambia,"Museya Kabamba , Milazi",2014-12-12,['Messkoub Mahmmoud'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The negative outcome of the Zambian Social Security Pension System which, impacts the livelihoods of retirees, has been shaped by shifting state approaches guided by manifestations of a transition from one phase of Globalization (i.e. Colonialism) to another (i.e. Modern trade and aid ). Employing the Sustainable Livelihood approach as tool of analysis, a case of retired civil service teachers in the Zambian Kapiri-Mposhi district was used to illustrate these challenges, their impacts and employed coping strategies in the risky pension system context. Resultant Pension system inefficiencies translated into challenges faced by all study participant retirees in accessing pension benefits. It was discovered that these challenges, especially delayed payments of pension benefits, yielded social exclusionary impacts on the retirees and their families as their livelihoods are disrupted by inability to provide for some basic needs. Risk management strategies employed by the retirees were coping strategies rather than mitigation or reduction hence proving them unsustainable. In concluding, emphasis is made on the incorporation of more contextually relevant micro (e.g. reciprocity centered) and meso level (e.g. civil action) approaches that ought to survive under and influence shifts in macro policy reforms towards being more comprehensive.","['social security', 'pensions', 'globalization', 'retirement', 'coping', 'risk', 'vulnerability', 'social exclusion']"
Productivity in development policy literature: A critical survey,"Fisher, Melissa",2014-12-12,['Fischer Andrew'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This dissertation critically examines the mainstream contention that productivity growth, supposedly achieved by increasing ‘productive’ employment, is the best route to improved living standards for the poor in developing countries. Tracing the intellectual history of the neoclassical conceptualization of productivity, I first situate the debate concerning the merits of productivity growth as a means to poverty reduction within the contentious theoretical debates - the so-called Cambridge Capital Controversies – of the 1950s-70s. In a subsequent section, I critically investigate the instrumentalizaton of the conventional conceptualization and measurement of productivity within the so-called Inclusive Growth paradigm that dominates contemporary international development policy. Reflecting on the implications of this body of work in terms policy recommendations and the distribution of gains resulting from the production process, my argument is: The obsession with boosting ‘productive employment’ among the poor in the global south completely ignores the elephant in the room – namely, unequal power relations between wage labourers and the owners of capital, which virtually ensures that any gains accomplished in the production process are captured by the latter.","['aggregate production function', 'productivity', 'productive employment', 'poverty reduction']"
Local Governance in Absence of Elected Councillors: Case of Village Development Committees (VDCs) of Nepal,"Acharya, Sunita",2014-12-12,['Vloeberghs Ward'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Nepal has been adopting the decentralization principle as a national policy reform es-pecially after re-establishment of democracy in 1990s. The main aim of decentraliza-tion is to distribute the benefits of development equally to all the citizens in the coun-try who are marginalized, excluded and deprived of their social, political and economic rights. Towards this end, the local bodies- District Development Committees, Mu-nicipalities and Village Development Committees- were reformed and empowered with social, administrative and financial authorities so that they can generate the reve-nues and utilize in their development cause to the extent possible on participatory ba-sis. The Local Self Governance Act, 1999 and Local Self Governance Regulations along with the guidelines have delegated the authorities and responsibilities to these local bodies. As Village Development Committees are the immediate government to the local people, it has vital role in promoting participatory governance and commu-nity development as well as bridging the local people to the central. Recognizing the vital role of the Village Development Committees in the delivery of goods and ser-vices, government has been providing grants from mid 1990s to them and the amount of grant has been increased up to 3 million now from 0.3 million in the beginning. Currently, the local bodies are headed by the government employees such as Local Development Officer as District Development Committee head, Executive Officer as Municipality head and Secretary (grassroot level officer in bureaucracy) as Village De-velopment Committee head in absence of elected councillors for over a decade. Fre-quent transfers of the Village Development Committee Secretaries and political vac-uum in the Local Bodies have led to higher levels of dominance of disorganized local politics in the utilization of funds. As a result, the central grant is not being utilized efficiently and effectively. Moreover, the institutional units as provisioned in the Local Self Governance Act, 1999 and Local Self Governance Regulations, 2000 are arranged differently at different locations and most of them are functioning far below the ex-pectations of Local Self Governance Act. Community participation, transparency and accountability as well as the outputs of the development projects are largely not ap-propriately tuned to the policy framework. The analysis of the current capacity (Hu-man, Organizational, and Institutional) of local bodies points to an urgent need for change in the functioning of local bodies in order to meet the spirit of the Local Self Governance Act.","['Decentralization', 'Accountability', 'Capacity Building', 'Participation', 'Community Development']"
"Public Roads Service Delivery and Governance:
The Case of the Benishangul Gumuz Regional State Rural Roads Authority, Ethiopia","Tadesse, Tadele Fekadu",2014-12-12,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper aims at assessing the service delivery and governance system in the road agencies of the Benishangul Gumuz Regional State (BGRS). On one hand, most of the literatures and reports prepared both at national and regional levels claims, the road agencies are not performing as much they were supposed to do due to financial limitations. On the other hand, the country is allocating much budget for road network expansion which made road a number one financed sector in the nation. This contradiction clearly shows, there should be another way to look at the gaps which are hampering the performance of road agencies. That is, Governance problem. Accordingly, this paper examines the capacity and role of different actors and governance system is in place for the public road service delivery in the regional state.
The research reveals that, while the private firms are playing a foremost role from among the non-state actors, the role of the public is still neglected. The ways through which platforms have been designed in different institutional setups and reform programs that invited the public to play its role are still lagging behind. The level of transparency is higher in the road agencies at higher level than those at lower administrative levels. The road agencies in the region are less responsive to the public demand. The main reason for this problem comprises of limitations in human resource capacity and political interferences in prioritization. Absence of appropriate voicing mechanisms and media coverage has highly affected the responsiveness to the public. On the other hand, there is no direct mechanism in which the road agencies become directly accountable to the road users. Similar to these, the major bottlenecks, the lower competency of the existed stuff in the regional road agencies and appropriateness to the position they hold as well as the unbalance of budget allocation for further specific topics in the agency (e.g. Between the maintenance and construction works, between the higher and lower level agencies) made the governance and the service delivery abound. These in turn have effect in obstructing the level of transparency, responsiveness, voicing, and accountability. However, for the better performance of the road agencies, building the capacity of the road agencies should not be the only solution. Rather, policies must adhere empowering the demand siders, the public, so that they can manage to uphold their voice and hold the service providers accountable to make the service a demand driven.","['Infrastructure', 'Public Service Delivery', 'Road', 'Governance', 'Transparency', 'Responsiveness', 'Accountability', 'Voicing', 'Capacity', 'Principal', 'Agent']"
Governing Strangers: How Brazil is managing immigration policy reform in a new era of immigration,"Fernandes, Sara Pereira",2014-12-12,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Despite the fact Brazil is recently advocating for social justice and human rights in supranational organizations and forums, the country faces, among other social problems, the sad reality of having a very archaic and discriminatory immigration policy. The Estatuto do Estrangeiro (Foreigners’ Statute) from 1980 was written during the dictatorship years and considers, inspired by the Cold War, basically the paradigm of “national security”, seeing the foreigner as a potential threat. Brazil now faces though a new reality and challenges with a much higher inflow of immigrants and different economic needs. The current immigration policy seems therefore outdated and not suited to the new era of immigration.
This research paper studies the historical immigration process in Brazil and the recent initiatives from the Brazilian government to reform its immigration policy to indentify the goals and values shaping the immigration policies and to see if there is a change of paradigm underway towards a policy with more emphasis on the immigrants’ human rights.","['Estatuto do Estrangeiro', 'immigrants', 'PL 5655/2009']"
Participation or Capture? The Paradox of Small Holder Farmer Participation in the Development of the National Coffee Policy in Uganda,"Nakabuga, Rashida",2014-12-12,['Gomez G.M.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Enhancing small holder farmer participation in policy development is critical in tackling their real issues. But this is to be seen difficult because of their less capacity to negotiate among other challenges. This paper argues that successful participatory processes in policy development should be mindful of existing farmers’ differences that are seen to shape limitations and thereby blocking participation to occur. The study attempted to position participation as a broader theory and illustrated capacity and empowerment as key elements to enhance participation of small holder farmers. Participation in this case was seen to be biased to the large holder farmers already empowered and with capacity to engage in negotiations thus this put the small holders farmers to a disadvantage to push for their issues inclusion. To enhance smallholder farmers’ participation, it should be based on their social, cultural, economic and political wellbeing. Strategies should strengthen individual farmers’ capacities and empower them using the existing knowledge to address their problems.","['Participation', 'Empowerment', 'Smallholder Farmers']"
"Incremental Dynamics of Resolving India-Bangladesh Border Issues:
Re-thinking the Past to Construct the Future","Mahur, Dinesh",2014-12-12,['Wit Joop de'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper enquires about the reasons for non resolution of the border issues between India and Bangladesh over a period of over six decades, even though the two countries claim to be friendly countries. This paper finds out that it is not possible to draw a single general border theory. Each border has something special to offer. Thus, both local as well as broader context of creation of a particular border is important to understand genesis of border issues between the countries. Thus, this paper considers that the borders are not only the political creation, but the social and cultural factors plays even bigger role.
This paper investigates the reasons for delay in resolving the border issues between India and Bangladesh by using primarily the governance and policy analysis concepts/ tools. For policy analysis, it uses various Discourse Analysis methods also in additions to the concepts of policy cycle. It finds out that the most important part of the policy cycle is policy implementation where strategic management of reaction to the policy is vital for successful implementation of the policy.
This paper finds out the reasons for delay in resolving the border issues between the two countries related to partition of British India and subsequently the partition of Pakistan, demarcation of boundary at the time of its creation, role of political regimes and fundamentalist forces, and also flaws in strategic management of various policy interventions (bilateral agreements) between the two countries.","['Policy Intervention', 'Border Issues', 'Policy Cycle', 'Policy Analysis', 'Governance', 'stakeholders', 'Floating Identities', 'Political Regimes', 'Discourses Analysis', 'Two Nations’ Theory']"
"Assessing Nicaragua’s Primary School Policy:
A Limited Notion to Education?","Gutiérrez, Victor Hugo Canda",2014-12-12,['Heumann Silke'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The objective of this research paper is to analyze the notion of education of the primary school policy as seen in Nicaragua‟s National Human Development Plan (PNDH). For the last half-century, education has obtained a key role in the development organizations such as United Nations, World Bank, etc. Education gained widespread recognition as being crucial to development in 2000, when world leaders agreed on a set of eight development goals knows as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In such set of goals, achieving Universal Primary Education (UPE) for all children by 2015 became goal 2 (MDG2). Nicaragua committed itself in 2000 to achieving the MDGs and the current government has reaffirmed its compromise towards achieving MDG2. This research paper will attempt to reveal how the MDGs set forth a limited notion of education and how the Nicaraguan government has adopted it. I believe that in effect MDG2 is limited because it only provides three quantitative indicators to measure progress, while not providing attention to other issues e.g. inequalities. Imperative to understand that the adoption of a limited notion to education is just one of the many factors that can help explain why the Nicaraguan primary school system is in such dire straits. Hence for example, enrolment rates may be above average but other crucial aspects such as teacher training, infrastructure problems, budget allocations, etc, are being overlooked by the government. This study will draw on secondary sources and on a discourse analysis of Nicaragua‟s National Human Development Plan (PNDH) to present these issues.","['Education', 'Primary School System', 'Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)', 'MDG2', 'National Human Development Plan (PNDH)', 'Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)', 'Nicaragua', 'inequality']"

Malaga, which develops its work in Andalucía, south of Spain. Through the
analysis of two of the main projects developed by the group, this paper explores
how the category of care is constructed both as related to the economic

specific way of living in community, based on the privilege of collectivity and
support. Such construction of support networks comprises also a resubjectification
of bodies as collective territories of resistance. Care is constructed
as a specific form of struggle, tackling directly the effects of capitalism/
hetero-patriarchy over women and men lives. This paper explores how
Feminism and, in general, collective action is being made in a particular place
of the world and is nourishing the practices of contemporary place-based social
movements. Finally, based on Standpoint and Situated Knowledges epistemologies,
this paper is an exploration on how to research on Feminist activism and

"Thriving in the Competition?
How Value Chain Governance Affects the Economic Performance of SMEs in Kasongan Pottery Cluster","Astuti, Dhani Dwi",2014-12-12,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The insertion of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries into global value chains is often associated with significant increases in income and economic growth. However, this view has been continuously challenged due to the growing inequality between lead firms in developed countries and local suppliers in developing countries. The governance within the value chain is argued to have significant influence on the distribution of economic rents among various actors along the chain. This research seeks to analyse the effect of value chain governance on the economic performance of SMEs in Kasongan pottery cluster through learning and upgrading as mechanisms to achieve higher economic rents. The research also observes how the institutional environment embedded in the cluster is operating. Furthermore, throughout the discussion, the study pays attention to the dynamics that occurred among different actors.
The research argues that given the institutional environment has not yet matured enough to promote competitiveness and prevent SMEs from market volatility; value chain governance has considerable influence on the learning and upgrading opportunities. Therefore, it has a say on the economic performance of SMEs. However, the study also finds some exceptions and dynamics that show a mixed picture of the realities. It further highlights some methodological challenges in the application of the theories and suggests modification for further research.","['Value chain', 'value chain governance', 'learning', 'upgrading', 'economic performance', 'small and medium enterprises (SMEs)', 'cluster']"
What works in girls empowerment and why? Examining PLAN-Aflatoun’s Project for empowering girls through finance and life skills education,"Ruzibiza, Yvette",2014-12-12,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study is about what works in relation to girls’ empowerment through education. Taking the example of a project designed by PLAN and Aflatoun and designed for Rwanda with two local NGOs, RWAMREC and YWCA, the study considers how the project was designed to take into consideration the needs of girls in relation to their empowerment. In particular, from a feminist perspective on policy design, this study is based on close engagement with Aflatoun staff and reports in particular. The study analyses such reports, as well as the data on which they relied on for planning, and the process of design of the curriculum and the project. In particular the study identifies those informed through the course of the project design process, and considers how they are informed about the priorities when it comes to girls’ empowerment through education. One of the distinctive features of this study was that the researcher was motivated to comment on the policy design process by one of the key institutions involved (Aflatoun). This led to some interaction and learning on both sides. A key finding of the study is that throughout the processes of curriculum development and project design, local partners are involved, but the voices of the girls themselves are mainly notable by their absence. At best, teachers act as informants about their priorities and their needs. One of the problems is that the pilot study on which the project draws lessons was conducted in other countries except in Rwanda. This meant that a full contextualization is still a challenge to the pro-gram. PLAN-Aflatoun recognized this and allowed for in their ‘Contextualization Manual’, but the study concludes that it is important to work on contextualizing the policies when implementing projects and/or programs.","['empowerment', 'girls', 'education', 'project design', 'PLAN', 'Aflatoun', 'Rwanda', 'feminist', 'contextualisation']"

Land Governance in the Peri-Urban Region of Chennai","Purushothaman, Pratheep",2014-12-12,['Wit Joop de'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Land has been the source of livelihood particularly among peasants across the since ages. With the limited supply and ever increasing demand due to reasons like food production, industrialization and urbanization, land is considered to be an important asset. Of late, there are many instances in which land is being converted from agricultural use to non-agricultural uses. This paper two main processes of land-use conversion. One by means of forceful acquisition by powerful actors including the State and other the land owners willingly parting away with the land. This paper focussed on land-use conversion in the peri-urban region of Chennai, where it happens with consent of farmers. The land-use conversion happens in spite of national and state policies to prevent the conversion of agricultural land. This paper investigated the formal dynamics and informal mechanisms and the roles of various stakeholders in land-use conversion by studying policies, media reports and various published sources. Further, discussions with various stakeholders in a selected village in peri-urban Chennai established that informal mechanisms overpower the implementation of policies that prohibit land-use conversion. This paper sought to make some modest recommendations and suggests making farming a viable option might help in reducing land-use conversion. The means to achieve this needs a detailed research in itself.","['Land Governance', 'Land-use', 'Peri-urban', 'Formal Dynamics', 'Informal Mechanisms', 'Policy Implementation']"

Unemployment experience of youth in Addis Ababa,"Dale, Beshir Butta",2014-12-12,['Siegmann Karin Asrid'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Ethiopia witnessed progressive achievement in education through the adoption of education for all initiatives. However, in the country youth in general urban youth in particular have experienced the highest rate of unemployment. Due to rise in education attainment among youth and the limited economic opportunities for skilled labor, unemployment is widespread among educated young people. This research paper focus on examining how young people experience unemployment challenge- what it means being unemployed and what mechanisms they adapt to sustain their livelihood and achieve their aspirations. In doing so the study highlights unemployed young people‟s perceptions of the employability and causes of unemployment. Concepts and theories of youth, human capital development, unemployment, relative deprivation theory and youth and transition model were used in analyzing youth unemployment experiences.
The study was primarily based on qualitative data from interview and ethnographic observation. Secondary data drawn from secondary sources were also used to analyze the background of urban unemployment in Ethiopia. The study revealed that the way in which young people navigate school to work varied depending on different personal and socioeconomic factors. Youth experience unemployment differently based on their age, gender, marital status, and family background and education levels. Due to limited opportunities, relatively better educated youth has faced challenges of finding work in the formal sector and left with the option either employment in the informal sector or remain dependent on their family. Unemployed youth was not only experienced material deprivation but also affected by social exclusion, and emotional and psychological distresses.","['young people', 'unemployment', 'labor market', 'educated youth', 'university graduates', 'TVET', 'unemployed youth']"
