Strategic Communication in High-Technology Industry - How storytelling with a strategic communication approach can be applied in a high-technology environment?,Ilektra Chatzopoulou,2018-08-20,['Noemi Mena Montes'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study reports the results of a qualitative survey of 11 high-technology firms on the practices of corporate communication, especially the links between strategic communication, storytelling and branding, all of them applied in the turbulent environment of high-technology industry The overarching research question addressed in this paper is “Strategic communication is high-technology industry: How storytelling with a strategic communication approach can be applied in a high-technology environment? ”.
High-technology firms operate in competitive environments of constant changes (Brown, 1998; Kelly, 1985). They are characterised by eminently skilled employees but also high turn-over rates (Sprague, 2012). Not to mention that the level of complexity of their products and services is usually high, and challenges their possibilities for commercial success (Kelly, 1985; Mohr, Sengupta & Slater. 2010; Rogers & Larson, 1984;). On the other hand, the last decade strategic communication has become the watchword in every organization (Langer & Thorup, 2006). In line with this every organization is awash in stories (Tyler, 2007). The strategic application of storytelling aims to decrease corporate risks and complexities both inside and outside the organization (Argenti, Howell & Beck, 2005; Langer & Thorup, 2006). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the applicability of storytelling in high-technology environments, through a strategic communication perspective.
By conducting 11 in-dept interviews with communication practitioners from high-technology organizations this paper accentuates the strategic communication imperative within high-technology environments. Storytelling also receives a high status in high-technology organizations for multiple reasons. The most important reasons are linked to familiarization and humanization of technology. The hot button issue of gender diversity in high-technology industry is also addressed.

de meest recente tak van de emotieleer, het cognitivisme, verwijst voor haar 'gelijk' naar

De religieuze existentie en de beweging van de herhaling bij Kierkegaard,D.M.A. Prins,2018-08-01,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"This thesis examines the importance and urgency of Kierkegaard’s work for our present time, based on an oft-forgotten and overlooked religious concept in his authorship: Repetition. Although Kierkegaard’s remarks on repetition are relatively scarce considering his body of work in its entirety, I argue that repetition is the single most crucial category of what Kierkegaard calls ‘religious existence’. Kierkegaard decisively links repetition to individual freedom and the individual’s reconciliation with eternity. This thesis demonstrates that what Kierkegaard means by this, is that God not only confronts the individual with the love that he harbors for mankind in the possibility of a new self through the forgiveness of sins, but also with the individual will towards the absolute task of repeating the love and forgiveness he reveals, in relation to all mankind. Based on this confrontation with the will towards the absolute task of loving one’s neighbor, this thesis aims to illustrate what religious existence truly means for Kierkegaard, and what this in turn could and should mean for our relation to Christianity in our present time, and for our relation to Christianity in the future.",

"The Crusader Coalition - 
Crusading Rhetoric in the Islamic State's Magazines Dabiq and Rumiyah",R. de Jager,2018-07-31,['D. Douwes'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Since the turn of the century, jihadist terrorist organizations have increasingly made use of social media outlets and the Internet to disseminate their propaganda. A recent case in point is the Islamic State, which uses the Internet to share its online magazines Dabiq and Rumiyah with its audience. These magazines provide an in-depth look into how the Islamic State interprets the world and how it frames this worldview for its audience. In constructing its worldview, the Islamic State uses historical analogies and other forms of rhetoric that link the current struggle to the era of the Crusades. This research has explored how the Islamic State uses such crusading rhetoric in framing its worldview in Dabiq and Rumiyah. The methodology used in this research rests on the three framing techniques of diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational framing, which were applied on several articles from Dabiq and Rumiyah in which the use of crusading rhetoric was prevalent. From these case-studies became evident that the use of crusading rhetoric is central in the construction of the diagnostic frame, which rests on a rigid dichotomy between 'camp of Islam'  and the 'Crusader Coalition.' The prognostic frame and the motivational frame included much less crusading rhetoric. The main reason for this is the shift from interpretation to divine obligation and faith: in the prognostic and motivational frame Allah's promises for victory and the divine obligation of waging jihad were central. Crusading rhetoric was only used to make sense of the world in a way that would accommodate violent interpretations of Islam. This construction of a worldview rested on subjective interpretation rather than the divine prescriptions used in the prognostic and motivational frames.","['ISIS', 'Islamic State', 'framing', 'discourse', 'Salafism', 'jihadism', 'Dabiq', 'Rumiyah', 'crusade', 'crusading rhetoric', 'tawhid.']"

Adriaansen'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In dit onderzoek worden de tijdschriften van de theosofische vereniging de Orde van de Ster in het Oosten tussen 1914 en 1929 onderzocht, alsmede literatuur die het bestaan van de Orde en de tijdschriften verklaren. Naar aanleiding van dit onderzoek ben ik tot de conclusie gekomen dat een theosofische organisatie, die diende ter facilitering van de toekomstverwachtingen van de leden, een christelijke vorm kreeg en sterk leek op een christelijke adventistische beweging. De Orde van de Ster in het Oosten kreeg veel aanhang door de invloed van de aangewezen Wereldleraar Jiddu Krishnamurti’s, maar waarschijnlijk ook door de invloeden van de oprichters van de Orde, Annie Besant en George Arundale, die de Orde bewust een ‘christelijke’ Orde maakten. Het op die wijze vormen van een nieuwe religie wekte bij Krishnamurti veel weerstand op, waardoor hij in 1929 de Orde ophief. 		De paradox in het streven naar verlichting is goed zichtbaar in de Orde van de Ster in het Oosten. De leden streefden naar een tijdperk van verlichting, maar Krishnamurti wees de leden erop de verlichting niet in de toekomst te zoeken maar in het huidige moment. Deze paradox zou echter alleen in het ‘streven’ kunnen zitten. Logischerwijs kan er in de toekomst een nieuw tijdperk aanbreken, voor zover wij die definiëren, als de mensheid het massaal voor elkaar krijgt spiritueel te ontwaken.

"Seven Seconds
Remediation of the 1944 Westerbork film and West European memory
of the Holocaust",R. Aitken,2018-07-25,['C. Ribbens'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","What images do you think of when thinking about the Holocaust? Anne Frank? Images of  hollow-eyed men in striped uniforms? Trains full of people slowly leaving stations? Or maybe you even think of a girl with a white headscarf standing between the doors of a cattle car, staring at the camera. 

This last image was filmed in transit camp Westerbork in the Netherlands and it is part of what we now know as the Westerbork film. It was commissioned in 1944 by German camp commander Albert Gemmeker and shot by Jewish Westerbork prisoner Rudolf Breslauer. The film shows, among others, images of life in the Westerbork camp and the transportation of Jews, Roma and Sinti from this camp to Auschwitz and Theresienstadt. The film was never finalised, because Breslauer was deported to Theresienstadt and later to Auschwitz before it was completed. 
	 The Westerbork film images are unique and vitally important as a primary historic source as they are the only moving images of a concentration camp in operation filmed during the Second World War. In 2017 the value of this film was recognised globally by UNESCO when the film and its script were included into the UNESCO Memory of the World programme as global documentary heritage, taking its rightful place next to, for example, the already world famous diary of Anne Frank. 	
The images of the film have been re-used in many different ways over the past decades, from shots such as the girl with the white scarf and the arriving and departing transports, to the starkly contrasting images of a cabaret show and soccer match.
There is only a very limited amount of footage of the Holocaust, especially moving images. This scarce material is therefore of grave importance for how our memory of the Holocaust is shaped , as it is these images - and only these images - which have constantly been remediated. This thesis examines the following research question: How and to what extent have the images of the Westerbork film contributed to the collective memory of the Holocaust in Western Europe? It uses a case-study approach analysing four documentaries from different eras and countries which use images from the Westerbork film. The documentaries are Nuit et Brouillard (1955, French), Gezicht van het Verleden (1994, Dutch), Anne Frank Remembered (1995, British) and Respite (2007, German).","['Holocaust', 'Memory', 'Collective memory', 'Remediation', 'transit camp Westerbork', 'Westerbork film', 'Nuit et Brouillard', 'Gezicht van het Verleden', 'Anne Frank Remembered', 'Respite']"

"Occult socialism? - 
Dutch theosophists’ perspectives on social reform and social engagement between 1897 and 1930",J.L. De Jong,2018-07-20,['A. Baggerman'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis focusses on the ideas of members of the Theosophical Society in the Netherlands about their role as theosophists in society, and the ways in which theosophical dogmas such as karma, reincarnation, and spiritual evolution related, according to Dutch theosophists, to social responsibility and social engagement. Central in this thesis is the following question: ‘to what extent did Dutch theosophists, between 1897 and 1930, view social engagement as an earthly means to actualize their occult beliefs?’
	A commonly shared idea amongst Dutch theosophists was that their contemporary modern society was increasingly dominated by materialistic culture, which they associated with nihilism and hedonism. This ascendant materialism and lack of spirituality in the West was believed to be the primary cause for the many problems of modern Western society, and the only remedy for it was a spiritual revival. Dutch theosophists believed that they had a responsibility to be the agents that would facilitate this spiritual revival by means of the study of all religions to uncover the hidden wisdom they believed formed the fundament of all religion. They believed it was up to theosophists to actively promote spiritual knowledge in modern societies and actively engage in spiritual practice, which would, over time, change human nature and, through a process of spiritual evolution, lead to a better world. 
	Influenced by new leadership and the emergence of a new generation of Dutch theosophists, debates steadily shifted between 1908 and 1914 towards the ways in which theosophical knowledge of spirituality could aid active social engagement and in solving social issues such as the miserable conditions of the working class. It was believed that developing an understanding of the cosmic laws of karma and reincarnation could aid all (theosophical and non-theosophical) social reformers, by, for example, proving that inequality was an inherent aspect of the universe, rather than the consequence of capitalism. During this shift towards practical implementations of theosophy, Dutch theosophists attempted to formulate spiritually inspired alternatives to Marxist theories used by materialistically orientated socialist reformers. Throughout the debates of Dutch theosophists regarding their role in society, however, a dilemmatic ambiguity surfaced time and again that proved to be a problematic, yet fundamental element of the theosophical discourse: the tension between individual responsibility and external aid in relation to achieving spiritual revival and enlightenment. The fundamental tension in the theosophical discourse about the relation between theosophy and social engagement was whether spiritual enlightenment and the related spiritual revival of society was achievable by individuals, or only reachable through the aid of external, supernatural agents. The failure to solve this theoretical puzzle can be said to have strongly contributed to the eventual downfall of the Theosophical Society at the close of the 1920s.","['theosophy', 'social engagement', 'social responsibility', 'karma and reincarnation', 'occultism', 'Theosophical Society in the Netherlands', 'spiritual revival', 'materialism', 'humanitarian reform movements.']"

It will be argued that the growth of inequality is being shaped by a self-reinforcing dynamic between political institutions and economic developments. Based on the principle of justice as fairness, institutions should regulate inequalities so that they are beneficial to all members of society, and most importantly the least well-off. Instead, inequality of income has resulted in political inequalities. The growth of income inequality jeopardizes the political and economic institutions tasked with protecting justice in society.",

Op weg naar de bergen! De natuurbeleving van zes Nederlandse reizigers in Zwitserland tussen 1850 en 1871,M.J. Goudemond,2018-07-18,['A. Baggerman'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De romantiek in Nederland en negentiende-eeuwse Nederlandse reisverslagen zijn twee onderwerpen die in Nederland weinig zijn onderzocht. Daarom worden beide onderwerpen in deze scriptie samengevoegd tot onderzoeksonderwerp. In dit onderzoek worden zes Nederlandse reisverslagen over Zwitserland uit de periode 1850-1871 onderzocht op de sporen van de romantiek. De vraagstelling daarbij luidt: in hoeverre kunnen deze zes Nederlandse reizigers in de periode 1850-1871 als romantische reizigers worden omschreven? Aangezien de romantiek een te breed onderwerp was voor een scriptie, is gekozen om alleen de hernieuwde natuurzucht onder de romantiek te onderzoeken. Romantici zochten naar verheven indrukken in de natuur om hierdoor overweldigd te worden. Tijdens het secundair onderzoek bleek ook dat in de tweede helft van de negentiende eeuw de overtuiging groeide dat berglucht een geneeskrachtige werking had en dat de wil om de natuur te beschermen voortkwam uit geloofsovertuigingen uit Bijbelse tijden. Aangezien beide onderwerpen verbonden zijn met de natuur, zijn de theorieën hierover getoetst in deze scriptie. Als analysemethode werd gekozen voor de discoursanalyse en ‘text in context’ methode. Hierdoor werd het mogelijk om de uitspraken of beweringen van de schrijvers van de reisverslagen te plaatsen in hun tijd en te concluderen of deze romantisch waren. Het theoretische kader werd gevormd door de ‘tourist gaze’ theorie van de Engelse socioloog John Urry. Volgens deze theorie gaan mensen op reis met een beeld over en verwachtingen van hun reisbestemming. Hun opmerkingen over hun reis zeggen daarom iets over de samenleving van de reiziger en niet de bezochte. Er is onderzocht of de reizigers het verleden met het heden verbonden, zij genoten van de natuur en hun gevoelens daarbij uitten, zij reflecteerden op hun eigen plaats (functie) in de wereld, wat zij van de (dominantie) van de natuurwetenschappen vonden, welke plaats het geloof had in hun reis, of zij opmerkingen maakten over een geneeskrachtige werking van de natuur in het algemeen en de berglucht in het bijzonder, en wat zij vonden van andere reizigers (toeristen) en de groeiende infrastructuur die nodig was om toeristen in hun behoeften te voorzien en de impact daarvan op de natuur. Door de resultaten van de discoursanalyse af te zetten tegen vastgestelde romantische kenmerken in de secundaire literatuur kon per vraag worden beantwoord in hoeverre de reiziger voldeed aan het betreffende kenmerk. Vervolgens werden alle antwoorden op de deelvragen bij elkaar genomen, waaruit kon worden geconcludeerd dat vier van de zes reizigers bijna alle romantische kenmerken bezaten en dus romantisch waren. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dus dat de romantiek in ieder geval doordrong tot sommige delen van de Nederlandse samenleving.","['romantiek', 'negentiende-eeuwse Nederlandse reisverslagen', 'Zwitserland', '1850-1871', '‘tourist gaze’', 'natuurzucht', 'gevoel', 'overweldiging', 'genezende natuurlijke omgeving', 'de natuur en het geloof']"

TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND HOW TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST WHILE KEEPING IT RATIONAL,F.Ö. Ulusoy,2018-07-15,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"How can individuals compare alternative futures to make rational life-changing decisions when they cannot foresee how the aftermath of their decision might change their tastes and preferences? In Transformative Experience, Laurie Paul (2014) argues that some experiences in life cause epistemic and personal transformation to the extent that their outcomes fundamentally affect individuals’ tastes and deliberations, and even change their selves. Paul identifies two problems that transformative experiences pose for decision-makers. When making choices about such experiences, individuals cannot first-personally imagine what the experience is like to make informed evaluations regarding their taste for it and have an ‘information problem’. Secondly, they cannot make judgments about their post-experience self at the time of the decision to choose between their current and future selves, which have different preference sets so they have a ‘preference-change problem’. Due to these two problems, individuals cannot follow decision-theoretic rules of evaluation to build a rational and complete preference-order for alternative futures. Nevertheless, Paul suggests that to make transformative decisions in accordance with the normative standard of rationality, people can decide whether they prefer the revelation of the new experiences and new selves entailed. 
This thesis aims to address the role of revelation—i.e. ‘the preference for discovery of new experiences’ in solving the problems that are caused by transformative experiences in a way that the decision-makers can still apply the normative standard of rationality. Accordingly, I first discuss Paul’s suggestions and then engage with the critics of Paul who propose their own solutions to make informed transformative choices and to compare alternative futures. I argue that the revelation strategy, by and large, fails to solve the problems of transformative experiences in accordance with the normative standard of rationality. In terms of the information problem, the revelation strategy does not incorporate enough experience-specific factors that individuals may need to make their decisions. Regarding the preference-change problem, having a taste for the discovery of new experiences alone is not sufficient to develop higher-order preferences to change one’s current preferences and to discriminate between various transformative experiences. The critical engagement with the debates on Transformative Experience also fails to yield satisfying suggestions to improve the revelation strategy in a way that it can fulfil Paul’s project.

"FAÇADE VAN NATIONALISME - 
Nationale identiteit op de nijverheidstentoonstelling in Dordrecht, 1897",M. Denekamp,2018-07-10,['M. Grever'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het meest in het oog springende onderdeel van de Nationale Tentoonstelling van Nijverheid en Kunst te Dordrecht 1897, was het marktplein ‘Oud-Dordt. Dit was een van karton gebouwd marktplein waar oude Dordtse gebouwen te zien waren. De originele gebouwen waren al voor 1897 gesloopt of helemaal veranderd qua aanzicht. Het is opmerkelijk dat een regionaal georiënteerde attractie het hoogtepunt was van een nationale nijverheidstentoonstelling.  In de tentoonstelling was dan ook een ‘strijd’ gaande tussen het nationale en regionale narratief. In dit onderzoek is gekeken welke ideeën er over nationale identiteit werden geproduceerd in de Nationale Tentoonstelling van Nijverheid en Kunst te Dordrecht 1897. Hierbij heb ik verschillende facetten van de tentoonstelling geanalyseerd: het publiek en de bruikleengevers, de tentoonstelling, Oud-Dordt, de geschreven publicaties over de tentoonstelling en de tentoonstellingsposters.
 	De Dordrechtsche nationale nijverheidstentoonstelling is het resultaat van een grotere ontwikkeling op het gebied van historisch cultuur in de negentiende eeuw. Dit was een eeuw waarin nieuwe historische infrastructuren ontstonden die gebruikt werden voor de verspreiding van historische kennis in de samenleving. Hierdoor kreeg de geschiedenis onder andere een prominentere rol in de openbare ruimte. Via de nieuwe infrastructuur werden ook nieuwe ideeën over de nationale identiteit verspreid. In de nationale nijverheidstentoonstellingen kwamen de historische kennis en nationale identiteit samen.  Deze tentoonstellingen hadden van oorsprong een sterk nationalistisch karakter. Gedurende de negentiende eeuw werd de oude kunstnijverheid een steeds belangrijker onderdeel van deze tentoonstelling. Tegelijkertijd was er in Nederland sprake van een groeiende interesse in volkscultuur, regionale identiteit. Tegen het einde van de negentiende eeuw werden de volksculturen gemusealiseerd en tentoongesteld op onder andere nijverheidstentoonstellingen. De nationale nijverheidstentoonstellingen waren onderdeel van de herinneringscultuur van de negentiende-eeuwse Nederlandse samenleving. 
 	Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de regionale elementen in de tentoonstelling voornamelijk werden gebruikt om een nieuw nationaal narratief te creëren. De aanwezigheid van ‘Oud-Dordt’ is op twee manier te verklaren. Enerzijds waren de historische straten eind negentiende eeuw een standaard ‘attractie’ bij zowel de nijverheidstentoonstellingen als de wereldtentoonstellingen. Daarnaast werd ‘Oud-Dordt’ gebruikt om een lokaal probleem aan de kaak te stellen, de afbraak van oude typische Dordtse gebouwen, en daar een nationaal probleem van te maken. Dit deden ze door de oude Dordtse gebouwen te promoten als typische zeventiende-eeuwse gebouwen. Dit was voor de negentiende-eeuwers een belangrijke periode uit hun geschiedenis.  Op deze manier werd in de nationale nijverheidstentoonstelling te Dordrecht van het Dordtse regionale erfgoed nationaal erfgoed gemaakt. Het oude Dordrecht werd een verbeelding van het oude Nederland en onderdeel van de Nederlandse identiteit.","['Nationalisme', 'nationale nijverheidstentoonstelling', 'nationale identiteit', 'regionale identiteit', 'historische cultuur', 'moderniteit', 'negentiende eeuw', 'historische straat', 'Nationale Tentoonstelling van Nijverheid en Kunst te Dordrecht 1897']"
"#AnneFaber

Een onderzoek naar de wisselwerking tussen traditionele en sociale media rond de vermissing van Anne Faber",D. Metselaar,2018-07-08,['N. Ruigrok'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De vermissing van Anne Faber, een 25-jarige studente die uiteindelijk bleek te zijn verkracht en vermoord door een zedendelinquent die eerder geen tbs kreeg opgelegd, domineerde begin oktober 2017 zowel de Nederlandse traditionele als sociale media en maakte veel los in Nederland. Na veel emotie sloeg de toon om in woede: had het rechtssysteem de dood van Anne Faber kunnen voorkomen? De media-aandacht voor beide perspectieven, die zorgden voor maatschappelijke onrust en druk op de overheid, verspreidde zich gelijktijdig over zowel traditionele als sociale media. Sociale media zijn niet meer weg te denken uit het medialandschap en daarom is aan de hand van de media-aandacht rond de vermissing van Anne Faber tot een vernieuwing gekomen van de criteria van een mediahype zoals eerder opgesteld door Vasterman (2005). Een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse van berichtgeving in Nederlandse online en offline media laat zien dat er op hetzelfde moment een mediabrede mediahype ontstond, waarbij er sprake was van een constante wisselwerking tussen alle mediagroepen. In het huidige medialandschap kan daarom niet meer worden gesproken over verschillende mediahypes die aanleiding zijn voor extreme aandacht in een andere mediagroep, maar ontstaat één mediahype die betrekking heeft op het gehele medialandschap waarbij alle mediagroepen hun eigen karakteristieken behouden. Media hebben de dood van Anne Faber gezamenlijk tot een signal crime geconstrueerd, waarbij door emoties op te wekken een roep vanuit de samenleving is ontstaan dat het rechtssysteem moet worden aangepast. Dit proces heeft plaatsgevonden door een verandering van perspectief van het human interestframe naar een schuldvraag in brede zin, waarbij interne ‘triggers’ leidden tot een mediabrede wisseling in aandacht en verschuiving van perspectief. Bij een emotionele mediahype als die van Anne Faber kan daarom niet worden gesproken van een vaste duur en verloop van nieuwsgolven, maar is de periodisering afhankelijk van veranderingen in perspectief en daarmee verandering in framegebruik. Een explosie van interactie waarin burgers dominant waren zorgde ervoor dat media altijd ergens over konden berichten. Het verloop van deze mediahype bevestigt dat een aanpassing van het concept mediahype in het huidige medialandschap gerechtvaardigd is.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'mediahype', 'sociale mediahype', 'signal crime', 'framing', 'Anne Faber']"

Hierbij stond de beeldvorming die de eerste week na de ramp voortkomt uit de Nederlandse landelijke dagbladen centraal. Dit geheel werd benadert vanuit vier groepen toonaangevende autoriteiten, namelijk de politiek, de wetenschap, de kernenenergie-industrie en anti-kernenergie beweging. Door middel van een kwantitatieve analyse gecombineerd met een kwalitatieve analyse is een beeld van de situatie in Nederland na Tsjernobyl geschetst. De beeldvorming uit deze analyse is vergeleken met die van Frankrijk. 
Dit actuele onderwerp bood inzicht in een chaotische periode. De korte intensieve onderzoeksperiode werd gekenmerkt door een grote vraag naar informatie, veel media-aandacht en grote onzekerheid. In tegenstelling tot lange onderzoeksperiodes bood dit de mogelijkheid de beeldvorming vanuit een breed perspectief weer te geven. Op deze wijze werd inzicht verkregen over het verloop informatiestromen bij grote rampen en de initiële chaos die erop volgt.  
Uit de analyses vormde een beeld dat in Nederland de gevaren van ramp  gerelativeerd werden, maar niet buiten de landsgrenzen werden geprojecteerd. De Nederlandse reactie kende nucleocratische elementen, maar deze waren beperkt aanwezig. In het algemeen werd duidelijk dat Nederlandse autoriteiten terughoudend reageerden. Voor specifieke informatie werd veelal verwezen naar internationale autoriteiten. In het algemeen werd door autoriteiten weinig nadruk op technische factoren gelegd, terwijl de kennis hiervoor wel aanwezig was. Tegelijkertijd was er weinig publiek debat, waarbij de grote afwezige de anti-kernenenergie beweging was.","['•\tTsjernobyl in Nederland', '•\tBeeldvorming', '•\tNederlandse landelijke dagbladen', '•\tInformatievoorziening', '•\tPubliek debat', '•\tNucleaire autoriteiten', '•\tPolitiek', '•\tWetenschap', '•\tKernenergie-industrie', '•\tAnti-kernenergie beweging', '•\tKernramp', '•\tKernongeluk']"
"The Digital Culture
Recent Users’ Online Behaviour and Interactivity in Social Media","A. Karadeli
     and 
    
  


J. Lee",2018-07-06,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","How and why do people use social media today, as opposed to six years ago? 
Over the years, there have been many researchers, who through their studies, have tried to investigate and understand the relationship between users and social media, since due to the development of the Web into an online platform that facilitates its users’ participation, communication and engagement, users have the opportunity to participate actively in this digital environment, by not only consuming content, but also by producing it. Due to social media’s continuously evolving features and structures, users are able to generate and disseminate content with other users all over the world, and connect with people who share similar goals, ideals, interests, or even personalities. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn, as well as various online blogs and forums, have formed an expansive ecosystem of connective media, and have influenced human interaction on an individual, community and even a larger societal level, allowing for the increasing interpenetration of the online and offline world. 
Tracking the digital culture and user interactivity leads to a particular user typology, which is characterized by the usage patterns that reflect certain types of user participation in social media. Research indicates that personality traits are highly related to social media usage, since individuals take particular actions in these online environments depending on their interpersonal characteristics. Consequently, the recent socio-technographics ladder typology distribution of digital interactivity based on users’ reported behaviour and personality traits suggests an alteration since 2012, since more people participate actively on social media, and have now turned from “passive recipients” of digital content, to active contributors of the online participatory culture. Specifically, the particular research indicates that personality traits affect heavily users’ online and digital behaviour, as social media users in 2018, have become increasingly involved in more variety of activities on social media, and therefore, create and circulate more content since 2012.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'social media', 'online behaviour', 'digital interactivity', 'social technographics ladder', 'online participatory culture']"
"Employer Branding and Recruitment Advertisement in the Digital Age
How can employers utilize social media to attract the desired talent?",Y.A. Kim,2018-07-03,['Y. Wang'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","With the ongoing “war for talent” in contemporary society, more and more organizations start to realize the value of employer branding in attracting competent talent. Hiring and retaining talented employees is crucial to a firm’s competitive advantages. Companies, as a consequence, invest substantially in human resources management, in order to develop appealing employer branding through a variety of recruitment activities. In this study, we investigated the impact of online employer branding on jobseekers’ perceptions. More specifically, we studied the role of interactivity and information richness of the recruitment advertisement in affecting a company’s employer attractiveness and potential candidates’ application decision. An online experiment was conducted in a cross-country setting. The sample (n = 607) consists of 174 Koreans, 136 Chinese and 297 Americans. The results suggest that interactivity and information richness of the recruitment advertisement, as well as brand awareness and country of origin, play an important role in employer branding. In particular, a strong impact of brand awareness on perception and behavior of potential applicants was observed, which suggests the critical role of brand awareness in the context of employer branding. Also, high-informative messages were found to be more effective in creating a favorable perception of the employer with low brand awareness. In addition, the perceived favorability of the employer and intention to pursue employment among the Chinese respondents were found to be higher than that of the US respondents on the well-known US employer, which confirmed the existence of the country of origin effect in the context of employer branding. The results imply that for the employers with low brand familiarity, it is critical to establish corporate brand awareness among the target audiences prior to developing an employer brand. Further, given the differences observed in the participants across the countries, employers are recommended to develop localized recruitment strategies that take regional characteristics of job seekers into account. This implies that it is important for companies to acquire a good understanding of the local talent in terms of their interest and concern when seeking future employers.","['media', 'business', 'employer branding', 'recruitment advertisement', 'employer attractiveness', 'brand awareness', 'social media recruitment.']"
THE CONFESSION OF COMING OUT,S. Nieuwenhuis,2018-06-30,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"In the current thesis, The History of Sexuality. Volume 1: An Introduction, also known as the will to knowledge,  by Michel Foucault is discussed. A summary is given of the book. After that, the concept of coming out is introduced. Coming out is the process in which individuals recognize romantic and/or sexual feelings towards people with the same gender and share their lesbian/gay/bisexual identities with others in a heteronormative society. Coming out is linked to different concepts used by Foucault; the repressive hypothesis, confessions and power. This will answer the question: can the theory discussed in the will to knowledge written by Foucault, also explain what is happening when people are coming out as gay, lesbian or bisexual.",
"Life Beyond the Blogosphere
Examining Lovepat Bloggers’ Acculturation Experiences and Self-Presentation Strategies",T. Gotay,2018-06-28,['A. Waysdorf'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This Master's thesis offers an insight on a unique group of individuals who are acculturating. This research will examine how expatriate's in international relationships (living in the EU) acculturate and how they portray their self-presentation strategies. This will be done by examining blog posts written by lovepats (expatriate’s in international relationships).
Previous research has looked at expatriates who move abroad for work assignments. This research will examine lovepats and their acculturation experience. Blogs are being used in this research as a modern media tool for social science to understand how lovepats acculturate and how they present themselves. Blogs represent a medium of self-representation and give researchers insight to their acculturation experience through the words of a lovepat blogger.
To examine this phenomenon, a qualitative (thematic) content analysis was conducted on selected blog posts from the blogs of lovepats. This analysis revealed that lovepat bloggers are portraying their acculturation experience by becoming a hybrid of two cultures: their own and the culture of their partner. Many themes were discovered that contributed towards this conclusion, such as comparing cultures, adapting to local life and the role of the local language. Also, blogs are being used as an online diary where lovepats are storytelling, but also being part of an online and sometimes off-line community where acculturation is also presented. 
The results of this research offer innovative insight towards exploring individuals in cross-cultural relationships in their acculturation experience and their self-presentation through blogging.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Acculturation', 'Acculturation Strategies', 'Blogging', 'Expatriate', 'Expatriate Adjustment', 'Europe', 'Home', 'Relationships', 'Self-Presentation']"
"The “Swiss Made” Label - 
An experimental study on the effect of market position, place of manufacture and domestic country bias in relation to corporate reputation and crisis contagion.",Karlo Buljac,2018-06-26,['Yijing Wang'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","With the increasing sensitivity of corporate reputations and the emergence of an interconnected world through social media, evermore companies are at risk of experiencing crises. Despite extensive research on (post crisis) reputation, this study has identified certain gaps in literature in relation to the market position and the place of manufacturing of brands and or products. This research also tackled the under-researched notion of crisis contagion as a possible spillover effect might occur when corporations experience a crisis, where not only the focal corporation suffers from the crisis, but also the whole industry or even other corporations from the same country as the focal corporation. To lead this research, the main question was constructed to contest the possible influence of market position and place of manufacture on the post-crisis reputation and the spillover effect. This research followed an experimental research design, which was executed through the use of an experiment. A total of 300 respondents were gathered with equal proportions of 150 American and 150 Swiss respondents. This total sample of 300 respondents provided useful insights on the proposed hypotheses and implications. The findings indicated that the market position, the place of manufacturing and the nationality indeed had a significant effect on the post-crisis reputation and the spillover effect. In short, the findings revealed that when products are located in the high-end market produced locally, in a country with a prestigious country branding, the eventual post-crisis reputation is higher, as well as a possible spillover effect. In contrast the products located in the low-end market produced abroad, in a country with a low country branding, suffered from a lower post-crisis reputation, as well as a lower spillover effect. The results also portrayed that the domestic public was more eager to forgive the corporation under crisis translating to a higher post-crisis reputation and a lower spillover effect in comparison to the foreign public. This research reveals the complexity of the aforementioned concepts in relation to post-crisis reputation and crisis contagion and at the same time advises caution to managers and decisions makers in regards to applying these complex findings to their respective corporations.","['media', 'business', 'Reputation Management', 'Crisis Contagion', 'Market Position', 'lace of Manufacture', 'Domestic Country Bias']"
"Hiphop in Rotterdam
Een onderzoek naar structuur voor een gezonde muziekecologie",S. Martosemito,2018-06-26,['E. Hitters'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Rotterdam wordt sinds jaar en dag als hiphopmekka van Nederland gezien. De stad heeft een rijke hiphopcultuur met een overvloed aan mensen die zich vanaf de jaren ’80 al bezighielden met de vier kunstvormen van hiphop: DJ’en, MC’en, graffiti en breakdance. Volgens sommige bronnen kenmerkte de periode 2005- 2010 de gloriedagen van Rotterdamse hiphopmuziek waarin rappers Winne, Hef en Feis een impuls gaven aan Nederlands hiphop. In de jaren erna was het genre wat minder prominent, althans, als het gaat om artiesten die nationaal succes wisten te scoren. Met acts als Broederliefde die het Sparta Stadion uitverkopen, rapper Ronnie Flex die Ahoy uitverkoopt en het succes van platenlabel Rotterdam Airlines, lijkt de stad op weer wat bruisender te worden wat hiphop betreft. De vraag die centraal staat in dit onderzoek luidt als volgt: welke elementen dragen bij aan een vruchtbare ecologie van de Rotterdamse hiphop? Dit onderzoek beoogt een inzicht te krijgen in de werking van de Rotterdamse hiphop ecologie waardoor er meer kennis is over hoe een genre zich kan ontwikkelen onder bepaalde omstandigheden. Om dit te onderzoeken zijn er veertien semi-gestructureerde interviews gehouden met experts – mensen die deel uitmaken van de Rotterdamse hiphopecologie. De respondenten varieerden van artiesten tot managers en creatief ondernemers. Voor het analyseren van de data is er gebruikt gemaakt van een thematische analyse. Uit deze analyse kwamen vier thema’s naar voren die belangrijk waren voor de Rotterdamse hiphopecologie: Rotterdamse mentaliteit en muziek, fysieke infrastructuur, niet fysieke infrastructuur en de toekomst. Echter, de elementen die bijdragen aan een gezonde muziekecologie zijn te verdelen in de volgende: Rotterdamse mentaliteit en muziek, het milieu, gebrek aan muzikale infrastructuur, niet fysieke infrastructuur en digitalisering. In bijna elk opzicht lijkt de Rotterdamse hiphopecologie vooral te worden getypeerd door wat er ontbreekt. Een tekort aan samenwerkingen omdat de mentaliteit van de stad dit niet toelaat, een tekort aan organisaties en ondernemers die hiphop evenementen organiseren, een tekort aan muzikale bedrijvigheid zoals platenlabels, een tekort aan plekken en podia waar producenten en/ of consumenten bij elkaar kunnen komen. Het milieu en de muzikale infrastructuur zorgen voor een perifere situatie in Rotterdam. Uit zo’n soort situatie waar niets aanwezig is, is de hiphop eind jaren zeventig in de Bronx ontstaan. De DIY-mentaliteit en de werkethiek die in Rotterdam heerst zorgen ervoor dat de leden van de hiphopecologie toch proberen te werken met de beschikbare middelen.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Rotterdam', 'hiphop', 'hiphopmuziek', 'ecologie', 'gezonde ecologie', 'digitalisering']"
Media Accountability - Holding online social platforms accountable,Anne van der Laan,2018-06-25,['P.M. Leendertse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The purpose of this research is to establish whether or not traditional accountability mechanisms, such as ombudsman, NGO’s, citizen activism, code of conduct, industry codes and similar mechanisms, could be applied to online social platforms in their assumed gatekeeping position, between users and content. The research is especially concerned with the threats that come with the use of ‘personalisation’ by means of algorithmic selection and filtering. This is done by online platforms such as Facebook and Google and the majority of their peers, to ensure that content as displayed on their platforms suits the user’s individual preferences, in order to maximize the height of the user experience on their platform. However, there are side-effects of personalisation, often put under the umbrella term of ‘the filter bubble’, which are undesirable in (democratic) societies. A filter bubble occurs when a user is no longer confronted with views that are contrasting or new. The user now simply has his own views re-affirmed over and over. Whereas democracies thrive on information plurality and diversity for citizens to base their opinions upon. Traditionally, in content-distributing companies, such problems where battled by means of accountability mechanisms, to minimize government interference, which is more a facet of totalitarian regimes. This debate largely follows Hambermas’ idea of the public sphere, applied to the online world. But for platforms, these mechanisms are scarce. Thus, expert interviews were conducted to analyse whether or not these mechanisms were applicable. It became clear that, while the risks as posed by the filter bubble theory need more empirical research, there is a perceived need for more accountability mechanisms. Although the industry of platforms is difficult to define, it appears that at least a basis of legislation is required. This should take an affirmative approach, encouraging and prescribing actions to be taken by the platforms themselves as well as governments. For the platforms, codes of conduct, transparency in communication towards users and responsiveness are found to be important elements of accountability. Issues of algorithmic transparency appear still a complex subject where the opinions are divided thoroughly. Meanwhile, governments should try to stimulate independent actors such as NGO’s and citizens to get engaged in the ‘holding accountable’. This can be done through increasing media literacy, rerouting taxes into accountability initiatives, supporting independent research and the likes. Summarizing, the urgency of legislation is low. Thus, independent research must be done to find support (or not) for the perceived risks of personalisation and algorithmic filtering and selection. Meanwhile, platforms should be
2
encouraged to behave responsibly. Governments should try to keep their involvement to affirmative actions towards stimulation desired behaviour and other indirect measures, at to keep involvement in content related issues at a distance.","['media', 'business', 'Media Accountability', 'Online Social Platforms', 'Algorithmic Filtering and Selection', 'Filter Bubbles', 'Transparency']"
"Breaking through the Green Box: Sustainable Initiatives of Dutch Fashion Labels - 
An analysis of corporate communication and sustainability",Philippa Slot,2018-06-25,['A.C. Uribe Sandoval'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The fashion industry is in the midst of a transition that encourages the decrease of environmental impact. Amongst the various corporate practices that sustainable fashion brands have communicated, Dutch sustainable start-ups have increased significantly. Such start-ups have widely used corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication to be transparent about their practices, thus enhancing their brand reputation on social media platforms such as Instagram. Yet the integral part of the brand, which is identified as the green box, is an aspect that needs to be uncovered. The collaborative performance of the brand is estimated in the green box, by understanding how it adds to sustainability and whether such collaboration complies with its CSR communication towards its stakeholders. The sustainable practices that have been identified in this research range from innovative methods such as 3D printing, to the use of new raw materials to substitute for cotton and animal fur/skin (vegan leather or fur), and the circular economy by reusing textiles and giving it a prolonged life, which reduces waste and overproduction. Scholars have demonstrated that consumers are overwhelmed by the CSR claims of fashion brands, and therefore encouraging green washing. On the basis of such theory, this study investigates the internal green box, and how the brands communicate their CSR initiatives. The results of this research indicate that start-ups realize that it is challenging to be 100% sustainable, and therefore communicate as much as they can about their practices, making sustainability their ultimate goal. Moreover, transparency becomes a topic of debate, and whether sustainability should be communicated at the foreground, or in the background. CSR communication solely in the foreground may lead to a negative brand reputation with regards to green washing, whereas communication CSR in the background could establish the commercialization of sustainable fashion, and therefore be more beneficial for companies that want to create value whilst decreasing environmental impact. Creating a positive impact should be a standard, not solely a marketing tool due to pressure of the transition or a unique message in a market full of messages.","['media', 'business', 'Sustainable Fashion', 'CSR Communication', 'Social Media', 'Instagram', 'Brand Reputation', 'Green Box']"
Influencer Marketing – The power of self -  An explorative study about personal branding of beauty micro-influencers.,Vanessa Sieg,2018-06-25,['Vidhi Chaudhri'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","As a direct outgrowth of social media, the idea of Influencer Marketing evolved from the
large numbers of regular social media users who developed a business acumen by displaying a
digital image of themselves to a mass audience on Instagram. In respect of this development, this
study focuse on the ways micro-influencers apply human-branding techniques in order to construct
and carve out distinct identities in an increasing mature Influencer Marketing market. One of the
most striking observations is a two-structural identity-constructing process, reaching over three
phases. Personal branding starts, first of all, at a basic level of identity construction and transitions
gradually into a consecutive, iterative process at later stages. Micro-influencers have to orchestrate
and sustain multiple social interactions with varying proximities simultaneously. Understanding the
decisive role of communication and engagement is crucial to succeed since micro-influencer's
person brand identity is intensely interwoven with follower's identity construction and, in a few
cases, partnered with other micro-influencers. By running an Instagram account, most of
interviewees recognized an acute shortage of one resource: time. To sustain the intensity of their
characteristic, one-on-one engagement, the proactive solution of delegation emerged as a deterrent,
however likely necessary approach in order to achieve growth. Deduced from findings, posting
once a day seemed to be the best communication strategy to exercise influence in an already mediasaturated,
information-rich environment and move towards a full-time profession – post by post.
While considering data privacy carefully, it is impressive how micro-influencers have mastered
controlling conversations and sensitive information across their media network.
In theory, micro-influencers are supposed to have internalized the concept of authenticity.
In reality, micro-influencers are confronted with the challenge of maintaining consistency and
therewith authenticity and the intention to cultivate a larger audience. Even though, microinfluencers
seemed to merge two contradictory aspects, authenticity and commodification,
effortlessly into one another, an internally and externally imposed pressure can be overwhelming.
By expanding their visual storytelling with (live) videos, their authenticity and thus legitimacy as
micro-influencers can be reconstructed. Overall, micro-influencers' efforts in visual storytelling can
be interpreted as tacit labor as their daily contributions are systematic and determined even if they
seem effortless for outsiders. By embarking in-depth interviews with 20 participants, this study
accentuates the way in which the process of micro-celebrification on Instagram is currently
executed. In all, results bolster the understanding of micro-influencers' person branding as a
dynamic, streaming and multiple process.","['media', 'business', 'Influencer Marketing', 'Instagram', 'Micro-Influencer', 'Personal Branding', 'Visual', 'Storytelling']"
Investigating the Impact of Cultural Dimensions on Social Media Behavior - A cross cultural study,Judith Hofmann,2018-06-25,['Joep Hofhuis'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In today’s world, the user rate of social media is steadily increasing. While individuals use social media for the purpose of personal communication or information exchange, global companies use it for the launch of international marketing campaigns and standardized online advertisements. As these campaigns are published across different nations, in order to produce successful online content, it is mandatory to consider cultural values. In these terms, Hofstede’s research on the so-called cultural dimensions helps to understand the complex structures of a culture and how cultural differences influence social media behaviors.
Thus, previous research already considered the relationship between cultural background and social media usage. Therefore, this research is focused on investigating how motivations for using social media depend on cultural dimensions, and furthermore how cultural dimensions affect the relationship between motivations for using social media and the actions taken on social media.
By applying a quantitative methods approach, an online survey was conducted. In these terms, 161 social media users were asked questions in regard to their cultural background and social media habits. To be more precise, the researcher gathered data to conduct a cross-cultural study and to uncover how cultural background and the corresponding motivations for using social media are related to one another. The research found out that cultural dimensions can serve as a moderator when considering the relationship between actions taken on social media and the motivations for using social media. The main findings indicated that social media behavior is related to the motivations for using social media. To be more precise, it has been found that depending on the reason for using social media, the user tends to make use of specific actions. Overall, the study recommends international marketers to closely consider the cultural dimensions of the target audience and understand how cultural differences lead to different motivations for using social media.","['media', 'business']"
"Art museums engaging audiences on social media:
the difference between established and recently opened museums",T. Stankovic,2018-06-25,['M. Willekens'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The purpose of this research is to analyse the art museums in Moscow and their usage of social media platforms in order to engage the audiences and attract public. The study is focused on the changes in museums’ life and their functions that happened as the result of shift from an ‘old’ to a ‘new museology’. The proponents of new museology emphasize that museums are affected by the growing importance of their visitors and need to shift toward many-to-many communication. The main aim is to compare traditional museums with the history of more than a century with the new upcoming ones. The notion of Bildung and cultural institutions historically rooted devotion to the cultivation of the society is used as an important point of this comparison. Based on Bourdieu’s social theory and the idea of struggle for organizational legitimacy it was assumed that the recently established cultural institutions that were introduced in the visitor-centered society would differ from the incumbents and may influence the changes in communication with the visitors. However, there are certain conventional procedures of the field that need to be followed in order to gain respect form the colleagues and audience. Therefore, the paper needs to see whether the difference between the new and traditional institutions is still significant. The analysis is based on the 4 interviews with museum representatives, who work on the development of social media marketing, as well as on 395 media posts, collected from Facebook and Instagram. The sequential multimethod design helps to cover the problem from different perspectives and acquire deeper knowledge of museum practices related to social media: analyse both the goals and actual content. The PR managers’ perception of the social media goals revealed that the difference certainly exists, but both traditional and upcoming museums are influenced by the era of edutainment and need to work for wider more diverse audiences, than they were used in the past – the ‘elitist’ connotation of art museums is blurring. Besides, emerging museums have more freedom to experiment, be creative and innovative while established have strict reputation and more expectations toward their activities. The research also revealed that channel choice plays important role, because each platform has its specific audiences and same museum needs to elaborate different tactics and content for each media platform. Furthermore, museums, especially traditional ones, still do not use the full potential presented by social media and maintain quite formal communication.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'museums', 'Russia', 'social media management', 'Web 2.0', 'marketing']"
"The political power of social media in Nigeria: 

A case study of the 2014 #Bringbackourgirls campaign",W. Mshelia,2018-06-25,['D. Dumitrica'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The role of social media in politics has been notable in many countries over the years. The Arab Spring is one of the significant incidents that exemplified how powerful social media can be on national politics. With the help of social media, citizens were able to mobilize each other and overthrow authoritarian regimes. And since then, there have been many debates about the ability of social media to create a more democratic society. 
    	In the year 2014, a campaign began on Twitter with #Bringbackourgirls after the abduction of over 250 schoolgirls in Chibok, a community in Northeast Nigeria. The campaign which started as a local Nigerian affair eventually spread like wildfire around the world. It was a turning point because that was the first case of online activism that galvanized attention within and outside the country.
This study looked to examine how mobilizers who participated in the #Bringbackourgirls campaign and are known for active media presence consider the political power of social media. The research question to be answered is: How do grassroots social mobilizers in the 2014 Nigerian #Bringbackourgirls campaign perceive the political power of social media? The question was answered by interviewing 11 mobilizers with renowned social media presence, and thematic analysis was used to analyze the interviews. The thematic analysis was deductive based on previous studies conducted on the role of social media in activism and social movements. 
The results of the study yielded that; the participants perceive social media as a platform to pressure the Nigerian government into taking actions that favor the citizens. This point is characterized by the emphasis they laid on compelling the Nigerian government to rescue the girls as their aim of using social media during the campaign. Also, they regard social media as a facilitator of strong collective action, and a platform to create collective identity despite the religious and ethnic diversity in Nigeria. And lastly, as means to mobilize people quickly as well as garner support for the campaign. They also mentioned factors such as digital divide, vulnerability to attacks and weak ties as drawbacks to the political power of social media.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'digital activism', 'social movements', 'social media', 'social mobilizers', '#Bringbackourgirls campaign']"
"Kwaliteitsjournalistiek in tijden van clicks
Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar de rol van webstatistieken en online reacties van het publiek
in de werkpraktijken van Nederlandse journalisten",S. van IJsselmuide,2018-06-25,['M. Slot'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De opkomst van sociale media als distributieplatformen voor digitale journalistiek heeft ervoor
gezorgd dat de wensen en interesses van het publiek steeds belangrijker zijn geworden voor
journalistieke organisaties. Er wordt daarom in de journalistiek in toenemende mate gebruikgemaakt
van webstatistieken en online reacties van het publiek om de mening en het leesgedrag van de
doelgroep te achterhalen (Lawrence, Radcliffe, & Schmidt, 2017; Tandoc, 2014). Hoewel deze
vormen van online technologie inzichten bieden voor journalisten, waarschuwen wetenschappers
ook voor een te grote invloed van het publiek op journalistieke beslissingen (Tandoc, 2014; Vu,
2013). Deze master thesis gaat dieper in op de rol die webstatistieken en online reacties van het
publiek spelen in de werkpraktijken van journalisten. Aan de hand van een thematische analyse van
twaalf kwalitatieve interviews met journalisten, wordt antwoord gegeven op de vraag: Op welke
manier spelen webstatistieken en online reacties van het publiek een rol in de werkpraktijken van
journalisten die werken bij Nederlandse kwaliteitskranten en -tijdschriften?
De resultaten laten zien dat zowel webstatistieken als online reacties van het publiek een rol
van betekenis spelen in de werkpraktijken van journalisten. Aan de hand van de benadering van
technologische affordances (Bucher & Helmond, 2017) die in dit onderzoek wordt gebruikt, kan
gesteld worden dat beide vormen van online technologie het mogelijk maken voor journalisten om
feedback te krijgen op hun werk. Webstatistieken bieden kwantitatieve en indirecte inzichten en
online reacties zeggen op een meer directe en kwalitatieve manier iets over de mening van het
publiek. Hoewel journalisten waarde hechten aan beide vormen van feedback, wordt het belang van
deze graadmeters gerelativeerd omdat journalisten vinden dat zij een onvolledig beeld geven.
Webstatistieken beïnvloeden de werkpraktijken van journalisten op veel verschillende
manieren: journalisten houden ze in de gaten, maken onderwerpkeuzes op basis van de cijfers,
worden ervan op de hoogte gehouden, praten er met elkaar over en worden onbewust en onofficieel
beoordeeld op basis van de online data. De online leescijfers spelen een rol in alle drie de niveaus
van journalistieke werkpraktijken die in deze thesis worden onderscheiden: routines, kenmerken van
de organisatie en maatschappelijke functies. De grootste invloed is echter zichtbaar in de routines
van journalisten. Online reacties spelen vooral een rol in de routines van journalisten: de reacties
worden gelezen, afgewogen en er wordt in sommige gevallen op ingegaan. Ook dienen journalisten
altijd bereikbaar te zijn voor hun lezers.","['media', 'cultuur', 'journalistieke werkpraktijken', 'digitale journalistiek', 'webstatistieken', 'online reacties van', 'het publiek', 'technologische affordances']"
"Refugees in the Digital Age:
Investigating Refugees’ Perceptions regarding Digital Privacy on Social Media Platforms",I. Athanasiadis,2018-06-25,['P. Arora'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In recent years, thousands of people prominently coming from Middle East, forced to leave their home countries and move to Europe in order to escape from the ongoing violence and conflicts in their region, and at the same time to protect themselves and their families. It is quite well known nowadays that this refugee crisis that Europe witnesses is considered to be the biggest refugee crisis after the World War II. According to migration literature, digital technologies are an essential tool for refugees not only to overcome numerous obstacles they might face during their resettlement, but also to maintain ties with their country of origin. In this context, this research explores refugees’ perceptions on digital privacy when using these technologies in the Netherlands. The censorship and the violations of personal privacy that these people have experienced or witnessed by the local authorities in their home states, raise questions regarding their present digital behaviour; how they use these technologies, if, and how, they manage to protect their personal privacy. Great attention was given by the academia to the relationship between the digital technologies and refugees in a more practical way. The current literature focuses on how new technologies facilitate refugees’ resettlement and integration into the host society. Less emphasis has been placed on refugees’ notions regarding their digital privacy when using them. Therefore, this thesis examines refugees’ perceptions and experiences through interviews referring to the digital privacy.  
  A total amount of ten in-depth interviews were conducted with refugees who are currently residing in the Netherlands. The qualitative content analysis by in-depth face-to-face interviews was considered to be the most suitable method of answering the research question of this thesis as it examines individual’s experiences, feelings, notions and behaviours. The thematic analysis revealed five themes which explain refugees’ digital behaviour and perceptions regarding privacy: (1) the use of digital technologies, (2) refugees’ perceptions of integration, (3) datafication, (4) digital privacy and trust, and (5) privacy management and protection. These themes depict the way refugees use new technologies in their everyday life and how it has been influenced by the various privacy protection strategies that individuals have adapted in order to protect their privacy. Furthermore, this thesis provides a critical evaluation of its limitations and offers few suggestions for further research in order to gain a better understanding of the issue.","['media', 'business', 'Refugee crisis', 'Integration', 'Privacy and trust', 'Digital technologies', 'Social media', 'Datafication', 'Privacy protection']"
"‘Duimpje omhoog’ voor politiek?
Een onderzoek naar de rol van social influencers in politieke communicatie",C. van den Boomgaard,2018-06-25,['C. Aalberts'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Social influencers are social media users with a large number of followers on several social media
platforms. Due to this great public magnitude they have become celebrities who can be used for
commercial purposes by both companies and stand-alone advertisers. Therefore, social influencers most
of the time represent or promote a certain brand or product. Social influencers are often specialized in
subjects that are related to lifestyle, beauty, fashion, food and games. Additionally, they share their life,
interests and thoughts with their followers. They do this, among other things, by means of a vlog. Vlogs
can be described as video diary entries that reflect the life of the vlogger. Until recently politics seemed
to be a topic that social influencers do not talk about in their vlogs, however during the Dutch
parliamentary elections in 2017 some social influencers did mention politics in their vlogs. Social
influencers serve as a reliable source for their audience, which mainly consists of young people who
lack political involvement. It is, therefore, interesting to see how social influencers present politics to
this specific audience. This research aims to explore the way social influencers talk about politics in
their vlogs. The research question how social influencers present politics to their audience during the
parliamentary elections in 2017 has been answered by using both quantitative content analysis and
qualitative content analysis. This research shows that a marginal number of social influencers talk about
politics in their vlogs. The social influencers that do talk about politics are talking about this subject in
four different ways. They present politics as fun, talk about politics in a positive manner, and playful
way. Additionally, social influencers are critical about politics. It seems that they lost faith in politics,
and they therefore have an indifferent and negative attitude towards it. Moreover, social influencers are
reserved when they mention politics. They do not express their political preference and state that is
unusual to talk about politics in their vlogs. Lastly, they motivate their followers by urging them to vote
and inform themselves about politics. When talking about politics in these four different ways, social
influencers show journalistic characteristics. They are independent, impartial and speak about politics
in an objective manner. They also promote politics in a similar way to celebrity endorsement.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'social influencers', 'vlogs', 'vlogging', 'YouTube', 'social media', 'user generated content', 'politics', 'political communication', 'decentralization', 'mediatization', 'media', 'journalism', 'celebrity', 'endorsement']"
"Angela Merkel: van Mädchen en Mutti tot Powerfrau
Een analyse van de beeldvorming van Angela Merkel in de Britse en Nederlandse dagbladpers ten tijde van de Duitse verkiezingen van 2017",L. Tiggelman,2018-06-25,['B. Kester'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Op 24 september 2017 werd Angela Merkel voor de vierde keer gekozen als bondskanselier van Duitsland. Dit ging niet zonder slag of stoot: extreemrechtse partij Alternative für Deutschland behaalde veel stemmen en Merkels partij de CDU boekte de grootste nederlaag sinds 1949. De verkiezingsuitslag weerspiegelt het gekantelde beeld dat al langer over Merkel bestond. Waar zij eerder op handen werd gedragen in zowel binnen- als buitenland, klonken er in de aanloop naar de verkiezingen veel negatieve geluiden. Binnen deze context van veranderde populariteit van de Duitse politicus is het interessant te bekijken welk beeld nu van Merkel wordt geschetst in de dagbladenpers. In dit onderzoek is dan ook bekeken hoe Angela Merkel werd geportretteerd in de drie weken vóór en de week na de Duitse verkiezingen van 2017 in de Nederlandse en Britse kranten. Er is gekozen voor een comparatief onderzoek naar deze twee landen omdat zij historisch en politiek gezien ver uit elkaar liggen, niet alleen wat betreft relatie met Duitsland, maar ook in hun houding tegenover Europa. Er wordt hiervoor een kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethode gebruikt, waarbij een inhoudsanalyse is uitgevoerd op 60 dagbladartikelen. Binnen deze analyse wordt er, naast het verschil tussen Nederland en Groot-Brittannië, tevens gekeken naar het verschil in beeldvorming tussen populaire en kwaliteitskranten. 
Uit de analyse is gebleken dat Merkel wordt geportretteerd als standvastige, terughoudende vrouw, die als anker van stabiliteit wordt gezien in een onrustige wereld vol instabiele mannelijke leiders. Daarbij wordt zij vaak als boegbeeld van Europa gepresenteerd, en wordt zij nog steeds vaak in één adem genoemd met haar beroemde ‘Wir schaffen das’-beleid uit 2015. In relatie tot dit laatste wordt zij ook gekoppeld aan het idee van schuld en verraad. Merkel is een van de weinige grote vrouwelijke leiders van wereldformaat, en het valt dan ook op in de resultaten dat haar ‘vrouw-zijn’ geen grote (beperkende) rol speelde in de beeldvorming over haar persoon. Ze krijgt daarentegen juist eigenschappen toegewezen die gebruikelijk aan het masculiene gender worden toegeschreven, en lijkt daarmee als vrouw de masculiene hegemonie te bevechten en tegen de gebruikelijke genderrelatie (en in zekere mate –hiërarchie) in te gaan. De verschillen die bestaan tussen de Britse en Nederlandse dagbladpers zijn grotendeels af te leiden uit de bestaande (politieke) verschillen tussen de landen, en de manier waarop zij tegen Europa aankijken. Verder is duidelijk geworden dat de Nederlandse pers in een iets neutralere toon over de Duitse bondskanselier schrijft dan de Britse, en dat vooral de verschillen tussen de Britse kwaliteitspers en tabloids duidelijk waarneembaar zijn. Vooral in relatie tot de vluchtelingenproblematiek en Brexit laten de laatste zich vaak negatief uit over Merkel.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'media', 'journalistiek', 'Merkel', 'beeldvorming', 'gender', 'Duitse politiek', 'personalisering', 'Othering', 'Europa']"
"“Zonder Twitter kan je niet echt goed fan zijn 
van iets”
De beweegredenen van fans om te participeren in activiteiten van online fangemeenschappen van DIY-popartiesten",R. Visser,2018-06-25,['S. Driessen'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Enkele wereldberoemde artiesten van dit moment, zoals Justin Bieber en Shawn Mendes, zijn ontdekt op sociale media. In dit onderzoek staan de fangemeenschappen van deze en soortgelijke artiesten centraal. Er is getracht meer inzicht te krijgen in de wijze waarop fans van DIY-(pop)artiesten participeren in online fangemeenschappen op sociale media en hun motivaties om actief deel te nemen in het fandom. Door te richten op fangemeenschappen van artiesten die hun carrière begonnen zijn op sociale media wordt een leemte in de literatuur over (online) muziekfandom gevuld. Om de onderzoeksvraag – wat zijn de beweegredenen van fans om te participeren in online fangemeenschappen van DIY-popartiesten op sociale media? – te beantwoorden is een casestudy gedaan en zijn interviews gehouden met twaalf jongvolwassen Shawn Mendes fans. Uit de interviews konden drie hoofdthema’s geïdentificeerd worden die informatie geven over de constructie van het fandom van de DIY-popartiest en hun beweegredenen om deel te nemen aan online fanactiviteiten. Ten eerste blijkt dat de fans met name participeren in het fandom om contact te houden met medefans. Door onbegrip over hun fan zijn in het ‘echte leven’ keren de fans naar het online fandom op Twitter om daar te kunnen praten over het fan object. Door middel van hun Twitternaam laten ze anderen weten dat zij deel uitmaken van het Mendes Army. Binnen de fangemeenschap wordt een onderscheid gemaakt in soorten fans, hun leeftijd en het aantal volgers dat ze hebben. Hierdoor ontstaat een gevoel van hiërarchie en status binnen het fandom. Het fandom kan daarom het best omschreven worden als een taste community (Van Dijck, 2012), aangezien het voornamelijk de interesse in het fan object is dat het fandom bindt. De hoeveelheid kennis en het aantal volgers bepalen ook de betrokkenheid van fans in de fan labor – het tweede thema - binnen de gemeenschap. De fans volgen update accounts (‘grote accounts’ met veel volgers) om op de hoogte te blijven van zowel de carrière als het persoonlijke leven van de artiest. Dezelfde ‘grote accounts’ starten ook acties, zoals streaming parties, met betrekking tot promotie van muziek van het idool. Deze vorm van fan labor is een nieuwe bevinding binnen onderzoek naar muziekfandoms en lijkt met name voor te komen bij fans van DIY-popartiesten die op deze manier bij proberen te dragen aan het succes van hun idool. Ten slotte zijn de fans actief op sociale media omdat ze daar tot in zeker mate in contact kunnen komen met de artiest en op deze wijze een bepaalde interactie met hun idool kunnen hebben. Het beeld dat ze van de artiest hebben door deze connectie proberen ze te valideren door concerten te bezoeken en de artiest ‘in het echt’ te ontmoeten. Dit verkennende onderzoek naar fandoms van DIY-popartiesten laat de constructie van deze online fangemeenschap zien en presenteert de online activiteiten van de fangemeenschap en de motivaties van de fans om daaraan deel te nemen. Voor toekomstig onderzoek wordt een vergelijkend onderzoek aangeraden om meer inzichten te krijgen in de fandoms van deze nieuwe type beroemdheden.","['media', 'cultuur', 'DIY-artiest', 'online fandom', 'user agency', 'participatiecultuur', 'fan labor', 'Shawn Mendes']"
DE NEDERLANDSE BIOSCOOP IN HET DIGITALE TIJDPERK,C. Berg,2018-06-25,['E. Hitters'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Online streamingdiensten als Netflix worden in dit tijdperk van digitalisering steeds groter en populairder bij het mediapubliek. De jeugd van 16 tot en met 23 jaar behoort tot een generatie digital natives voor wie deze online platforms en functies erg aantrekkelijk zijn. Tegelijkertijd zijn deze jongeren een belangrijke bezoekersgroep voor de Nederlandse bioscopen. Voorgaande onderzoeken voorspellen directe concurrentie van online film voor het bioscoopbezoek, gezien jongeren als fervente internetgebruikers tegenwoordig steeds meer cultureel actief zijn op het internet.
Dit probleem vormde relevantie voor de onderzoeksvraag: Op welke manieren wordt het Nederlands bioscooppubliek van 16 tot en met 23 jaar gemotiveerd om online dan wel offline films te kijken in het tijdperk van digitalisering?. Dit rapport past de uses and gratifications theorie toe in een kwalitatief onderzoek naar een antwoord op deze vraag. Met behulp van individuele interviews met zestien jongeren is er meer inzicht verkregen in hun behoeftes en motivaties voor het kijken van on- en offline film. Deze methode bood een waardevolle toevoeging aan voorgaande onderzoeken van kwantitatieve aard, die weinig achterliggende informatie gaven over publieksmotivaties.
Voorgaande onderzoeken beschrijven wel veranderingen in de consumptiepatronen van het mediapubliek als gevolg van digitalisering. Zo wordt gesteld dat het nieuwe mediapubliek actiever is in haar keuzes door het groeiende aanbod, waarbij meer voorkeur is voor diversiteit en mobiliteit boven kwaliteit in mediaconsumptie. Daarnaast wordt het publiek meer aangestuurd door gepersonaliseerde content. Ook geven onderzoeken aan dat jongeren meer behoefte hebben aan beleving en interactiviteit in de bioscoop om nog een duidelijke meerwaarde te bieden aan het (gratis) thuis-filmaanbod. Hierdoor is merkbaar dat bioscopen tegenwoordig veel investeren in beeld- en geluidtechnieken.
De jongeren uit het huidige onderzoek blijken echter met name waarde te hechten aan de bioscoop als een sociaal uitje. De beleving en interactie die in voorgaand onderzoek worden benadrukt, blijken opvallend minder van belang dat wordt gedacht. De jongeren vinden met name de geluidseffecten wel mooi, maar geven veelal aan dat zij een bioscoopbezoek alleen plannen op basis van sociale behoeftes en de aantrekkingskracht van de inhoud van films. Dit geeft aan dat integratieve en affectieve motivaties voor een bioscoopbezoek het belangrijkst zijn, waarbij zeer weinig behoefte blijkt aan belevingstechnieken als 3D-film.
Voor het kijken van online film zijn procesgerichte motivaties van belang bij de jongeren uit dit onderzoek. De jongeren worden aangespoord om online te kijken door het gemak en de variatie die online platforms met zich meebrengen. Hier geldt de aantrekkingskracht van het motto: wat je wilt, wanneer je het wilt, waar je het wilt en hoe je het wilt, zoals voorgaand onderzoek dit ook stelt. De jongeren kijken thuis wanneer het hen uitkomt en laten zij hier leiden door het beschikbare aanbod en reclames die hen aanspreken op basis van hun behoeftes.
De resultaten maken duidelijk dat online film inderdaad zorgt voor andere motivaties, maar dat deze geen directe concurrentie vormen voor het bioscoopbezoek. Online is aantrekkelijk door functionaliteit, en offline door filmkwaliteit en sociale waarde.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Digitalisering', 'Jongeren', 'Bioscoopbezoek', 'Online film', 'Uses and gratifications']"
"Guilty and in debts: Who is paying the bill?
A qualitative content analysis of the portrayal of poverty in the documentary series ‘Schuldig’",I. Rots,2018-06-25,['I. Awad Cherit'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The twenty-first century is an era increasingly being dominated by the logics of the neoliberal market, which goes accompanied by a declining welfare state and the subsequent emergence of the participatory society, all of which together lead to the paradoxical effect of a growing rather than a decreasing, new kind of poverty: debts. However, this ‘neoliberal poverty’ that debts are, is structurally made invisible through the strategy of depoliticization that favors this participatory policy. A contemporary and increasingly popular way of executing this strategy throughout the media, is the genre that British scholars labelled ‘poverty porn’, that upholds an anti-welfare message through representing poverty in a stigmatized, stereotypical, and individualized manner that neglects important structural causes of poverty. The case of the Dutch documentary series ‘Schuldig’ about people in debts in a neighborhood of Amsterdam, challenges this logic due to an approach that seems to offer an alternative to poverty porn and was acclaimed by many. Moreover, the series has contributed to opening up a public and political debate that effectively seems to tackle poverty. Goal of the current study is to examine the precise formula of Schuldig, through answering the research question ‘In light of conventional media representations of poverty, what makes the case of Schuldig a relatively novel and unique discourse about poverty?’, through the implementation of a discourse analysis on newspaper coverage on Schuldig as well as on the series itself. Starting from concrete elements that are evidence of the concept of poverty porn and the discourse of neoliberalism and participatory society, findings of the analyses show that the series Schuldig has adopted elements of poverty porn in such a way that it transforms so-called ‘judgement shots’, aimed to evoke moral disgust, into the conveyance of a message that favors the poor. Using the rhetoric of dissociating, “self-Othering”, the addition of context, and a multifaceted view of the poor, the case shows that the concept of poverty porn is not simply a black versus white issue, but can be implemented in more elaborate ways in order to foster a diverse debate that can lead to political and societal change. Moreover, with these findings, the case of Schuldig delivers a relevant contribution not only to the dominant portrayal of poverty, poverty porn, but also it sheds new light on more conventional media framing of poverty such as Iyengar’s thematic and episodic framing, and the Othering framing as posed by Krumer-Nevo and Benjamin (2010).","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'neoliberalism', 'participatory society', 'depoliticization', 'poverty porn', 'Othering']"
"Facebook: why people leave, their experiences, and opinions towards (other) social media.",E. de Winter,2018-06-25,['J. Jansz'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","With the ongoing negative presence of Facebook in the news this past year, it made Facebook an interesting case to study, as many more people seem to quit this social media platform. This paper examines what reasons young (previous) Facebook users gave to quit Facebook, how they experienced quitting Facebook, how they now look at other social media platforms as well as the rules they have applied to their social media (and the Internet in general) usage. Even though research has been done on the reasons to quit before and how people experienced it, this study focuses on a younger generation, aged 16-25, which was a recommendation from Baumer et al (2013). Fourteen participants were interviewed, from which nine were male and six were female. All interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis. It was found that the participants were very aware of the reasons why they quit Facebook and these reasons seemed to be of big importance to them. By growing older, they noticed they became more aware of the effects Facebook had on their lives, often negatively and this related to their reasons to quit. Often, the experiences, both positive and negative, were related to their reasons to quit, where first some felt Facebook was disconnecting them with their friends, they now felt they started connecting more. However, others felt it was disconnecting them even more. Also, after quitting Facebook, they became more aware of the negative effects of Facebook. Most of the participants started, or tried, reducing their other social media use after quitting Facebook, or some even before, when they realized how much impact other social media still have on them. Even though seeing the negative effects of social media, most of the participants still were using other platforms, as they also saw the positive effects social media can have. For some, after quitting Facebook, they became more reliant on other social media platforms, such as Reddit or Youtube, but it was seen as less worse. By quitting Facebook while simultaneously growing older, they became more aware of how they should use the Internet in general. Instead of wasting time, they were trying to use it more productively, but they also posted less themselves. They considered each platform to be quite different from each other, where Instagram for example is more one-sided, and Reddit is more anonymous, which are the reasons why they look at these platforms differently even after quitting Facebook.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Facebook', 'social media', 'non-use', 'technology refusal', 'reasons', 'motivations', 'experiences', 'opinions']"
"(De)constructing national identity in nation branding efforts
the relation of Thainess in Amazing Thailand tourism campaigns for Thai diaspora",P. Sritaragul,2018-06-25,['D. Dumitrica'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Nation branding efforts increasingly become important tools for officials in promoting the nation to externals. Considering the effort’s aim to present good images and unique aspects of the nation, tourism industry makes use of the project extensively. However, criticisms of the nation branding projects suggest that they impose a single image of the nation and a fixed national identity for its members. They are seen as tools for soft nationalism where the representations of its members are made homogenous. Based on this argument, this study analyses the relation Thai diaspora in the Netherlands make with the constructed Thainess in Amazing Thailand tourism campaigns. Hence, the main research questions are how do members of Thai diaspora in the Netherlands relate to the construction of the nation in Amazing Thailand tourism campaigns and how do they articulate their own national identity in this process?
To answer the research questions, the study used Anderson (1991)’s definition of nation being an ‘imagine community’ as a theoretical framework. Furthermore, the research incorporated different theories such as nation branding, diaspora and transnationalism, as well as Thai nationalism. By applying qualitative methods of visual analysis on tourism campaigns and discourse analysis in interviews with 13 Thai diaspora, findings revealed that critical comments towards the representations of the nation in the campaigns are dominant. Although some consisting images of Thainess are found between the visual analysis and interviews, main findings suggest that Thai diaspora challenged the representations of the nation as well as portrayals of Thai people. In conclusion, the homogeneity that the notion of the nation is promising through nation branding effort is not found, thus, criticisms of the project overlooking members of the nation is proved.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Nation Branding', 'Nationalism', 'Diaspora', 'National Identity', 'Transnationalism']"
Influence of Digital Technology on the Formation of Social Connections during Syrian and Eritrean Refugees’ Journeys,S. Konneke,2018-06-25,['A. Paz Alencar'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The Syrian crisis has been one of the worst crises in the present century. Europe was struggling to handle and control the amount of refugees seeking asylum and safe countries to live in. In addition and comparison to that, Eritrea has been ruled under a military doctrine since the 1990s, a lot of Eritreans try to escape through Sudan and Libya in order to reach Europe. The European Union is therefore under constant struggle to avoid refugees’ deaths during their journeys, especially when crossing the seas, and handle the amount of refugees, who enter the European Union from Italy and Greece and try to arrive in the Netherlands. Moving individuals leave behind their home, ordinary lives and families in order to live in freedom and peace. Therefore, social resources are lost and refugees in need to aggregate new ones. The journeys taken by Eritrean and Syrian refugees differ in relation to the routes, but are similar in seeking and providing information, relying on social connections and access resources in order to reach Europe and the country of destination successfully. 
Coming from recent studies and migration literature, digital technology is understood to be part of and helpful concerning the journey process. Refugees are digitally connected and access online platforms in order to inform and update themselves. In this regard, smartphones and Internet cafés can be of great importance since they enable refugees to access various social media platforms, websites and communication services and provide access to different kinds of social resources like social connections, sleeping places, transport devices and information about border crossings and routes. Differences in the use of digital technology can be drawn between Eritrean and Syrian refugees, parallels are observed looking at the journey processes and accesses to resources. 
The present study aims to understand and investigate the influence of digital technologies on the formation of social connections before, during and after the journey experience of Syrian and Eritrean refugees.
Qualitative in-depth interviews and in location produced network maps are conducted to analyze the impact and importance of social connections, established and maintained, on refugees’ journeys in relation to digital technology. Qualitative methods were considered as appropriate since the study addresses a sensitive topic and aims to understand personal experiences. By means of a comprehensive speech interaction, insights and opinions were gained in order to add to a deeper understanding and knowledge of refugee journey processes in modern times.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'refugee crisis', 'refugee journeys', 'refugee experience', 'social connections', 'interpersonal communication', 'social media', 'Facebook', 'WhatsApp', 'mobile communication', 'social networks', 'qualitative interviews']"
Selling brands while staying “authentic”: Instagram influencers’ negotiation of the imagined audience,,2018-06-25,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This paper investigates the position of Instagram influencers within the new media landscape. These influencers started out as ordinary people documenting their everyday life through a stream of photographs (Abidin, 2016b; De Veirman, Cauberghe, & Hudders, 2017). However, they are increasingly emerging as an intermediary between advertisers and consumers. This leads to tensions, as influencers find themselves in a position where they need to present an authentic and trustworthy version of themselves to their audience, while also keeping in mind the demands of the advertisers that they wish to work with. Furthermore, these relationships do not take place in a void, rather they are mediated by the platform Instagram, which, as a corporate entity, shapes the behaviour of its users. This study shows how Instagram influencers negotiate the relationship with their audience, advertisers and the platform Instagram itself, using data from 11 interviews with travel influencers, combined with a visual and textual content analysis of their twelve most recent Instagram posts (N = 132). The paper suggests that, in negotiating their newly professionalised position within the media landscape, these influencers need to present themselves as authentic whilst creating content that meets the standards of their imagined audience. On the one hand, they adopt a range of personalisation strategies to interact with the audience, while on the other hand the content which the social media influencer produces is becoming increasingly standardised. Thus, these influencers carefully curate their self-presentation in order to build a loyal audience that is attractive to advertisers.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'Instagram', 'social media influencer', 'social media', 'self-branding', 'presentation of self']"
"EGOCENTRIC SLACKTIVISTS?
Users reflecting on their participation in social media campaigns",V. Gaizutyte,2018-06-24,['J. Engelbert'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Audience research often employs quantitative research methods, which conceptualize audiences by talking about them and their social media behaviour, rather than with them. In this way, audiences become oversimplified and objectified, stripping them off their social positions and individual contexts. With the emergence of the digital age and social media, this led to participation in social media campaigns and the motivation behind it to be oversimplified to two extreme perspectives conceptualizing audiences as egocentric slacktivists or empowered citizens with possibilities to revolutionize the world. Inspirational to this thesis, Hall’s (1973) Encoding/Decoding model and Morley’s research on audiences provide insights that social position such as class and education shape the discursive resources that audiences use to “decode” or understand media messages in different ways. This indicates the subjectivity of audience media readings and motivations, and signifies the importance of inclusion of the participants themselves in the research process through qualitative methods. Stronger inclusion of audiences can also lead to their de-objectification by providing them with their own voice, rather than speaking for them. 
This qualitative study puts audiences in ‘the driver seat’, and allows them to reflect on their own social media behaviour, and participation in social media campaigns more specifically. The thesis reveals that the existing binary conceptualization of social media campaigns is too simplistic, and highlights the complexity of people’s reflections on motivations and thought-processes behind participation. Thus, the research question of this thesis is: how do university students reflect on their use of social media as a way to contribute to social media campaigns? The decision to focus on university students is based on the suggested relationship between higher education, political knowledge and civic engagement, as well as the typical age group that university students fall into, which constitutes the most active group of social media users. Based on the two insights, this group of young people provides a good opportunity to obtain rich, in-depth reflections on the perceived political and social impacts of social media campaigns, as well as the subjective insights into motivations to participate. 
In total, thirteen semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with students of Erasmus University Rotterdam in March and April of 2018. Results of thematic analysis suggest a complex interrelationship between motivations for participation in social media campaigns, with some support for ideas of slacktivism, including low physical effort and personal interests, as well as public concerns and the desire to achieve social and political change. More specifically, this study revealed that the relationship between selfish participation and interest for the public good is paradoxical, where contradicting motivations do not rule each other out, but rather, coexist. This further indicates the complexity of human psychology and behaviour online, and the fact that audiences cannot be categorized as a single, oversimplified ‘type’, such as narcissists or empowered activists.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Social Media', 'Participatory Culture', 'Slacktivism', 'Civic Culture', 'Qualitative']"

A study on the effects of YouTube metrics and review valence on perceived source credibility and purchase intention.",D. Kourelis,2018-06-23,['R. Jacobs'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The changes that Web 2.0 brought to people’s lives in the past years have also introduced a lot of changes in several industries. Especially social media have disrupted the ways of interaction within societies, interpersonal relations, as well as communication and advertising in numerous fields. Likewise, a new landscape has been created, that nowadays hosts the actions that in the past would have mainly taken place in the outside world or through traditional media.
	This thesis attempted to research the effects of technology product review videos on YouTube, the leading social medium when it comes to video hosting. Using YouTube’s environment, an online experimental survey was conducted. The goal was to understand the effect of YouTube’s popularity metrics that exist for every video and channel, together with those of review valence, on the perceived information credibility and purchase intention of the audience. The experimental part of the research helped in revealing cause-effect relationships, as well as joint effects from the manipulations on the dependent variables.
	The results from the data analysis were both expected and surprising. They partly confirmed past literature regarding the effects of social media metrics, that were found to positively affect both credibility and purchase intention. As long as review valence is concerned, the findings were in contrast with what has been demonstrated in past studies, showing no effect on either of the two dependent variables. Interestingly, the only joint effect that was found was from the combination of positive valence with low metrics on the trustworthiness of the source and the information as perceived by the participants. The findings are finally discussed through the scope of the Heuristic-Systematic model of information processing in order to provide a better understanding of the motives and reasons behind them.","['media', 'business', 'Online reviews', 'social media metrics', 'review valence', 'credibility', 'purchase intention']"

Kwalitatief onderzoek naar de betekenis van maatschappelijke waarden die organisatoren en hun publiek geven aan Nederlandse dancefestivals",J. Hamstra,2018-06-22,['A. van der Hoeven'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication",In de loop der jaren hebben dancefestivals zich verspreid door de steden van Nederland en gaat er geen weekend voorbij zonder dat er een dancefestival georganiseerd wordt. Jaarlijks worden er 450 dancefestivals georganiseerd in Nederland. Deze festivalisering waarbij er steeds meer (dance)festivals in steden wordt georganiseerd is jaarlijks in de zomer punt van discussie in de media en door inwoners van steden. Dancefestivals zouden namelijk alleen plezier opleveren voor de festivalbezoekers terwijl andere mensen juist overlast ondervinden. In gemeentelijke beleidsplannen staat echter weer beschreven dat dancefestivals een maatschappelijk belang dienen en dat ze daarom georganiseerd mogen worden in steden. Hierbij is een spanningsveld ontstaan waarbij de industrie van dancefestivals enerzijds bestaat uit het hedonisme van de festivalbezoekers en anderzijds het maatschappelijk belang van deze dancefestivals. Interessant is om te bekijken hoe die Nederlandse dancefestivals die georganiseerd worden in een stedelijke omgeving een maatschappelijk belang dienen. Daarom worden in deze masterscriptie de maatschappelijke waarden van dancefestivals onderzocht. De centrale hoofdvraag is daarbij; Hoe geven organisatoren en hun publiek betekenis aan de maatschappelijke waarden rond Nederlandse dancefestivals? Om deze hoofdvraag te beantwoorden zijn 40 websites van dancefestivals inhoudelijke geanalyseerd en hebben er 12 kwalitatieve diepte-interviews plaatsgevonden onder Nederlandse dance-organisatoren en festivalbezoekers. Naar aanleiding van deze analyse blijken een aantal maatschappelijke waarden dominant te zijn. Dit zijn de sociale en artistiek-culturele waarden van dancefestivals waarbij dancefestivals een maatschappelijk belang dienen voor zowel festivalbezoekers als de (lokale) omgeving. Daarnaast blijkt uit het onderzoek dat duurzaamheid een belangrijk maatschappelijk thema is waar Nederlandse dance-organisatoren aandacht aan geven. Een andere interessante bevinding die gevonden is bij Nederlandse dancefestivals is het gebruik van ambassadeurschap. Het samenbrengen van communities waarbij actieve participatie vereist wordt van festivalbezoekers of fans van de dance-organisatie is een nieuwe manier waarop festivalbezoekers worden samengebracht door Nederlandse dance-organisatoren. Dance-organisatoren kunnen volgens dit onderzoek maatschappelijke thema’s verweven binnen hun dancefestivals en hiermee een maatschappelijk belang dienen. Hierbij is gevonden dat de thematiek van deze maatschappelijke waarden vanuit de dance-organisatoren zelf komt. Dance-organisatoren geven betekenis aan maatschappelijke waarden door actuele maatschappelijke thema’s in de programmering te verweven die zij belangrijk vinden,"['media', 'cultuur', 'Maatschappelijke waarden', 'sociaal', 'artistiek', 'cultureel', 'duurzaam', 'Nederlandse dancefestivals']"
Modern man in search of meaning,A.M. van Kooten,2018-06-22,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"This thesis addresses the impact of the force of modernisation on man’s ability to conceive of the world as a meaningful whole. Even though modernisation is a tremendously energising and progressive force that transformed European society throughout the modern era, many thinkers have also addressed the ‘dark side’ of modernisation that can be found in its disenchanting, disruptive, and disembedding character. As argued in this thesis, the quest for meaning starts with the understanding that despite the disenchantment of the world, moderns still find themselves in a condition of disenchanted enchantment, where meaning and significance can be found in existence through attunement and ontological involvement.",
How is the role of the sommelier (re)defined in contemporary times?,Raphaëlle Boyer,2018-06-21,['Filip Vermeylen'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Wine is doubtlessly a product that arouses today interest as it is associated with the notions of complexity, mystery and luxury. As such, the sommelier seems to be very representative of these conceptions. His expertise as well as his role within gastronomic restaurants crystallize both fascination and curiosity. If the topic of wine has been largely written about (the sales, the marketing strategies, the consumer’s behaviour, the bottle labels…), few researches focus on the profession of the sommelier only, who he is, what he does, what he aims at. That is why the decision has been made in this master thesis to give pride of place to the sommelier whose role is crucial in the world of wine, as he is the liaison between the wine-making process and the consumer. Hence the following research question: How is the role of the sommelier (re)defined in contemporary times? The idea behind the notion of “contemporary times” was to entail the concepts of digitization, globalization and experience economy. Indeed, since digitization has affected the economy in multiple ways and brought about a lot of changes as well in the wine industry (in the sales and speculation for instance), the question was to know whether the sommelier had been affected and in which way. A strong emphasis has been made on the rise of amateurs on the social media and the impacts this could have on the sommelier profession. However, the findings overthrew the expectations, showing that the sommelier is part of a whole experience of tastes and enjoyment, anchored in a reality and in the present, working in a close relationship with particular meals and flavours. As such, he is today little impacted by digitization and by the social media. Indeed, if theoretical information is far more accessible to anyone, and if the consumers may be more informed, this latter is (1) not necessarily educated in terms of tastes and (2) most of the time trusts the sommelier’s and rely on his advice as he is regarded as the wine expert. Also, the sommelier relies on his palate only and is little influenced on what can be said about such or such wine. As such, he is less a trend follower than a newness introducer. Expectations about globalization and demand for New World wines have been as well overthrown. The results showed that demand for French wines remain very strong in France both from the French and non-French consumers. Finally, the interviews brought up multiple new insights, the three main being: (1) the qualities of the sommelier, that turned out to largely exceed the mere knowledge in wine with a strong emphasis on the relationship to the client, (2) the core idea of experience and (3) the evolutions of the sommelier over the years as well as the consumers’ habits.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'wine', 'sommelier', 'digitization', 'social media', 'expert', 'globalization', 'experience']"
THE AUDIENCE AS GATEKEEPER - Attention for unreleased techno music in online communities as indicators for post-release success,Boris Gunst,2018-06-21,['Christian Wolfgang Handke'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis investigates to what extent pre-release attention for techno songs and popularity of
artists in online communities can predict post-release success of songs on Spotify and
Beatport. Before a song is released, it is difficult to estimate whether the audience will
appreciate it or not. Gatekeepers and certifiers take a central role in the music industry
because they decide whether the value of music is high enough to cover investment in the
product. Since the digitization of music and emergence of social media, culture, and music in
specific, is increasingly taking place online. This resulted in an enormous amount of data
regarding preferences of the audience and popularity of artists. An extensive amount of these
data is generated in online music communities and provides us with information about
audience attention for songs before release. The focus of this thesis lies on the attention for
unreleased techno songs in the online Facebook-community Raad de Plaat. In this
community, recordings of unreleased songs at events are uploaded by members in order to
identify the artist and title. The research question of this study is to what extent attention for
songs in the online Facebook-community Raad de Plaat and the popularity of the artist on
Facebook can predict success of songs after release. Success on Spotify is defined as number
of plays per day. The success on Beatport is measured by a songs peak position in the charts
and number of days in the charts. A quantitative content analysis is performed in which there
is controlled for musical characteristics and the popularity of the DJ that plays the
unreleased song. In the results, different models are presented in order to answer the
research question. The research showed that attention for unreleased songs in Raad de Plaat
significantly predicts the success on Spotify after release to some extent. When taking the
popularity of the artist on Facebook into account, a majority of the success of songs can be
predicted before release. For predicting success on Beatport, attention on Raad de Plaat is
not a significant predictor when controlling for musical characteristics. The popularity of the
artist on Facebook however, is in all models a significant predictor for success on Beatport
and Spotify. When online communities enable the audience to collectively value songs before
release, their practice is similar to the practice of certifiers and gatekeepers and this may
have implications for the organization and structure of the music industry","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Electronic Music', 'Online Communities', 'Uncertainty', 'Gatekeepers', 'Economics of Attention']"
"Media Accountability in the Algorithmic Age - 
Portugal and The Netherlands: Two Media Systems in Comparative Perspective",Catarina Dias Osório,2018-06-21,['Matthijs Leendertse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The widespread use of algorithms in several areas of society raises concerns about their impact on the lives of people (World Wide Web Foundation, 2017). Particularly in journalism algorithms are used in several ways. For instance, to distribute content on social media, to find topics to write about, and to rely on data-analytic tools (Diakopoulos & Koliska, 2016). Owing to this, some scholars have been urging for algorithmic accountability in journalism (Berners-Lee, 2018; Diakopoulos, 2015, 2017; Diakopoulos & Koliska, 2016; World Wide Web Foundation, 2017). Within the two main media systems in Europe this thesis asks how can journalists in Portugal and in The Netherlands be held accountable for publishing their content on algorithmically-controlled environments and using algorithms in their work? Based on the different expectations concerning the role of journalism in the Polarized Pluralist and Democratic Corporatist models (Hallin & Mancini, 2004) this research assesses potential solutions for algorithmic accountability within two opposing frames of accountability – the political and the professional frame. Through expert interviews, this inquiry shows different possible solutions for Portugal and The Netherlands concerning algorithmic accountability in journalism.
In relation to Portugal, the main findings show that governmental intervention should be avoided, except for the case of the use of social media. One of the solutions proposed is to monitor the content that is published on these platforms by news media companies for normative purposes. Although self-regulation is considered the most adequate path, the structure of the news media market might hinder algorithmic accountability as well as some features among the class. One of Surprisingly, one of the solutions points to the market frame, not in the scope of the research. Differently, the experts from The Netherlands give a more nuanced approach on the matter. Although self-regulation is deemed ideal, a more indirect governmental interference is considered positive to hold journalists accountable, mainly through governmental pressure and State subsidies to independent monitoring organisations. Indeed, the inputs lean to the public responsibility frame rather than the political frame, which does not comprise the focus of the research. In both countries, algorithmic transparency is considered a possible path to hold journalists accountable, but it needs
3
to be thoroughly assessed and implemented. The findings also indicate that algorithmic accountability is already happening in both countries, mainly through informal self-regulation mechanisms. On the whole, this thesis aims to spark the discussion not only in Portugal and in The Netherlands but also in other Polarized Pluralist and Democratic Corporatist countries concerning algorithmic accountability in journalism. Most of all, it informs further research, media policy makers, news media companies, and journalists themselves on possible paths to algorithmic accountability.","['media', 'business', 'algorithms', 'journalism', 'media accountability', 'media systems', 'social media']"

tech giants are developing an important strategic key role for the next years.
This research made an attempt to investigate how these companies firstly developed, and later
on evolved their internationalization process towards Western countries.
The data collection process and the analysis were guided by the conceptual model, which was
created through theoretical research.
Most of the theory is confirmed by the significant findings. The evidence of the absence of a
clear path for the overall internationalization process corresponds with the theoretical
propositions about the internationalization process of Multinational companies originated by

"The forms of value creation in music intermediaries - 
Intermediation and disintermediation in the music industry",Andreas Periklis Metaxas,2018-06-21,['Erik Hitters'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis project aims to research and analyze the changes that digitalization brought to the music industry while in particular; the research focuses on the forms of value creation in music intermediaries. Accordingly, the qualitative research’s target is to investigate the means that music intermediaries use in order to create value, remaining relevant in the era of digitalization and online distribution, where physical record sales tend to disappear. Moreover, the research was designed and based on two theoretical arguments. On one hand a number of writers and researchers that indicate the end of music intermediation as emerging technologies remove the barriers between artists and listeners. For them, this new era of independents, eliminates traditional monopolies in music production and consumption such as the record labels and the radio. On the other hand, many suggest that digitalization brings new aspects in the music industry as it creates new necessities. Therefore this projects aims to dive deeper in the changes that digital technology brings in the field of music intermediation as well as the transformations that music intermediaries have to confront. Thus, through a holistic approach to music intermediation, the research tried to investigate how music intermediaries continue to create value in an uncharted period where new models of music consumption, such as Spotify or YouTube, emerge.
Furthermore, the research approach was based on the importance of traditional or new gatekeepers in the field of music business as well as the elements that help them to remain sustainable for the industry. Thus, through ten exploratory expert interviews, relevant questions based on a given literature were asked. Subsequently, music intermediaries from several types of companies such as record labels, music media, radio or live events operators were contacted and answered questions based on given themes. Hence, concepts like the “digitalization of record industry», the “necessity of contemporary intermediation” and the” positive or negative aspects of digital transformation in music intermediaries”, were explored throughout the interviews. Ultimately, besides the methods that music intermediaries use in order to remain relevant in the music industry, this project also wants to fuel the conversation regarding intermediation in the larger spectrum of media, culture and entertainment. Similarly, as the web creates new frames in creation and distribution, it challenges simultaneously, the role of intermediaries not only in music but in several fields such as media and creative industries.","['media', 'business', 'digitalization', 'intermediaries', 'intermediation', 'music', 'media', 'digital transformation', 'music industry', 'music business']"
"“The fact is just that people are finally realizing what it’s about” - 
Analyzing the changing work practices of communication professionals",Kaisa Vetoniemi,2018-06-21,['Alex Gekker'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research focuses on analyzing the changes that the shift towards a so-called
participatory culture has brought into the work practices of communication professionals.
Technological developments have resulted into increased availability and overwhelming
amount of information as the number of communication channels has multiplied, and
changed the way in which audiences participate and create content. While thinking of the
magnitude and speed of the transformations in the media landscape, it is interesting to
analyze how communication professionals are dealing with these changes. The theoretical
framework of this research provides a broad overview of the field and gives some concrete
examples of the shift towards participatory culture. The chosen method for this research is indepth
interviews, as the aim is to analyze the perceptions of communication professionals in
greater depth.
It was discovered that even though the essence of the profession remains the same,
the shift towards participatory culture has indeed changed not only the way the professionals
approach their work but also some concrete work practices. As the amount of third parties
such as social media influencers and the time spent on working with owned media has
increased, professionals are working less with traditional media. Therefore, greater amount
of content than ever before is produced in communication agencies and departments. Due to
these changes communication professionals are able to have direct contact with their
audiences, which together with the increased participation from the audience, has led to
leaving the sender-perspective behind and adapting a more user-focused perspective.
Therefore, creating dialogue, facilitating peer-to-peer discussions and forming of
communities and aiming to be part of the communication rather than the sender of
information has become important when working as a communicator. Because of the
increased produsage and creation of user-generated content, the control that professionals
used to have over the messages and content that was published has decreased, and
therefore, flexibility, adaptability and improvisation skills have become valuable assets when
working as a communication professional in the fast-moving landscape characterized by
wide variety of communication channels. This research advocates that in order to be a
successful communicator in this landscape, flexibility and improvisation together with the
ability to have a more holistic perspective and be included in decision-making processes are
important skills to master.","['media', 'business', 'participatory culture', 'work practices of communication professionals', 'attention', 'economy', 'micro-celebrity', 'structural change']"
"The Pursuit of Legitimacy.  
Corporate Use of Legitimation Strategies in CSR Crises.",Julia Orth,2018-06-21,['Vidhi Chaudhri'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Crises are well-recognized as events that damage a company’s positive reputation, i.e. stakeholder perceptions of the company’s favorability. A less recognized attribute that can be threatened by crises is legitimacy. Different from reputation, legitimacy describes stakeholder perceptions of the company’s appropriateness and conformity with social, value-driven expectations. The loss of legitimacy can cause substantial threat to a company’s existence. CSR crises are such incidents that put a company’s existence at risk. They are defined as incidents where stakeholders perceive the company or its actions as inappropriate regarding social norms and values. If exposed to a CSR crisis, companies thus need specific crisis communication that aims to regain lost legitimacy. These ‘legitimation strategies’ are subject of this research. The objective is to gain in-depth insight regarding the use of legitimation strategies in the face of CSR crises which require active regeneration of legitimacy.
Guided by the main research question “How do companies aim to regain their legitimacy in the face of a CSR crisis?”, the press releases related to five CSR-crises from 2012 to 2017 were analyzed in a multi-case study. The affected companies were British bank Barclays, German automotive group Volkswagen, US drug producer Mylan, US bank Wells Fargo, and US airline United. The accused inappropriate incidents were either cases of fraud or cases of serious unethical behavior. In a thematic content analysis patterns of legitimation that could be found within the cases as entities, shifts of legitimation that come with the crisis progress, and patterns of legitimation that were found amongst the cases were examined.
The results showed that legitimation in the case of a CSR crisis resembled the general discursive legitimation theories to a significant extent. Those results from practice that were different from the theory-based discursive framework could be explained as well. For instance, through other non-discursive legitimacy theories or the distinct characteristics of a CSR crisis. It was also recognized that different legitimation strategies are applicable for different legitimacy objectives.
Legitimation in the analyzed cases was used holistically within the press releases. A universal legitimation approach with legitimation leitmotifs was visible. Legitimation progressively mutated along with the crisis. In the ‘reaction stage’ legitimation based on vague emotional claims, in the ‘correction stage’, information about legitimizing corrective actions were communicated. The ‘transformation stage’ bases on the acceptance that structural change is needed to regain institutional legitimacy. Claims of long-term corporate transformation and future-orientation were characteristic for this final stage. Legitimation patterns were not only visible within the cases but also amongst them. Main themes that were utilized prominently by most of the companies were for instance ‘customer commitment’ or the announcement to ‘make it right’. This overarching use showed that legitimation can be interpreted as a particular CSR crisis response strategy, a ‘regeneration of institutional legitimacy’ strategy.","['media', 'business', 'Crisis Communication', 'CSR Crisis', 'Discourse', 'Legitimation', 'Press Releases']"

How Travel Experts Believe Marketers Can Sell to Travellers 2.0",Rayhaan Imam,2018-06-21,['Ana C. Uribe Sandoval'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The field of travel marketing has undergone a paradigm changing transformation with the rise of
Web 2.0 and the subsequent Traveller 2.0. The key offerings of the travel industry have
gradually become more consumer-centric and experiential, catering to the wants of travellers
who crave authentic experiences, as opposed to tourists who were not content seeing
destinations under the tourist gaze. How then, do travel experts believe that travel marketers
can use Web 2.0 to attract new customers to their “traditional” businesses? By getting insight on
the core concepts of Web 2.0 marketing, selfie and tourist gaze, hyperreality on social media,
prosumption, storytelling, customization, influencer marketing and trend creation, this research
aims to explain how Web 2.0 can be leveraged to effectively market experiential travel to this
generation of DIY travellers. These themes were explored via conducting ten semi-structure indepth

"Museums and Digital Media - 
Engaging with Users Who Might Never Visit",Chloe Aftab,2018-06-21,['Matthijs Leendertse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis explores how museums can strategically use digital media to engage with people who might never visit physical museum spaces, as many new opportunities online have been created by the proliferation of the Internet. While previous research primarily focuses on using digital media within the museum sector as a method of recruitment for physical visitors, this thesis explores possibilities for museums with digital users. With current technology and the Internet, museums can now expand their reach and engage with new audiences using innovative digital media products and processes. Because of the highly competitive cultural sector that museums operate in online, they must strategically position their organizations using differentiation strategy to entice these new audiences to engage with them online. This requires the innovation of current business models in order to tailor digital media to the new, digital audiences. The research was carried out through ten qualitative interviews with experts who were defined as people who have created digital products and services either for or within museums.
By analyzing the transcribed interviews using theoretical thematic analysis, several important findings were discovered regarding the viability of innovating customer segments, value propositions, customer relationships, channels, and revenue streams. To segment users, data and location were proven to be effective strategies. Value propositions that museums can offer digital audiences are authoritative knowledge, exclusive content, edutainment, and accessibility, but they are of the most value when combined. Online communities and personal assistance are both relationships that are well suited to digital audiences, whereas co-creation may not be. Integration of online channels, otherwise known as the omni-channel approach, is important to create recognition amongst digital audiences. By effectively managing the latter four sections, new streams of social and commercial revenue can be generated by museums with digital users.","['media', 'business', 'museums', 'digital media', 'business models', 'social value', 'commercial value']"
"“Watching toy unboxing videos on YouTube: How Dutch parents portray the experiences of their children” - 
A Qualitative Research",Tibby van Dijk,2018-06-21,['Nicoleta Bălău'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","There is a large body of literature devoted to how parents mediate and influence the media consumption of their children, also in the area of user-generated YouTube videos. However, academics have yet to conceptualise how parents portray their children’s experience of watching user-generated content, and in particular of toy unboxing videos on YouTube. In these videos, adults or children open, assemble and demonstrate new purchases mostly related to toys, and the videos are targeted primarily at young children. This current study aims to understand how Dutch parents portray their children’s experience of watching toy unboxing videos on YouTube. By means of semi-structured in-depth interviews this qualitative-oriented research essentially aims to investigate how Dutch parents make sense of their children’s toy unboxing viewing experience, and how they perceive the potential consequences as a result of watching those videos to be for their children. Furthermore, this research also examines how parents monitor this behaviour, and lastly how they perceive the future consequences of watching these videos to be. The main findings showed that Dutch parents portrayed the videos as a simple, innocent yet rich media form. The implications of viewing those videos entail the notion of inspiration, as children seem inspired how to interact with specific toys through the videos. However, parents acknowledged children do not exactly copy the act of toy unboxing, because they do not make a connection between the unboxing in the videos and their own opening of received gifts. Also, parents portrayed that children do not experience similar emotions when they watch a toy unboxing video compared to when they open a new toy themselves, except once a child is ascertained to someday own the toy in the video the act of watching becomes a highly sensational exercise. Additionally, parents indicated their child may learn from the videos by understanding the multiple functions of the toys, increase their vocabulary or even improve their social status, which may enhance their future life events. Furthermore, parents apply a strategy of distant mediation to monitor their child’s toy unboxing viewing behaviour, and seek to find the right balance between freedom and protection. Overall, parents share the opinion that their children will adjust their viewing behaviour according to their personal interests, which will potentially drive them further away from viewing toy unboxing videos on YouTube. At last, this research elaborates on several theoretical and practical implications. For instance, in the future a shared online space could be created on which parents can convey about matters such as new YouTube viewing trends and how to respond to such new online phenomena. In addition, this research contributes to the fuller understanding of contemporary digitization of
3
early childhood, and cognitive scientists could use these insights to find out how children actually cognitively process toy unboxing videos.","['media', 'business', 'User-generated YouTube videos', 'toy unboxing YouTube videos', 'viewing experiences', 'parents portraying experiences child', 'parental mediation of YouTube videos']"
"Influential media partners - 
How media firms can incentivise professional social media
influencers to generate value for them",Thomas Stoffer,2018-06-21,['Matthijs Leendertse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","During recent years, a more interactive internet caused for a digital equivalent of opinion
leaders to emerge: influencers. Influencers are understood to have the ability to influence a
particular group of people through social media or blogs. They are different from the more
traditional concept of celebrities where influencers could also be everyday people, who use
the internet to reach their accumulated following through the visual and textual narration of
their personal lives and lifestyles. Simultaneously along the rise of the concept of
influencers, businesses also developed interest to work with them because they are
considered to be the main channel of electronic word-of-mouth marketing. Existing literature
on influencers primarily had an exploratory focus on including them in marketing and
advertising strategies, with no attention to the principles of co-creation. Additionally,
academic co-creation literature primarily resolved around firms working with consumers or
other stakeholders. At the crossroads of these two gaps in the current literature, this study
aimed to determine how media firms could incentivise professional social media influencers
in order for them to generate value. Hence, this study carried out a qualitative research
whereby twelve semi-structured expert interviews were conducted. The results derived from
thematically analysing the interviews shows that companies need to incentivise influencers
on the partnership creation level and on the implementation level. Noteworthy, currently
firms primarily work with influencers in a more traditional way, slowly moving towards cocreation.
In the partnership with professional social media influencers, it is important to
determine the goals of the firm, select the right influencer, maintain the relationship, discuss
the goals and compensation, inspire the creative process and monitor the results. To ensure
the quality of the co-created value, firms should ensure trust is built, authenticity remained
and creative freedom is ensured.","['media', 'business', 'influencers', 'social media', 'partnerships', 'collaboration', 'co-creation', 'value creation']"
Lifestyle micro-influencers and the practice of product endorsement on Instagram through the eyes of young female users,Christina Elenopoulou,2018-06-21,['Teresa de la Hera Conde-Pumpido'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Nowadays, the emergence of influencer marketing has resulted in the ever-growing demand on behalf of brands to collaborate with influential individuals on social media, who can assist in the promotion of various products and services. On Instagram specifically, aside from using celebrities for endorsements related to fashion, beauty, travel and lifestyle in general, brands are increasingly relying on influential individuals such as micro-influencers, who may have fewer followers but are considered to be more relatable and accessible.
With the help of the word-of mouth theory, the source credibility model and the match-up hypothesis, the purpose of this research is to investigate the practice of product endorsement by lifestyle micro-influencers, as it is perceived by their young female followers, their main audience on Instagram. More specifically, the study explores the motives for following and interacting with these micro-influencers on this application, as well as the different ways their credibility is interpreted according to the young women who follow them. In addition, the congruence between the lifestyle micro-influencers and their endorsements and how their young female followers understand it, is also examined.
This research was based on twelve in-depth interviews, either face-to-face or through Skype, with women between 21 and 25 years old, followers of five lifestyle micro-influencers. By implementing thematic analysis, the main themes emerged from the collected data, related to the posed research questions. In particular, it was indicated that inspiration, opinion seeking, attractiveness and relatability are what motivate the young female Instagram users to follow lifestyle micro-influencers. Furthermore, according to these users, attractiveness is the most important indicator for the credibility of lifestyle micro-influencers, a finding also connected with the match of these micro-influencers with the products and brands they endorse. Finally, the limitations of the study were critically assessed, together with suggestions for future research.","['media', 'business', 'micro-influencers', 'product endorsement', 'Instagram', 'source credibility', 'match-up hypothesis']"
"And the Oscar goes to:
A movie that we can totally predict?",Jordy Krijgsman,2018-06-21,['Ju-Sung Lee'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research primarily aimed to combine and add to previous studies who delved
into the individual aspects that are considered to influence a film’s critical recognition
(defined in this research as a film’s success at the Oscars, both in terms of
nominations and wins). For this study, three main influential factors were established,
who operate as agents in the persuasion knowledge model (Friestad & Wright,
1994), as they try to influence the persuasion target, which is the Academy. The
three factors in this study consisted of the box office performance, public reception
and critical reception. For the critical reception, it was argued that the job of critics
(namely, rewarding films of the highest quality) lines up with the main goal of the
Academy, thus resulting in the facile assumption that there is a relation between the
two. For the public, it was argued that films who appeal to the public regarding a
certain contemporary social discussion, or controversy, have to a higher chance of
being critically recognized (e.g. as evidenced by Moonlight (Jenkins et al., 2016) and
the #OscarsSoWhite (Cox, 2017) controversy), which means that the public reception
of a film has an influence on the Oscars. Finally, the box office indicates the films that
were seen in theaters by the majority of the public. Given that the Academy
frequently nominates (although never actually rewards) a few of these films in order
to lure in viewers for their ceremony, it can also be argued that the box office has a
persuasive effect on the Academy. Each of the four components of this research
were operationalized. First, the public reception was operationalized by combining
the online IMDb and Cinema scores. Second, the critical reception was
operationalized by combining two statistics (Tomatometer and average rating) on the
Rotten Tomatoes website. Third, the box office was operationalized as the domestic
box office numbers, adjusted for inflation. And finally, critical recognition was
operationalized in terms of a film’s number of Oscars nominations, Oscar wins, and
Oscar wins in the big five (the most prestigious Oscars) category. A sample of 290
films (N = 290) was drawn, ranging between the years 1995 and 2017, and
3
consisting of all kinds of films that were eligible for Oscar recognition (blockbusters,
flops, poorly reviewed films, big five winners, etcetera.). OLS regression models,
negative binomial regression models and Baron-Kenny mediation models were
calculated in order to analyze the relationships between the four components of this
research. In the end, it was found that critical reception is a strong and consistent
predictor for a film’s critical recognition. The public reception was found to be a
moderate predictor, and it was found that its predictive value decreases as the
degree of critical recognition increases. Finally, the box office was the weakest
(although still a significant) predictor. Moreover, the box office variable was found to
be a weak and mostly insignificant mediator when mediating between public or
critical reception (IV) and critical recognition (DV). This was explained by the
Academy simply caring more about the critical or public reception, rather than the
box office numbers.","['media', 'business', 'Box Office', 'Critics', 'Public Reception', 'Oscar Recognition', 'Film', 'Academy Awards']"
Exploring the effect of a message source and corporate response strategy on publics’ behaviour intentions and perceived corporate reputation,A. van Mook,2018-06-21,['Y. Wang'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study aimed to explore whether a message source (CEO or employee) and corporate response strategy (deny, diminish, apology) had an effect on public’s behaviour intentions and perceived corporate reputation after a corporate paracrisis. The reason for focusing specifically on the paracrisis is its relevance for contemporary crisis management that springs from the increasingly powerful role of social media and evoking an issue to a crisis. In this study it was discussed whether Attribution theory, Image repair theory or SCCT would be the best theory to follow in order to solve a paracrisis. SCCT was seen to be the most applicable theory. As little to no research was done on the topic, the results would provide good insight in whether selected SCCT response strategies apply to the paracrisis.  Moreover, existing literature do not agree on who should be perceived as the most credible message source in times of a crisis; the CEO or the employee. To find out whether SCCT is applicable to the paracrisis, and who is perceived as the most credible message source, the following research question was posed: “How do a message source and response strategy affect post-crisis reputation and the publics’ behaviour intention among the public of a preventable crisis?” Based on this research question, four hypotheses were established. In order to answer the research question, an online experiment was conducted in ‘Qualtrics’ using a 2 x 3 factorial between-subject design for a total of six conditions. Each condition included a combination of one message source and one response strategy. The data for this study were collected via online tool MTurk whilst adopting a simple random sampling method. A total of 438 people participated in the experiment. However, after filtering out 144 participants, the final sample was compiled of 294 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to one out of six different conditions. Each condition presented several stimuli; a biography of George Allington who was described as either the CEO or employee of PlasTech Innovations, a corporate description, and a fictitious news article in which allegations were made towards PlasTech Innovations. Lastly, participants viewed a corporate crisis response conform to the condition. After all responses were collected, several statistical tests were conducted in SPSS to test the relationship between the fixed factors and the test variables. The findings showed insignificant relationships between the fixed factors response strategy and message source, and the independent variables ‘Post-crisis reputation’ and ‘Behaviour intentions’ . Consequently, all four hypotheses were rejected. All in all, this indicates that both the message source as well as the response strategy do not significantly influence the post-crisis reputation perceptions and behaviour intentions in the sample. The rules of SCCT are seen to be inapplicable to the distinctive paracrisis. Therefore, in order to be able to respond to a paracrisis properly, a new theory should be established which takes into account the characteristics of the paracrisis.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Paracrisis', 'response strategy', 'message source', 'behaviour intention', 'post-crisis reputation']"

Kester'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Een onderzoek naar de betekenisgeving van het Nederlandse publiek aan het vrouwenvoetbal in de media: één jaar na de historische overwinning van het vrouwenvoetbal op het Europeeskampioenschap van 2017
2017 was een belangrijk jaar voor het Nederlandse vrouwenvoetbal. Op eigen bodem won het Nederlandse vrouwenvoetbalteam, voor het eerst in de geschiedenis het Europeeskampioenschap voetbal, WEURO 2017. De wedstrijden trokken een zeer groot en divers publiek, zowel in de stadions als op televisie. De meeste eerdere onderzoeken naar gender en sport hebben zich gefocust op het mannenvoetbal of de (stereotype) representaties van het vrouwenvoetbal besproken. Hierdoor is de manier waarop deze mediarepresentaties worden ontvangen door het publiek en hoe hier betekenis aan wordt gegeven door zowel het mannelijke- als het vrouwelijke publiek onderbelicht gebleven. Dit onderzoek heeft zich gericht op dit kennishiaat en geeft inzicht in hoe het Nederlandse publiek de gemedieerde prestaties van het Nederlandse vrouwenvoetbalteam interpreteert, één jaar na de historische overwinning. Uit de analyse van zes verschillende focusgroepen, bestaande uit zowel mannen als vrouwen en voetballers en niet-voetballers, kwam naar voren dat het publiek vooralsnog middels het hegemoniale mannelijke discours betekenis geeft aan het vrouwenvoetbal. Daarnaast is er sprake van een positieve verandering en ambiguïteit binnen dit dominante discours. Echter zijn er wel drie belangrijke voorwaarden aan deze positieve betekenisgeving verbonden: succes, de aanwezigheid van heteroseksueel aantrekkelijke speelsters en de aandacht van de media. Al deze voorwaarden waren afgelopen zomer aanwezig waardoor het vrouwenvoetbal EK uitgroeide tot een mediaevent en de veranderingen met betrekking tot het dominante discours rondom het vrouwenvoetbal werden versneld.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Sport', 'Gender', 'Discours', 'Representatie', 'Receptie', 'Vrouwenvoetbal', 'WEURO2017']"

M. Bouman",2018-06-21,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Gezondheidskwesties en medische thema’s zijn onderwerpen die relatief veel aandacht krijgen op de televisie in vergelijking tot andere wetenschapsgebieden. Er bestaan verschillende invalshoeken en perspectieven om gezondheid, ziekte en/of dood in beeld te brengen en betekenis te geven aan deze onderwerpen. Karpf (1988) identificeert vier verschillende perspectieven van deze onderwerpen binnen televisieprogramma’s, die zij gezondheidsbenaderingen noemt. Hierbij onderscheidt zij de medische benadering, de consumenten benadering, de zorg-voor-jezelfbenadering en de omgevingsbenadering. Het is van belang dat al deze gezondheidsbenaderingen te zien zijn op televisie, zodat voor de kijker een veelzijdig beeld van gezondheid, ziekte en dood wordt gecreëerd. Wanneer bepaalde perspectieven worden uitgesloten kan dit leiden tot een versmalling van het publieke debat (Karpf, 1988; Kline, 2011) en een gebrek aan oriëntatie op het gebied van gezondheid en ziekte (Dutta, 2007).
De hoofdvraag van deze scriptie luidde: Welke gezondheidsbenaderingen zijn aanwezig in televisieprogramma’s over gezondheid, ziekte en/of dood die worden uitgezonden door de NPO? Om een antwoord de formuleren op deze vraag is een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse gedaan naar televisieprogramma’s op de NPO over gezondheid, ziekte en/of dood in de tijdsspanne van september 2017 tot en met december 2017. Daarnaast zijn diepte-interviews gehouden met een aantal programmamakers, redacteurs of andere betrokkenen van de geanalyseerde programma’s. Uit onderhavig onderzoek kwam allereerst naar voren dat de vier gezondheidsbenaderingen van Karpf (1988) nog steeds worden gehanteerd in televisieprogramma’s. Gezondheid, ziekte en dood worden via een breed scala aan invalshoeken in beeld gebracht: van televisieprogramma’s waarin het klassieke beeld van de arts in de deftige witte doktersjassen in stand wordt gehouden, tot aan programma’s waarin tips worden gegeven over veilig vrijen en het veilig gebruiken van drugs. Tevens is een nieuwe gezondheidsbenadering gevonden: de kwaliteit-van-levenbenadering. Deze nieuwe benadering draait om het leren leven met en accepteren van een ziekte of naderende dood, zodat kwaliteit aan het leven gegeven kan worden. Echter blijkt de verhouding tussen de benaderingen niet in balans te zijn. De medische benadering is namelijk nog steeds een dominant perspectief op televisie. Daarnaast krijgt ook de kwaliteit-van-levenbenadering veel aandacht. Dit is in mindere mate het geval bij de andere gezondheidsbenaderingen. Voorts is een duidelijke verschuiving richting de patiënt waarneembaar binnen alle gezondheidsbenaderingen. De patiënt krijgt een grotere rol binnen de televisieprogramma’s en de mogelijkheid om in te gaan op zijn of haar belevingen en ervaringen met de ziekte of medische behandeling. Er wordt een podium geboden voor het laten zien van emoties. Mogelijk spelen nieuwe mediatechnieken, zoals het invoegen van vlogs en het gebruikmaken van hoofdcamera’s in de televisieprogramma’s, een rol in deze verschuiving, omdat de kijker op die manier dichterbij de hoofdpersoon kan komen.","['media', 'cultuur', 'gezondheidsbenaderingen', 'televisieprogramma’s', 'NPO', 'framing', 'agenda-setting', 'gezondheid', 'ziekte', 'dood']"
"Examining parental sharing behavior on Instagram - 
An experimental study measuring the effect of emotions and colors on the sharing behavior of Dutch parents towards their children between the ages of 6 and 12",Vincent Mosmans,2018-06-21,['Nicoleta Bălău'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Along with the transition from the static stage of Web 1.0 to the interactive Web 2.0 stage, children become increasingly represented in the online environment. However, as the minimum age to use social media is still 13, children below the age of 13 are highly dependent on their parents when it comes to their access to social media content. Existing literature claims that colors and emotions have always affected human sharing behavior prior to the age of social media: indeed, positive emotions and colored images tend to be shared more often. This study aimed to examine whether these findings hold for parental sharing behavior on Instagram as well, with the objective to find out in which ways children below the age of 13 could be reached best on the online platform. The main research question of this study was ‘To what extent do emotions and colors on Instagram affect the sharing behavior of parents towards their children between the ages of 6 and 12?’ To answer this research question, a quantitative study with an online experiment was conducted using a 2 (positive vs. negative emotions) by 2 (colored vs. black and white images) between-subjects design. The survey was completed by 211 participants (N = 211), who were equally divided over the four experimental groups. Surprisingly and in stark contrast with existing literature, findings showed that emotions and colors did not have a significant effect on both online and offline parental sharing behavior. Additionally, an interaction effect between positive emotions and black and white Instagram images was found, as well as an interaction effect between negative emotions and colored Instagram images. The contradicting results could be caused by the fact that this study had an extremely specific target group, namely Dutch parents with children between the ages of 6 and 12, whereas existing studies used a broad target group and were conducted with a more global mindset. It can thus be concluded that when it comes to Dutch parents with children between the ages of 6 and 12, emotions and color use do not affect the sharing behavior of Instagram content towards their children.","['media', 'business', 'Offline/online parental sharing behavior', 'Social media', 'Instagram', 'Color', 'Emotions']"
"Millennials, Media and Luxury Brands: The Role of Indulgence as a Cultural Dimension on the Brand Recall, Brand Attitude and Purchase Intention of Luxury Brands Featured in the Product Placement of Popular Online Music Videos",Clarissa Spiekerman-Roberts,2018-06-20,['Dr. Petra Tenbült'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","3
Abstract
Nowadays, product placement is increasingly employed in modern media technologies with the aim of targeting global audiences. However, product placement messages may not appeal to all cultures equally, as culture is a complex construct, and is the primary reason why consumer behavior differs across countries. Still, it is frequently debated whether or not it is more effective to target advertising messages according to culture, or whether it is more effective to standardize advertising across cultures. An increasing amount of research suggests that businesses should take cultural differences into consideration when creating advertising messages.
A popular model used in cross-cultural research, which is used to measure cultural differences, is Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, and one of the most recent and least researched dimensions is the indulgence dimension. In order to assess how a cultural dimension can potentially influence the way individuals are affected by product placement, the primary objective of this research was; to discover how the indulgence level of millennials influences their brand recall, their purchase intention and their brand attitude of luxury brands featured in the product placements of online music videos. An additional aim was to assess whether the Netherlands, Turkey and Bulgaria were statistically different in their mean scores of the indulgence dimension to compare the scores of an indulgent, neutral and restrained country, and assess whether these scores reflect the scores provided by Hofstede. Finally, this research analyzed whether different countries (the Netherlands, Turkey & Bulgaria) vary in; their ability to recall brands, their purchase intention and their brand attitude, to better understand how different countries (with varying levels of indulgence) react to product placement. For this research, a quantitative survey was conducted.
It was found that the extent of indulgence negatively influences millennials’ ability to recall luxury brands in popular Hip-Hop/R&B music videos, and positively influences millennials brand attitude of luxury brands in Hip-Hop/R&B music videos. The findings also suggest that the extent of indulgence does not influence millennials’ purchase intention. Furthermore, the findings demonstrated that the Netherlands, Turkey and Bulgaria were statistically different in their mean scores of the indulgence dimension, but while there was a significant difference between the Netherlands and Bulgaria, and Turkey and Bulgaria, no significant difference was found between the Netherlands and Turkey. Lastly, this research has shown that the three countries vary in their brand recall, brand attitude and purchase intention when shown product placement messages of luxury brands featured within online music videos. Bulgarian millennials recalled more luxury brands compared to Dutch and Turkish millennials, Turkish millennials had a higher intent to purchase in comparison to Dutch millennials, and Turkish millennials had a higher brand attitude compared to Bulgarian millennials.
This research has made it apparent that it may be more effective to target advertising messages according to culture, in comparison to standardizing advertising messages across cultures. Also, this research demonstrated that an important direction for future research is to reassess Hofstede’s cultural dimensions as some of the findings did not accurately reflect what was predicted by the model.","['media', 'business', 'product placement', 'indulgence', 'brand recall', 'brand attitude', 'purchase intention']"
"Reactionary sentiment - 
An Uber and Samsung sentiment analysis of situational crisis management",Jan Thurm,2018-06-20,['Ju-Sung (Jay) Lee'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Corporate reputation plays in integral role for businesses when it comes to distinguishing themselves from their competition, as well as the continued value creation for all involved stakeholders. Additionally, corporate reputation is an assessment of how stakeholders perceive a company by means of communication and actions of the firm. There has been extensive amount of research on the effect of a single crisis on corporate reputation, however research conducted on multiple crises and their effects on corporate reputation is scarce. This research aims to fill the gap in literature by employing sentiment analyses to find out how the public perceives a company and how this sentiment is impacted by a corporate crisis. By looking at sentiment levels in tweets from stakeholders of both Uber and Samsung at various points in time, this research employed a quantitative approach in conjunction with several quantitative analyses in order to answer the proposed research question. Uber and Samsung have been chosen for this research due to the fact that both have been facing a multiplicity of large crises during the last several years. The addition that one company has a high corporate reputation and the other one not gives another dimension to this study. Additionally, this research aimed at understanding how a company’s response would influence the sentiment, how public sentiment towards a company would be affected by multiple crises, as well as the importance of corporate reputation on all of this. The findings show that there is a variation in how long it takes for a company to recover from a crisis, as well as that multiple crises of the same company have a detrimental negative effect on positive sentiment, especially for companies in a slow-paced industry. Companies with a high pre-crisis reputation are impacted longer by the repercussions of a crisis, seeing as customers are not used to having to deal with a crisis in the first place. Furthermore, a statement on the situation of the crisis by a company can have a positive effect on the restoration of positive sentiment, however it also has the potential to work against the company.","['media', 'business', 'Corporate crisis', 'Sentiment', 'Corporate reputation', 'Samsung', 'Uber']"
"Vrouwen in een mannenwereld
De betekenisgeving van Nederlandse voetbal-mediaprofessionals aan gender en vrouwenvoetbal in het productieproces",,2018-06-20,,"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Dit onderzoek is een aanvulling op eerder onderzoek naar de relatie tussen sportverslaggeving en gender, met de focus op vrouwenvoetbal in het jaar na het succesvolle EK 2017. Eerder onderzoek bestaat voornamelijk uit inhoudsanalyses. Uit deze inhoudsanalyses is gebleken dat vrouwensport significant minder aandacht krijgt in de media dan mannensport. Wanneer vrouwensport wel de aandacht krijgt, laat eerder onderzoek zien dat dit vaak gepaard gaat met genderstereotyperingen terwijl dit bij mannensport niet of nauwelijks het geval is. Vrouwen worden als fysiek minder sterk, emotioneler, afhankelijk van mannen of seksueel aantrekkelijk neergezet in de verslaggeving. Daarnaast liet eerder onderzoek zien dat vrouwenvoetbal als minderwaardig werd gezien en zelfs niet als topsport. Dit onderzoek focust zich op hoe Nederlandse voetbal-mediaprofessionals zelf betekenisgeven aan gender en vrouwenvoetbal in het productieproces, en hiermee ook het gebruik van stereotyperingen in de verslaggeving. Doordat dit onderzoek zich focust op het productieproces, is het een relevante aanvulling op bestaand onderzoek. Aangezien hier nauwelijks  recent onderzoek naar gedaan is kan deze studie nieuwe inzichten bieden in het bestaande onderzoeksveld naar dit onderwerp. Voor dit onderzoek zijn er tien interviews met voetbal-mediaprofessionals afgenomen, die vervolgens thematisch geanalyseerd zijn. Uit de analyse zijn drie hoofdthema’s naar voren gekomen: ‘Routines in het productieproces’, ‘Diversiteit op redacties’ en ‘Betekenisgeving aan vrouwenvoetbal’. Hieruit is gebleken dat door de tijdsdruk die de voetbal-mediaprofessionals ervaren en de machocultuur die heerst op sportredacties genderstereotyperingen nog steeds voorkomen. Tevens is dit ook de reden waarom er weinig tot geen reflectie over dit thema plaatsvindt op redacties. Mannelijke journalisten vinden zichzelf over het algemeen genderneutraal en zien daardoor niet de noodzaak om hierop te reflecteren. Uit de interviews is gebleken dat de respondenten hier de noodzaak inderdaad niet van inzien en de hand niet in eigen boezem steken voor het nog steeds aanwezig zijn van genderstereotyperingen. De respondenten stellen dat ze de machocultuur niet snel zien veranderen door het gebrek aan vrouwelijke sportjournalisten, waardoor de huidige status quo behouden blijft. Verder is gebleken uit de interviews dat mannenvoetbal nog steeds de norm is. Door de heersende machocultuur zal het vrouwenvoetbal voorlopig onderbelicht blijven en de huidige vorm van verslaggeving bestaan. Huidig onderzoek toont echter wel aan, in tegenstelling tot voorgaand onderzoek, dat de aandacht voor vrouwenvoetbal een ontwikkeling heeft gemaakt en inmiddels als topsport wordt beschouwd en daardoor langzamerhand een plek begint te veroveren op de sportradar.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Gender', 'stereotyperingen', 'routines', 'voetbal-mediaprofessionals', 'kwalitatief onderzoek']"
"Social Code: YouTube
Kinderen over reclametransparantie in YouTube-video’s",E. López,2018-06-20,['P. Nikken'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Onbewust hebben YouTubers invloed op het (koop)gedrag en de algemene houding van jonge kinderen rond de tien tot twaalf jaar. Het Commissariaat voor de Media vindt dat hier verandering in moet komen en heeft daarom de Social Code: YouTube (SCYT) opgericht met bekende Nederlandse YouTubers. Kinderen hebben meer begeleiding nodig op gebied van verwerkte reclame in YouTube-video’s en de SCYT zou hen hierbij moeten helpen. Het is echter niet verplicht voor een YouTuber om zich bij de SCYT aan te sluiten omdat de wetgeving voor reclametransparantie nog niet in Nederland is doorgevoerd. Dit onderzoek richt zich op het optimaliseren van deze code ter voorbereiding op de opkomende wetgeving. De belangen van de jonge kijker en de bekende YouTubers staan in dit onderzoek centraal; de manier waarop de kinderen op richtlijnen van de SCYT reageren is geanalyseerd aan de hand van focusgroepen.
In totaal zijn er vier jongensfocusgroepen en vier meisjesfocusgroepen gehouden met ieder vier participanten. Hieruit is naar voren gekomen dat veel kinderen bekend waren met betaalde samenwerkingsvideo’s van YouTubers, het onderscheiden van ‘niet gesponsorde’ video’s van wel gesponsorde video’s vonden zij echter lastig. De kinderen vinden het niet belangrijk om op de hoogte te worden gesteld van betaalde samenwerkingen omdat het hen om de inhoud van de video gaat, sponsoring maakt de video niet minder aantrekkelijk. De analyse liet duidelijk zien dat kinderen van tien tot en met twaalf jaar beter geïnformeerd moeten worden over de mogelijke gevolgen van reclame; de SCYT kan kinderen attenderen op reclame-inhoud maar kan hen hier geen les over geven. De ouders en de school spelen daarom een belangrijke rol als het gaat om de jonge kinderen hierover te informeren, deze partijen zouden zich daarom moeten inzetten voor medialessen over mediawijsheid onder deze doelgroep.
Het advies dat voortkomt uit dit onderzoek is dat de huidige richtlijnen van de SCYT in de praktijk niet effectief blijken te zijn. Kinderen hebben een eigen manier van YouTube-video’s kijken ontwikkeld en gebruiken dit platform veelal uit verveling. De sponsorvermelding kan daarom het beste verwerkt worden in de YouTube video zelf opdat het kind deze vermelding verplicht moet accepteren. Het kind dient daarnaast niet verward te worden met verschillende manieren van sponsorvermeldingen, het is van belang dat de SCYT één manier van sponsorvermelding hanteert; dit gedijt duidelijkheid voor zowel de kijker als de YouTuber(s).","['media', 'cultuur', 'Reclame', 'YouTube', 'Social Code YouTube', 'Kinderen', 'Focusgroepen', 'Mediawijsheid']"

Towards a cultural explanation of political non-participation in citizens’ initiatives: Feelings of entitlement and a ‘taste for politics’,V. Visser,2018-06-18,"['J. van der Waal', 'W. de Koster']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research explores the relevance of a cultural explanation for the well-established pattern that less educated citizens participate less in citizens’ initiatives. Prevailing theories explain this pattern by focussing on a lack of time, money, cognitive sophistication and social capital. However, Bourdieu’s seminal work suggests that the cultural dimensions of feelings of entitlement and a ‘taste for politics’ may also be relevant. Based on 13 in-depth interviews with less educated citizens living in Rotterdam, I scrutinize the two dimensions. The results show that people feel less entitled to participate when they experience stigma and perceive that they lack mastery of the culturally legitimate knowledge and language. A ‘taste for politics’ has three subdimensions: a disdain or dislike of red tape, a disdain or lack of affinity with government officials because they are perceived to come from a different milieu and a disapproval of politics as power play. These aspects can restrain but also – against expectations – induce participation. The (sub)dimensions occur in different combinations, forming four ideal types of (non-)participation among less educated citizens. From the construction of these ideal types important theoretical implications follow. First, they demonstrate that a cultural explanation is relevant in explaining (non-)participation in citizens’ initiatives. Moreover, they indicate that feelings of entitlement and a ‘taste for politics’ are not only analytically distinct, but also empirically different. My research must therefore be seen as a call to disentangle the two mechanisms. I conclude my paper with recommendations for policy.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'Political participation', 'citizens’ initiatives', 'cultural capital', 'feelings', 'of entitlement', 'taste for politics']"
"Co-innovating the generative future - 
How media organizations can sustain a competitive advantage in the dynamic digital media
landscape",Alexander Baanen,2018-06-15,['Matthijs Leendertse'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Technological advances and digitization have significantly changed the media landscape,
creating the need for continuous innovation to sustain a competitive advantage in the
dynamic, fast-paced digital media landscape. It was suggested that to maximize the
possibilities in the digital media landscape, new digital innovations need to be generative, so
that they can be used to create value. In developing generative innovations, it is important
that the five dimensions that delineate generativity are implemented in the innovation. More
specifically, these five dimensions pertain to: adaptability, capacity of leverage, accessibility,
transferability, and ease of mastery. However, it was found that a single organization’s
resources are often too limited to satisfy the need for continuous innovation since they either
lack finances, or knowledge capabilities, or resources. This can be solved by opening up the
organization’s innovation department, and employ a model of open innovation. More
specifically, a model of co-innovation. For this, there were two main components that need
to be satisfied for successful co-innovation: co-innovation collaborations through strategic
partnerships, and the media innovation process. The problem however, is that little was
known about how these co-innovative collaborations function in the digital media landscape,
as well as how innovations can be made generative in the media innovation process. Hence,
by carrying out 10 expert interviews, this study tried to answer the question on how media
organizations can leverage strategic partnerships to co-innovate generative innovations. A
thematic analysis was conducted according to themes that were derived from the literature,
with strategic partnerships and the media innovation process as the main themes. The
findings of the thematic analysis suggest that there are six main success factors that
constitute what is needed for media organizations to leverage strategic partnerships to coinnovate
generative innovations. These six factors were: organizational alignment, creating
the right team, co-designing the co-innovation project, continuous interactivity, continuous
validation, and continuous optimization, including the optimization for the five dimensions
that delineate generativity to ensure the innovation can be made generative. The key
findings of this research add to co-innovation literature not only by substantiating what was
already known, but also by illustrating how key success factors in the strategic partnership
process as well as the media innovation process work and how they need to be approached,
rather than just focusing on the why and what of the topic.","['media', 'business', 'Co-innovation', 'Strategic collaborations', 'Continuous innovation', 'Media', 'innovation process', 'Generativity']"
"The influence of the popularity of an unboxing video on the perceived credibility of the source, the perceived usefulness of the information and the purchase intention",Panagiotis Tzeremes,2018-06-15,['Alex Gekker'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","We live in an era, in which social media platforms, such as YouTube, provide their users with new ways to communicate with each other and share information. If we take a closer look at the various YouTube channels, we will see that online reviews and unboxing videos are quite popular, especially the videos that present technological goods, such as mobile devices, because these products are essential in our lives. The aim of this study is to investigate if a popular unboxing video affects more positively the perceived credibility of the source, the usefulness of the information in the video and the purchase intention compared to an unboxing video, which is not regarded as popular. Unboxing videos seem particularly interesting for this research, since they purport to present the product “as-is” and emulate the effective elements of purchasing – and opening – a new product. Therefore, the question of popularity, in this case, goes beyond the reviewer’s expertise and the reason for focusing specifically on YouTube is because it has not been examined extensively in previous research on the effect of the popularity of the source on the purchase intention.
In order to explore our research questions, we conducted an online experiment, accompanied by a survey. In this experiment, we divided randomly the participants into three groups and we provided them with the same video, but with different numbers of views, subscribers and likes. Our results showed that a popular video review on YouTube affects positively all the dependent variables that we examined with our methodology. Users take into consideration other users’ interactions and they evaluate the YouTubers accordingly. In addition, users are influenced not only by the product related information, but also by the popularity of the source. Therefore, corporations and individuals who are using YouTube for marketing and advertising purposes should take into consideration all these parameters if they are looking for efficient ways in order to promote effectively their products or services.","['media', 'business', 'Unboxing videos', 'engagement metrics', 'credibility of the source', 'usefulness of the information', 'purchase intention']"
The evolution of CSR Communication in the Oil Industry: Insights from The Royal Dutch/Shell,Lavinia Rossi,2018-06-15,['Vidhi A. Chaudhri'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The concept of corporate social responsibility has increased in importance over the years, because of the pressures from the society which sees corporations as having an obligation to do more than just make profits. To be more transparent towards their stakeholders, companies everywhere have started diffusing CSR reports, which aim to communicate the various initiatives to which they take part to. However, there are certain companies which face particular challenges when communicating their CSR initiatives, because they are seen with suspicion by stakeholders. These are those businesses which belong to controversial sectors, such as the alcohol, tobacco and oil ones. The latter provide the context for this thesis, which examines the annual sustainability reports of one oil company, the Royal Dutch/Shell, an interesting corporation to analyze because of its size and its long history in CSR reporting.
The aim of this research is to approach the problem of CSR communication and legitimation in Shell, by looking at the changes in its reporting practices over the years.
Thus, this thesis uses a longitudinal approach and analyses the totality of the company’s CSR reports belonging to a time frame of 19 years. By examining the reports, the following questions will be addressed: (1) how has the framing of CSR motivation in Shell’s annual CSR reports changed over time, (2) how have the characteristics of Shell’s CSR strategies and practices developed in time and (3) how has Shell evolved its communication strategies in order to legitimize its CSR initiatives and increase the effectiveness of its CSR communication over the years?
This paper builds on existing studies on the topic, but tries to bridge the gaps in the literature for future research and application.","['media', 'business', 'controversial industries', 'corporate social responsibility', 'CSR', 'oil industry', 'Shell', 'sustainability reports']"
"Refugees in the Digital Age:
Investigating Refugees’ Perceptions regarding Digital Privacy on Social Media Platforms",Ilias Athanasiadis,2018-06-15,['Payal Arora'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In recent years, thousands of people prominently coming from Middle East, forced to leave their home countries and move to Europe in order to escape from the ongoing violence and conflicts in their region, and at the same time to protect themselves and their families. It is quite well known nowadays that this refugee crisis that Europe witnesses is considered to be the biggest refugee crisis after the World War II. According to migration literature, digital technologies are an essential tool for refugees not only to overcome numerous obstacles they might face during their resettlement, but also to maintain ties with their country of origin. In this context, this research explores refugees’ perceptions on digital privacy when using these technologies in the Netherlands. The censorship and the violations of personal privacy that these people have experienced or witnessed by the local authorities in their home states, raise questions regarding their present digital behaviour; how they use these technologies, if, and how, they manage to protect their personal privacy. Great attention was given by the academia to the relationship between the digital technologies and refugees in a more practical way. The current literature focuses on how new technologies facilitate refugees’ resettlement and integration into the host society. Less emphasis has been placed on refugees’ notions regarding their digital privacy when using them. Therefore, this thesis examines refugees’ perceptions and experiences through interviews referring to the digital privacy.
A total amount of ten in-depth interviews were conducted with refugees who are currently residing in the Netherlands. The qualitative content analysis by in-depth face-to-face interviews was considered to be the most suitable method of answering the research question of this thesis as it examines individual’s experiences, feelings, notions and behaviours. The thematic analysis revealed five themes which explain refugees’ digital behaviour and perceptions regarding privacy: (1) the use of digital technologies, (2) refugees’ perceptions of integration, (3) datafication, (4) digital privacy and trust, and (5) privacy management and protection. These themes depict the way refugees use new technologies in their everyday life and how it has been influenced by the various privacy protection strategies that individuals have adapted in order to protect their privacy. Furthermore, this thesis provides a critical evaluation of its limitations and offers few suggestions for further research in order to gain a better understanding of the issue.","['media', 'business', 'Refugee crisis', 'Integration', 'Privacy and trust', 'Digital technologies', 'Social media', 'Datafication', 'Privacy protection']"
"The case of gender diversity in the Dutch workforce - 
From the perspective of women professionals",Laura Reijm,2018-06-15,['Vidhi A. Chaudhri'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Women increasingly take part in the workforce, however the numbers of women in management and top positions lag behind. Several initiatives and solutions were presented in recent years, yet this has not proven to be successful. Therefore, in-depth interviews were held with female professionals from the Dutch workforce in order to get an understanding of their experience with gender diversity in the workforce. The interviewees, whose careers are high on their list of priorities, argued they do not feel restrained in making a career within the organization in which they work. They believe that the only thing that stops women from making a career is themselves, in which organisations and media only have a minor role to play. However previous research argues that gender diversity is dependent on the government, organisations or media, this study shows that all aspects are intertwined, together with the societal mind-set. The topic of gender diversity needs to be addressed from different sides and is not purely a women’s or organizational issue and that is what makes the subject so challenging.","['media', 'business', 'Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Gender Diversity', 'Dutch Workforce', 'Women Professionals', 'Work and Life Balance']"
"Influencer Marketing and Luxury - 
Defining luxury branding through visuals on Instagram",Janet (Jen) Ingrid,2018-06-15,['Teresa de la Hera'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Luxury has, conventionally, been an industry that targets privileged consumers in terms of wealth and social status. The growing importance of social media platforms have, however, caused luxury to become democratized. These platforms have made luxury more accessible to ‘regular’ consumers in the sense that the concept of luxury has become more reachable for a broader group of consumers, who may be potential buyers. Luxury brands are, therefore, slowly adopting social media marketing strategies, especially collaborating with social media influencers who serve as an important and trustworthy mediating party between high-end brands and ‘common’ consumers. This is essentially because the brand-consumer interaction can still be quite complex and therefore, influencers work to ameliorate the relationship between brands and their (expanded) target audiences. The fact that luxury products are expensive and mostly the wealthy consumer can afford to purchase them, though, means that luxury brands need to find ways to engage with and hold the attention of the less affluent consumer. This is important because the latter type of consumer has the potential to become future buyers if, for instance, their income increases. This means that luxury brands must design their marketing strategies in such a way that makes their products attractive for a diverse target audience by creating great brand experiences for them. The democratization of the luxury industry has also enabled consumers to newly define luxury through a visualization platform. As such, this research qualitatively explores how two luxury influencers, who serve as executers of luxury brands’ progressive social media marketing strategies, define and communicate the concept of luxury branding through visualizations on Instagram to target and attract more, diverse consumers. This is done through content analysis of luxury cars and luxury jewelry (particularly watches) posts. The theoretical framework of this thesis consists of important theoretical concepts including two types of influence that influencers exert, cultural values such as individualism, collectivism, and gender, as well as values pertaining to the dichotomy between exclusivity and ubiquity. These concepts were helpful to analyze the practices of the influencers in terms of (re-)defining luxury branding by means of visual posts. This research found that the influencers, indeed, embed such values that can attract both the conventional type of consumer, namely those of the higher classes, and the progressive type of consumer, namely those of the lower classes. The findings of this research, then, add knowledge to Instagram influencer marketing in relation to luxury branding, which is a relatively new research topic.","['media', 'business', 'social media influencers', 'democratization', 'luxury branding', 'Instagram', 'influencer marketing']"
"Who cares about diversity? - 
Effects of organizational diversity communication on organizational attractiveness and person-organization fit",Tessa Boon,2018-06-15,['Joep Hofhuis'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The increasingly diverse composition of the Dutch society challenges organizations to develop diversity approaches and to manage diversity in the workplace. If managed well, diversity in the workplace can have a multitude of beneficial effects, referring to both improved employee and corporate performance. Despite various governmental and corporate efforts, many Dutch organizations are still characterized by a lack of diversity, being dominated by the cultural majority. A possible explanation for this lack of diversity is that organizations that are dominated by a cultural majority tend to attract job applicants that are similar to this group. Organizational communication about diversity can play a role in attracting a diverse group of job applicants, as the diversity perspective (colorblindness or multiculturalism) used in job advertisements can be considered a filter for the type of job seeker that responds to the advertisement. The objective of this study is to examine whether job seekers’ personal characteristics play a role in their assessment of different organizational diversity approaches. More specifically, it is researched whether ethnicity, gender, social dominance orientation, and need to belong moderate the relationship between colorblind or multicultural organizational diversity statements in job advertisements and job seekers’ assessment of the attractiveness of the organization and perceived person-organization fit.
In order to study whether the two organizational diversity communication approaches attract different types of job seekers, an online survey experiment with a between-subjects design was conducted. The experiment consisted of three conditions in which participants were asked to look at one extract of a job vacancy of a fictitious organization, either without diversity statements, with colorblind diversity statements, or containing multicultural diversity statements. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the conditions. The experimental results, based on data obtained from 153 respondents, suggest that for this particular sample, in this specific context of job advertisements, including colorblind or multicultural diversity statements does not drive away or attract certain types of people. Ethnicity, gender, social dominance orientation and need to belong do not moderate the effect of diversity communication on job seekers’ assessment of an organization. Results of the study imply that the diversity perspective communicated in job advertisements actually may not be a crucial factor in attracting a diverse applicant pool. The study contributes to the limited amount of research on job seekers’ assessment of organizations based on diversity communication in job advertisements and the moderating effect of job seekers’ personal characteristics on this relationship. The results suggest that more research concerning increasing diversity in the workplace is required, as it continues to be an important and contemporary topic in our diversifying society.","['media', 'business', 'Diversity communication', 'job advertisements', 'multiculturalism', 'colorblindness', 'organizational attractiveness', 'person-organization fit']"
"Behind the Music:
How Labor Changed for Musicians through the Subscription Economy",Saskia Mühlbach,2018-06-15,['Payal Arora'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the last decade, many musicians have taken to digital platforms to share their music.
The provision of users with low or no cost access to vast libraries of music initiated a decrease
of the role of middlemen in the industry, such as record labels. This development
comes with certain advantages for artists, but at the same time, they can no longer rely on
revenue generated solely by their music, due to the pay-back model of these platforms.
There is growing evidence of exploitation of the creative workers in the subscription economy.
While the perspectives of music platforms, as well as record labels, have been covered
extensively, the artist perspective is alarmingly sparse. We know little of musician's new
forms of labor that enable them to capitalize on streaming services.
Hence, this paper examines how the labor of artists in the music industry changed
through the rise of streaming platforms, specifically in the context of Germany, the fourth
largest music market in the world. To date, little research exists regarding the German music
market and its digital growth. If we want to investigate the global implications of the subscription
economy, it is essential to move beyond the usual suspects of the United States
and the UK as chosen contexts for research.
In this research, a qualitative analysis of the contemporary German music market from
the artist perspective was carried out. In the course of this, thirteen semi-structured indepth
interviews with German musicians were conducted to investigate how their labor
changed due to the rise of streaming platforms. The findings show that artists no longer perceive
their music as a product, but as a marketing tool for their brand. Further, the gradual
elimination of the album as an artistic element and the enormous competition caused by
subscription services pressures artists to produce solely hit singles. Other than that, the creative
process is not extensively impacted through the datafication, facilitated through subscription
services. The non-creative process and the perception of music as a commodity has
changed tremendously. Thereby, artists leverage on the data that platforms provide to support
their non-creative tasks. Further, new intermediaries in the market have emerged in the
form of digital distributors, which enable artists to share their music for a small fee on all
available digital platforms. Through the increased amount of time which is needed for noncreative
tasks, the wish for an even broader intermediary network becomes obvious. It can
be questioned whether this provides artists with more creative freedom or if they find themselves
in an even more exploitive and precarious position. As expected, the perceptions of
artists regarding their platform labor are double-edged. While they perceive a big pleasure
and satisfaction through their work, they get burdened with new non-creative laboring due
to these rising subscription services.
To conclude, this paper adds to the conversations on the globalization of music platform’s
labor and provides a basis for comparative analyses with other markets. It serves to
reimagine the intersection between creativity and digital labor in the German music subscription
industry and challenges current understandings on intermediaries in the music industry.","['media', 'business', 'Subscription Economy', 'Music Industry', 'Platformization', 'Cultural Labor', 'Creative', 'Labor']"
"Alexa, Start My Day - 
The Experience of Integrating Voice-Activated Personal Assistants in Home Environments",Kristin Wohlmacher,2018-06-15,['Jason Pridmore'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Voice-activated personal assistants in the form of smart speakers have become one of
the most impactful technologies that may significantly alter people’s everyday life. The thesis
researches how users experience the integration of this emerging technology in their home
environments while investigating into the perceived usefulness of the device and the
emotional processing behind the usage of the voice interface. For this, a mixed method
approach of combining an autoethnography and in-depth interviews was used. Out of this,
three major themes came up that are linked to each other through the uniqueness of the voice
interface.
First, the users are adopting through a conscious habituation and modification process
the personal assistant into their everyday life. Especially for simple and repeated practices that
are short, spontaneous and easy to conduct, the integration of personal assistants was
perceived as particularly useful.
Second, the usage of the personal assistant as a new technology is a highly emotional
process. Depending on users’ characteristics, which determine their belonging to either the
group of early adopters or early majority, they experience different levels of playfulness and
curiosity. Although these feelings decreased for all interviewees over time, the joy of using
the personal assistant declined faster for users with a more superficial usage of just the basic
functionalities compared to more technological affine users. Besides this involvement, a
bonding relationship is created through the sensitivity of people towards voice. Interviewees
started automatically to apply social rules to the personal assistant. This treatment of the
device is connected to the concept of anthropomorphism which follows into the phenomenon
of media equation where people unintentionally react to technologies as they would do to
other interaction humans. In doing so, they even ascribe social rules to the device which
intensifies the human-computer interaction even more. These two findings are connected to
each other in the process of mutual shaping between the personal assistants and the users.
Third, with the placement of the personal assistant in private home environments and
the emotional bonding, the perception of privacy issues has to be differentiated between
II
personal private and institutional privacy. While data collection and further usage from
suppliers are hard to imagine for users, they are less concerned about a possible loss of
privacy. Because of this low level of privacy literacy about how suppliers and third parties are
using their data, they are also not taking any actions to secure them. On the contrary, users are
more concerned about their privacy when the device is speaking without being asked. They
perceive it as a direct intrusion into their social privacy which follows into a direct reaction of
privacy protection. This concrete threat towards the device itself rather than in the supplier is
grounded in the humanization of the personal assistant as it feels like another person that is
suddenly disrupting private situations.","['media', 'business', 'Mutual shaping', 'media equation', 'voice-activated personal assistants', 'human-computer interaction', 'privacy awareness']"
"MANAGING THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE BROADCASTING INDUSTRY WITH BIG DATA - 
BIG DATA’S IMPACT ON CONTENT IN THE DUTCH BROADCASTING INDUSTRY",Laura Bäck,2018-06-15,['Erik Hitters'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Due to technological advances, the global broadcasting industry is in the midst of a digital
transformation. The factors that caused it, changing consumer behavior, the diversification of
communication channels, and new market entrants, have threatened traditional players in
their existence. For their fight for survival in this insecure environment, big data offer remedy:
They present predictability and stability and presumably shine the light through an
impenetrable world that is taken over by companies that do not consist of creativity but
technology. To defy those tech giants, traditional broadcasting companies do not only
develop digital products and new business models that revolve around data, they also lean
towards big data analytics to see how they can differentiate themselves from their new
competitors in terms of content.
With Netflix setting first examples, the implications of data-driven content for creativity
have been discussed fiercely within the industry. Academics, however, rather point out the
limitations of big data analytics, such as possible biases, and their cultural implications. Yet,
little has been said about current and future possibilities of data-driven content. Furthermore,
not much knowledge exists about how big data change organizational processes within
media companies and production processes of creative products. Therefore, this work
researches the Dutch broadcasting industry’s application of big data for decision-making
about content and answers the question how companies in the Dutch TV broadcasting
industry use data and what are their intentions are regarding its possible application for
content. 16 interviews with media experts in the field of data, production and decision
making were conducted and served as the basis for a latent thematic analysis.
The findings draw a detailed picture of current developments and suggest that big
data analytics are seen as the solution for the industry’s struggle and perceived as highly
beneficial for content. While the research revealed different levels of big data application for
content between public and commercial broadcasters, the overall adoption of big data for
content remains low and suggests a non-intrusive usage of big data analytics that traces
back to isomorphic tendencies. The little interference of big data with creative processes as
currently prevalent in the market shows the resistance of the required fundamental change.
The main reason for this was detected to be a lack of managerial vision and skill sets to
change existing routines and make data actionable. Overall, the development of a clear
direction and strategic approach of traditional players within the broadcasting market is yet to
come.","['media', 'business', 'big data', 'broadcasting', 'content', 'data-driven', 'digital transformation']"
"Modern parents, dangers of advertising and children:
A qualitative study on the dangers of advertising targeted at children",Jovan Djukanovic,2018-06-15,['Jeroen Jansz'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","With the advancement of technology it is important to consider the societal changes that come with it. One of those changes is the way marketeers advertise their content. These changes primarily affect the newer generations, as they are the most susceptible to them. Children are who needs the most protection from these changes as the findings of Van Schaik, Chatterton and Croxon (2016) indicated there is no proper legislation for advertising to children through mobile phones. The study was a qualitative analysis that interviewed 10 parents who talked about the effects of advertising on children aged 7 to 12. The research investigated the advertising content targeted at children in Montenegro, a small country that recently joined NATO and is currently aiming to join the EU. This country is undergoing a lot of different changes, so this research aimed to provide support for advertising regulation targeted at children. The results of the research indicated an unexpected finding, which was the effects of the social norm. The social norm factor appeared to affect the parents’ thoughts on advertising as some of their ideas and adjustments to raising a child were based on it. They all agreed about the effects of advertising and were not pleased about the negative outcomes, however, they did not expect regulation to solve the issue, but instead adapted to the changes themselves. This was interesting to see as the social norm factor here was that they wanted the children to be exposed to a certain amount of advertising content as, as they explained, they would eventually be exposed to it. They thought that restriction in itself is a potential danger to the child and they felt that active discussion with the child combined with minor restrictions was the best way to raise a child. The research found that the “social norm” factor had a big effect on the parents decision making and usage of the two types of mediation, namely, active and restrictive mediation (Valkenburg et al., 2013).","['media', 'business', 'advertising', 'children', 'parenthood', 'parental mediation', 'social norms']"
"How a fitness tracker changed my life -  Data, technology and identity in personal blogs",Kayleigh Noordijk,2018-06-15,['Jason Pridmore'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Self-tracking is a phenomenon that is increasingly accessible and accepted in today’s digitized world. Smartphones and wearable devices allow us to capture quantitative self-representation in tables, graphs and numbers. Along with written and visual digital self-representations, they have come to shape an extension of the self. This research observes from the perspective of Foucault’s technologies of the self how both blogging and self-tracking practices are used to construct a digital extension of identity. The main research question answered is “how is self-quantification integrated into digital self-representations of personal bloggers?”. To answer this, a sample of 50 personal blog posts, in which bloggers describe their experience with self-tracking, was subjected to a qualitative content analysis using a grounded theory approach. Two primary overarching themes were found in the blog posts. The first is the presentation of the self, which shows that the digital representation of the self in personal blogs is like a bricolage made up of the bloggers’ self-disclosure, what is assumed of the reader and the commercial forces in the blogosphere. The second is reflexive self-analysis, which shows us the practice of self-tracking is grounded in a cultural idealization of self-improvement, but can lead to disembodiment. There is a tension between self-tracking devices being experienced as either a controlling structure that represents an alternate version of embodied reality, or as a tool to obtain empowering insights into lived reality. The human tendency to actively work on a construction of self long predates our digital era of blogs, social media and wearable self-tracking devices. However, the integration of these technologies into our everyday lives continue to change the dynamics of how we digitally construct identity. This research connects to the modern perspective of the self as a direct reflection of our moral decision-making, behavior and actions. If it seen as our moral responsibility to perfect the aspects of self that we have any control over, today that responsibility overarches both the physical body and the digital representation of the self. This is further amplified by the data doxa, the cultural belief that the data-driven technological tools such as self-tracking devices available to us are helpful or even necessary in our quest for self-actualization. With an increased cultural, moral, social and economic pressure to optimize the self, Foucault’s conceptualization of technologies of the self has become more relevant than ever.","['media', 'business', 'The quantified self', 'self-tracking', 'blogs', 'digitizing identity', 'extension of self']"
"The Power of Words - 
Leadership communication in practice",Katerina-Ralitsa Georgieva Komova,2018-06-15,['Vidhi Chaudhri'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the past two years, leadership communication as a way of expressing the views of corporate leaders has become more visible for the audiences. This was made by a number of open letters published by the founders, presidents, and CEOs of companies around the globe. Open letters are not an innovative or unusual way of leaders to express their point of view in front of a wider public. However, from 2016 onwards, an interesting trend is observed. Corporate leaders started to raise their voices about controversies that concern the society. They did this in such way that their opinions will reach not only their employees or customers, but other people as well. They started using open letters as an arena where burning topics and crucial subjects are brought in the foreground. 
Although open letters have been discussed in previous research, this type of leadership communication has not yet been looked at through the lenses of CEO activism. Neither has the language of CEO open letters related to societal issues been examined. Thus, three main research questions were formulated: what are the defining characteristics of CEO open letters; how do CEOs frame the purpose of writing open letters; and what are the rhetorical strategies used in CEO open letters?
Considering the aim of the study, a qualitative research approach was selected. Qualitative content analysis of 50 open letters written and published by corporate leaders in the period January 1st, 2016 – December 31st, 2017 was conducted. A deductive approach was used to create a coding frame in accordance with the underlying concepts and analyze the data.
Findings showed that, indeed, CEO open letters related to societal issues possess common features such as short length, topics related to recent issues, types of audiences, common geographical location and communication elements. The open letters also utilized a variety of frames for presenting their purpose of communication in a specific way. Finally, the language of CEOs was filled with appeals of ethos, logos, and pathos, which proved institutional rhetoric as the type of rhetoric used in CEO open letters. Overall, this study complements leadership research by drawing a link between framing and purposes for writing an open letter, by showing the open letters as a new way of CEO activism, and by highlighting the importance of language for corporate leaders and their credibility.","['media', 'business', 'Leadership', 'Leadership Communication', 'CEO Activism', 'CEO Language', 'Open Letters', 'Societal Issues', 'Framing', 'Rhetorical Analysis', 'Rhetorical Strategies']"
Instagram and Online Presence Among Art Museums - An Investigation of Instagram Content on Audience Engagement,Jullaya Vorasuntharosoth,2018-06-12,['Trilce Navarrete Hernandez'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The aim of this thesis is to examine how and why art museums engage with
audiences on Instagram and to identify the factors that indicate a successful social media
strategy. Instagram, in particular, the image-based social media platform that is suitable to
present and mediate digital visual content. It offered the opportunities for the museum to
mediate between communication and content-presentation in the platform that extended
beyond the physical space of the museum; allowing the museum to create new experiences
through their audiences’ involvement and active participation. Therefore, knowing what
forms of activity will be most effective, and what prompts the audience to engage are all
crucial to the success of social media activity in the museum sector. While previous studies
have focused on the consumer perception of the social media usage among museums, little
attention has been paid to how museums implement social media effectively. The research
question is: How do museums communicate through Instagram and to what extent does an
Instagram account reflect the institutional objectives to engage with the audience? This
thesis is conducted on the basis of qualitative content analysis, by analyzing and interpreting
the contents from three of the prominent art museums in the Netherland: the
Rijksmuseum, the Stedelijk Museum and the Van Gogh Museum. The analysis not only
revealed the specific characteristics that varied between the museums, but also the
importance of Instagram in terms of audience engagement. In addition, three emerging
themes demonstrate the objectives of museums on Instagram, namely, enabling digital
consumption of artworks; taste formation and education, and public image of the museum.
All in all, three museums show some common tendencies to engage with its audience, while
the effectiveness of the strategy comes to how they can manage to catch on the attention
of the audience and stimulate them to interact.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Instagram', 'social media', 'audience engagement', 'museum', 'online presence']"

Entrepreneurship became a strategic priority of policymakers in the territories where Porto is embedded, arguably motivated by economic recession. In entrepreneurial ecosystems, entrepreneurship is seen as a result from the interaction between entrepreneurs and the surrounding environment. Despite much attention has been given to the study of cultural and creative industry clusters, literature applying the entrepreneurial ecosystem approach to these sectors within a region is scarce. Earlier studies have been criticized for taking a static approach to the study of entrepreneurial ecosystems. The region of Porto has a long reputation as a strong cultural and creative cluster in the national context, an idea which became concrete with a study from 2008 promoted by Serralves. How has Porto’s cultural and creative entrepreneurial ecosystem evolved since 2008? This study analyzes the interactions between the main actors and factors of Porto’s cultural and creative entrepreneurial ecosystem and explains its evolutionary dynamics.

A Quantitative Research on Relationship between Audience Experience and Their Expenditure in Chinese Music Event,Yunyan Jiang,2018-06-12,['Carvalho Marques'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Since experience has been the fourth competitive stage in the economy, its important role is manifested in every industry, especially for festivals and events. A good audience experience always relates to a positive economic impact on events. A good experience can attract an audience to re-participate and voluntarily spread positive word-of-mouth about events, and good commercial operation also helps event providers provide a good experience for the audience. However, the concept of experience is full of connotations and descriptions (Andersson & Armbrecht, 2014), it is subjective and without the fixed system. Therefore, it is necessary to research on the relationship between audience experience and their expenditure. Music event has developed quickly in China these years because of the increasing demand, the number of the audience attending to music events in 2016 exceeded 10 million. In this background, the audience in the Chinese music event is a group worthy of study. This study aims to find out the relationship between audience experience and their expenditure in music event in China. An audience is presented an event experience scale from the ATLAS project and eight categories expenditure to choose how much they spend in every category. There are 321 respondents participate in the study, and 145 respondents have been to the music event in last 12 months who are the primary respondents. Findings from bivariate correlation, chi-square test for independence and
ANOVA test show that most of the audience think highly of Chinese music events and the relationship between audience total experience and their expenditure is insignificant, but some sub-relationships are significant. Audience transportation expenditure and other activities expenditure affect audience affective engagement significantly, and audience transportation expenditure and souvenirs expenditure affect audience physical engagement significantly. Implications of this are that event providers can influence audience emotional judgement and active participation by different pricing strategies and Chinese government should set up adequate monitoring and assessment systems to control the quality of experience that music event provides for the audience.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Music event', 'expenditure', 'experience', 'Chinese']"

Performance Goals and Measurement Systems in Commercial Art Galleries",Erin Chang,2018-06-12,['Ellen Loots'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research investigates the performance goals of commercial art galleries and the performance measurement systems (PMS) they use. As one of the first examinations into the topic, this research provides a foundational understanding of performance measurement in for-profit arts organizations. Combining notions from traditional management, non-profits arts PMS, and cultural economics I develop a framework within which to analyze galleries’ performance goals and PMS. Through qualitative interviews with galleries in Los Angeles and the Netherlands, I find that previous explanations of performance goals in arts organizations are insufficient to explain the varying goals of galleries. I develop a gallery orientation matrix that defines four types of galleries (discoverers, developers, endorsers, and canonizers) based on their values which helps to account for the variation in galleries’ goals and measurement systems. I also find several factors which are shared across galleries (motivations, challenges, and business structure) which shape performance goals and measurement systems. Based on these factors, the different performance goals and PMS of galleries are outlined.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'performance', 'measurement', 'evaluation', 'art galleries', 'indicators', 'performance goals', 'for-profit', 'commercial', 'arts organizations']"
The emergence of the Romanian art market - An exploratory study,Georgiana Iuliana Carp,2018-06-12,['Filip Vermeylen'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Over the past decade Romania has been characterized by the emergence of institutions aimed at the consecration and commercialization of contemporary art such as galleries, art fairs, biennales, contemporary art museums and auction houses which publish yearly reports on the development of the Romanian art market. All these developments are indicators of an increasing professionalization of the Romanian art market as well as indicators of the current globalization of the art market which has been interesting regions all over the world since the 1980s.
As research on emerging art markets within the globalization framework underlines how the development of new markets occurs as a combination of adoption and adaptation of the Western art market model, this thesis aims to explore how is the Romanian context influencing the current development of the contemporary art market. The research draws on 12 in-depth semi structured interviews with relevant actors in the current Romanian art market and participant observation in important artistic events. Lastly, as most research on emerging art markets has focused on the BRICS countries, this thesis contributes to the literature on emerging art markets by offering insights on the current developments in a smaller country as Romania.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'emerging art markets', 'globalization of the contemporary art market', 'Romania', 'local context']"

Crowdfunding Backers Driven from Within? - A study of backer motivations in crowdfunding forum posts.,Aurélien J.G. Rougier,2018-06-12,['C.W. Handke'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis examines the motivations individuals may have for supporting cultural
crowdfunding campaigns through the analysis of online forum posts. In a context where the
cultural and artistic industries face uncertainty linked to diminished subsidies and subsequent
reduced funds, considerations pertaining to new sources of funding are crucial, further stressing
the need to better understand phenomena such as crowdfunding. Hence, the following material
draws upon literature pertaining to psychology and behavioral economics mainly to demonstrate
that agents tend to privilege rewards which are rather internal and/or intangible when contributing
to crowdfunding campaigns. Amongst other things, backers tend to see crowdfunding as a sort of
group activity, a community. They are driven internally towards the act of crowdfunding in order
to satisfy intrinsic needs. They see certain cultural projects as benefiting or enriching the wider
industry, or being of special use to a third, more or less acquainted party. I therefore suggest that
overall, the backers which (inter-)act on forums privilege indirect and/or intangible rewards when
crowdfunding. To demonstrate this idea, I combine the various defining aspects of both non-use
value and intrinsic motivation to obtain a framework that can help me reach this goal. I select the
two most active crowdfunding forums I could find, Crowdfundingforum.com and
Kickstarterforum.org, to conduct a Sentiment Analysis of forum posts, whilst implying a focus on
the heavyweight crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.com. By using an array of terms or
combinations of words as markers of the various aspects mentioned above, I verify to what extent
various cultural industries, defined early on as “arts”, “publishing”, “film”, “games”, “music”, and
“comics & illustration” validate these aspects on the aforementioned forums. The results of my
analysis are mixed: it would seem backers pursue different types of rewards to various extents. On
one hand, backers sometimes seem to privilege the social aspects of crowdfunding or adopt an
investor behavior as they relish to the idea of being part of a convincing and successful campaign.
In other cases, backers seem to privilege the utility that the projects or rewards can bring them
directly. I conclude that crowdfunding backers do seem to pursue non-use value yet seem to have
a mixed relationship with these intangible or intrinsic rewards, and therefore cannot be considered
fully intrinsically motivated or self-determined. I conclude by making suggestions for further
research. Namely, I believe that applying such methods on a larger-scale, whilst utilizing adequate
2
software could lead to results that are more precise. I also believe closer consideration should be
given to the differences between various industries and types of projects.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Crowdfunding', 'online forums', 'behavioral economics', 'non-use value', 'nonconsumptive', 'use', 'third-party use', 'intrinsic motivation', 'motivation crowding effect', 'rewards', 'natural language processing']"
The Influence of Japanese “Contents tourism” on Chinese Outbound Tourists,Ziwei Song,2018-06-12,['L. Carvalho Marques'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Tourism as an important force to promote local development has attracted the attention of the Japanese government and Japanese organizations. International tourism fueled the growth of the Japanese economy and these inbound tourists are not only interested in traditional Japanese culture but also popular ones. With the growth of a fan foundation and the economic impact of the popular Japanese culture, the concept of “contents tourism” was introduced by the Japanese government as a promotion strategy and became a buzzword. There are many pieces of research about “contents tourism” in Japan, and these researches mostly focused on the government, organizations, economic impact etc., but this study is focused on the influence of Japanese “contents” which is generally defined as the popular culture on the demand side. The Chinese outbound tourism as a rapidly expanding market and the biggest amount of visitors and spenders of Japan’s inbound tourism is selected to be the target of this study. The study is concentrated on the main research question “ To what extent does Japanese ‘contents’ as a branding strategy influence Chinese outbound traveling?”. The influence on Chinese outbound tourists is examined in terms of motivation, travel activity preference, destination selection and the effectiveness of branding. In order to successfully achieve the aim of the study, a quantitative method and online questionnaires were used by the researcher to gather and analyze the data. According to the analysis of motivation and activity preferences, B-grade gourmet is the most influential and attractive content for general Chinese outbound tourists. Other contents like shooting places and sacred places are more attractive for repeated visitors, higher educated and male visitors. Based on the previous experience, intention, attitudes, and branding, the contents plays an important role in increasing the possibility of destination selection. The effectiveness of branding is studied in brand awareness, brand image and brand loyalty, and confirmed positive. Especially mascots have an obvious advantage in raising brand awareness. The results demonstrated that as a branding strategy the “contents” has limited influences on Chinese tourists’ motivation and activities, but they successfully built the brand of these contents related destinations and raised the possibility of destination selection. Moreover, the potential influence of contents on Chinese outbound tourists is positive and using influential information sources like word-of-mouth can enhance the efficiency of branding.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'contents tourism', 'Chinese outbound tourists', 'branding', 'motivation', 'activity']"

TRANSMISSION OF
INTERIOR DESIGN FIRMS
IN TRADE FAIRS",Celine Tandoyo,2018-06-12,['Anna Mignosa'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research explores on an individual level how interior design firms interact with and manage
knowledge through participating in trade fairs. By analyzing the processes of participation from the
preparation to the post-event phase, this research identifies points where firms acquire, share, and
utilise knowledge.
To gain an in-depth understanding, this research applies a qualitative method using semistructured
interviews with eight interior design firms operating in the Netherlands. The firms are of
varying sizes, from 1 to more than 950 employees. Additionally, desk research was conducted to
provide a neutral background information regarding the firms and the trade fairs attended by the firms.
The findings show that firms are unfamiliar of the term ‘Knowledge Management’ despite their
intensive interaction with knowledge. Firms’ interaction with knowledge happens in each activities
starting from the preparation phase to the post-event phase. Firms acknowledge the benefits of trade
fairs as spaces for exchanging knowledge, constructing network and symbolic capital, bringing
together supply and demand, and conducting experiments.
Trade fairs motivate and facilitate exhibitors to present new products. Due to visitors’
expectation for new things and competition from other exhibitors, firms are triggered to be innovative
in their exhibitions. As the firms gain feedback from visitors and inspiration from fellow exhibitors, they
increase their innovation capability by being able to improve their product offerings and create new
products according to the market’s needs and taste.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Knowledge management', 'temporary clusters', 'trade fairs', 'absorptive capacity', 'innovation capability']"
The Role of Music in the Construction of Individuals' Narrative Identities,Anna Ferro,2018-06-12,['Stijn Reijnders'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Many people listen to music on a daily basis. Adolescents and young adults, especially, spend a good amount of their time listening to music. This means that they might use music as a way to crystallize certain moments and specific experiences in their identity narrations Through music, past life experiences are elaborated and adapted to the current context in order to deliver to the self and others a coherent and meaningful story. That is why, this research is set out to explore the role of music in the construction of young adults’ narrative identities by looking at the way they perceive the (changing) role of music in their lives up until their current age. Therefore, it is expected that music is used as an ‘ordering scheme’ to give coherence and unity to one’s identity narration and serves both as a self-reflection tool and as a means to convey a message to the broader socio-cultural environment. In order to examine such intimate processes of memory recollection and identity work, friends and a family member were interviewed. It was revealed that most of them did use music as a temporal container to order the narration of their identity and, within such structure, technology constituted the red thread that characterized and influenced their habits in listening to music and changed participants’ approaches to music experiences. Such experiences are tied up to specific memories of crucial events – or ‘turning points’- that the respondents found relevant and therefore narrated while being interviewed. Starting from their pre-teens years, through their adolescence, up until their current age, their experiences with music changed according to their age and, in most cases, corresponded to a deeper understanding and awareness of who they were and their place in the social world. In some cases, respondents found in music an instrument to grant their identity either a sense of continuity or transformation. In some other cases, music sparkled imaginative practices that allowed some participants to mold and/or escape their identity work. Music, in sum, can be considered as a helpful instrument that contributes to the performance of the choreographies of the lives of the individuals interviewed.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Memory', 'Music', 'Narrative Identity', 'self-reflection', 'socio-cultural context', 'young adults']"
"Monopolisation in the live music industry - 
The study of a possible monopoly and its consequences in the Dutch live music industry",Martin Hamel,2018-06-12,['Hans Abbing'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In this research we’ll take a look at the monopoly of Live Nation in the Netherlands. This monopoly has come to existence through the vertical integration of other companies such as Mojo Concerts. To examine this monopoly, we’ll use four sub-research questions aimed at discovering the developments in the music industry, the strength of Live Nation and the similarities between Live Nation’s situation and standard economics. The results show a different impact of Live Nation on bookers, promotors and venues. As these three intermediaries all have a different relationship with Live Nation and its subsidiaries, three different conclusions are created. For venues, the impact of Live Nation is almost non-existent at this moment, however, this might change in the future as Live Nation continues to grow. For bookers, the impact of Live Nation is greater, as Mojo controls an important market of the Dutch live music industry. Thirdly, the promotors experience the most impact of Live Nation, as they communicate with all the subsidiaries of Live Nation in the Netherlands. As promotors can compete with Mojo, book certain venues of Live Nation such as AFAS and can use Ticketmaster as their ticket seller. Although the impact of Live Nation can be big on these intermediaries, it seems unlikely that Live Nation will become a monopoly who can showcase monopolistic behaviour in the near future. This monopolistic behaviour seems unlikely as the services Live Nation and their subsidiaries supply, are rather easily imitable by other companies that want to enter the market. In the end, the only one who really has the monopoly is the artist. Through the ongoing trend of globalisation, more and more markets are become accessible for the artists to perform. This benefit the income of the artist, and supports the only monopoly in the live music industry, the artist’s one.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Monopolization', 'live music', 'Live Nation', 'vertical integration', 'market leader', 'music preferences', 'festivals', 'music artist', 'uniqueness']"
"The music industry redefined by scholars - 
A bibliographical study to intermediaries in the music industry",Michelle Verhoeven,2018-06-12,['C. W. Handke'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research examines whether there is a shift in positions and influence among intermediaries in the music industry through a content analysis of 255 articles on music intermediaries obtained from the Web of Science database. When the music industry transformed from a publishing industry into a recording industry, there was also a shift from publishers as dominant institutions to record companies. Recently the music industry has dealt with several changes related to the digitalization of music. It is interesting to examine whether this has also created a shift of most influential intermediaries. It can be concluded that digitalization enabled a lot of new intermediaries to enter the market and that they did take over the pre-selection role of record companies who now function as post-selectors. These smaller or new intermediaries are launching and developing artists careers and play a important role in determining which artists will be signed by major record companies.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'intermediary', 'gatekeeper', 'music industry', 'record industry', 'digitalization']"
"Choreographers Career Paths, Field Awards and Career Outcomes on the Contemporary Dutch Dance Field",Jussi Nousiainen,2018-06-12,['Laura Braden'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","An artist is known by his reputation. Especially on the cultural markets institutional recognitions are a valuable means of telling apart masters from mediocre (Bourdieu, 1983). By ensuring exalted artist reputation and long-lasting recognition, the honors might make the difference on artists career paths and career outcomes on precarious and contingent artistic labor markets (English, 2011). On popular art fields, such as cinema and music, different field awards have a long history of producing fame and making stars. They legitimize the artform, awarding institutions, and of course the awarded artist alike (Braden, 2012). Contemporary dance is a less appreciated art field by big crowds and choreographers making cotemporary dances less know artistic occupation. Yet, giving out awards and recognitions for choreographers, their artistic and career achievements have increased manifold since the last couple of decades. The previous studies on field awards have much emphasized the economic aspects of prestige, how the awards affect the value of artistic goods, the canonization of artists and the tastes of audiences. It is thought that accumulating reputation leads to an accumulative advantage in competition for scares resources, favorable market positions and popularity among spectators. In this paper I asks if the honors also might help the artist to lead more sustainable careers, lasting beyond the momentary hype of winning? Thus, to what extend does the accumulation of recognition from filed awards benefit the living artists careers and do they matter on such small art field as contemporary dance in particular? This study aims to first of all shed light on to the choreographers’ career paths and describe their career trajectories from occupational perspective. Naturally, besides honors various other factors affect the choreographers’ careers and career outcomes. The artistic careers are often deeply intertwined with other life spheres (Netzer & Parker, 1993). Besides the awards, and the life events on personal sphere, different career dimensions are described and considered. Take as an example career mobility and embeddedness and entropy and stability, which reflect the boundaryless characteristic of the occupation. Sequence analyses is used as the method to gain insights to the complex reciprocal dynamics governing the field and the career paths of the choreographers on the contemporary Dutch dance field.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Field awards', 'Contemporary dance', 'Career sustainability', 'Sequence analyses']"
"The assessment of the cultural value of heritage: incorporating plural interpretations and meaning or sticking to a singular scientific model and definition? - 
A qualitative research on the assessment of the cultural value and challenges regarding the implementation of the cultural value by Dutch heritage organisations",Lise Sloot,2018-06-12,['Dr. Martens'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The purpose of this research is to provide insights on the matter of the supposed importance of cultural value assessment in heritage management by Dutch heritage organisations. Often, Dutch heritage organisations mention the impact and importance of culture and cultural value on heritage practices in their policy plan or on their website, yet the ways in which this cultural value is defined, assessed and evaluated remains unclear or is not mentioned. By conducting qualitative research by conducting semi-structured interviews with immovable heritage organisations on their cultural value management practices and the challenges that occur, the research provided an answer to the research question: What cultural assessment models do heritage agencies, organisations and funds in the Netherlands use, if at all, to rate the cultural value of a heritage site, and what challenges do these heritage stakeholders experience in using these models? The findings from these research showed that there are two perspectives regarding the cultural value assessment of heritage. The first dominant perspective holds on to the limited and traditional idea of cultural value as coming from the object itself, where it is believed that the worth of heritage does not depend on interplay between the object and the public, but is a fixed value that can be measured by the rather short-sighted objective scientific value systems of the Dutch Heritage Agency. By using this system that is based on rating the architectural and cultural historical significance of heritage, it is believed that the cultural value of heritage is assessed. The second perspective shows the aim to have a plural and inclusive approach towards heritage management, where the cultural value is approached from different angles, where not only the scientific experts’ point of view, but also how the public identifies with the heritage and attach value to heritage is evaluated. Yet, there is no assessment tool developed to evaluate this and the heritage organisations stick to the dominant and limited perspective of the cultural value as coming from the object itself. This can be explained by the challenges that these heritage stakeholders experience regarding the cultural value of heritage. They find it a challenge to incorporate the cultural value that is subjective, not fixed and can differ per person in heritage management and hold an elitist stance towards involving non-scientific perspectives that do not have the expertise, like the public. Even though they state that they wish to involve communities, they view themselves as having the expertise which gives them the authority in value based heritage management. From these findings, it can be concluded that taking on a plural approach towards the cultural value of heritage by involving the public is often only a symbolic gesture in order to appear more inclusive in heritage management. There is no clear structure or assessment for this involvement of the public and because of this, the power and authority stays with the traditional power holders in the heritage field where they stick to the institutional quantitative approach to heritage value assessment.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Cultural value', 'Cultural Heritage', 'Assesment models', 'Pluralistic Heritage management', 'Cultural identity']"
"Female Orchestral Conductors:
Negotiating Gender And Leadership In The Classical Music World",Jing Zhang,2018-06-12,['Boross B.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Men have traditionally dominated the classical music world, where gender dominance is particularly prominent in the role of the orchestral conductor. The conductor is a traditionally male-dominated profession, due to its dual roles of musical leadership and endowed authority, which have been historically legitimated. The stereotypical image of the gender of the conductor has profound influences when women challenge this position. However, due to significant social changes in society, women have gained more access to education and obtained opportunities to compete with their male counterparts. Gender conventions have been challenged, and gender inequality has slowly shifted. As a result, a considerable number of female conductors have emerged in the field. Yet, there is still a vast disparity in professional orchestral conductors’ positions held by men versus women. The purpose of this study is to understand how people in the classical music field perceive female leaders when these women take on the leadership role in a highly-demanding and extremely competitive environment, challenging gendered conventions by performing the role of conductor. I am interested in how the perceptions of individuals have influenced female conductors to achieve this particular leadership, and whether these perceptions may shape/reshape the stereotypical role of the conductor
The research aims to answer the core question: “How do insiders perceive female conductors as leaders in the classical music world, and to what extent do the perceptions influence the status of female conductors, thereby reconsidering the gendered leadership role of the music conductor? ” A qualitative research method was employed in this study. I have identified five types of “insiders” who work in the classical music field, have had direct or indirect relationships with female conductors, or have worked with female conductors. Because of the limited accessibility into the classical music field, I chose a non-probability snowball sampling strategy to select eleven participants. Eleven semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted. Once the interview data was collected, a thematic analysis method was employed to process the data. Based on the theory-driven approach, four main themes/patterns were identified.
As the results show, not all individuals considered the unequal representation of male and female conductors as a sign of gender inequality. This is because the legitimated status of male conductors and rooted gender conventions in the classical music field has caused (unconscious) gender prejudice and bias perception toward female conductors. However, there are traces of changing perceptions, due to the improvement of women’s status in society and the higher achievement made by a small number of female conductors. The awareness of gender inequality in the role of the conductor and individual recognition of female conductors contribute to shaping female conductor leadership roles, as well as further deconstructing gender inequality in the classical music world.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Gender Inequality', 'Female Leadership', 'Female Conductor', 'Perception', 'Classical Music']"
"Gentle Women, Genius Men - 
A study into Implicit Gender Association with Artistic Occupations",Nikki Oomen,2018-06-12,['Michaël Berghman'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","It is already researched multiple times in what fields of work and research there is an underrepresentation (e.g. CEO’s) or overrepresentation (e.g. nurses) of females. Males are being associated with higher levels of occupations among different work fields. Although there is no research done yet to see whether the art sector is also gendered, gender stereotyping within this sector is not something
g new. Kant already made a statement in 1790 where he suggests that there is something as the male “artistic genius”. There are considerably more successful male artists, but different elements of the art world (e.g. arts educations, still lives) are associated with femininity. Therefore, this research aims to study the paradox that exist within the art sector. On the one hand the artistic genius is associated with men, but on the other hand women are associated with different elements within the sector. The associations people make have an influence their behavior. This leads to issues such as boundaries when entering certain work fields or applying for certain jobs.
By researching if and how occupations in the art sector are implicitly and explicitly associated with a specific gender, this study aims to make the boundary to enter smaller. By using implicit and explicit measures, this study will look for the reasons behind stereotyping. To measure the gendered biases, this research uses two different Implicit Association Tests (IAT). The first IAT looks for biases against artistic occupations versus non-artistic occupations and the second IAT focusses solely on artistic professions. The first hypothesis expected artistic jobs to be easier associated with femininity and non-artistic jobs quicker associated with masculinity. By confirming this hypothesis, this study validates that both genders, different educational backgrounds and ages all had no effect on this bias. This means that the gendered association is not limited to certain part of society, but it is a general stereotype made by a large group of people.
The second hypothesis expected a stronger association between masculinity and responsibility profession compared to responsibility and female professions. By confirming this hypothesis and finding no significant effects from the background variables, this stereotype was also more general instead of linked to a specific group within society (e.g. age, gender, educational background). In summary, the biases of men having more responsibility in their profession and females being associated quicker with artistic occupations suggest that art is only associated with masculinity if there is an element of success involved.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Implicit Association Test', 'IAT', 'Gender', 'Stereotyping', 'Female Occupations', 'Art World']"
"Accidental Tourism in Wagner’s Bayreuth - 
An Analysis of Visitors’ Motivations and Experiences in Wagner’s Bayreuth.",Myrto Moraitou,2018-06-12,['S. L. Reijnders'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research offers an analysis of the motivations and experiences of visitors in Wagner’s Bayreuth. Wagner’s Bayreuth is a great example of music tourism as it is maybe the first site where music lovers from around the world visited in order to listen and experience classical music.
Taking as a starting point the theories developed on music tourism studies on sites related to popular music such as the ones of Connell and Gibson (2003), Gibson and Connell (2005, 2007) and Bolderman and Reijnders (2016), this research will try to identify whether these theories apply also on the classical music field, based on the example of Wagner’s Bayreuth.
This paper addresses four visitor elements; the motivation, the expectation, the experience and evaluation of the above. The personal ‘identity’ of each visitor plays also an important role on their motives and evaluation procedure of the experience, as it defines the relationship between the visitor and the place and also the way of evaluation through their personal story.
Through the analysis of these elements, using a qualitative approach with in depth interviews based on these elements, the findings suggest that there are some similarities in the behavior of the visitors between Wagner’s Bayreuth and previous researches on popular culture sites. However, the major difference lies in the fact that the visitors of Wagner’s Bayreuth, who visit the city outside the period of the festival, are not fans of the music and the composer and thus, they have different motives and experiences than the ‘Wagnerians’.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'music tourism', 'visitor', 'motivation', 'expectation', 'experience and evaluation']"

Within three quantitative studies, this thesis attempts to analyse what is relationship between creative personality and dishonest behaviour and what are the other factors involved. By testing hypotheses based on literature, we found that a creative personality has a positive and significant effect on dishonest behaviour that is moderated by an honest personality (study 1). The second study (2.1) supports that creative personality is a significant predictor of dishonest behaviour and it also indicates that their connection is fully mediated by small everyday creativity. Finally, the last study (2.2) was unable to catch any significant relationship between creativity and dishonest behaviour, in contrast with the previous findings, suggesting that the connection is not doubtless.

"THE MUSEUM EXPERIENCE IN THE 21ST CENTURY - THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE POTENTIAL AUDIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCES
DESIGNED BY MUSEUM PROFESSIONALS: THE CASE OF THE BOIJMANS VAN BEUNINGEN DEPOT",Marzia Polese,2018-06-12,['Daniela Stocco Ferreira'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Museums in the 21st century dramatically are changing from the traditional museums of the past.
They are becoming more open and are expanding their roles that embrace conservation, education,
research, entertainment and engagement of the society. Museums nowadays are more audience
centred and customer oriented, manifesting the need to attract wide and differentiated targets of
audience to accomplish their mission and survive in the competitive leisure industries. Essential to do
so, is providing memorable and positive experiences for visitors that satisfy their expectations and
preferences. Falk & Dierking at this purpose provided a model, the contextual model of learning to
understand and address the museum experience, saying that it is a circular process among the
personal, socio-cultural and physical context of real and potential visitors. The personal context is of
particular interest for this thesis, since it comprehends the background, preferences, motivations and
expectations of visitors towards the museum experience. By investigating the personal context of
potential visitors, it is possible for museum professionals to understand their targets and provide
attractive and satisfactory experiences able to attract and retain those visitors. Since this Master
thesis originates from a commissioned research on the potential audience of the Depot from the
Boijmans Van Beuningen museum in Rotterdam, all these concepts have been applied to the specific
case of the Boijmans Van Beuningen Depot. By 2020 it will become the first public depository in the
world and the new tourist attraction of Rotterdam. This qualitative research is aimed at researching
how the expectations of cultural tourists, one of the main audience targets of the Depot, match the
Depot dreamed experience designed by the museum professionals. In order to answer to this question,
a qualitative research with semi structured in depth interviews with cultural tourists has been
conducted. From the analysis of the data collected, some important findings emerged. Cultural
tourists have different personal contexts and identities that influence their expectations and
preferences for the museum experience in the 21st century. They perceived Depot more as a museum
of the future and most of the experiences designed by the museum staff match the expectations of
cultural tourists interviewed. Yet, a gap has been found, since they perceived the Depot as confusing
and expressed negative feelings about the wayfinding and exhibition design. This result in particular
could be considered by the Boijmans Van Beuningen staff as a starting point to improve the design of
positive experiences for future cultural tourists that will visit the Depot.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Museum experience', 'Boijmans Van Beuningen Depot', 'museum experience in the 21st', 'century', 'Cultural tourists', 'museum experience design']"
"FAMILY TYPES AND LEISURE DECISION-MAKING - 
A study looking for potential visitors for Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen",Joni Ashlin Cousins,2018-06-12,['Koen van Eijck'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This master thesis has two major purposes: (1) to gain a better understanding of how families make decisions regarding leisure activities with their children and (2) to find out what implications this has for Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen to reach more families in Rotterdam and interest them for a visit to Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen. The question around which this research was based, is: What are the leisure interests of families currently not visiting Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen and under which conditions would the new depot be an interesting place for different types of non-visitors to visit? In order to understand the complex process of family decision-making regarding leisure activities, the research focused on three aspects: social class – defined by educational and occupational class - , parenting styles and decision-making processes. General motivations and constraints were also considered.
Using SPSS, the quantitative data of the VTO omnibus was used to find patterns in leisure activities in Rotterdam. Interviews were used to create a deeper understanding of how social class, parenting and decision-making inform these patterns. Atlas.ti was then used to code and organize the data in order to find structures. This resulted in insight into general motivations and constraints for parents, but also in two main types of families – which are structured along social class, parenting style and the types of activities they participate in during their leisure time.
Family type 1 is of higher social class and engages in a wider range of leisure activities, including cultural activities. They want their children to have fun, but also pay attention to opportunities to learn in their free time. Type 2 families focus mainly on fun and entertainment for their children and do not consider cultural activities to be among those things. For the museum, type 1 families might be in closer range for visiting Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen, by making clear the museum is a child-friendly place in their advertising. Making it resemble the more interactive science museums those families are already visiting, might make the Depot an interesting place to visit. Type 2 families will be harder to pull in with fun educational activities, since they do not seek out anything that focuses on education and are mostly led by what their children enjoy. However, the attractiveness of the building’s design might make these families interested in visiting it for its attraction value – like the Markthal. If the Depot manages to pull in families and show that children can have a good time, the children might want to come back.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Leisure', 'social class', 'parenting', 'decision-making', 'museum visiting']"
"Where Queer and Vegan Meet - 
The Development, Negotiation, and Desires of an Emerging
Intersectional Identity",Nathaniel R. Feldmann,2018-06-12,['Balázs Boross'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis investigates the emerging phenomenon of queer individuals more frequently practicing veganism; seeking to understand the role that veganism plays in the lives of queer people. Applying intersectionality, or an understanding that identity categories are intertwined (Crensaw, 1989), it is apparent that the identity categories of ‘queer’ and ‘vegan’ are to be examined concurrently and in relation to the systems of oppression in which they are positioned. This approach sought out to bridge the gap in literature that has evaluated such identities and practices in isolation. Following this theoretical underpinning, 16 queer vegan identifying individuals were recruited via social media to participate in semi-structured in-depth interviews. The data collected was analyzed utilizing thematic analysis in the first phase of collection and Grounded Theory throughout the length of the project. The results of this study found that the queer vegans involved viewed their identity temporally. This is first exemplified through the participants describing how they look to their past to explain the development of their identity categories as a step-by-step process in which veganism is viewed as a means to address the trauma that they have experienced due to their queer identity category. In the present, the participants describe how they must negotiate the current meaning of their intersectional identity in relation to discourse, ideology, social isolation, other salient intersectional identity categories such as race/ethnicity and class, as well as utilizing Queer Vegan social media groups and online communities to stabilize the salience of their identity categories. For many of the individuals involved in this study, their past developments and present negotiations with their identity categories are seen as investments for a future in which their marginal identity is considered normal and mainstream, but most importantly, the participants expressed a desire for a kinder and more inclusive queer vegan world. Through the analysis, it is made clear that veganism is more than a practice or a lifestyle to the individuals involved, but instead, is a defined identity category that plays a considerable role in the lives of the queer individuals involved, in which the
experiences of being queer influences one’s practice of veganism, as much as one’s veganism influences their queerness.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Queerness', 'Veganism', 'Intersectionality', 'Identity', 'Community']"
"The Politics of Fashion:
The use and perception of political statements by fashion houses in relation to
women’s rights and emancipation",Lara Oliveri,2018-06-12,['Janna Michael'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Within this research it is shown that fashion should be considered as a meaningful concept
that is an expression of ideas, desires or beliefs that circulate within the society (Wilson,
2013). In addition, politics and fashion are two fields that have an inseparable connection.
The main goal of this research is to analyse this relation more profoundly, where the meaning
of fashion is examined through the use and perception of political statements within the
fashion industry. This research is placed in the political context of the presidential election
process of Donald Trump within the United States. A specific political reaction that was
striking in this period was linked to the feminist debates of women’s rights and emancipation.
This resulted in visible political statements by different fashion houses that were
subsequently perceived and given meaning by the fashion intermediaries. Through
qualitative content analysis of fashion articles and qualitative interviewing of fashion editors,
five fashion houses were examined on the use and perception of political statements.
Through the analysis of Dior, Prabal Gurung, Prada, Versace and Missoni, it became clear
that political statements could be used and perceived in different ways. From this research
five relevant elements were developed that play an important role in the use and perception
of political statements in fashion. Firstly there exists the difference between an obvious or
intrinsic statement, secondly, the link between the statement and the entire collection, the
third element is related to the extent to which the political statement is perceived as a
seemingly logical next step for the fashion house, fourthly the existing of a trend mechanism
regarding political statements and finally, the commercial element that is linked to the
presented political statements in a collection. These elements contribute to the way in which
fashion intermediaries perceive the statements and subsequently give meaning to them.
From this research these elements prove to be of great relevance for a political statement in
fashion to be perceived as sincere and meaningful.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'fashion', 'political statement', 'fashion intermediaries', 'perception', ""women's rights and emancipation""]"
Curating Ancient Egypt: Examples from the Netherlands,Isabela Silvia Avila,2018-06-12,['Daniela Stocco Ferreira'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study addresses the persistence of a colonial gaze employed by Western European archaeological museums in their current process of curating Ancient Egyptian exhibitions. This “colonial gaze” is related to the concept of “othering”, as defined by Edward Said’s Orientalism (1978), which presents a critical outlook on Western conceptions and representations of cultures in the Middle and Far East. My study was focused on two Dutch museum with significant Ancient Egyptian collections, namely the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden and the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam. The data for this study was gathered through a content analysis of the museum’s mission statements, their choice of collection highlights, in addition to an in-situ observation of each of the permanent exhibitions and interviews with the head curators of the Egyptian departments of the two museums. Through this mixed methods approach, I have arrived at different conclusions which not only address the question of to what degree this colonial gaze is still employed by museums, but which also sheds light on a range of issues regarding the contextualization of the artifacts, the museums’ acquisition histories and policies, and post-colonial debates regarding the ownership and repatriation of artifacts.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Orientalism', 'Ancient Egypt', 'Curatorship', 'Post-Colonial Studies', 'Acquisition Policy']"
"Between God and Marx - 
The Catholic Worker under the Era of FDR and the Enigma of Socialism in the United States",Sandra Graf,2018-06-12,['Martijn Lak'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Beside their prevailing capitalistic system, the United States have been known for their two-party system which is ruled by the republicans on one side and the democrats on the other side. Their overarching prevalence presented a grand difficulty for third-party members to gain a significant political share.1 Socialism is therefore not the first notion one would associate with America. As scholars like Werner Sombart started to publish theories about a failing socialist movement in the United States, debates and discussions regarding this topic have been conducted for over a century. This thesis concludes that the two main reasons why the assumption of a failing socialism prevails is firstly, that the two-party system obstructed the socialist political success, and the fact that socialism was often automatically equalized with communism and thus inherited a bad reputation within the United States. This thesis furthermore detected that socialism was not absent in the United States. To demonstrate the socialist impact on the U.S.A., the thesis introduces various scholarly works as well as the socialist journal, called The Catholic Worker. The Catholic Worker’s peculiarity was its combination of socialist ideas and its Catholic convictions. It was founded in 1933 and therefore established during the Great Depression and the first term of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The research goal is to present The Catholic Worker as an individual socialist stream and to examine views of The Catholic Worker on Roosevelt’s legislations, and its stance on the situation of African-Americans in the 1930s. Roosevelt’s New Deal was initially well received but its implementations were soon criticized by the journal. Contrary to other opinions, the movement did not see the legislations as socialist. Regarding the Civil Rights Movement, The Catholic Worker was in full support of providing equal rights to African- Americans, opposed racism and campaigned against the rising lynchings in the 1930’s. Because of the journal’s distinctive direction in the socialist realm, its effort to join catholic and socialist philosophies and its nation- wide recognition in publications and newspapers, The Catholic Worker sets itself apart from other socialist movements and can be regarded as its own stream.","['Socialism', 'Untied States', 'Great Depression', 'FDR', 'Catholicism', 'The Catholic Worker', 'Capitalism', 'Civil Rights', 'Communism', 'American Worker']"
"Demand in the
music industry:
The case of
Popronde",K. van Beek,2018-06-10,['C. Handke'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The formation of demand in the music industry is highly uncertain and volatile. Since the
music industry is a dynamic industry where quality, uncertainty and oversupply prevail, it is
difficult to predict which product will gain success. However, to overcome these
uncertainties, consumers will base their decisions on several aspects which will show the
quality of the product. This research project makes an attempt to show how Popronde, a
travelling showcase festival in the Netherlands, is one of those institutions that plays an
important role in the formation of demand in the Dutch music industry. Even more specific,
the media attention that (not for every band though) comes with Popronde, is determining in
demand formation in the Dutch music industry.
This quantitative research answers two questions, namely (1) ‘how does participating
in the showcase festival Popronde influence the demand for live performances expressed by
bookers of venues?’ and (2) ‘how does media endorsement during Popronde influence the
demand for live performances expressed by bookers of venues?’ The main findings show that
participating in Popronde does not increase the demand for every band or artist. The data
shows differences between the group of participants. However, participating in Popronde and
receiving media endorsement will cause an increase in the amount of shows, as well as the
audience size.
Next to that, the data also shows how the supply side if affected in this research. The
data shows large differences in the long-term effect, which implies that some bands gain
success, while others split up entirely.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Music Industry', 'Demand Uncertainty', 'Demand Formation', 'Certifiers', 'Quality', 'Signaling', 'Popronde.']"

"Platform work – empowering or exploiting the labourers? - 
A Case Study of Taxify: An analysis of the relationship between the company and its labourers",Laura-Liisa Lilleberg,2018-06-01,['Payal Arora'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The people’s need and dependence for community has led to a sharing economy in which underused resources or leisure time are monetised. This new type of economy has brought on the growth of the digital labour platforms that offer sharing solutions in various fields. For instance, it has created a ridesharing and providing trend. Apps like Uber offer seemingly easy options to earn money yet have regulations that make the labour conditions very precarious for the workers who are providing gigs for the companies. Many scholars have conducted studies about sharing economy and digital labour phenomena yet the current research on transportation sector lacks information from the labourers’ side. This empirical study dives into the transportation platform work and tries to uncover what is the relationship between Taxify, a ridesharing app, and its drivers. To what extent are the labourers exploited by the company and why? In order to answer the research question and sub-questions a qualitative research design was chosen. A case study method was chosen to analyse the relationships between the company and the employees, as well as, to understand the role of a digital labourer by looking into how the structuring of Taxify works. A thematic analysis was conducted based on the 100 latest posts from four different Facebook groups, in addition to two focus groups in which Taxify and the drivers were interviewed separately. The study revealed quite a lot of new information in regards of how the workers perceive the gig labour and their work conditions. Contrarily to the previous literature on the matter, this research showed that the drivers have a neoliberal view of the job and believe themselves to be responsible for their success. The relationship that Taxify has with its drivers can mainly be explained as transparent and supportive. The analysis showed no existence of exploitation and revealed that the drivers perceive Taxify’s treatment as fair. The main reason for the misconception surrounding the treatment of drivers might be caused by the fact that the regulations seem to leave all the responsibility on the drivers while the company actually has many positive activities that are not written down and announced to the larger public.","['media', 'business', 'Taxify', 'Platform work', 'Digital labour', 'Gig economy', 'Precarious labour']"

How do Millennial leaders make sense of their leadership positions?,Viktoria S. Videlova,2018-05-25,['Nicoleta Bălău'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study is looking into the notion of millennial leadership discussing and examining key aspects used to define the concept of contemporary management. The research investigates the administrative practices of leaders currently operating within the hyper-active labour market, specifically focusing on the high-tech industry.
By examining the incentives millennial leaders identify as their motivation for pursuing and retaining management positions and exploring the day-to-day practices the respondents apply within their workplace environment, the research is aiming at providing a better understanding on the perception millennial leaders have of their leadership positions and the powerful implementations these influence roles possess.
The study has a qualitative exploratory nature and uses semi structured in-depth interviews as the main research method for data collection. From a methodological perspective, a constructivist grounded theory approach has been taken and applied to the process of data collection and analysis.
One of the main claims the research makes is that the management style millennial leaders are applying within their workplace environment, is heavily influenced by the transformational leadership approach, even though it sometimes displays tendencies towards more modern management patterns by incorporating more ethical and democratic values, making the style more suitable to the more contemporary and competitive market. The research also proposes that millennial leaders are exhibiting more power related instinct motivations towards their decision to pursue and retain management positions. The research claims that millennial leaders today understand and view their leadership positions more as an opportunity for even further professional development, rather than as the end goal of their professional careers.
The research examined the responses of eleven participants, therefore future studies may use the methodological model of the current research to examine millennial leadership, its specific practices and the leaders’ identification of the motivations they have when going into management positions in even further details. The findings of the research provide an outlook of how the new generation leaders perceive their management roles and address the millennial conceptualization of the power dynamic within the workplace environment in real organizational settings. The implications of the current study will be discussed in further details throughout the text.","['media', 'business', 'Leadership', 'Millennial', 'Power', 'Management', 'Motivation']"
"Conciliating Between Polities:
A Pragmatic Study on Contemporary Visual Artists in the Netherlands",Milica Jovićević,2018-05-15,['Stocco Ferreira'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Literature suggests that there is a presiding romanticized notion of what it is to be an artist, where they encompass the charismatic myth and thus use an aesthetic logic as the guide to make artwork. With today’s evolving post-industrial society, the traditional art career is of question, and for it to sustain itself in a modern-day context, literature indicates artists must conciliate between two forms of (non) mutually exclusive logics – the “aesthetic” and “market” logic. There are numerous factors that to extent provoke a conciliation process between these two polities, such as the role of the art academy, artistic labor markets, private versus public funding, and the relationships between artists and selling. Thus, via qualitative semi-structured interviews, a thematic analytical tool and a pragmatic sociological perspective, this study sets foot into understanding, how do contemporary visual artists in the Netherlands conciliate between the market and aesthetic logic, since graduating from a fine arts academy.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'charismatic myth', 'art academies', 'artistic careers', 'aesthetic logic', 'market logic', 'pragmatic sociology']"

How green-er are international students becoming in the Netherlands? Exploring recycling as pro-environmental behavior among university students,"Gómez Endara, Estefanía",2018-03-07,['Arsel Murat'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Current household consumption including the immense waste that it carries, accounts as one of the highest determinants of environmental impact and subsequently climate change due to methane generation of burned material. Recycling behavior then is one of the main solutions towards such consumption for which becomes essential to understand more and more the drivers of pro-environmental recycling behavior. Its understanding could predict barriers towards mitigation and resilience. Usually university students are not the subject of recycling empirical studies. Therefore, this paper analyses university students from the International Institute of Social Studies of Erasmus Rotterdam University and whether their recycling behavior has changed while residing in The Netherlands and specifically under the local environmental policies of The Hague.  

Environmental behavior can be analyzed in a wide variety of forms. This paper focus on the interplay and synergy of internal and external factors that influence pro-environmental behavior. Through a mixed methodology research including an online survey, semi-structured interview to students, environmental policy advisors of the Municipality of THe Hague and student residence managers this research paper will then answer whether behavioral changes is proved through an amalgamation of internal and external factors and the influence of policy instruments.   A positive behavioral change was perceived among students, nonetheless, it was only under certain circumstances and conditions that this occurred. Hence, it is necessary that internal and external factors are deeper analyzed when policy making is being carried.","['International university students', 'The Hague', 'recycling', 'pro-environmental behavior', 'waste management and waste generation', 'external and internal factors']"

Perceived impact of music festivals on the development of the hosting cities: a case study of Carpino Folk Festival,Maria Giovanna Castigliego,2018-02-09,['Frans Brouwer'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This paper focuses on effects of music festivals on the cities that host them as perceived by the local population and the organizers. The paper uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the effects in terms of recreation/socialization, culture/education, tourism, internal revenue generation, natural resources, external revenue generation, community pride/spirit and image creation/change. The design of the research is a case study on the Carpino Folk Festival in the Foggia area (Italy). An interview with the organizers of the festival have been conducted. Subsequently, a questionnaire about the same topics have been prepared and handed in to a sample of 150 people from Carpino. The research has found that the festival has had a remarkable impact on the community of Carpino in all aforementioned fields. Nevertheless, the perceptions of the festival slightly varied between organizers and residents. Both parties agree that the festival improves the image of the city and boosts sales of most of the local shops, cafés and restaurants. Concerning the cultural aspects, festival organizers are sceptical about the local youth’s interest in folk music; but the results of the questionnaire show how Carpino’s youth, instead, enjoys and engages in tradition-related activities. Limitations of the research and suggestions for further research are also discussed.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Music festivals', 'Tourism', 'Impact on cities', 'Carpino Folk Festival', 'Image Development']"
Contemporary dancing and the role of Art Schools in the careers of Dancers: A study of the artistic labor market in Greece.,"Varsou, A.",2018-01-23,['Vermeylen F.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Over the past years, cultural economists’ interest was attracted by the working lives of artists and the particularities and peculiarities of the artistic labor market, compared to the general labor market. Using these findings as an inspiration, this thesis focuses on the Greek artistic labor market and specifically on the labor market of Greek contemporary dancers. The Greek market appears to be an interesting study case, because of the complexity of its economy, which was hit by the financial crisis. The primary aim of the study is the exploration of the effect of dance schools on dancers’ careers and the investigation of the extent to which schools contribute to their success. For the purposes of this study, an extensive research is conducted, through the distribution of a structured questionnaire and the collection of quantitative data which are then statistically analyzed. The findings of the study suggest that schools affect significantly the artistic careers of contemporary dancers in Greece, by providing them with theoretical knowledge and practical skills, training on different techniques and opportunities of networking and professional rehabilitation. Schools achieve this by contributing to the formation of dancers’ mentality and discipline, and by helping dancers to find a job due to the school’s name and reputation. Regarding the nature of this effect, it differs within the different dance schools in which each dancer has studied and may be either positive or negative.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship']"

Within this thesis, narrative cues are elements within the story world that draw the attention of the spectator, and therefore direct a spectator’s gaze towards important plot elements within the virtual world. This study employs a mixed method approach, which combines qualitative expert interviews with qualitative content analysis. The results show that narrative cues, either diegetic or non-diegetic, work collectively towards a similar goal, namely, a spectator who better comprehends the plot. Moreover, maintaining the spectator’s feeling of presence throughout the experience, the type of narrative, and the developer’s aesthetic objectives, have shown to be of vital importance with regards to the use of narrative cues in cinematic virtual reality content.","['media', 'business', 'Cinematic virtual reality', 'narrative cues', 'interactive narrative', 'virtual reality films', 'gaze direction']"

Alternative for care for children in Brazil: how social norms are influencing judges’ capacity to fulfil the child’s right to family and community living,"Cascao de Almeida McCann, Cassia",2017-12-15,['Cheney Kristen Cheney'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study looks into how the standards of child care, shaped by the
Convention on the Rights of Child (CRC) and UN Guidelines for Alternative
Care of Children have led to progressive reforms of Brazil’s alternative childcare
system. The current gap that exists between law and practice in this realm has
been associated with social norms that are in ways determining judges’ ability
and willingness to comply with Brazil’s internationally embraced plan. The research
aims to show that efforts must be made to engage with judges at a local
level throughout the country to increase commitment to the country’s initiative
to move away from the institutional systems that have been predominant
throughout Brazil’s history. To present this case, I have utilized both theoretical
and analytical methods to attain a deeper understanding of the elements creating
the reality of the role of the judiciary and more specifically of judges in the country’s
intricate alternative care system. The relationship between law and social
development and law and governance along with sociological approaches such
as the social construct of childhood and norm socialization were all considered
in the Brazilian context and combined with an investigative study revealing the
evolution of Brazil’s contemporary child based approach to alternative care. To
better understand the magnitude of a judge’s duty and how social norms can
affect that responsibilities, a capacity gap analysis was performed. The data used
to perform this analysis was collected in Brazil through a series of interviews
with over twenty individuals including judges, heads of ministries and grassroots
workers. Their testaments confirmed among other things, that a judge’s commitment
and leadership in this movement are paramount in ensuring the implementation

Forest fire contest : The case of forest fire policy design in Indonesia,"Aminingrum, Aminingrum",2017-12-15,['Arsel Murat'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The Indonesian government actions to countermine Forest fires fail and lack public trust. This issue becomes more complicated when forest fire effects are followed by another series of problematic impacts. For example, forest fires create haze disasters, then the haze affects health,
transportation, the economic etc. This problem makes forest fire extinguishing activity a perpetual
and never-ending story. Researchers find out that the incongruence between the causes of fires and
proposed management solutions occur in countries all over the world, including in Indonesia.
The Indonesian Government spends large amounts of money to extinguish forest fires, but forest fires still occur and sometimes become worse in El-Nino and drought seasons. Forest fire researchers claim that there is a discrepancy between the causes of forest fire. This research defines and categorizes 2 approaches based on the causes. They are: the technical approach which is the idea of a single frame to extinguish the fire. Meanwhile, the social, environmental, and political approach refers to the fact that forest fire management is not just management to extinguish ‘the fire’ but a complexity of the nature of ‘fire’ which pertains to the effects of other issues that also have a secondary impact.
Severe weather contributes to making the effect of forest fire broad and uncontrollable, but it does not ignite the fire. In 2015, 99% forest fires happened because of human burning activity. Then after the 2015 conflagration, forest fire policy was renewed, revoked, and recreated. Since 2015, all burning activity has been forbidden no exception made for swidden. However, although a reduction of forest fires nevertheless was achieved in 2017 many researchers claim that oil palm plantations and
swidden cultivation are the culprits of the forest fires.
This piece of research wants to understand why the fire policy implementation continues using the technical approach dominantly over the years. For over 18 years forest fires continue to happen; the question has arisen examining what the challenge and obstacles are that forest fire policy design does not consider as well as the social, environmental and political causes of forest fires, together with the technical causes in the policy process and implementation.","['forest fires', 'haze', 'government policy design', 'palm oil', 'swidden cultivation', 'technical causes', 'social', 'environmental', 'and political causes of forest fire']"
Gender power relations in the Upper West Region of Ghana : The role of the woman peasant in the education of the girl-child in Goripe.,"Baliebanoe, Juliet Anataba",2017-12-15,['Harcourt Wendy'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study sought to understand the multiple strategies women farmers in Goripie in the Upper West Region of Ghana employ to ensure the education of the girl-child, in spite of the numerous challenges they face on a daily basis. The study employed the use of qualitative research methods to examine the perspectives of various stakeholders (women, women groups, NGOs, teachers, agricultural extension officers) on how gender power relations play out in the study area especially in the allocation of resources such as land. Using agency theory, concepts such as gender power relations, among others to guide the study, the findings show that, women’s access to land rights in Goripie is discriminatory because,
customarily, women in this part of Ghana do not own lands. This infringement of women’s rights has been a barrier to their empowerment. Additionally, findings from the study also reveal that from birth, there are gender inequalities in most households in Goripie and boys are given preferential treatment over girls. The study recommends that in order for gender equality to be achieved, efforts should be made by development actors to change the structures that create inequality between men and women. Resource investment in women will empower them and increase their incomes/livelihoods and decision-making power and this will directly contribute to the education of the girl child.","['gender power relations', 'empowerment', 'peasant women', 'farming', 'education', 'girls', 'Goripie', 'Ghana']"
Gender norms perspectives: women labour and artisanal small-scale gold mining in Wa East district of Ghana,"Yahaya, Abdallah",2017-12-15,['Gomez G.M. (Georgina)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Women participation in the ASM has gained worldwide recognition especially in Ghana. Despite the fact that women are highly represented in the
sector, forming close to about 50% of the labour force, yet their activities are often discriminated against.
Through a case study of artisanal mining in Wa East District of Ghana, this paper explores the political dynamics of gender roles in the ASM sector in ascertaining the impact of mining on women and their immediate surroundings. To achieve this, the study dwelled on a number of approaches such as
gender and development (GAD), labour feminisation and occupational sex segregation in examining the issue.
Findings from the research revealed that, artisanal mining presents a paradox: as more women are venturing in to the sector, more and more are being
discriminated, stigmatised, and treated unequally with their male counterparts, partly because of the prevailing social norms and the culture of the community. This warranted the adoption of various off-farm and farm income diversification strategies by the women in augmenting their income levels for survival. Such strategies include: Pito brewing, Shea-butter production, trading, and some re-investing in to farming in an attempt to secure sustainable incomes. However, the state laws and policies are very silent about women
involvement in the sector.","['artisanal', 'Ghana', 'labour', 'mining', 'participation', 'small-scale mining']"
"The nature, extent and causes of food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa","Uozawa, Naoki",2017-12-15,['Nicholas H.V.B. (Howard)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) continues to exist, in spite of the rising awareness of the problem within and outside of the region. The traditional explanations tend to focus on such factors as the absence of the necessary technical expertise and corrupt administrations failing to liberalise food production and imports. Others, returning to themes developed in the traditional ‘Dependency’ literature, have pointed to the possibility that prevalent food insecurity in SSA serves the interests of those seeking to obtain plentiful and cheap supplies of the much-needed raw materials which the region possesses. This research paper considers the nature, extent and causes of food insecurity in SSA. The analysis shows
(1) the problem of food security in SSA is extensive and has worsened over the recent past in contrast to most other developing countries, and (2) the source of the problem is the global and domestic institutional environments which condition food production and price in the region and which are shaped by the necessity of the regions continue role as a global provider of cheap raw materials for the developed world. The implication of the study is that a basic food self-sufficiency strategy is indispensable for attaining greater food security for
the majority of the SSA populations, and their attempt to break free of the dependent divisions of labour imposed on them.","['food security', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'food production', 'food Price', 'food self-sufficiency', 'institution']"

"The role of debts in facilitating land grabbing/dispossession:  a case study of Kibaigwa Ward, Dodoma Region-Tanzania","Muro, Alice Exaud",2017-12-15,['Visser Oane'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study uses the Sustainable Rural Livelihood framework to understand the role of credit/debit in facilitating land grabbing/dispossession while exploring the link between land dispossession and debts. This is the case study of Kibaigwa ward in Kongwa district, Dodoma Tanzania whereby, like in other rural areas, agriculture is the main source of livelihood. The area is characterized by small scale and large-scale farmers but because of the availability of international crop market and good infrastructure mainly Morogoro road, it has attracted a number of formal and informal financial institutions as well as individual money lenders.
Empirically, the study findings show the clear link between debt and land dispossession either through collateral taking in case of debt repayment failure or involuntary selling of land to secure other collaterals mainly houses. This is due to the poor financial institutions management policies coupled with the land tenure system which does not favour rural poor as well as unreliable climatic condition which largely affects agriculture. Furthermore, land dispossession is facilitated by population increase of which farms mostly regarded as infertile have being converted into settlement areas. Scholars argue that, although not all credits are bad analysis of land and financial institutional processes and organizational structure that govern credit are of vital importance including involvement of local people to let their knowledge, perceptions and interests to be heard (Gerber 2013; Scoones as cited by Krantz 2001:2).","['land grabbing', 'dispossession', 'credit/debt', 'sustainable livelihood', 'agriculture financialization']"

This approach has shown the negative impacts of such practices—in terms of generating social conflicts, environmental hazard, and impoverishment of coastal communities—through an ‘interdisciplinary understanding’ used to complement the analytic tools. Yet, it did not clearly bind with coevolutionary studies which also concerned with the interrelated issues of environmental change, social, and economic. This study is intended to indicate the need of incorporating a co-evolutionary framework into this approach in order to understanding the more complex social forces in extensive shrimp farming area.
Life history interviews is employed as the main research technique, apart from participant observation and secondary data collections. The objective is to obtain thorough information about the environmental and social (including political and economic) transformation of a particular village which is located in the (mangrove) protected forest of Muara Gembong, Indonesia. It was a productive extensive aquaculture area (shrimp and milkfish farming) for a few decades. A greater attention is therefore given to narratives about the past in chronological order: pre-productive, productive, and post-productive periods. The result of this research reveals the power contestation over the protected area, mangrove depletion, and coevolution between the environmental change and social dynamic in the Ujung Krawang protected forest.","['political ecology', 'coevolutionary environmental history', 'extensive shrimp aquaculture', 'mangrove ecosystem', 'environmental degradation']"
Greening the land restoration question : Exploring tensions between gold mining and land restitution for black communities in Colombia,"Rodríguez Junco, Yeny Lorena",2017-12-15,['Arsel M.

Experiences on land restitution, such as the South African, have
demonstrated that land restoration is not a panacea for solving far larger rural problems (Walker 2008:227). This research aims to problematize the master narrative by studying, from a political ecology approach, the way the Colombian State has addressed the environmental conflicts caused by uncontrolled gold mining in black communities territories from the Colombian Pacific coast. I will
argue that a land restitution policy carried out over territories that are on dispute for the control of its natural resources, should put at the center the environmental conflicts in order to guarantee the effective and sustainable restoration of territory. I will do this by analyzing the case of the regressive territorial restructuring of places and spaces (Holt-Gimenez 2008) of the Community Council of the

two communities in Ghana-Tanchara and Cherikpong. In Tanchara, mining operations have been
halted and the company’s stage of operations was limited to prospecting, but in Cherikpong, the
company is at an advanced stage of exploration with the next stage being mining. Using a comparative approach, the paper identifies the reasons that led to Tanchara successfully resisting mining but Cherikpong could not.
I argue throughout this paper that the success of a local resistance movement is possible through the advancement of reasons of livelihood, ecological impacts, the sacredness of nature and above
all spirituality. These are only possible if there is unity between the elite and the traditional opinion leaders. The paper establishes that the influence of policy entrepreneurs in such a situation is paramount
in achieving success. This is demonstrated by the collaboration between the Tanchara community and Centre for Indigenous Knowledge and Organizational Development (CIKOD) in the deployment of a biocultural community protocol (BCP) in resisting Azumah Resources in the Tanchara community leading to the absolute rejection of mining.","['environmentalism', 'environmental conflicts', 'local communities', 'resistance', 'Ghana', 'Tanchara', 'Cherikpong', 'movements', 'livelihoods', 'Biocultural Community Protocol (BCP)']"

The corruption in forestry has been understood as an institutional problem and resolution has been proposed through regulatory measures. In Pakistan’s context the state has intervened through different policy and regulatory measures, albeit, illegal logging continues. The state and timber mafia are seen as two separate entities that compete or collude with each other for personal benefits.
By taking Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Project as a case in point, this study explains that corruption in forestry sector in Pakistan exists as complex social networks of different state and non-state actors. These actors have dynamic and fluid identities, thus the binary between ‘public’ and ‘private’ is blurred. The social networks are driven by not just economic interests but also ‘logics of sociality’; payments and favours based on cultural, familial and social norms. Local power relations and politics play an important role in these networks for resource capturing. Furthermore, I show how the power relations result in inclusion of some sections of society in conservation practices, while marginalizing others.","['state', 'timber mafia', 'forest conservation', 'Billion Tree Tsunami', 'social networks']"

any democratic election. In-group and cognitive biases are frequently reported
to influence our decision-making and judgment, including voting decisions,
which may lead to illogical decisions and counter self-interest in the longer
term. This paper investigates such decision biases in the case of the gubernatorial
election in Jakarta. The electoral process in this case was widely seen to be
marked by intolerance and discrimination against minorities rather than more
substantive policy issues. I explore two plausible drivers of voting behavior and
related biases, religion and socio-economic status, to analyze the paradox of high
satisfaction of the candidate’s work performance and the actual election result.
To this end, I use survey experiments with priming treatments in an original
dataset of 228 respondents in Jakarta. The priming with religious cues substantially
provoked emotions, in-line with previous studies. The evidence suggests
that religiously motivated voting behavior is salient, and stronger than economicstatus
anxiety. The evidence points to strong in-group bias. This present study
argues that ‘ethno-religious economic’ motivations may explain paradoxical election
results. Overall, the results complement previous studies in the area of social

The Political Economy of Media Coverage toward the Corruption Scandal in Indonesia,"Sitepu, Ardhy Dinata",2017-12-15,['Sparrow Robert'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper discusses the impact of government advertising and political affiliation of media ownership to the coverage of corruption scandal in Indonesia in 2013 and 2015. There are three theoretical frameworks used in this research, including the propaganda model, the oligarch, and the collusion. These theoretical frameworks, together with the literature, and the empirical evidence construct the model used in this research. For measuring the impact of advertising and political affiliation to the front pages, I use the panel dataset with fixed effect model and Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) as the estimator. The finding strongly supports the negative and significant contribution of advertising to the front pages of a corruption scandal. However, the result does not confirm the significant impact of political affiliation to the front pages. The impact of political affiliation to the front pages of corruption is measured by comparing the trend of coverage and the political background of media ownership. The result found that newspaper which has the political affiliation with the government tend to hide corruption scandal than other newspapers without political affiliation.","['Advertising', 'Political Affiliation', 'Corruption', 'Media Coverage', 'Economic Development']"
Microcredit and Children’s Cognitive Outcomes: Evidence from Indonesia,"Saputra, Romas Adi",2017-12-15,['Rieger Matthias'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper studies the effect of microcredit on children’s cognitive outcomes using panel data from Indonesia. The research paper attempts to provide novel evidence on the effect of microcredit on non-monetary outcomes such as human capital formation in children. To this end, the paper investigates the association between microcredit participation and the children’s cognitive test score in two periods of time.
The data comes from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS), allowing for a panel analysis and a rich set of co-variate. The first two results from the analysis of descriptive statistics and household wealth indicators suggest that borrowers are wealthier and the microcedit participation notably generates income. However, there is no significant effect on child education. Further, there is suggestive evidence that microcredit is negatively associated with cognitive scores, yet the effect is insignificant and not robust. The paper then examines possible channels through which microcredit may impact child outcomes. It is found that microcredit does not increase the likelihood that mothers work nor the age of children. In sum, there is little evidence that microcredit impacts cognitive outcomes – for better and for worse. Further work is needed to examine the robustness of this finding and other channels and related heterogeneities.","['Microcredit', 'microfinance', 'MFI', 'cognitive outcome', 'IFLS', 'channels', 'mechanisms', 'Cognitive Achievement Production Function (CAPF)', 'fixed effect model', 'control variables']"
"Masculinity, Sexuality and Japanese sexual slavery system in World War Two: Discourses of Justification and Dissent","Arimatsu, Sayaka",2017-12-15,['Zarkov Dubravka Zarkov'],International Institute of Social Studies,"During World War Two, the Japan’s military system of sexual slavery, the so-called

pleasure to soldiers of the Japan’s Imperial Army, as a part of the military plan of the
Empire of Japan. As a result, an estimated 200,000 women and girls from the territories
colonized and occupied by Japan and Japan’s mainland were taken into the system. This
research analyzes and compares documents and arguments issued between the 1930s and
1940s, when the Japan’s sexual system was established, with the statements and arguments
in today’s Japan, specifically in 2013 and 2014. The purpose of the research is to
understand how understanding of masculinity, sexuality, race and nationhood within the
Japanese government and Imperial Army played the role of justifying the system. The
analysis tells two main findings: first, patriarchal ideas about male (and female) sexuality,
the nation and political ambitions, as well as ideas about Japanese racial hierarchies
encouraged the Imperial Army to establish and justify the sexual slavery system. Second,
many of those ideas remain in the contemporary Japan’s politics that continues denying
responsibility for the sexual slavery system and survivors. At the same time, new
discourses of denial have appeared, linked to the renewed power of nationalism in Japan.","['the Imperial Army', 'the Empire of Japan', 'the Japanese government', 'system of sexual slavery', 'World War Two', 'military', 'masculinity', 'gender', 'sexuality', 'race', 'nationhood']"

relations on gender, sexuality, class, and ethnicity. People having these characteristics

War economies in peacetime: the Colombian context after The Havana peace agreement,"Guío Pérez, Nadia Alejandra",2017-12-15,['Jayasundara Shyamika'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The Colombian armed conflict, characterised by the involvement of several actors,
guerrillas, paramilitary groups, state military forces, and criminal
organisations, has had differentiated regional impacts and dynamics over the national
territory. For more than five decades, all non-state armed groups have
financed their actions, stability, and political discourse (if there is any) through
diverse illegal economic activities, from drugs’ trafficking to gold mining, kidnapping,
smuggling and timber exploitation and trafficking, among others. The
influence of the international community, especially regarding the war against
drugs, as well as of the illegal global markets and the immersion of the private
sector, has also shaped the conflict.
Currently, Colombia is living a transition stage towards peace with the signed, in
November 2016, of the ‘Final Agreement to End the Armed Conflict and Build
a Stable and Lasting Peace’ after four years of peace talks between the national
government and the FARC-EP guerrilla, the major non-state armed group. The
transition scenario after ten months of implementation is not promising, the expected
changes were not clear-cut, while difficulties were. This study aims to
explore the problematic nature of the peace, now that the major non-state actor
is out of the play, and its uneasy relationship with localised and resource-related
increases in violence and resource extraction involved in criminalised war economies
in drugs and gold.
This study combined quantitative and qualitative data to understand the current
context in the major gold and coca producer areas. The theoretical framework
used to analyse the findings was the transformational peacebuilding approach,
and the rational choice theory, focused on the war economy literature.
A key finding of this research is that the economic benefit of the criminalised
war economies of drugs and gold keeps the non-state armed groups active and
incentives alliances and disputes between them, in the local and regional scenarios.
This parallel extra-legal economy also has generated fragmentations within
non-state armed actors, constituting a kind of anarchical insurgent and criminal
map and projecting a new conflict stage rather than peace. Parallel, the perpetuated
horizontal inequalities between national, urban, and regional elites, and rural
marginalised and minority populations are used to explore other than economic
explanations of the persistence of non-state armed actors, high and localised
violence and war economies in peacetime.","['conflict', 'war economy', 'peace', 'peacebuilding', 'greed', 'grievance', 'crime']"

Rwanda especially among the small business in the informal sector by taking the case study of street
vendors in Nyarugenge District. It was directed by the following three precise objectives: to evaluate
whether street vendors are financially included or not and to what extent, to assess the relationship
between socio economic characteristics of street vendors owners and their financial inclusion level
and the availability of financial institutions in their villages. Finally, to find out why some street
vendors are not financially included. The study used two methods (quantitative and qualitative) which
support the researcher in describing and explaining the status of financial inclusion among street
vendors. The research got randomly 100 respondents for providing information in a form of face to
face questionnaire survey and a semi-structured interview with 3 key informants from financial
institutions and one of a district officer in charge of financial affairs. While secondary data was
collected through a desk review of relevant related documents by doing archives analysis. After collecting the needed information, the study proceeded to data analysis where quantitative data were
analyzed using logit model, descriptive statistics, and cross-tabulation (MS Excel). The results of the
study indicated that only 53% corresponding to the majority were account holders, while 47% do not
have an account. Again, the results of the study showed that street vendors who live in the village with
at least one financial institution are more likely to be financially included compared to street vendors
living in the village with no financial institution. Also, the results indicated that males’ street vendors
are more likely to hold accounts than females, but this is not statistically significant. The study also
indicated that most of the street vendors had limited education, most of them attended only primary
school education. Regarding statistics, participants replied that most of their beneficiaries are ranged
between 20-30 years old. Furthermore, socio-economic characteristics of beneficiaries do not matter
when looking at service delivered in the process of delivering financial services. Again, the study
indicated that limited capital, lack of information, the high value of monthly transaction charges,
financial illiteracy and other factors like lack of important credentials were limiting barriers to financial inclusion. The research paper recommends that all participants in financial inclusion should be
focused on looking for how low limited capital business doers be favored in accessing, affording and
using financial services to warrant the great development for all.","['Rwanda', 'financial inclusion', 'informal sector', 'street vendor']"

exploitation is not an alien phenomenon in Ghana. However, the competing
debate on whether Ghana is already suffering, not suffering or can escape
the Resource Curse make is imperative to examine the economic situation pre
and post oil discovery to ascertain the possibility of Ghana not falling to victim
to RC. We are asked two questions to understand the extent the variables of
Resource Curse from the structuralist and institutionalist economics have effects
on the Ghana economy at the advent of oil discovery in commercial quantity in
Ghana and how can Ghana economy avoid becoming a victim of Resource
Curse?. The findings revealed that the variables that structural economists argued
that will cause Dutch Disease has not yet prevailed in Ghana, and although,
the volatility of Terms of Trade, price of commodities, and Real Exchange Rate had impact on the economic growth of Ghana but did not find any correlation
with hindrances in the export diversification. The study however argued that the
panacea to the effect of these variables on the economy growth of Ghana is
intertwined with policy response of Ghana to mitigate the effect. In conclusion,
we argued that the oil discovery come at a time that Ghana seems to be better
equipped, both with tools and historical know-how, to avoid past mistakes. This
is something the neighbouring countries such as Nigeria and Serial Leone did
not have when diamond and oil were discovered in the countries.","['Resource curse', 'Dutch Disease', 'Ghana', 'Structuralist', 'Institutionalist', 'Term of Trade', 'Volatility', 'Institutions', 'Real Exchange Rate', 'Oil Discovery', 'Export']"
"Is wives’ overseas migration a deterrent to the
labor supply behavior of non-migrant spouse
and school attendance of children left-behind?
Evidence from the Philippines Temporary Migration","Daquio, Carl Rookie O.",2017-12-15,['Bedi Arjun S.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"A key feature of the Philippine overseas migration is the increasing female migrants
working outside their home. It is of interest that migrant women highly
dominate overseas employment for the last decade who had to leave their homes
and endure long years of family separation. The aim of this research was to determine
how the migration of wives impacts the labor supply behavior or motivation
to work of the husbands and the school outcomes of the children left
behind. To achieve this objective, a combination of quantitative and qualitative
methods was employed to address the research question.

First, I modeled husbands’ participation in the labor market activities
and school outcomes of children using nationally representative merged dataset
on labor force and family income surveys and correct for the endogeneity of the
migration status of wives using migrant networks. Results show that stayer husbands
significantly reduce their hours of work and shift from being permanent
to short-term employed persons. The reduced labor supply of the stayer husbands
could be associated with an increasing proportion of men becoming less
economically active due to their participation in the household or family duties
due to the absent-wives. Meanwhile, the effect of migration also promotes productive
investment, particularly in children’s education. However, much of the
positive effect of migration is largely driven by boy’s attendance in school than
girls. Second, I also interviewed female migrants at selected Middle East destination
countries to understand transnational family relationships. The study
found out that absent wives decide to work abroad based on the cooperation of
their husbands to provide better welfare of their family, particularly children.
This affirms parents’ altruistic attitude in terms of maximizing resources that
benefit the whole family.","['female labor participation', 'overseas migration', 'household labor allocation', 'Heckman’s two-step procedure']"
The Impact on Economic Growth of Nigeria’s Oil Dependency,Momodu Itua Kingsley,2017-12-15,['Nicholas Howard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Since the discovery of oil in Nigeria in 1956, the production and dependence of oil has steadily increased and has had a great impact on its economy. With the recent decline in oil price and subsequent fall in economic growth, this research paper aims to show how limiting oil dependency has been for the growth pro-cess, which is measured by gross domestic product (GDP). The scope of the paper will touch on the nature and extent of Nigeria’s oil dependency in relation to its lack of diversification in the oil sector to the non-oil sector, particularly the manufacturing sector. Through the use of empirical methods such as Explora-tory Data Analysis (EDA), and a range of qualitative and quantitative data, the relationship between oil and GDP growth is studied to show the impact oil has had on the Nigerian economy since 1969.

The findings of this research demonstrate there is a positive correlation be-tween oil dependency and GDP growth which is affected by a lack of diversification and the fluctuations in world oil price. The volatility of the economic growth can be attributed to the fluctuations in oil price, meanwhile the lack of sustained growth is a consequence of the lack of diversification. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a need to introduce policies which promote di-versification from the oil sector into the non-oil sector, especially the manufacturing sector, so as to experience a sustained economic growth.","['Diversification', 'manufacturing', 'sustained growth', 'oil sector', 'non-oil sector', 'GDP', 'economy', 'volatility', 'fluctuation', 'oil dependence', 'oil price', 'oil revenue', 'economic growth']"
More than goods: trade in welfare through foods,"Canales Gómez, Ana Cristina",2017-12-15,['van Bergeijk Peter'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper examines the impact of trade openness over child and general population food
security in Latin American countries, except for Haiti, Cuba and the Small Caribbean States,
between 1985 and 2016. In order to do so, we regress 5 trade indicators over 6 food security
indicators using a FE panel data model and controlling for macroeconomic situation and the
number of food security programmes implemented by each country in each year.
Our results suggest that there is a strong influence of trade over the reduction of undernutrition
in its different forms, improving food security in Latin America. Imports have improved weightfor-
height and height-for-age indicators due to improvements in food availability, both in
nutritional variety and quality. This suggests a stabilization of seasonal fluctuations in food access
and consequent prevalence of infectious diseases. On the other hand, exports seemed to have
produced an income effect, which in turn has enabled the reduction of extreme forms of
undernutrition and allowed for the purchase of more nutritious food.","['Undernourishment', 'undernutrition', 'anthropometric indicators', 'food deficit', 'Trade', 'Trade Balance', 'Latin America']"
"Employment, poverty and redistribution in Ecuador; A minimum wage story?","Muñoz Bravo, Julio César",2017-12-15,['Bedi Arjun'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper examines the effects of minimum wage over labour income, poverty and underemployment in Ecuador during the period 2007 to 2016. For such objective, this research relies on pooled cross section data obtained from the December editions of the National Survey of Employment, Underemployment and Unemployment of Ecuador between the years 2007 and 2016. The paper uses different approaches for each one of the intended outcomes: in terms of labour income, we will use kernel density plots and Lorenz dominance tests, and assess whether there are improvements in the distribution of income after the implementation of minimum wage policy; for the measurement over poverty and underemployment, we will use a probit model; and to analyze the effect of minimum wages over labour income distribution we will use OLS and quantile regressions.

The main findings of this paper are that there is a compression of labour income and informal employment distribution due to an increase of the minimum wage, which is observed in the poorest percentiles of the population, hence there is a relevant link to poverty-alleviation in Ecuador. Consequently we find evidence of poverty reduction due to an increase of minimum wage. The novelty about this paper is the finding that an increase in minimum wage decreases the probabilities of being underemployed within the informal sector.","['Minimum wage', 'underemployment', 'labour income', 'poverty', 'formal employment', 'informal employment', 'Ecuador']"

"Legitimising Adolescent Girls’ Voices: Menstrual Cup as the Mediator
of Menstrual Hygiene Management in Urban Informal Settlements in
Kenya","Miriti, Sheila Makena",2017-12-15,['Cheney Kristen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Adolescent sexual and reproductive health, particularly for adolescent girls’ in
Low and Middle-Income Countries has emerged as a fundamental policy issue
in the post-International Conference on Population and Development era.
Despite the post ICPD progress, access to adolescent sexual and reproductive
health has been incommensurable for adolescent girls in LMICs. Extensive
literature document that poor, disenfranchised and marginalized adolescent
girls in the urban informal settlements bear the highest burden, especially as
pertaining to menstrual hygiene management. In Kenya these girls face unique
infrastructural challenges associated with high population densities, dilapidated
housing structures, abject poverty, limited access to WASH facilities, and high
insecurity and crime incidences. Compounding this further, is the material
poverty, social norms, taboos and gendered power relations in which their
menstrual experiences are embedded. For such girls, menstrual hygiene
management has emerged as a fundamental human right and gender equality
issue that necessitate multi-level and multi-sectorial policy interventions.
In social policies, menstrual hygiene management is approached from a
technocentric perspective. However, menstruation is theorized as neither
purely biological nor purely sociocultural. Its technical and sociocultural
approaches are thus, essential to the way it is understood, experienced and
intervened in. In the recent past, menstrual hygiene management discourses
has subtly shifted to the most cost effective and culturally appropriate hygiene
products. The menstrual cup has been conceptualized as the most appropriate
for girls in urban informal settlements. With this in mind, this research was an
attempt to bring to the fore the menstrual experiences of adolescent girls in
Kibera, the biggest slum in Kenya. First, it explored whether the menstrual cup
could be framed as a mediator of the menstrual hygiene management
challenges these girls face. Second, it aimed to deconstruct the dominant
technocentric way menstrual hygiene management is approached.
The research findings point to the need for a nexus to be created
between the technocentric and sociocultural approaches to menstrual hygiene
management. Further, they point towards the potential of menstrual cup as the
mediator of menstrual hygiene management in urban poor locales. Finally, they
illuminate the girl’s resilience and potential to transform the dominant
vulnerability discourses in adolescent-centred social policies. Rather than
vulnerable, the girls are social actors that could transform their social worlds.
However, for them to realize sexual and reproductive health rights and
menstrual hygiene management, policy actors should address the material and
discursive situations in which their menstrual experiences are embedded.","['Adolescent sexual and reproductive health', 'menstruation', 'menstrual hygiene management', 'urban informal settlements', 'adolescent girls', 'vulnerability', 'social actors', 'social policies']"

Compensation for Torture Victims in Uganda: Explaining and Addressing the Delays,"Kajobe, Harriet Rwakabbira",2017-12-15,['Arts Karin'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Compensation as part of the right to remedy is internationally recognised
and provided for in various legal instruments. However, swift payment of compensation
for victims of torture has been a challenge for many states. In Uganda,
this can partly be attributed to the prevailing political environment, the legal
framework in place governing the payment of compensation, and implementation
issues.
This paper examines the underlying factors that are responsible for the delay
of compensation for torture victims in Uganda from the time of award by the
Uganda Human Rights Commission Tribunal (UHRCT) up to the time of actual
payment or lack thereof.
The paper clarifies the state obligation in terms of providing compensation
to torture victims, the institutional framework and the power dynamics involved
and the follow up of the tribunal awards for compensation, the legal framework
and its accessibility, enforceability and challenges.
The study indicates that Uganda seemingly is committed to observing human
rights and effectuating compensation for torture victims. This is evidenced
by the laws, policies, directives and other human rights mechanisms in place or
still in the making. However, these efforts have not yet yielded sufficient tangible
results in practice. Legal, structural, institutional and individual power relations,
and administrative gaps still exist in the system of government in regard to efficient
and effective service delivery to victims of torture in the area of compensation.
The paper also formulates some recommendations of what could be done
to reduce on the delay of compensation to torture victims in Uganda in the future.","['torture', 'compensation', 'state obligation', 'power relations', 'human rights', 'Uganda']"

Experiences from Colombian Youth in the ‘Ser Pilo
Paga’ Program","Suárez Bautista, Edwin Danilo",2017-12-15,['Okwany Auma'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Exclusion from the Colombian higher education system has been a constant
over the years for vulnerable female and male youth. The internal armed conflict,
the limited coverage offered by the State, and the configuration of the system
itself have deprived a considerable portion of the population of education and
better life chances. To improve this situation, the recent governments have implemented
many initiatives that mainly seek the enhancement of access. However,
few have been the results. ‘Ser Pilo Paga’ is currently the most popular and
polemic program that has the mentioned goal.

This study draws on empirical evidence of a group of eighteen beneficiaries,
a government official as well as secondary data to analyse the social dynamics
produced by the implementation of the program. It demonstrates how those
dynamics are being influenced by long processes of social exclusion, traditional
policy structures, and social class differences. Simultaneously, the research
shows the way these intersections interfere in the individual positionalities of the
actors within the new context brought by the program. The findings unpacked
hidden failures that affect the ultimate goal of tackling social exclusion in a
broader sense, beyond the financial alleviation.","['Higher Education', 'Social Exclusion', 'Youth', 'University', 'Colombia']"

Are Universities Fostering or Constraining Critical Thinking Space toward Development?","Piuzzi Valle, Marcela Belén",2017-12-15,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper is about the political economy of education. In Nicaragua, universities historically represented important sites for revolutionary processes fostering critical thinking and action towards different systems of oppression. Nevertheless, the advances of neoliberalism since the 90ths, plus the comeback of the Sandinista party with a governance characterized by different human rights defenders as repressive and antidemocratic opens the question whether there is still space for critical thinking inside higher education.
Using Critical Pedagogy as the analytical framework and an interpretative methodology, this research papers aims to explore how and why the space for critical thinking on development in Nicaraguan universities fluctuated in recent years.
Some of the main findings illustrate an important historical shift about the role of public and private universities in Nicaragua. In addition, it shows the fundamental role that social movement and informal education plays on fostering a critical vision towards development.","['Education', 'Development', 'Critical thinking', 'Critical pedagogy', 'Universities']"

consequences of different senior secondary types attended to tertiary education entry. This
study is motivated by vocational education expansion planning in senior secondary and tertiary
education which is initiated by the Government of Indonesia in Ministry of Education's

Multinomial-Logit model is used to examine the senior high school types, Logit and Probit are
used to examine the decision on pursuing tertiary education. The main conclusions are (1)
parents with high education prefer academic senior high school than vocational high school for
their children, (2) the educational facilities availability has a significant impact to the school
choice, children who live in a district with vocational school share higher than general school
share tend to attend vocational senior high school than academic senior high school, (3)
parents’ education also has a positive and significant impact to the probability a child attending
tertiary education, parents’ with higher year of schooling higher possibility to send their
children to tertiary education, (4) children who attended vocational senior high school have a
lower probability to enrol in tertiary education compared to those who attended general senior

"Is Public Provisioning of Secondary
Education Equity Enhancing? A Case Study in
Bangladesh","Hossain, Md. Ismail",2017-12-15,['Chhachhi Amrita'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In recent years, the secondary education sector of Bangladesh is credited for its
increasing enrolment rate and gender parity. Major debates in this sector are revolving
around quality of education and high dropout rate. However, the problematic
government school provisioning system in promoting equity is limited
in education policy discourse. This paper argues that while direct Government
education provisioning through government schools are supposed to address
the existing inequality of opportunity in secondary education sector, the Government
provisioning itself creating inequity in access to education.
Using the case study method, the paper tried to provide insight on different
secondary school provisioning system in one (i.e., Tangail Sadar Upazila) of the
490 administrative units of Bangladesh. Based on the primary and secondary
data of the six carefully selected schools of the administrative unit, the study
assess the difference among the three types of schools (Government, Non-government
MPO and Non-government Private) in terms of resources, academic
performance, administration etc. Following that, the paper tried to validate its
argument by analysing differential access of students from different socio-economic
background to difference provisioning system.
The reveals that limited number of Government schools with limited seat
capacity and better educational resources/capacity are serving the need of financially
well off segment of urban population. Government is trying to address the
education need of rest of the population through subsidizing (MPO provisioning)
Non-government schools expense and project based stipend system. With
limited resources and capacity, MPO and private schools have become resort of
less privileged segment of population. While these segment of population afford
less, they pay the more to get less quality education.
Following the human capability approach, while state could expand its direct
provisioning for less privileged population, state excluded them from its
direct provisioning system. Instead of offering government resources to less
privilege class for promoting their equal footing, government exacerbating the
exiting inequality through promoting inequity of opportunity in the government
provisioning system. Inaccessibility to limited government school provisioning
is limiting the window of opportunity of those population who already have limited
opportunity.","['Secondary Education', 'Equity', 'Public Provisioning', 'Bangladesh', 'Opportunity', 'Education Policy']"
"Redefining the Invisible Victims of Incarceration: Survival
Strategies of Young Girls of Incarcerated Mothers in Ghana","Akodi, Precious Dede Teiko",2017-12-15,['Cheney Kristen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The number of incarcerated mothers in Ghana has increased in the last few years, with the vulnerabilities
of their children also increasing. Though much research has been carried out on children
whose mothers have been incarcerated, their voices are often missing. Girls develop interpersonal
relationships with their mothers when they start menstruating in order to learn more
about their sexuality and how to perform adult roles in their homes and communities. The absence
of mothers therefore causes emotional instabilities and engenders a number of risks in the
lives of young girls. During maternal incarceration, most girls live with relatives or alone without
any family support. Some family members abandon the children of their relatives who have been
incarcerated due to the shame, stigma and legal issues surrounding incarceration.
The child protection policy in Ghana does not address the needs of children whose mothers
have been incarcerated. In the face of family and policy neglect, young girls depend on their creativities,
friends and spiritual affiliations for survival. In this paper, I refer to these girls as ‘invisible
victims’ because of their non-recognition by government policies and programmes such as
the child and family welfare policy and the LEAP programme.
Findings from this research revealed that these invisible victims become silent, stigmatized and
suffer during maternal incarceration. Maternal incarceration has led to the truncation of some of
these girls education and some have become single mothers in the process of fighting to leverage
their vulnerabilities. Intergenerational poverty and child parenting are some cyclical deleterious
effects of maternal incarceration thus it is recommended that policy makers and organisations
should appreciate and recognize the struggles and vulnerabilities of these invisible victims and
provide support such as extension of the current social protection programme (LEAP) to address
their specific needs as right holders.","['Young girls', 'vulnerability', 'incarceration', 'mothers', 'invisible victims', 'survival']"
"Political Budget Cycles and the Indonesian Simultaneous Regional Direct
Elections in 2015","Priyono, Setyo Hari",2017-12-15,['Rieger Matthias'],International Institute of Social Studies,"There is an assumption that incumbent candidates often try maximizing their influence as the
heads of regional government to increase their probability of being re-elected in the second
period. Related to this assumption, this study examines the existence of local budget
utilization behaviour by incumbents who have politically interested policies. This study also
aims to analyse the probability of these incumbents of being re-elected.
This study focuses on 254 provincial and districts/cities in Indonesia which held
simultaneous regional head direct election in 2015 and examines regional heads’ fiscal policy
and how it is induced by political motivation. It analyses certain expenditures such as budget
deficits, total spending, and investment spending. The “other” budget category namely
discretionary funds, with which regional officials have discretionary power to allocate and
distribute, will also be observed. The funds consist of grants aid, social assistance
expenditures, and financial aid. All these local government spending are examined, in
particular related to the election year in 2015.

According to the results obtained, there is no indication of politically driven fiscal policy by
incumbent candidates in almost all spending categories. However, there is a positive and
significant relationship between the regions that have incumbents and grant expenditure
subcategory behaviour. This finding indicates that this subcategory expenditure is still
popular among incumbents to stimulate citizens and gain sufficient vote-share later on.
Surprisingly, the opposite effect of the cyclical behaviour appears in terms of the possibility
of winning the election. The total expenditure disbursement policy around election year will
be affect negative and significantly decrease the incumbents’ winning re-election.","['Political Budget Cycles', 'Fiscal Spending Policy', 'Simultaneous Regional Direct', 'Elections', 'Regional Elections in Indonesia']"

This research conducts a literature review focusing on three different channels:
academic literature, non-governmental reports and documentary films. The
study explores how is violence that surrounds young people’s especially young
female migrants’ decisions to emigrate, and that is experienced during migration
trails, which was addressed in the selected sources. It also seeks whether a relationship
between violence, youth and gender in the context of migration has
been described by the authors. The research reveals that many selected sources
did not use gender and generation as an analytical lens for analysis of experiences
of migrants. Also, most of the sources framed migrants as victims who are likely
to be recognized as ‘passive’ and ‘vulnerable’ objectives, while the few authors
captured that migrants’ agencies implement countermeasures against violence

Go-jek as Innovative Support for Motorcycle Taxi in Jakarta","Dina, Siti Alifah",2017-12-15,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Since 2010, the motorcycle-based transportation system in Jakarta has been institutionalised by a
start-up company named Go-jek through a mobile phone application. Due to the emergence of
Go-jek, the population of motorcycle taxi drivers are divided into two types: online and
traditional. Since then, the preference of customers has shifted to the online as it becomes the
most popular mode of transportation for the residents of Jakarta. Initially, motorcycle taxi
drivers are facing insecurities such as the absence of recognition and no protection related to
their work. Hence, this paper seeks to address whether the innovation by Go-jek plays a part in
reducing the vulnerability of motorcycle taxi drivers or not. It will be carried out by examining
Go-jek drivers’ (in)dependency, their type of entrepreneurship, and assets comparison with
traditional ojek drivers along with before-after comparison prior to joining Go-jek. Assets in this
context consist of financial productive assets, physical capital, human capital, and social capital.
The evidence suggests that Go-jek drivers are dependent self-employed workers. Almost all of
Go-jek drivers are classified into growth-oriented entrepreneurs while traditional ojek drivers are
survivalist entrepreneurs because of their initially different nature. The inclusiveness that Go-jek
claims do not seems to affect the drivers based on their asset vulnerability assessment, except for
the increasing social capital.","['Motorcycle taxi', 'Go-jek', 'Jakarta', 'workers’ dependency', 'entrepreneurship', 'assets vulnerability']"

target of witch-hunts. This research investigates how the intersection of gender,
socio-economic conditions, and old age contribute to witchcraft accusation
and banishment.
Gender, old age, and socio-economic conditions are some of the key factors
that influence witchcraft allegation and banishment of suspected witches. I
have argued that though each of these key statuses of power influence the process
of accusation, decision making in accusation cases, and the experiences of
the accused. However, none of these standing alone is enough to explain why
women located in these social statuses of power are the target of witchcraft
accusation. These statuses of power intersect to either mutually weaken or
strengthen each other. How decision is reached regarding the treatment of an
accused witch and the experience of an accused witch is dependent on her positioning
on these three social categories. Those positioned in better statuses
experience accusation differently than those located in lower ones. This shows
that the process of marginalization is context specific and the power dynamics
involved in each levels of witchcraft accusation are crucial for understanding
witchcraft branding and banishment.","['accusation', 'banishment', 'witchcraft', 'witches', 'power', 'allegation', 'branding']"
Continuity and Change: Prosecution of Sexual Violence in the International Criminal Court,"Mwangi, Naomi Wambui",2017-12-15,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research seeks to explore gender legacies of International Criminal Law and
how these can be diluted or strengthened according to context. The inclusion of
sexual violence against women and girls in ICC cases, like the Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo and Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo cases analysed in this study, may depend
on a number of contextual factors. Three key factors were found to matter most:
personality and personal decisions of the Prosecutor; institutional changes inside
the ICC, and pressures from NGOs. All three were found to be relevant in the
enhanced prioritisation of sexual violence crimes in the case of Bemba compared
with their exclusion from the Lubanga case. In exploring why sexual violence
was first excluded and then included in the prosecution and the trials of the ICC,
this study interrogates institutional and contingent factors that influence
decision-making at the investigation, charging, trial, sentencing and judgement
stages of international criminal trials at the ICC. By tracing institution processes
and their ‘nestedness’ in past legacies, the exclusion and subsequent inclusion of
sexual violence in ICC trials, the question of inclusion and exclusion was found
to be more nuanced than expected, with elements of inclusion and exclusion of
sexual violence in both the Lubanga and Bemba cases.","['Sexual violence', 'ICC', 'Prosecutor', 'Lubanga', 'Bemba', 'Institutional', 'Personal and contingent influences on inclusion/exclusion decision.']"

into homogenous intervention model. This arguably influencing the way
LGBT civil society movement is designed as site of development intervention.
This research aims to deliver alternative representation of LGBT problems
and proposed solution that have been constructed by international development
intervention. Guided by post-development and Queer theory, this research applies
Critical Discourse Analysis to assess selected texts produced by the ‘Being
LGBTI in Asia’ program. Particularly, WPR approach developed by Carol Bacchi
is employed to assess the representation, assumptions and silencing. The
analysis showed that language of human rights violation has been used to grant
warrant for the emerging of other discourses which reflect Western model of
modernity. The life of LGBT people is used to problematize government’s incapability
in creating enabling environment to sustain economic development.
Thus, it is an economic project that value LGBT people as an instrument for
economic prosperity. Furthermore, it is a political project that rely on the liberal
democracy system where LGBT people is symbolized as the bearer of individual
freedom. Consequently, LGBT civil society has been narrowly characterized as
a working unit that serve specific role in the political process to establish legal
framework. In the future, we need to further understand in which way the notion
of LGBT movement hinders or creates civic space to acquire justice and
equality. It is also important to investigate the cultural, social and political consequence
of public exposure that garnered from the growing development investment
for sexual right movement.","['LGBT Rights Movement', 'International Development Aid', 'Being LGBTI in Asia', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'WPR']"
“Listening to the Neglected Whispers of Jakarta: Understanding Poor Children’s Outdoor Play”,"Egaratri, Christine Lora",2017-12-15,['Huijsmans Roy'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Living in a high-density neighbourhood, Jakarta’s poor children face limited outdoor play spaces, which creates unequal conditions when compared to wealthier children. Appreciating Jakarta’s poor children as experts of play, this research reveals how these children value outdoor play and play spaces. Furthermore, the research also analyses the factors that shape their outdoor play.
Conducting qualitative research with an ethnographic approach, this study combines participant observation, photographs, map drawings, ranking, transect walks, and informal interviews as methods to collect data from multiple sites: RPTRA Intiland Teduh, RPTRA Manunggal and non-designated outdoor play spaces around these neighbourhoods. It is important to highlight that children’s perspectives are the main focus of this research.
Outdoor play is a part of poor children’s daily lives in Jakarta. Before the establishment of designated outdoor play spaces (RPTRAs), these children only had alleyways, streets, abandoned plots, and other non-designated play spaces. However, they also have their own reasons as to why they are still playing in both types of play spaces.
It is important to highlight that the main drivers for the children playing outdoors are the need for sufficient spaces to (physical) play and the need to socialise with other children (peers). Due to children’s eagerness to play outdoors, these play spaces have become laboratories for creativity, which can be seen in how they use, modify, and create new functions from what they find in their play spaces.

This research found that geographical factors, generational relations, and gender and class differences play important roles in shaping poor children’s outdoor play in Jakarta. First, from the perspective of geographical conditions, and in determining which outdoor play spaces children use, a large play space consisting of natural elements is their preference. Secondly, generational relations shape their outside play time in the form of parents working hours, school hours, and religious-based customs (e.g. Muslim prayer time). Moreover, generational relations are also significant with regard to how adults determine equipment, schedules, activities, and rules. Furthermore, parents’ transferal of values also creates the risk of religious-based bullying and discrimination in children’s play outdoors. Finally, gender and class differences also influence children’s social relations in outdoor spaces.","['Adults', 'agency', 'childhood', 'children', 'child-friendly', 'ethnographic approach', 'generational relations', 'geographies', 'Jakarta', 'outdoor', 'play', 'poor', 'RPTRA', 'social actor', 'social construction', 'spaces', 'urban']"

"Perceptions of Young People on Young Parenthood from the Ghanaian Community in The Hague, the Netherlands.","Garbrah Hooper, Allswell",2017-12-15,['Icaza Rosalba'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Young parenthood is seen as a global phenomenon. Many countries are faced with the
challenge of teenage pregnancy hence becoming young parents. However, this is not the same
for many countries in Europe such as Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. These countries
have achieved remarkable success in relation to teenage pregnancy. Although the Netherlands
has lower rates of teenage pregnancy, teenage pregnancy is high among young people of
ethnic minority background. This was intriguing because there is a huge gap between young
people from native Dutch background and young people from ethnic minority background.
Having in mind the effectiveness of comprehensive sexuality education in the Netherlands and
how informed young people are about their sexuality I was curious to find out perceptions of
young people from Ghanaian community on teenage pregnancy and young parenthood.
This study used qualitative methodological approach to gather data. Face to face interviews
were used to gather rich, informed and deep information from the participants. The findings
revealed that young people from the Ghanaian community did not see their position as young
parents as problematic but are exercising their agency as a result of the education they have
about their sexuality. This according to them has empowered them to make informed decisions
about their future. For those young people who were not young parent they also perceived that
they have made such decisions as a result of the education on CSE and the various experiences
about young parenthood from their family and neighbourhood which has shaped their life
choices.","['Young people', 'Sexuality', 'Comprehensive Sexual Education', 'Young Parenthood']"

facing exploitation, in relation to sexual bribery with older men or teachers in
particular. Working on this sensitive topic in the environment of the refugee
camp was not straightforward. To investigated whether their relations are closer
to transactions sex or exploitative sexual abuse, around 16 interviews were
conducted, including 5 with NGO workers, and 4 with teachers, 4 self-organisers
and 3 with adolescent refugee girls out of school. Further, 14 adolescent refugee
Congolese girls were involved in two focus group discussions. In total they make
a number of 30 respondents. The main finding of the study was the access to
educational facilities were free for the refugee teenage girls, they faced a big risk
of sexual exploitation. The study found that the girls were often obliged to
engage in transactional sex, arose when it came to passing exams and being able
to progress through school towards graduation. Overall, the study found that
the line between transactional sex and exploitative sexual abuse is not as clear as
the concepts of agency and exploitation would imply.","['Congolese', 'refugee girls', 'education', 'Tanzania', 'sexual exploitation', 'transactional sex']"
Youth and the Syrian Conflict: A Case Study of HNGOs and Psychosocial Support for Youths,"Stana, Ridiona",2017-12-15,['Meskoub Mahmoud'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In humanitarian emergency response contexts, youth-empowerment programmes are important for
helping youth adapt to adversity and for driving them forward toward the road to development. If
empowered, youth, as a group, can be a key resource for development and durable stability in the
Arab states (UNDP 2016: 7).
This research is concerned with the wellbeing of youths affected by the Syrian civil conflict hosted by
neighbouring countries. In particular, it seeks to examine the impact of humanitarian response as well
as to explore the existence of psychosocial support and trauma-focused programmes adapted to
target youths in post-conflict settings. The relationship between trauma, depression and daily
stressors, on the one hand, and empowerment programmes for this vulnerable category of young
people, on the other hand, were studied. A literature review was conducted by regarding existing
data, evidence and practices of HNGOs, in the area of psychosocial support related to youths aged
15-24; moreover, a review of the Regional Refugee Resilience Plan (3RP) monthly reports and
interviews with HNGO practitioners from Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Greece and Jordan involved in
humanitarian responses were conducted. Geographically, the research focuses on youths from Syria
and other countries affected by the Syrian conflict: Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, and
Greece.
The research finds that no standardized psychosocial support and trauma-focused model is used by
HNGOs, and that interventions targeted at youths focus on education and VET programmes.
Programmes in humanitarian response are created ad hoc, and only partially address youths’ socialemotional
needs. Even if there is not enough evidence of or a validated set of tools for measuring the
impact of the interventions, some positive impacts were observed by practitioners involved in VET
and PSS activities with youths. Implications for further academic research, programme development,
and policies related to the protection and mental health of the youth as a distinct group of civilians in
conflict settings are also considered.","['youth', 'post-conflict settings', 'civilians', 'psychosocial support', 'trauma', 'Syria', 'HNGOs']"

part of the ‘Peace Agreement’ signed by the Colombian government and
the FARC-EP defines the place as an economic asset restricting it to its physic
meaning in contrast to the definitions given by the women who also attached to
place symbolic and social meanings.
This study relies on a phenomenon of individual and collective political
struggles around place/space in which these five women engage in collective
action countering injustices perpetrated against the displaced Afro-Colombian
people during Colombian violent conflict. In doing so, these women build their
roles within the new communities in Cali following or challenging patterns of
gender identity and engaged in institutional processes in order to provide themselves
means to survive in the city and overcome the label of ‘victims’.
The intent is to demonstrate how through the narratives the five displaced
Afro-Colombian women create a place for themselves in different ways, through
intersections of gender, race, age, and family, as well as through loss and struggle.
They show women’s gendered perception of the old and the new places that go

What are the determinants for local communities’ acceptance and disbeliefs of interim nuclear waste storage? The case of high-level nuclear waste in the neighbourhood of NPP1 and NPP2 in Taiwan,"Chen, Szu-Ying",2017-12-15,['Arsel M. (Murat)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The concept of risk society argued by Ulrich Beck implies science and technology are not undoubtedly objective and certain since a series of new forms of environmental crisis with the typicality of Chernobyl catastrophe disclosed the political and economic interest behind them. Nowadays the entire society is under overwhelming and uncontrollable scientific and technological errors. Various sectors in the society started to interpret science in their contexts and science needs to reconstruct its essence to be socially robust encountering with numerous doubts and distrusts. Nuclear power and waste issues have been experiencing social opposition internationally, and Taiwan, the country recognised as the most dangerous location of nuclear risk, particularly has to abolish the conventional policy mechanism of considering social opposition as irrational deeds by lay-public. It is vital to unravel the determinants for public acceptance and disbeliefs of high-level nuclear waste storage in the neighbourhood of NPP1 and NPP2 as the proposal to mitigate the social conflicts
in waste management.
Qualitative interviews and secondary data collection were conducted attempting to construct a coherent storyline in the case of NPP1 and NPP2 with retrospect of historical nuclear power and waste development. The selected case here has its index significance that it is the first time of initial local uptake of nuclear waste in Taiwan’s history of social conflicts over nuclear issues. The research approach is distinct from mainstream risk perception analysis which emphasises quantitative and psychometric models. This paper recognised the importance of contextualising active role of local lay people when interacting with scientific risk and historical background.
Analysis and results presented the relevant determinants and the detailed contexts behind them. The local memory of tsunami, the constant discovery of deformed fish associated with nuclear incidents, long-term failure of low-level nuclear waste disposal, issue of public and democratic participation, issue of compensation were factors causing the local disbeliefs. Sub-politics in cooperation with international environmental movements and political ideology could lead to the initial but vulnerable consensus on nearby high-level nuclear waste interim storage with the government.","['risk society', 'scientific risk', 'technology', 'risk perception', 'nuclear waste', 'nuclear power']"

This paper explores state intervention from an overlooked nexus of informal economy and discipline. This paper contrasts a process of formalization and discipline using the case of street food vendors on Yoawarat Road, Bangkok, Thailand, to show that formalization is being appropriated as a strategy for state construction and modernity. The paper explores ways in which government intervention has shaped the business operations of street food vendors. Findings show that vendors have their own norms and practices to organize their activities, but these are replaced by government measures in order to construct a modern and disciplined enclosure. Using disciplinary mechanisms the government is able to control the vendor’s body and mind with regulations similar to those prevalent in the formal economy, but without formalizing them. The findings from this paper need to be confirmed in a state with a more democratic system.","['informal economy', 'formalization', 'discipline', 'street vendors', 'modernity', 'Bangkok']"

It employs qualitative methodology and case study approach. Also it takes my own experience as a source of information, since I worked within the government for 8 years on matters relating to poverty and attention to victims of violence. The overall research finding is a fragile context is the ideal scenario for the strengthening of illegal activities that mobilize the local economy through a value chain, generating income stability and development opportunities in a region with unsatisfied basic needs. Hence, investment in social welfare should be complementary to the development of alternative projects. Also, the articulation and coordination of different actors allows to broaden the impact of the interventions and mainly to strengthen the value chains of the new productive activities, in such a way that it is prevented from returning to illicit activities. In that sense, the role of government in strategic coordination is fundamental to recover its legitimacy in places where it has not had control for years.","['local development', 'Local Economic Development', 'bottom-up', 'weak states', 'illegal economy', 'illicit crops', 'Colombia', 'Catatumbo', 'fragile context', 'local economy']"

Private sector involvement in port management in Indonesia: the case of Cikarang Dry Port,"Prasetyo, Widhodho",2017-12-15,['Bergh S.I. (Sylvia)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In the global economy, logistics cycles and international trade have become important driving forces for many countries to improve their economies and competitiveness. This has necessary led to the development and improvement of logistics and port management. Considering many problems in port management, the Indonesian government has focused on the development of infrastructure in the port area. The policy of the National Logistics System (SISLOGNAS) aims to realize national connectivity that is self-reliant, competitive and sovereign of the nation. One of the derivative policies of SISLOGNAS is the Integrated Customs Service Zone (KPPT) scheme.
Based on interviews, documents review, survey responses and personal observation, this paper finds that several factors such as the poor Logistics Performance Index, high logistics cost, long dwelling time and logistics security has prompted the government to design a logistics policy. The Public Private Partnership with PT Cikarang Inland Port gives the possibility to develop the Cikarang Dry Port based on the KPPT concept, despite the financial limitations of the government. The private port operator company had some issues with contributing to the project, like un-optimized capacity utilization, the complexity of marketing strategies and government inconsistencies in policy implementation. But eventually the government and PT CIP both showed their intentions in continuing the partnership to be maximized.
It seems that this partnership has not produced yet all the expected results for both parties. The private partner still finds difficulty to get the return of investments on the CDP development. Some of the policy objectives that have been estimated are not achieved yet. There is still a lot of work that should be done by this partnership to further optimize the efficiency of CDP utilization such as the improvement of security systems, the cheaper logistics handling costs, and closer service area to users.","['Indonesia', 'Cikarang Dry Port', 'Public Private Partnership', 'National Logistics System (SISLOGNAS)', 'Integrated Customs Service Zone (KPPT)', 'logistics', 'effectiveness', 'efficiency', 'customs']"

Both countries have undergone a gradual transition from birth to growth stage, although they still face an enormous challenge to consolidate their start-up
ecosystems. Buenos Airesʼ ecosystem shows a slight advantage in terms of maturity, considering investmentsʼ exits, highly dynamic start-ups, and investors. The findings indicate that there is the availability of capital for seed stage. However, the possibilities of getting funding for larger rounds are
limited. Consequently, companies that rapidly scale up must go abroad to get capital. It is explained, in part, because of the financial gap identified in both ecosystems. The paper discusses the scope and limitations of the policies implemented in the two countries and proposes an alternative way to explore alternatives for development.","['start-up ecosystems', 'start-ups', 'entrepreneurial policies', 'Argentina', 'Chile', 'investors', 'venture capital']"

Through Non-Government Budget Investment Financing (PINA) scheme, pension fund’s involvement in infrastructure sector has begun. As infrastructure and pension fund carry the political and social-economic vibe respectively, the decision making investment is framed with political support from the government and economic examination by pension fund. The government takes combination of custodian and demiurge roles by providing accommodated regulations, enforcing state-owned enterprises preference, endorsing supported policies and structure which subsequently should be dealt by the pension fund in the economic perspective. Nevertheless, the endorsement of pension fund involvement in infrastructure is lacking the foundation of shaping pension fund’s character as a true institutional investment, that is, pension fund reform.

(Sylvia)'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The provision of clean water for the urban population in developing countries is becoming both scarce and expensive largely because of rapid urbanisation and poor urban water management; including the lack of transparency and accountability and rising corruption.
Ghana’s capital city, Accra, is facing such challenges in the urban water sector. Confronting the problem of corruption and ensuring transparency and account-ability in the water sector requires a number of actors: first, an effective public sector; second, a dynamic private sector; and finally, an engaged civil society including an independent, robust and sustainable media to raise public awareness about water sector corruption, causes, effects and solutions.
Based on the review of relevant literature and content analysis of newspapers, this paper demonstrates how constant exposure to news media can help change people’s perception of specific issues, such as a corruption engendered national conversation to cause specific change in policy and promote transparency and accountability.
The paper further argues that the effectiveness of the media in promoting transparency, accountability and fighting corruption in Ghana depends on a number of factors: first, the news media mostly lacks the capacity to tell the story of corruption in a compelling way to get the attention of the public; and second, ownership of the media limits the media’s ability to remain independent in telling the story of corruption. In other cases, journalists lack the necessary training and skill to report on corruption.","['water', 'corruption', 'media', 'accountability', 'transparency', 'Ghana', 'Accra']"

This paper will focus on the latest Presidential and Legislative Elections that were held in 2014, while describing the development of electoral reforms over time. This, with a view to assess as to whether Indonesia is still on the right track in adopting western-style liberal democracy and by applying democracy assessment tools and liberal democracy criteria. On the basis of detailed evidence, it is established that it is best at this point of time to see the democracy in Indonesia as a hybrid system. It is a ‘variety of democracy’ combining elements of what is considered a liberal democracy, as well as historical and specific Indonesian socio-cultural, traditional and informal governance systems are influencing the result.","['democracy', 'election', 'electoral reform', 'democratization', 'vote-buying', 'money politics', 'transparency']"

Het is precies deze tegenspraak die mij inspireerde deze scriptie te schrijven. Want beide uitspraken zijn in onze tijd gedaan. Ze tonen zich bovendien erfgenaam van twee totaal andere tradities, die echter volgens de Canadese filosoof Charles Taylor wel tot dezelfde bron zijn te herleiden: de Reformatie. De historische ontwikkeling van deze tradities is in deze scriptie nagegaan. De eerste kan de puriteins-piëtistische  traditie genoemd worden, de tweede kunnen we de traditie van het onthechte zelf noemen. Ik heb dit gedaan door eerst een beschrijving te geven van de ontwikkeling van het moderne, ‘onthechte’ zelf en daarna een beschrijving te geven van het gereformeerd piëtisme (in wezen het Nederlands puritanisme, wat zelf Engels van oorsprong is maar er is sprake van een zelfde theologisch bekeringsmodel en gebruik dezelfde geschriften), met daarbij veel aandacht voor de rol van het bekeringsmodel en de bekeringsgeschiedenis. Tenslotte heb ik in religieuze autobiografieën van gereformeerde piëtisten onderzocht of de ontwikkeling van het moderne onthechte zelf hier ook te ontdekken valt. Uit dit onderzoek valt te concluderen dat het zelfbeeld van de gereformeerde piëtisten door de eeuwen heen altijd puriteins- piëtistisch  is gebleven maar in sommige gevallen wel duidelijk sporen toont van de tijd waarin het tot stand kwam. De conclusie moet bescheiden zijn omdat ik slechts enkele tientallen bronnen heb kunnen bestuderen. Het is echter wel duidelijk geworden dat de gereformeerde piëtisten in Nederland weliswaar al zo’n driehonderd jaar een afgezonderde groep vormen maar ze zich geenszins compleet van de buitenwereld hebben afgesloten waarbij vooral is opgevallen hoezeer ze met name in de negentiende eeuw beïnvloed zijn door de Romantiek in hun van emoties doorspekte bekeringsgeschiedenissen.  Opvallend genoeg nam juist dit aspect in de twintigste eeuw sterk af, waarbij de bekeringsgeschiedenissen steeds meer begonnen te lijken op een sterk geformaliseerd bekeringsmodel, wat kan wijzen op een musealisering van de puriteins-piëtistische traditie in Nederland, die heden ten dage aangeduid worden als bevindelijk gereformeerd.","['ontwikkeling zelf', 'gereformeerd piëtisme', 'puritanisme', 'religieuze autobiografie']"
The sentiment of user comments in relation to sponsored branding on YouTube,"Biere, A.",2017-11-06,['Lee J.S.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","After the introduction of the Internet and several social media platforms, advertisers use narrative advertisement to influence potential consumers. However, consumers are becoming more vocal and critical and with the easy accessibility of the Internet, and engage in online discussions that can potentially influence the attitude towards a brand or product and the intention to purchase. Through product reviewing on YouTube, consumers can share and express their opinion regarding a specific brand or product with other consumers. Advertisers are now collaborating with these reviewers through sponsorship deals in order to talk about their brand, and thus advertise and promote them. Via comments with different sentiments on YouTube, users can discuss and express their opinion and emotion towards the associated brand which is being talked about in the video. This research sets out to investigate the potential influence these user comments underneath a video on YouTube has on the brand and product that is being reviewed by a consumer. The research is guided by the following research question: How and to what extent do the sentiment of own and others’ YouTube comments and review type influence brand attitude and purchase intention of products featured in a review video on YouTube? A quantitative research method was conducted, using a survey to retrieve data from the participants in order to analyse and help answer the research question. The experiment consisted of a (paid) product review video and linked this to user comments, which were chosen after performing a sentiment analysis, potentially influencing the brand attitude and purchase intention of the participant. This classical experimental design consisted of ten separate conditions and retrieved 412 completed surveys. According to the analysis of the findings, the sentiment of chosen comments on YouTube influences brand attitude positively. Subsequently, brand attitude has a positive relation with purchase intention. Conversely, reading comments that other users have written do not influence any behaviour towards commenting or attitude towards a brand. Also, a narrative advertising strategy used into product reviewing on YouTube is not of importance in the end. This study recommends similar researching for distinct products, while focusing on target groups, even outside the social media platform of YouTube.","['media', 'business', 'Brand Attitude', 'YouTube Comments', 'Review Video', 'Purchase Intention', 'Sponsored Advertising', 'Disclosure']"
Causes of Road Traffic Accidents at Junctions in Pristina,"A’Mula, G. (Gonxhe)",2017-11-01,['Sharma S. (Somesh)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"As the tenth leading cause of death worldwide, road traffic fatalities account for 1.24 million
deaths and 20 to 50 million non-fatal injuries annually - over 90% prevalent in low and
middle-income countries with 40% of the world’s registered cars. Urban trends estimate
hazardous growth of traffic fatality rates in future decades accounting for substantial losses in
economic development (accounting for 3% of GDP) and vulnerable road users (pedestrians
and cyclists).
Fatal accidents in Kosovo represent 15-20% higher than EU countries presenting evidently
declining traffic conditions in its capital city Pristina. Confronted by rapid urbanization,
Pristina is the administrative, political economic and cultural hub of Kosovo comprising of
increased flows of people and transport commuting from one activity to another. 57% of road
traffic accidents occur on urban roads with main causes indicated by unsafe accessibility,
inadequate distance, incorrect adjustment of speed to facilitate road conditions, irregular
changing of lanes, unsafe driving (Road Safety Strategy and Action Plan for Kosovo, 2015).
Extensively far from EU benchmarks, figures show a significant increase of road traffic
accidents (RTAs) from 2004 to 2014, confirming that the number of fatalities is considerably
high throughout the last 11 years (Road Safety Strategy and Action Plan for Kosovo, 2015).
Road safety has been researched from various disciplines and perspectives and RTAs have
been stated to be very difficult to predict due to the randomness of their occurrence. The main
research objective was to explain causes contributing to RTAs in order to determine the most
significant cause contributing to RTAs at junctions in Pristina. To achieve this objective,
three mutually distinctive concepts (human error, built environment and traffic management)
influencing RTA causation were examined. To study a deeper context of the research topic,
the research strategy used was a multiple case study with mixed methods in order to
comprehensively explain causes of RTAs upon real life situations in Pristina. Survey was
used to collect driver’s perspectives while driving in Pristina complemented by in depth
interviews with individuals who were of interest to the case study (e.g. near by residents,
RTA victims and experts in the field). Accordingly, both quantitative and qualitative primary
data was collected. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics and binary
logistic regression in SPSS whereas qualitative data was analysed manually. Secondary data
was also collected for the selection of the case study as well as archives from the Kosovo
Police, which further explained and supported research findings.
Based on survey results, the analysis revealed that drivers perceived the built environment
and traffic management as significant causes of RTAs at junctions in Pristina. Interviews
further concluded that traffic management and human error were significant causes although
the built environment ranked comparably near lacking only 1 point. Moreover, secondary
data confirmed human error as the cause of 92% of RTAs as reported by the Kosovo Police.
Furthermore, to answer the research questions, the research results were analysed through
individual and combined effects (human error, built environment and traffic management)
based on academic literature. Research findings similarly indicated a combined effect of all
three concepts interchangeably producing error resulting in RTAs. Particularly, the TCI
model (Fuller, 2005) clarified the role of human error within the task of driving whereas the
system perspective model (Reason, 1990) ideally explained the circumstances in which the
combined effect of causes increase the probability of RTAs at junctions in Pristina thus
answering the research questions.","['Road Traffic Accidents', 'Causation', 'Traffic Safety', 'Pristina', 'Kosovo']"
Togetherness as a strategy,B. van Riel,2017-10-27,"['F.J.C. Brouwer', 'A. Klamer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Art organizations appear to have consistent problems with generating sufficient revenue.
Recent government cutbacks in the Netherlands have increased this problem for art
organizations operating in the city of Rotterdam. In the Netherlands corporate support of the
arts in the form of corporate sponsorship and corporate philanthropy, which could provide the
necessary relief, is declining in general.
Therefor strategies need to be explored, that could provide the necessary income for art
organizations in Rotterdam from sources that are likely to fund based on certain strategies.
Collaboration between art organizations could provide such a strategy, as recent collaborations
were able to retain government support for several art organizations in Rotterdam. Can a
similar strategy be used to ensure revenue from corporations? This thesis poses the following
research question:
To what extent can collaboration be a feasible strategy from 2017 onwards for government
subsidized art organizations in Rotterdam to strengthen their relationship with for-profit
business in terms of corporate sponsorships and corporate philanthropy and
increase/safeguard their necessary incomes to survive and innovate?
To approach this question a qualitative research strategy is employed. A literature review on
art-art collaborations provided the framework through which data could be analysed. Data
analysis relied on qualitative content analysis of annual reports, released by Rotterdam’s
subsidized art organizations. The findings from the annual reports were supplemented by the
analysis of unstructured face-to face interviews.
Analysing the data shows that, although, art organizations in Rotterdam have a rich
collaborative history, collaboration is not a feasible strategy for art organizations in Rotterdam
to ensure the necessary income from corporate sponsorship and corporate philanthropy.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'corporate sponsorship', 'corporate philanthropy', 'collaboration', 'art-art collaboration']"

To make the concept of quality measurable, I use indicators of quality such as: box office revenue, production budget, award nominations, award wins, and review ratings, several other variables derived from literature. After analysing these variables I conclude that there is a consistent correlation between budget and box office revenue, which could provide information to producers before production starts, and there is a correlation between box office revenue and the review ratings, which could provide information after production ends. I conclude by discussing the difficulties in measuring the concept of quality and the other possible indicators of quality which are not included in this thesis.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Movie industry', 'Cultural goods', 'Production studios', 'Quality', 'Indicators of quality', 'box office revenue', 'For-profit organisations', 'Consistency', 'Correlations']"

growing, and influential stage. With the samples, several analysis were performed
including regression, contents analysis, and in-depth interviews. The results say that
educational factor doesn't significantly affect the success of their career. Also, I found that
they start the career with various reasons such as sharing pure passion towards makeup,
adopting a suitable method to show their knowhow, chasing the trend from blog to vlog
and so on. Some of them show multiple job-holdings because the job at the early stage is
not enough to sustain livelihood. During the career development, the repeated labour
routines are identified. In building up reputation in the market, they get help
intermediaries like MCNs. They apply entrepreneurship by using their cultural and social
capital to make create new outputs. When they become influential to the market, they
launch their signature products developed with big cosmetic brands, showing innovation.

Turning Attention: The certifying role of a Dutch television show,K. Bosman,2017-10-27,"['E.M.M.P. Loots', 'C.W. Handke']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study researches the certifying role of Dutch TV-show De Wereld Draait Door. As creative goods like music are experience goods, it means that consumers do not know the value of the product or service before purchasing it. Therefore, consumers retrieve information in order to lower uncertainty about a product or service. An example of how consumers do this is herd behaviour, where they base their decision on what others are doing. Another way of lowering uncertainty is by listening to a certifier; someone who provides the consumer with information about the good or service. Digitalisation and Web 2.0 make that the pile of goods to choose from is so big, the need for certifiers increases, while the need for gatekeepers decreases due to the concept of prosumation, which in turn is shifting boundaries between ‘professional suppliers’ and ‘amateurs’ or ‘consumers’. As De Wereld Draait Door is an example of a certifier within the music industry, the literature leads us to the following research question:Does De Wereld Draait Door has a certifying role for artists and/or bands performing in the show? If so, what type of attention does the show generate for the musicians?with the next follow-up question: Are there any other (musical and/or aesthetical) characteristics influencing the type of attention for the artist or band?This research investigates whether certifiers really have a more important role like the literature assumes, by measuring the impact of De Wereld Draait Door on the number of Google Searches, the number of views on YouTube and the number of subscribers on YouTube. In addition it looks at whether there are musical and aesthetical characteristics which influence the type and depth of the attention generated by De Wereld Draait Door. In order to do this, a content analysis is conducted. Our main findings consist of that we can talk about a ‘De Wereld Draait Door – effect’, as the show does generate attention in terms of Google Searches and YouTube subscribers. The results of correlations between our independent variables account for us setting up a musician profile for whom De Wereld Draait Door creates the biggest increase in attention. As we have shown that certifiers really do play a big role, it could have a big influence on the democratisation of the music industry. Shows like De Wereld Draait Door have the power to break through the power of the traditional players in the industry, such as record labels.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Certifiers', 'Gatekeepers', 'Taste', 'Attention', 'Music Industry', 'Visual Aesthetics']"
Artists attending arts festivals,X. Xu,2017-10-27,"['M. Lavanga', 'A. Mignosa']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Festivals are an emerging form of knowledge creation, especially in the current
knowledge-based economy (Bathelt, Malmberg, & Maskell, 2004; Grabher, 2004). The impact
of festivals has been regarded from various perspectives, yet evaluation on participating
stakeholders is still a neglected topic, particularly in connection with the temporality of
agglomerated learning spaces, called temporary clusters. This thesis links artist practice to the
temporary nature of a festival to analyze to which extent festivals benefit the participating
artists. The main research question to which extent do artists benefit from participating in
festivals is answered in two ways. The role of festivals in a temporary context is highlighted in
the first sub-question how does a festival function as a temporary cluster? Findings confirm
that festivals are not only temporary clusters but of cyclical nature. The second part focuses on
to which extent does a festival shape artists’ practice? Theory focusses on communities of
practice using an adapted form of Grabher’s (2004) network theory. In which of the network
spheres of communality, sociality and connectivity does interaction amongst artists and
between other stakeholders occur? Qualitative interviews with involved artists and producers
of a case study festival provide insight into the working practice and to which extent festivals
shape it. Findings show that producers and local artists are based in communality, while
sociality is the most likely network for newly participating artists. Since artists describe their
work as being ‘in development’, a festival is likely to represent a deadline or an opportunity of
shaping their work into a presentable format rather than as career-oriented drivers in terms of
reaching an audience, or as a tool for promoting for potential funding options.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'arts festivals', 'knowledge networks', 'temporary clusters', 'creative industries', 'communities of', 'practice']"
Performance in cultural organizations: the case of Organizações Sociais in Brazil,C. Mayer Tibeau,2017-10-27,"['A. Mignosa', 'A. Klamer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The public support for the arts and culture has been widely discussed by economists, arts
administrators, and policy-makers in the last decades. The shortage of funds to support
the cultural sector - intensified in many countries during the 1990’s - increased the
demand for performance measurement and accountability in the sector. Performance
indicators started to be applied to monitor the operations and the management of cultural
organizations, resulting in a general complaint based on the alleged inappropriateness of
the managerial rationality to the arts field. Despite of this fact, the use of performance
measurement methods is being adopted by many countries to implement new hybrid
models for the funding and management of arts and cultural institutions. In this sense,
this study uses quantitative methods to examine the performance evolution of cultural
organizations operating under the Brazilian Social Organizations (OS) model. The results
indicate that OSs are being more efficient and effective in terms of revenue and
accountability maximization, and are less focused on economy maximization objectives.
The effectiveness of the OS model in terms of reducing the dependency on public funding
and enabling the diversification of revenues might lead cultural institutions towards
financial stability and organizational sustainability. While many positive aspects
regarding Social Organizations have been identified, this study emphasizes some points
of attention regarding the OS model and the use of performance indicators in the arts and

Hoe Moslims TV kijken,J. de Bloeme,2017-10-27,"['J. Jansz', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Verschillende persoonlijke en onpersoonlijke factoren zijn van invloed op het kijkgedrag, zoals normen en waarden en tv-bezit. Bij de doelgroep van dit onderzoek, moslimechtparen, kan ook de religieuze overtuiging een rol spelen. Deze verwachting is gebaseerd op het feit dat de Islam een religie is die vrijwel alle aspecten van het leven omvat. De volgende hoofdvraag staat centraal in dit onderzoek: In hoeverre is de Islam van invloed op het kijkgedrag van moslimechtparen? 
De onderzoeksmethode is kwalitatief: de gegevens zijn door middel van interviews verzameld. Verder is de studie exploratief van aard vanwege het gebrek aan al bestaande theorie over de mogelijke invloed van de Islam op het kijkgedrag van moslimechtparen. Om deze reden heeft een uitgebreid vooronderzoek plaatsgevonden waarbij in totaal zes moslimechtparen zijn geïnterviewd over hun kijkgedrag en islamitische levensstijl. Middels de Grounded Theory methode is de daaruit voortgekomen data samen met de theorie zoals beschreven in het theoretisch kader gebruikt voor het samenstellen van de topiclijst voor het hoofdonderzoek waarvoor tien echtparen zijn geïnterviewd. Wat betreft de geïnterviewden is zowel bij het voor- als hoofdonderzoek gestreefd naar zoveel mogelijk variatie in afkomst, leeftijd, aantal huwelijksjaren, en mate van praktiseren. Naar aanleiding van deze interviews is in combinatie met eerdere empirische onderzoeken een vijftal moslimtypes vastgesteld. Elke echtgenoot is ingedeeld bij een van deze vijf types. 
Uit de data is naar voren gekomen dat er sprake is van invloed van de Islam op het kijkgedrag van moslimechtparen, wat betreft ongewenste content en de manier en het moment waarop zij actie ondernemen wanneer zij hiermee geconfronteerd worden. De mate waarin er sprake is van invloed hangt samen met de mate waarin de Islam een rol speelt in het leven van de echtparen. Echtparen bij wie de Islam een grote rol speelt in hun leven beschouwen meer televisiecontent als ongewenst dan echtparen bij wie de Islam minder van belang is in hun dagelijkse bezigheden.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Islam', 'Moslim', 'Echtparen', 'Normen en Waarden', 'Aanbidding', 'Moslimtypes', 'Kijkgedrag', 'Programmakeuze', 'Kijkmotieven', 'Invloed', 'Uses and Gratifications Theorie']"
The police’s mediatization and relation to the media within a terror-related context: An in-depth investigation on the police’s perspective through the lens of the Paris attacks,M.S.J. Gibbs,2017-10-27,"['D. Trottier', 'D.D. Dumitrica']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research examines the police’s mediatization within a terror-related context. As such, theories of mediatization, police-media relations, and police’s new visibility notably are linked and discussed. The focus is put on the Paris attacks which occurred on November, 13th 2015. The police’s perspective is investigated, which implies that French police officers working in Paris and its area were interviewed. Moreover, this research raises questions such as the impact of the police’s mediatization on the police’s position towards the media. The stress is put on 24 hours news channels - BFM TV and iTélé - and Twitter. The study aims to complete the academic field researching the police-media relations, by taking the police’s point of view into account. As scholars formerly qualified the relation linking the police and the media as an unhappy mariage, one goal is to determine whether or not it is still the case, especially within terror circumstances. As such theories of mediatization are applied to the police, together with new visibility theories, it leads to consider the police’s new visibility  as a dimension and a consequence of its mediatization. Further, the impact of the new visibility on police officers’ professional and personal plans are addressed, turning out that police officers are rather negatively affected by their new visibility. Since this research investigates on the French police, which presents a particular communication structure and tradition, these dimensions peculiar to the case-study are exposed as well. Thus, the French Police institution appears to be strongly traditionally-rooted and reluctant to an open communication, which hinders its communication modernization. As such, the French police’s uses of Twitter are researched, in order to compare with previous academic findings. This research’s observations support former statements on the police’s uses of this social network site and complete the academic field by exploring the police’s uses of Twitter under a terror-related context. An amount of ten in-depth interviews were conducted. They were audio-recorded and further transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. It resulted that the police-media relation can still be characterized by an unhappy marriage characteristic within a terror-related context. However it also resulted that police officers were especially harmed by their mediatization through 24 hours news channels, while acknowledging that these channels had specific requirements to meet: images, material, testimonies etc. In sum, journalists are doing their job, which is incompatible with the police profession: real-time information cannot suit to the length and scope of the police’s investigations requiring a lot of time and discretion. The mistakes that BFM TV and iTélé made on the RAID assault of the Hyper Kosher supermarket in January 2015 (cf. Charlie Hebdo) were also pointed out since these television channels provided intelligence on the police’s strategy and revealed the presence of hidden hostages on the site of terror attacks; which explains the police’s position towards 24 hours news channels. Overall, the unhappy marriage characteristic of the police-media relation is supported by this research which also brings new elements related to the context of terrorism and terrorist threat.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Mediatization', 'Police-Media Relation', 'New Visibility', 'Police and Twitter', 'French Police', 'Police Perspective', 'Terrorism', 'Paris Attacks']"

Leendertse', 'C.J. Billedo']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis explores current news media policies regarding algorithmic accountability on third-party platforms and notions of a digital public sphere in Germany and the Netherlands and aims to give suggestions of how they might be adapted to conform to current changes. Algorithmic curation processes active on platforms shape the way users assimilate information and are therefore possibly shaping public opinion. As of today, those procedures are mostly happening concealed from the user, raising the question of accountability on platforms. Thus, the question of how actors such as media companies, public institutions, and governmental institutions can redefine their media policies in the context of a platform press is asked in this paper. A thematic analysis of expert interviews with professionals working in the media industry, researchers, journalists and activists exposed actions that could be considered in the frames of professional responsibility, public responsibility, the political frame and the market frame of accountability. Main findings of this paper concerning media companies are the need for making journalistic processes transparent when they are active on platforms, due to an abundance of otherwise unaccounted content and strengthening institutional authenticity outside of the platform eco-system. To weaken monopolistic structures, political actors should consider breaking-up platforms and subsidize the creation of alternatives to the established actors. Doing so would provide consumers with a choice and possibly diminish the power a few platforms have right now. The digital space platforms occupy is subject to several national laws, making it difficult to effectively impose guidelines on platforms. Furthermore, media literacy should be promoted not only by public institutions but also by private actors. Currently, consumers are not equipped to utilize publishing tools provided by platforms and are mostly unaware of the consequences algorithms have on the content they receive. Finally, a clear account of the effects platforms have on public opinion has yet to be established in order to advance research on this topic. An ideal digital public sphere is possible to a certain extent, but always with the limitations of the traditional model and not within the current options available for users.","['media', 'business', 'accountability', 'algorithms', 'platforms', 'journalism', 'media literacy', 'public sphere']"
Hidden Motives?,A.Y.M. Dieben,2017-10-23,"['A.C. Uribe Sandoval', 'J.R. Ward']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The growth of social media has made it an interesting area for marketers to target, as it provides marketers with a new way to reach potential and existing customers. A marketing strategy that has become very popular on social media is product placement through the use of social media influencers. This entails that an influencer - who is an independent third party, with usually a lot of followers - promotes a certain product in a social media post. The goal is to create brand awareness and brand recall which will lead to increase sales at a point of purchase. At this moment, not all influencers that have been compensated for a social media post include a disclosure in that post expressing this. This has caused online and offline discussions in the media about the topic of deceptive endorsement by social media influencers, which formed the motivation for this research. In order to find out if current Dutch laws are sufficient or should be amended it is important to establish how Dutch Instagram users are affected by branded content posted by social media influencers. The research was conducted by performing twelve semi-structured interviews with Dutch consumers. During the interviews a small-scale experiment was integrated to find out if respondents recognize elements of product placement on Instagram. All interviews were transcribed and the data was analyzed through open and axial coding. The results yielded that respondents perceived themselves to be less influenced by product placement on Instagram than others. A form of moral panic was detected towards children and lower educated people. This is remarkable because the experiment showed that the respondents were overconfident regarding their own knowledge and did not recognize product placement when it was well integrated into the Instagram post of a social media influencer. This shows that the moral panic as expressed by the respondents is not completely justified; they are not in the position to judge someone based on their knowledge when they don’t have the knowledge themselves. However, it also shows how the influence of product placement on Instagram is bigger than the respondents realize. Consumers think they are well informed but in practice they over-estimate their own knowledge. The fact that respondents are not always aware of the promotional purpose of a social media post can be considered misleading, because the respondent assumes the influencer is using a product because he or she genuinely likes the product. A change of the law can therefore be considered favorable, as this will make it clear for consumers when they are confronted with a promotional message.","['media', 'business', 'Social media influencers', 'social media', 'Instagram', 'product placement', 'Instagram marketing', 'influencer marketing', 'sponsored content', 'branded content']"
Sharing Without Caring,S. Bouwmeester,2017-10-23,"['S.J. Opree', 'J. Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Consumers used to accept commercials on television as a mandatory interruption of what
they were watching. On the Internet, however, many advertisements can be avoided if the viewer
wants to. Consequently, viral commercials emerged that are meant to entertain the viewer instead
of interrupting them. Viral commercials are intended to be an online destination for the viewer,
something they can enjoy and share online with peers. However, it is unclear whether this type of
advertising is effective at all, let alone whether it is more effective than traditional, television
advertising. Therefore, this study compared consumer responses to viral and traditional
commercials. Additionally, this study researched possible differences in consumer responses
from generation X, the generation that grew up with television, and generation Y, the generation
that grew up with the Internet. The research question that was used to study this was ‘How does
a viral commercial influence brand awareness, brand knowledge, brand liking, brand
preference, brand conviction, commercial liking and the willingness to share differently than a
traditional commercial does for consumers from generation X and generation Y in the
Netherlands? To answer this research question, an online experiment was conducted using a 2
(generation X and generation Y) by 3 (viral, traditional, and control conditions) between-subjects
design. The survey was completed by 185 respondents, equally divided over the six conditions of
which two watched a viral commercial, two watched a traditional commercial, and two served as
control conditions. Surprisingly, it was found that brand knowledge decreases after viewing a
commercial, and more so after watching a viral commercial than a traditional commercial. Also,
within the viral commercial condition, brand knowledge decreases more for generation Y than
generation X. In line with the expectations, the results showed that viral commercials increase
commercial liking and the willingness to share more than traditional commercials, and that the
level of commercial liking has a positive influence on the willingness to share a commercial. The
results generally showed little differences between the effectiveness of viral and traditional
commercials, as well as little differences between the consumer responses of generation X and
generation Y. Thus, it can be concluded that when it comes to viral commercials, consumers do
share, but consumer behavior responses show that they do not really care.","['media', 'business', 'viral advertising', 'traditional advertising', 'generational comparison', 'hierarchy-ofeffects', 'sharing online']"
Spill the Beans,A.H. Seeskari,2017-10-23,"['D. Bartosova', 'P.

Among other governments, The Netherlands’ government are spending resources on the creative industries for the benefit of employment. However, many companies in the creative industries remain small. Previous research has concluded that spillovers in the creative industries can contribute to the competiveness of companies within the industries. However, how knowledge in these industries spills over and how SMEs can capture and facilitate these knowledge spillovers is a surprisingly understudied field. This thesis therefore seeks to fill that gap in academic research and does so by developing an own research framework based on prior research conducted on knowledge bases, networks and knowledge diffusion within the creative industries. The research takes a case study approach and focuses on a Dutch digital media company, Elastique, which is active in the Dutch creative industries while also being situated in the media cluster of Hilversum. The thesis seeks to answer the main research question, which asks, ""How can a digital technology SME within the media sphere of the Dutch creative industries utilize their respective networks in order to facilitate and capture knowledge that spills over?"" by answering the sub-questions which explore the dynamics of the Dutch creative industries, knowledge essential for the media sphere as well as networks and interaction which facilitate knowledge spillovers. The method is carried out mixing qualitative and quantitative data, although the emphasis is on qualitative analysis. The qualitative data consists of a document analysis and four expert interviews. Additionally, a survey interview, which provided both quantitative and qualitative data, was conducted with 18 respondents. The thesis finds that there is a potential for knowledge spillovers in the Dutch creative industries, but to what extent that knowledge is exploited for commercial benefits is still unclear. Furthermore, the results provide insights into what types of knowledge are essential in for digital technology companies. Such knowledge mainly revealed to be synthetic, meaning for example technical knowledge and knowledge that gained through experience.","['media', 'business', 'creative industries', 'media sphere', 'knowledge spillovers', 'networks', 'face-to-face interaction', 'digital interaction', 'the buzz']"

Venues and promoters can be contacted through different online services, some of which are social network services, such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. The aim of this paper is to study in which ways digital media are employed in music management practices of emerging bands with the purpose of acquiring bookings?
With an exploratory design, this paper used quantitative methods to investigate this topic. An online survey (N = 153) was conducted to explore the reality that bands are experiencing when trying to find, by themselves, venues to play at. We found how some of these online tools can at the moment replace gatekeepers in some aspects of the managerial process. Concepts such as disintermediation, self-management and decentralization were also studied here. It was found that emerging bands are highly decentralized, being present on and using many different online services in order to self-manage their careers. However, even when self-management is frequently practiced and disintermediation is common, gatekeepers, such as external agents, are still a very attractive asset for emerging bands for the many benefits that these external agents’ work can contribute to their clients’ career. Online tools have been proven to have great potential, being able to substitute the middlemen if they are used correctly.","['media', 'business', 'music management', 'self-management', 'social network services', 'disintermediation', 'live performance']"
The Ubers of babysitting,K.P. Ciszek,2017-10-23,"['M. Slot', 'J.R. Ward']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The transformation of the Internet into a collaborative environment has given rise to the sharing economy, allowing users to connect not only with friends, but also to interact with strangers. The sharing economy enables its users to exchange services and goods among one another in a quick and easy manner. Nonetheless, due to the fact that such services function based on relationships established online, their creators need to provide tools, which would facilitate trust between users. This thesis delves into the theory concerning trust on online platforms and expands it by means of qualitative interviews with users of peer-to-peer services connecting babysitters and parents. The qualitative approach reveals that the respondents’ answers vary depending on their personal needs for babysitting or au pairing, but all respondents are aware that the platforms are a means of connecting peers to one another and allowing them to communicate without much interference. Despite the fact that most of the background checking necessary to increase trust towards strangers met online is done by the users themselves, they still trust the platform and view it as very practical. The study reveals that babysitting and au pairing platforms are not very sustainable, as the users only use them when they are under pressure to find a caretaker for their child or when their current babysitter is not available anymore. Therefore, the users play a passive role on these websites most of the time. The research reveals that although the peer-to-peer babysitting platforms are helpful, they could not establish trust between the users on their own, as the most important element of building trust between strangers is interaction on other media, via video call and in an offline environment.","['media', 'business', 'The sharing economy', 'online trust', 'reputation', 'recommendation systems', 'peer-to-peer environments']"
The use of collaboration tools at work,G. Dans,2017-10-23,"['J.H. Pridmore', 'C.J. Billedo']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This research examined how employees perceive the use of social media type collaboration tools (SMTCT) at work. Organizations and their environments have changed. Technology is taking an increasing role in employees’ everyday work and tasks, making their work less visible and more abstract to their peers. Besides, organizations have evolved in a way that they are more and more “jobless” or “boundaryless”. Therefore, employees have to work in a broader perspective than their own job duties and they are expected to go beyond their job, to understand the “big picture”. 
At the same time, the way people communicate with each other in their private life has also evolved during the last decades. People are increasingly becoming users and, sometimes, heavy users of social media platforms. While social media have outperformed emails as the primary way to communicate socially, in the workplace, emails remain the primary means of communication. However, social media technologies are increasingly implemented and adopted by organizations and many experts foresee social networks as the most popular form of communication among teams within organizations within a decade. 
In this study, in-depth interviews were conducted in order to explore and understand employees’ perception of the use of SMTCT at work. The findings suggest that employees perceive SMTCT as having brought significant changes to their everyday work. Besides, employees’ experience with such tools also seem to be contradictory at some points. 
First, the findings highlight the fact that SMTCT tend to have an impact on employees’ relationship with immediacy. SMTCT enable employees to save time for different reasons such as communicating in a way more straightforward and targeted way or benefiting from other employees’ connectedness and responsiveness. Employees tend to see SMTCT tone of voice less formal, which enables them to create more intimate relationships with their colleagues. Finally, it enables employees to communicate with each other beyond geographical limitations. However, we could also observe that this immediacy can also generate a feeling of loss of control over time among employees. 
Second, SMTCT induced some transitions in the way people share, exchange knowledge. While respondents tended to perceive SMTCT as a way to better learn collectively by sharing their views and experience as well as a way to centralize and archive knowledge. They also seemed to recognize that SMTCT do not enable a very organized and structured archiving. 
Finally, SMTCT seem to have an impact on employees’ mental resources management. The addition of new tools on top of many already existing tools within organizations seem to be sometimes a bit complex to handle. Having to deal with a great variety of attitudes and behaviors from other employees towards SMTCT and having to deal with a multiplicity of communication tools can sometimes increase employees’ mental load.","['media', 'business', 'enterprise social network', 'social media type collaboration tools', 'collaboration tools', 'strategic alignment', 'knowledge management', 'immediacy', 'mental resources management']"
Museums and strategic usage of Web 2.0 social features,V. Lanskaya,2017-10-23,"['P.M. Leendertse', 'J. Jansz']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In the last decades the museums have faced the unprecedented museum boom. Today, having to
exist in the conditions of highly competitive market of various leisure activities, the museums
are facing the decline in the number of the visitors, combined with the lack financing. Moreover,
the transition from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 forced the museums to adapt to the new digital reality
and a new generation of visitors. In order to differentiate themselves not only from the other
museums, but also from leisure activities, which are offered to the modern user, the museums
had to adapt and strategically reposition themselves to satisfy the desires of the visitors. This
research focuses on before and after the visit experience, and the capabilities of Web 2.0
features. The rise and the influence of Web 2.0 created multiple opportunities for the museums
to enhance visitors’ and potential visitors’ experience through personalization, interactivity
orientation and co-creation. Implementing the functionalities of the Web 2.0 on the websites can
result in a stronger visitor-museums long-term relationship. Social networking sites have also
become an important channel of value proposition delivery and also customer relationship
management.
This research made an attempt to investigate how the museums with the best social media and
website practices strategically apply Web 2.0 features in order to enrich visitors’ experience. For
the purpose of the studies ten museums were selected for the analysis based on their popularity
in the social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. Through an in-depth observation
of the museums’ official websites and social media pages in Facebook and Instagram the data
was collected. The data collection process and the analyses were guided by the conceptual
model, which was created through theoretical research. The conceptual model, based on
Business Model Canvas, was aimed to identify, whether the museums apply Web 2.0 features as
the new value propositions.
Most of the theory is confirmed by the significant findings. The evidence from the multiplesource
data corresponds with the theoretical propositions about Web 2.0 features implemented
by the museums as value propositions. It was demonstrated that both museums’ websites and
social networking sites integrate Web 2.0 functionalities in order to offer different from the
competitors’ value propositions and establish stronger relationships with the visitors.","['media', 'business', 'Web 2.0', 'museums', 'social media', 'value propositions', 'business model']"
Predicting Online Books Sales from Review Sentiments,T.M.T. Doan,2017-10-23,"['J.S. Lee', 'J. Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The past decades have seen the advent of online book retail and its explosive growth. As
the popularity of online book retail continues to increase, so does the interest in
understanding the predictors of online book sales. Accordingly, prior research has found
evidence for the significant effects of traditional (I.e. expert reviews) and social earned
media (i.e. online customer reviews) on online book sales. By literature review, the
researcher pinpoints three main drawbacks of the extant literature. First, scholars have only
been studying the effect of online customer reviews and expert reviews in isolation,
regardless of the fact that they actually interact with each other while influencing online book
sales in reality. Second, little research has been carried out to closely examine the impact of
sentiment reviews on online book sales with sophisticated automated sentiment analysis
technique. Third, the moderating role of book category was insofar neglected in scholarship.
Drawing from these perspectives, this research sets out to investigate the differential
impacts of traditional earned media (i.e. expert reviews) and social earned media (i.e. online
customer reviews) on Amazon.com’s book sales. Additionally, it seeks to understand the
moderating effect of book category on the impact of the positive sentiment in online
customer reviews and expert reviews on Amazon.com’s book sales. The research is guided
by the following research question: To what extent do traditional (i.e. expert reviews) and
social earned media (i.e. online customer reviews) predict Amazon.com’s book sales? To
answer the research question, the researcher conducts a quantitative research which
consists of two steps of analyses. First, she performs a sentiment analysis on 1,133 reviews,
using the sentiment analysis software LIWC 2015 (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), in
order to detect the percentage of positive and negative sentiment in their textual content.
Next, she conducts regression tests and z-score tests for regression coefficients to assess
the hypotheses. The research provides practical recommendations for online book retailers
to tailor their online communication strategy and budget so as to enhance sales
performance. It, likewise, produces some important theoretical implications for future
research to investigate the interplay between online customer reviews and expert reviews in
influencing online book sales.","['media', 'business', 'e-commerce', 'online book retail', 'Amazon.com', 'online customer reviews', 'expert', 'reviews', 'online sales']"
The right swipe?,L.A. Wezenberg,2017-10-23,"['J.R. Ward', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Finding the perfect partner to spend the rest of our lives with has always been part of human society. In traditional dating, it is often seen that people look for a partner with similar characteristics, also called homogamy. A new mechanism that enables people to find this potential partner in the modern world is mobile dating. Mobile dating applications hold certain features, which to some extent enable match selection based on personal preferences. One of the most popular mobile dating applications used worldwide nowadays is called Tinder. This widespread mobile dating application has filtering features such as photos, name, age, education and profession, location, and biography. Since we live in an era where the number of higher educated women has increased and women have become more accepted as intellectual equals, educational homogamy might be different in comparison to other aspects of homogamy, especially in the modern dating environment. Hence the following research question is posed: “How does homogamy play a role in Tinder users’ search for finding a potential partner on Tinder?”. Through 13 interviews with 13 Tinder users with an MBO or WO educational background, many interesting insights into potential partner selection on Tinder were found. A thematic analysis was performed on the data, which shows the motivations of Tinder users to start using the mobile dating application and the different steps that Tinder users go through when selecting their potential partner. This Tinder partner selection showed to be based on the features of Tinder, where users first looked at appearances by swiping through profile photos. Secondly, Tinder users looked at profession and educational level, with a difference between the selection process of MBO and WO educated respondents. Most MBO educated interviewees started working at a younger age than WO educated interviewees. Consequently, MBO educated Tinder users valued the profession of the potential partner more than educational level. Though for the WO educated interviewees, this was the other way around. Also, WO educated interviewees seemed to have some prejudice about MBO educated people in general. Subsequently, it will be interesting to see the social effect of educational level and the interference of Tinder in society in the future. Lastly, interviewees looked at two other features of Tinder, the biography of the potential partners’ profile as well as shared mutual friends. In the end, one of the reasons why Tinder users would leave Tinder again was because they had found a new romantic partner.","['media', 'business', 'Tinder motivations', 'online potential partner selection', 'educational homogamy', 'mobile dating applications', 'filtering features']"
Investigating the nature and impact of social media campaigns that focus on the empowerment of Muslim women,R. Schenato,2017-10-23,"['P. Arora', 'J.S. Lee']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study aims to analyze the nature and impact of social media campaigns that focus on the empowerment of Muslim women. It clarifies key concepts involving women empowerment, Feminism, the status of Arab women, the notion of disempowerment, gender, media, stereotypes, social media campaigns, and activism. This paper tries to make a clear distinction between the terms “Feminism” and “Islamic Feminism” and the movements that have developed over the years. This study also presents reasons for the lack of woman empowerment due to religious, social and political reasons. Moreover, it presents a clear definition between “old” and “new” media, and how these two may affect the perception of the global society.  Concerning new media, this paper provides several examples of social media campaigns. After these concepts have been clarified, the paper addresses the research question by tackling it with both qualitative and quantitative methods of research. The qualitative method consists in two interviews made to two well-known activists in the field of women rights in the Arab world. The quantitative method instead, includes surveys from a sample of over three hundred people which was exposed to video-based social media campaigns. In both cases, interesting results were obtained. The nature of social media campaigns related to Muslim women empowerment is the spread of knowledge regarding this theme. Social media campaigns tend in fact to spread knowledge to reach a change both in a social and legislative way. The impact that the proposed social media campaigns have on the studied sample instead, is reflected by the realization of Muslim women condition, resulting in a possible change in perception and change in attitude after video-exposure. Visuals, music and words in the video campaigns seemed to have more importance for viewers than the actual message. Thus, a general consideration towards these elements could be important for the outcome of a social media campaign focused on the theme of Muslim women. This study does not want to generalize results, but simply wants to have a clearer insight on this theme.","['media', 'business', 'Women empowerment', 'Feminism', 'Status of Arab women', 'the Disempowerment', 'Gender', 'Media', 'Stereotypes', 'Social media campaigns', 'Activism', 'Muslim women empowerment.']"

Billedo']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Today, organizations are more culturally diverse than 30 years ago, and this is only likely to increase. These developments require individuals from different backgrounds to work together as a team. For these groups to successfully function, effective interaction and communication are essential. When different perspectives are shared in groups this may result in conflicts. Task conflict and relationship conflict are expected to be influenced by cultural diversity and to influence group performance. An important indicator that influences the group’s behavior is believing in the positive or negative value of diversity. Previous research has resulted in ambiguous findings regarding diversity, intragroup conflict and group performance. To date, little is known about the effects of task conflict and relationship conflict under different conditions or the explanatory factors between cultural diversity and group performance. Therefore, this research looked at task conflict and relationship conflict as mediating the relationship between cultural diversity and group performance, moderated by diversity beliefs. In a two-group (positive vs. negative diversity beliefs) experimental design participants were assigned to culturally diverse workgroups. They worked individually and collaboratively on a manipulation task and the desert survival situation as decision-making task. This research shows that cultural diversity was linked to task conflict, which in turn was linked to more favorable group performance. The relationship between cultural diversity and task conflict was moderated by diversity beliefs (under condition of negative diversity beliefs, not positive). The current study contributes by presenting evidence that task conflict acts as an important explanatory factor between workgroup diversity and group performance under condition of diversity beliefs. A heterogeneous team can provide useful insights and enhance task performance through task conflict. This study recommends managers to benefit from the culturally diverse nature of their workforce and stimulate collaboration and information exchange.","['media', 'business', 'Task conflict', 'Relationship conflict', 'Cultural diversity', 'Intercultural communication', 'Group performance']"

“modern” woman in a rather superficial and biased manner, both regarding her professional
development and her intimate life. Failing to capture the countless shifts towards a more
empowered view on women’s work achievements and expression of sexuality, such
conservative female portrayal continues to reinforce dated understandings on the matter. The
TV show “Sex and the City” has been recognized world-widely for its daring representation of
the modern woman, in terms of placing women in power over men and thus challenging the
stereotypical Television content. The TV series is perceived by many as an expression of a nontraditional
woman that is financially independent and sexually empowered. “Sex and the City”
quickly managed to become widely successful, whereby raising post-feministic discussions on
women’s societal roles. Given the societal importance of shifting gender roles, an examination
of the impact that “Sex and the City” has had on the perceptions and personal feelings of the
modern woman was conducted. As the TV show was launched in a time of changing gender
roles, a retrospective study design aimed to capture the exact effects that it had on its viewers.
Cultivation Theory was incorporated as a base for understanding the impact that repeated
exposure to TV content can have on the audiences. Attitudes Towards Women, Hyperfemininity
and Gender Empowerment Scales were used as main measurements. The data was gathered
using a quantitative empirical method, in the form of an online survey, whereby the final
sample consisted of 361 participants of various demographic backgrounds, as well as with

past decennia. However, the media industry remains one of the least involved industries in terms
of CSR. The media industry is characterized by efficiency and a problem-solving attitude. This
research set out to find how the B2B media industry may incorporate CSR efforts, while not
losing sight of the industry’s identity. The research questions for this research is thus, ‘what
determines a good fit between CSR strategies and corporate identity of B2B companies in the
media industry?’. To answer this question, the research took a qualitative approach, by making
use of in-depth interviews and applying an ethnographic aspect. The interviews were conducted
with employees and clients of a single faciliatory company that operates within the European
media industry. The research found that on both the individual and corporate level, two groups
of people can be distinguished: those in favor of implementing CSR efforts, and those who
consider it a waste when implemented within the industry. However, CSR enforcement is driven
by a top-down demand, that is currently barely present: merely a handful of clients consider CSR
important, while most other clients do not consider it relevant for the industry at all. This
perception goes hand in hand with the decrease in production budgets that has taken place over
the past few years: there simply is no financial room for sustainable innovation. The only
exception to this, is when the innovation provides more, often economic, benefits for the
production. Yet, it seems that without further incentives for clients at the beginning of the value
chain of TV production, the top-down demand for, and thus the implementation of CSR practices
will not increase any time soon. The research findings imply that a good fit between CSR
strategies and the corporate identity for the media industry are determined by its business
practice and a will to adapt. However, it is also determined by its economic performance and
business model, which is currently halting the development of CSR strategies.","['media', 'business', 'CSR', 'Media Industry', 'B2B', 'Corporate Identity', 'Broadcasters']"

Facebook. With a large amount of information available on Facebook, users need to employ
media literacy strategies in order to access and critically consume that information, as well
as produce their own content to share. Because of low costs and high reach, there is also an
increasing number of advertisements on Facebook, often in the form of paid posts. In order
to be able to recognize and critically assess advertising, users need a certain level of
advertising literacy. Therefore, this research investigated the overall levels of media and
advertising literacy among Croatian millennials, as well as the effects of intensity of
Facebook usage and media literacy on advertising literacy on Facebook. The overall
question of this research was whether Facebook usage and media literacy are positive
predictors for advertising literacy. To answer this question, an online survey was conducted
during which participants were asked questions to determine their intensity of Facebook
usage and media and advertising literacy. The participants were recruited through Facebook
using snowball sampling. The findings showed that the overall level of media literacy of the
Croatian millennials was high, attitudinal advertising literacy was high, but the ability to
recognize advertising depended on disclaimers presented with paid posts. The results
showed that media literacy positively influenced understanding of persuasive intent, but had
limited effect on other segments of advertising literacy. At the same time, intensity of
Facebook usage had limited effects on both media and advertising literacy. In order to
increase people’s ability to recognize advertising, disclaimers of paid posts need to be
clearly visible, and possibly regulated with industry guidelines. Media and advertising literacy
modules should also be present in the educational system, and individuals need to become
aware that their levels of advertising literacy are not as high as they perceive.","['media', 'business', 'Media literacy', 'advertising literacy', 'paid post', 'intensity of usage', 'Facebook']"
How Media Bias is Presented in Donald Trump’s News Coverage as a Presidential Candidate by The New York Times?,Y. Pan,2017-10-20,"['V. Tsagkroni', 'D.D.

contentious presidential candidate. Most importantly, as a Republican Presidential Nominee,
Donald Trump accused that the mainstream news media are biased against him. After that,
Donald Trump keeps conveying the message to the public that the most news media is having
media bias and the media system is even “rigged” by his opponent, the Democratic presidential
Nominee, Hillary Clinton. The New York Times speaks up for news media, claiming that the
media bias does not exist. To examine whether the claim of media bias of news media during the
2016 presidential election exists or not, this research focuses on the dispute between Donald
Trump and The New York Times to diagnose the media bias. To diagnose the media bias in
Donald Trump’s news coverage, a “media frame” perspective is adopted. That is to say, in this
research, a quantitative content analysis of media frames is first adopted to identify the media
frames of Donald Trump’s news coverage. For the reason that, in the claim of “media bias” made
by Donald Trump, it also implies that Hillary Clinton is part of the reason within. Therefore, the
content analysis of “media frame” is not only conducted in 150 news articles of The New York
Times but also in another 150 news articles of The New York Times. Consequently, media frames
of both candidates are first identified by the quantitative content analysis, and then the
components and characteristic of those media frames are as well presented. The comparisons of
the media frames of both candidates are utilized to interpret the “media bias”. As the
supplementary method in this paper, particular analysis of each single elements of the “media
frame” are also conducted to diagnose other specific forms of “media bias”. As a result, the study
finds out that in general, The New York Times is having “media bias” in Donald Trump’s news
coverage because there are significant slant of negative or unfavorable information (content) in
Trump’s news coverage. And this media bias is further asserted when comparison is done with
those media frames of Hillary Clinton’s coverage. What is more, the “media bias” exists in
Donald Trump’s news coverage mainly appears to be “ideological bias”, and other than that,
“decision-making bias”, “content bias” and “statement bias” are also diagnosed during the
supplementary analysis process. Nevertheless, “ideological bias” is the most salient form of the
media bias in Donald Trump’s coverage by The New York Times.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Donald Trump', 'The New York Times', 'media bias', 'media frames', 'ideological bias']"

Organizations (NGO’s) that operate in Greece and are attempting to tackle the recent refugee
crisis. Ever since the late 18th century, Non-Governmental Organizations have been trying to
deal with several issues from human suffering to saving the environment. As every other
organization, NGO’s ought to market themselves in order to achieve their goals. However,
how do they market the organization? On the one hand, marketing is essential to familiarize
them with the public but on the other hand marketing is a concept intrinsically linked to forprofit
organizations. This research explores the ways that NGO’s find successful to promote
their efforts. Therefore, the main research question of this thesis is “How is marketing
perceived and utilized by Non-Governmental Organizations in Greece?”. In order to answer
the aforestated research question, ten in-depth interviews with employees of six NGO’s
which operate in Greece and are involved with the refugee crisis, were conducted.
Furthermore, a thematic analysis was performed on the data collected from the interviews.
The findings indicated, that even though NGO’s do not like to be associated with marketing
tools, they do resort to using promotion strategies, which include advertisements on television
and printed press, as well as utilizing social media. Moreover, the data revealed that, even
though NGO’s do not compete, the industry is a competitive one and non-profit organizations
only cooperate, when it is towards a common target. However, all interviewees believed that
in general, there is a negative public perception of NGO’s and it is an issue that renders their
task challenging. This in turn could have an impact on their efforts and thus, render the use of
marketing in NGO’s a subject for further research.","['media', 'business', 'Marketing Strategies', 'Non-Governmental Organizations', 'Non-Profit Sector', 'Greece', 'Social Media']"
Sustainability is the new black?,D.H. Hertlein,2017-10-20,"['V. Chaudhri', 'C.J. Billedo']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Organizations are entities that need to have the ‘licence to operate’ in society. The shifting political, economical and financial changes cause an increasing uncertainty about what the future will bring, leading organizations having to strive even more for this licence. Due to these facts, sustainability has gained much prominence in recent years, shifting stakeholders’ perceptions of how an organization should operate. Luxury brands are not exempted from this licence and are certainly affected by this shift in perception, as previous research has shown that millennials and luxury brand consumers emphasize on purchasing luxury goods that are sustainably produced. Given this, and that the notions of luxury and sustainability don’t go hand in hand at first glance, luxury brands have to convince stakeholders, they are – as a matter of fact – sustainability oriented and driven. To achieve that brands design sustainability narratives, justifying the apparent paradox between luxury and sustainability, and aiming to portray themselves as being sustainable at their very core. The present thesis examined how luxury brands approach those issues and manifest sustainability as an integral part of their organizational identities by applying specific rhetorical strategies in their sustainability narratives. In order to answer this question qualitative content analysis was applied in the sustainability narratives that luxury brands present in their website. Aiming to spot different attitudes between luxury manufacturers of same conglomerates, the goal was to focus only on the sustainability website of each brand and not that of the overarching group company. Overall, the assumptions made by the researcher, based on the theoretical framework of this research, were confirmed by the findings. The key findings confirm the hesitation- addressed by previous research- of luxury brands taking a leading stand when it comes to sustainable practices. Most of the brands of the sample opted for a rather collaborative attitude towards the notion of sustainability and in some cases portrayed themselves as being constraint to operate in a certain manner, not by choice, but rather due to external influences that are out of their control. An additional theme of this research is the issue of supply chain practices, with most luxury brands shifting gears between a collaborative and authoritative attitude. Most of the brands stressed the importance of strategic partnership to achieve sustainable practices, while emphasis was also placed on achieving internal employee compliance to achieve the status of being sustainable. In terms of future research, the findings further triggered the discussion of topics that have not being addressed in this research, such as the importance of strategic partnerships. Hence replicating the present research design but refocusing on the topics would lead to a fruitful analysis.

Industries - The Multi-Dimensionality of Motivation in Relation to Growth
Intentions of Netherlands-based Architects",Natalia Bajczi,2017-10-19,['Ellen Loots'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The research topic of this thesis is the multi-dimensional motivational factors of
entrepreneurial architects based in the Netherlands in relation to growth motivations
and gender. The objective of the research was to gain an in-depth understanding of
multi-dimensional motivational factors of Dutch architects, and identify which factors
motivate them to grow their firm. The researcher conducts a qualitative
phenomenological research. The main findings identify three pairs of multidimensional
motivations, namely freedom and flexibility, value realization and
sustainability, and creative independence coupled with authority problems. In
conclusion, the entrepreneurial narrative of Dutch architects showed striking
similarities across genders, as the sex of architects does not affect motivations to grow.
Value-realization is an overarching motivation, which drives Dutch architects and
inspires them to establish ideal circumstances to be able to design and construct
buildings, which reflect and materialize one’s personal and artistic principles.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Gender', 'cultural entrepreneurship', 'creative industries', 'architecture', 'The', 'Netherlands']"
Which came first: The opinion or the news? A study of the influence of online news on diversity perspectives in The Netherlands,L.J.W. Beijen,2017-10-17,"['J. Hofhuis', 'J. Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The ongoing debates in societies all over the world about the influence of fast circulating and
personalized online news about patriotic ideas and negativities concerning cultural diversity in society
serve as the basis for this study. A theoretical research of the influence of news on people’s -
perspectives on society generally begins with two assumptions about its potential: the news has to
imply bias to a certain degree, and the to-be-influenced people and opinions have to be triggered by
this bias. Therefore, this thesis looks at a possible new contributing factor to the influence of news on
people’s perspectives, namely the online news environment in which its closed information system is
accused of having a narrowing, polarizing and attitude reinforcing effect on people’s diversity
perspectives. The experimental research model provides insight into the full online news media
process in which possibilities for selective exposure, as well as the effects of closed information
systems online, are explained. Experiment 1 tested the selective exposure theory online along people’s
diversity perspectives and Experiment 2 tested the influence of unilateral biased news on these
perspectives. To measure the diversity perspective variable a validated questionnaire was used to
measure people’s diversity perspectives, respectively ‘multiculturalism’ and ‘colorblindness’, as two
separate constructs. To measure people’s usage of online news in Experiment 1, a fictive news
website was built containing news articles with multicultural and colorblind news articles. To measure
the influence of unilateral biased news on people’s diversity perspective for Experiment 2, three
fictive news websites were built containing news articles containing either a multicultural or
colorblind bias, or had no cultural bias. Both were online experiments. This study is motivated by the
reignited interest of the selective exposure theory in an online environment and the ability of online
mechanisms to narrow rather than widen people’s perspectives on diversity. Contradicting these
theories, this study finds that people are not motivated to search for online news that confirms their
diversity perspective and their diversity perspective is also not amplified by biased online news.
Concluded is that only spending more time reading multicultural news reinforces the multicultural- as
well as the colorblind perspective, which can be ascribed to the agenda-setting function of
multicultural news in the online environment.","['media', 'business', 'Online news', 'cultural diversity', 'diversity perspective', 'multiculturalism', 'colorblindness', 'selective exposure', 'bias', 'attitude reinforcement']"
De foodblogger: kortstondige hype of authentiek rolmodel? Een onderzoek naar de perceptie en praktijk van vrouwelijke gebruikers van Nederlandse foodblogs,R.V. van der Markt,2017-10-17,"['M.P.A. Bouman', 'J. Jansz']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De foodblog is afgelopen jaren als een nieuwe bron van voedingsinformatie gaan gelden voor jonge vrouwen. Vanwege het toegankelijke karakter en het aantrekkelijke beeld wint de foodblog nog steeds aan populariteit. De openheid van het internet maakt dat de foodblogger uitspraken kan doen over voeding en gezondheid. Deze uitspraken kunnen een grote impact hebben op de gebruikers (volgers) van de blog. In sommige gevallen wordt dit door de voedingswetenschap kwalijk gevonden. Zo zijn niet alle uitspraken en adviezen van foodbloggers wetenschappelijk onderbouwd en accuraat.
De onderzoeksvraag van deze thesis luidde: Hoe percipiëren vrouwen tussen de 20 en 28 jaar de drie populairste Nederlandse foodblogs? Daartoe zijn foodblogs Rens Kroes, Green Happiness en Chicks Love Food aan de hand van kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse onderzocht. Vervolgens hebben interviews met de gebruikers van deze blogs (N=13) en medewerkers van het Voedingscentrum (N=3) plaatsgevonden. De volgende zes resultaten kwamen naar voren. De functie van de foodblog bleek voornamelijk het geven van informatie, inspiratie of motivatie. De respondenten namen hierbij de rol van een passieve gebruiker aan. De blog wordt betrouwbaar gevonden wanneer aan de volgende criteria werd voldaan: de blogger moet een voedinggerelateerde opleiding hebben gevolgd, de adviezen moeten door de gebruiker zijn uitgeprobeerd en de adviezen moeten wetenschappelijk onderbouwd zijn. Ook de culturele en sociale context van de blogger bleek van betekenis, omdat de culturele nabijheid van de blogger in verband staat met de identificatie van de gebruiker. Vervolgens werd de ervaring van authenticiteit gecreëerd door eerlijkheid, persoonlijkheid en een transparante omgang met sponsoring. De tone-of-voice werd op prijs gesteld wanneer deze de gebruiker persoonlijk aanspreekt. Ten slotte verleenden de respondenten betekenis aan het visuele beeld op het gebied van het gefotografeerde (voeding versus lifestyle-gerelateerde onderwerpen), de blogger als nieuw schoonheidsideaal en de mate van perfectie waarmee de blogger zichzelf in de publieke ruimte construeert.
De medewerkers van het Voedingscentrum kenden zowel positieve als negatieve consequenties toe aan de populariteit van foodbloggers. Positief vonden zij de bijdrage van foodbloggers aan een algemeen bewustzijn omtrent gezonde voeding. Negatief achtten zij de onjuiste adviezen of het gebrek aan wetenschappelijke onderbouwing op de foodblogs.","['media', 'cultuur', 'foodblogs', 'authenticiteit', 'betrouwbaarheid', 'perceptieonderzoek', 'gebruiker', 'User & Gratification Theory', 'het Voedingscentrum', 'sociale media']"
Developing inclusive museums: the role of personalization: A research on the impact of personalized educational products and services on museums‟ movement towards inclusion,I. Kranioti,2017-10-17,"['P.M. Leendertse', 'J.S. Lee']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The mandate of a more inclusive museum able to respond to its diverse public constitutes the
cornerstone of this research. At a time when expectations on service quality are rising, museums are being
challenged to redesign their experiences and reposition their audiences‟ expectations and needs at the
center of their operational actions. Throughout this century, museums have made thoughtful efforts to
become inclusive organizations in response to their social mission as public funding institutions, although
there is still way ahead. The creation of inclusive educational programs can be seen as the opportunity to
museums‟ movement towards inclusion. In this context, this paper proposes that a personalized approach
around their educational products can contribute to this goal.
The research aims to act as an explanatory study on how museums can exploit the creation of
personalized educational products and services through digital means to meet the growing needs of their
diverse audience and become more inclusive institutions. For the sake of this research, eleven experts in
the museum field were selected and then interviewed. The data analysis was based on the conceptual
framework that was formulated according to the literature on the field of inclusivity and personalization.
The analyses of the expert interviews revealed that experts are interested for the creation of personalized
educational products as an opportunity to make the museum experience more personal and accessible to

Reputation affection in the Samsung Electronics smartphone crisis,X.G.J. Huisman,2017-10-17,"['Y. Wang', 'J. Kneer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Reputation is seen as one of the most important intangible assets of a company. It takes years for a company to built a good reputation. However, a reputation of a company can be damaged within minutes. This is oftentimes caused by a crisis. A crisis is a “sudden and unexpected event that threatens to disrupt an organization’s operations and poses both financial and reputational treat” (Coombs, 2007, p. 164). The effective use of crisis communication can repair the reputational damage. In order for communication managers to know when crisis communication is affective one can use the situational crisis communication theory. This theory covers all important aspects of a crisis such as the type of crisis, the responsibility, response strategies and emotions. Though, the theory does not cover the perception of the public on reputation. Therefore, this study aims to find out whether or not the reputation of Samsung Electronics has been affected in the eye of the Dutch public after the crisis with regards to the exploding batteries of the Galaxy Note 7. 
	Using a quantitative method, an online survey has been distributed in order to find out if the post-crisis reputation can be predicted based on responsibility and experiencing negative emotions. The results of this study suggest that responsibility as well as negative emotions does not have an effect on the post-crisis reputation of Samsung Electronics. This can be explained by the fact that the responsibility level within this crisis is rather low according to Coombs (2005). Additionally, the public is very familiar with Samsung Electronics as a brand and is therefore not seen as a predictor for post-crisis reputational damage. Additionally, the involvement of the Dutch public has a positive effect on the post-crisis reputation. It has been concluded that the Dutch public was highly involved since the release of a new Galaxy Note smartphone took some time. Furthermore, future study should focus more on the involvement of the public with regards to a crisis in order to provide a profound framework. This framework can be used by communication managers in order to implement more effective crisis communication in times of emergency.","['media', 'business', 'reputation management', 'situational crisis communication theory', 'crisis communication', 'responsibility', 'involvement', 'emotions', 'post-crisis reputation']"
'Social Erfgoed',A.W. Raijmakers,2017-10-17,"['A.J.C. van der Hoeven', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Delft is een stad vol cultureel erfgoed. Dit erfgoed wordt elk jaar weer meer bezocht (Prinsenhof Delft, 2015). Delfts cultureel erfgoed trekt daarnaast ook steeds meer aandacht op sociale media. Er ontstaan meer erfgoed-gerelateerde pagina’s en deze pagina’s trekken een groeiende groep belangstellenden die het gedeelde erfgoed op de pagina’s volgen. Door de groei van het gebruik van sociale media zou het begrip over en de ervaring met erfgoed geherdefinieerd worden (Giaccardi, 2012). Via sociale media kan iedereen deelnemen aan het verkennen en verrijken van cultureel erfgoed. Op deze manier kan men ook waarden toekennen aan erfgoed op sociale media. Deze waarden zorgen ervoor dat cultureel erfgoed betekenis krijgt (Gregory, 2015). 									Dit huidige onderzoek heeft gekeken hoe inwoners van Delft in een participatiecultuur Delfts cultureel erfgoed waarderen op de Facebookpagina Historic Pictures of Delft. Doordat dit onderzoek zich focust op Delft en op de pagina Historic Pictures of Delft, gaat het onderzoek de diepte in. Door middel van interviews wordt er aangegeven wat mensen zelf nu belangrijk vinden voor zo een pagina. Dit is nog niet gedaan door eerder onderzoek.		 Totaal zijn er elf diepte-interviews gehouden met een duur van 45-80 minuten. Tijdens de interviews zijn er vragen gesteld over Delft, cultureel erfgoed, sociale media en de combinatie van deze drie. Naast leden is ook de eigenaar van de pagina geïnterviewd. 		Uit dit onderzoek volgen ten eerste resultaten op het gebied van erfgoed en sociale media. Zo geven de respondenten aan waarom zij geïnteresseerd zijn in erfgoed. Deze interesse ontstaat voornamelijk door verhalen, herinneringen, persoonlijk erfgoed en trots. Vervolgens tonen de interviews ook aan waarom de respondenten sociale media gebruiken, zowel voor de media in het algemeen als voor erfgoed-gerelateerde sociale-mediapagina’s. Mensen zijn vooral actief op erfgoed-gerelateerde pagina’s voor informatie en kennis, voor entertainment, om tijd te doden, voor utilitaire doeleinden en om interessante informatie te delen. Verder volgen de respondenten bepaalde pagina’s, omdat zij zich verbonden voelen met een stad of gebied, interesse hebben in bepaald cultureel erfgoed of vanwege werk. 		De belangrijkste resultaten zijn de waarden die voortvloeiden uit de interviews. Dit zijn waarden die men toekent aan erfgoed en aan de erfgoed-gerelateerde pagina. Uit de interviews kwamen vier nieuwe waarden naar voren: verhalen, kennis, herinneringen en herkenning. Historische en sociale waarden uit het onderzoek van Clarke (2010) blijken ook belangrijk te zijn voor de pagina. Deze zes waarden zijn te verklaren door het persoonlijke aspect dat sociale media met zich meebrengen, zoals de mogelijkheid tot interactie (Bateman, Pike & Butler, 2011). Sociale waarden van erfgoed op een pagina, zoals Historic Pictures of Delft, zijn belangrijker dan bij erfgoed in het algemeen. Ook is het veel gemakkelijker om verhalen en herinneringen te delen via sociale media.						Doordat dit onderzoek de diepte in gaat en zich vooral focust op Delft en de pagina Historic Pictures of Delft, kunnen de resultaten moeilijk gegeneraliseerd worden. Vervolgonderzoek kan daarom kijken of de gevonden resultaten ook gelden voor andere steden en andere sociale media, zoals Instagram en Flickr.","['media', 'cultuur', 'cultureel erfgoed', 'sociale media', 'Delft', 'participatiecultuur', 'waarden']"
Nederlandse berichtgeving over de Islamitische Staat,F.C.R. den Dunnen,2017-10-17,"['P.C. Ruigrok', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Dit onderzoek analyseert de berichtgeving omtrent de Islamitische Staat in de Nederlandse kranten
tussen 2014 en 2016. De Islamitische Staat heeft verkondigd zich te willen focussen op het Westen.
Sinds 2014 zijn er dan ook verschillende aanslagen gepleegd die zijn opgeëist door de Islamitische
Staat. De berichtgeving omtrent de Islamitische Staat en diens aanslagen zijn op uiteenlopende
manieren verslaan. Om verschillen te kunnen waarnemen wordt onder andere gekeken naar
verschillende frames die kunnen voorkomen in een krantenbericht. Zo wordt het dreigingsframe,
othering frame, diplomatieke- en militaireframe onderzocht. De keuze die journalisten maken omtrent
het framen van gebeurtenissen heeft invloed op een maatschappij en kan volgens voorgaande literatuur
bijdragen aan polarisatie. Er wordt in dit onderzoek onderscheid gemaakt tussen populaire- en
kwaliteitskranten aangezien eerder onderzoek sterke verschillen heeft aangetoond. Populaire kranten
worden getypeerd als populistisch en rechts waar kwaliteitskranten worden getypeerd als links en
gefundeerd. Er zijn echter ook onderzoeken die erop wijzen dat de verschillen tussen populaire- en
kwaliteitskranten vervagen. Dit houdt in dat de nieuwsselectie en de daartoe behorende nieuwswaarden
door beide kranten gelijkgestemd worden gewaardeerd. Volgens enkele onderzoekers wordt zo de
toenemende invloed van commercialisatie zichtbaar die ervoor moet zorgen dat er meer publiek wordt
bereikt dan wel het huidige publiek wordt behouden.
Uit de analyse blijkt dat de media-aandacht omtrent de Islamitische Staat sterk is gestegen sinds
2014. Wanneer gekeken wordt naar de nieuwswaarden die beide krantentypes belangrijk achten wordt
duidelijk dat beide kranten conform eerdere onderzoeken gelijkgestemd zijn. De berichtgeving over de
Islamitische Staat piekt bij beide krantentypes op dezelfde momenten. Er is in dit onderzoek bewezen
dat populaire- en kwaliteitskranten in hun berichtgeving steeds meer op elkaar gaan lijken.
Kwaliteitskranten laten zich mogelijk leiden door commercialisatie wanneer geschreven wordt over de
Islamitische Staat. De vervaging tussen beide krantentypes wordt ook zichtbaar wanneer gekeken wordt
naar het gebruik van frames. Duidelijk wordt dat het othering frame veelvuldig wordt gebruikt in de
berichtgeving van beide krantentypes. Voorgaande literatuur stelt dat vooral populaire kranten gebruik
maken van het othering frame. Daarnaast blijkt dat vooral de culterele of geografische ligging van een
gebeurtenis voor journalisten een rol speelt tijdens de nieuwsselectie. Conform eerdere literatuur geven
populaire kranten voorkeur aan het militaire-interventie frame, waar kwaliteitskranten eerder het
diplomatie frame gebruiken. Er is in de berichtgeving omtrent de Islamitische Staat geen journalism of
attachment waargenomen. Beargumenteerd wordt dat dit kan veranderen wanneer er een aanslag wordt
gepleegd in Nederland.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Islamitische Staat', 'framing', 'othering', 'nieuwswaarden', 'clash of civilizations']"
Zicht op impact,M.E. de Boer,2017-10-17,"['M. Slot', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De Nederlandse overheid investeert steeds minder geld in wetenschappelijk onderzoek en innovatie. Ook de mediasector heeft hieronder te lijden. De afnemende mate waarin geïnvesteerd wordt in innovatie leidt ertoe dat onder andere fondsen het op zich nemen innovatieve mediaprojecten te ondersteunen, en daarmee maatschappelijke waarde proberen te creëren. Deze fondsen zijn op zoek naar een manier om inzicht te krijgen in de effecten van de activiteiten die zij ondersteunen. Onderzoek naar methoden voor het kwalitatief evalueren van maatschappelijke impact is echter nog zeer beperkt, zeker in de context van innovatiefondsen. Om deze redenen is in dit onderzoek gepoogd op basis van inzichten en ervaringen van zowel fondsen als projectaanvragers adviezen op te stellen met betrekking tot het kwalitatief evalueren van maatschappelijke impact. De onderzoeksvraag daarbij luidt: Hoe kan de maatschappelijke impact van gesubsidieerde media-innovatieprojecten kwalitatief geëvalueerd worden binnen de context van fondsen in Nederland? Aan de hand van interviews met zes fondsen en tien projectaanvragers zijn inzichten met betrekking tot het evalueren van maatschappelijke impact vergaard en geanalyseerd. Uit de analyse blijkt dat zowel fondsen als projectaanvragers allerlei termen gebruiken om over maatschappelijke impact te spreken. Hoewel in theorie een oplossing wordt geboden voor het ontbreken van een expliciete definitie van maatschappelijke impact, blijkt in de praktijk het evalueren van maatschappelijke impact op die manier niet haalbaar. Deze uitkomst zou zelfs tot de vraag kunnen leiden of we in de toekomst misschien afstand moeten doen van het gebruik van de term maatschappelijke impact om de waarde van interventies uitgevoerd door fondsen en projecten beter te kunnen beschrijven. Daarnaast wordt het bewerkstelligen en evalueren van maatschappelijke impact in de theorie over het algemeen als een lineair proces omschreven. Uit de analyse blijkt echter dat het bewerkstelligen van maatschappelijke impact in de praktijk veel meer de vorm van een iteratief proces aanneemt. Hieruit kan geconcludeerd worden dat het wellicht opportuun is om de lineaire structuur van het bewerkstelligen en evalueren van maatschappelijke impact te herdenken. Door verwikkeld te zijn in het iteratieve proces en projecten stap voor stap te helpen wordt indirect geïnvesteerd in het project. Fondsen worden op deze wijze onderdeel van de impactontwikkeling.","['media', 'cultuur', 'maatschappelijke impact', 'media-innovatie', 'fondsen', 'projecten', 'impact', 'impact evaluatie', 'waardeketenmodel']"
Poëzie in de jukebox,K. de Vries,2017-10-17,"['M. Willekens', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De toekenning van de Nobelprijs voor Literatuur aan de Amerikaanse muzikant Bob Dylan heeft in het Nederlandse culturele veld niet alleen een polemiek veroorzaakt tussen schrijvers en musici over de terechtheid van de toekenning, maar ook over wat er onder literatuur en muziek wordt verstaan en hoe de verschillende culturele velden en hun producten gepositioneerd zijn in het culturele veld. In dit kwalitatieve onderzoek is er door middel van interviews met totaal 12 voor- en tegenstanders aan de productiekant uit beide velden geprobeerd om deze polemiek op een wetenschappelijke manier te analyseren en is deze aan de hand van een uitgebreid theoretisch kader, met daarin een divers aantal onderdelen waarop het culturele veld en specifieke culturele velden zoals literatuur en muziek worden onderzocht, getoetst voor een huidig beeld van het Nederlandse culturele veld. De focus van dit onderzoek ligt daarbij op de manier waarop de muzikale en literaire velden zich afscheiden door middel van symbolische grenzen, maar ook hoe er strijd wordt gevoerd rondom de conceptualisering van product specifieke kenmerken en om economisch kapitaal. Daarbij is er gekeken naar hoe verschillende actoren, waaronder het Nobelprijs Comité, bepalend zijn voor de manier waarop het culturele veld is ingericht en wat dit betekent voor de producenten van literaire en muzikale producten.					De toekenning aan Bob Dylan bleek een vruchtbare bodem voor een polemiek die al een langere tijd speelde. De strijd rond symbolisch kapitaal blijkt daarbij onder druk te staan van economisch kapitaal, wat door middel van subsidies en consumentisme behaald kan worden. Bij het conceptualiseren van literaire waardes en kwaliteitskenmerken in de kunst blijkt dat de emotionele individuele ervaring van de consument voor de respondenten leidend is en waardoor er geen wetmatigheden rondom productkwalificatie gesteld kunnen worden. Aan de andere kant laat dit onderzoek zien dat mediapersoonlijkheden een steeds grotere invloed spelen in de smaakbepaling en genreclassificering van culturele producten en daarmee indirect een grote invloed uitoefenen op de toekenning van economisch en symbolisch kapitaal. Het Nobelprijs Comité wordt hierin een dubbelzijdige rol aangemeten, doordat deze voor de producenten in het veld aan status van professionele en eervolle erkenning inboet, maar dat deze status door de media in de maatschappij overeind wordt gehouden. Wat betreft de technische verschillen tussen literaire en muzikale producten wordt er een discussie gevoerd over de mogelijkheid om de songtekst uit te schrijven en te isoleren van de muzikale componenten eromheen. De symbolische strijd richt zich met name op het literaire veld waarbinnen een interne strijd wordt genoemd om symbolisch kapitaal en het aanleggen van grenzen door middel van statustoekenningen en een positionering in het culturele veld. Dit wordt door de voorstanders gezien als een reactie op het afnemende belang van het literaire veld binnen het culturele veld als geheel. Daarbij worden er misvattingen besproken over de mate van economisch kapitaal binnen het muzikale veld en over de status van popmuziek als lager soort, waarbij toekenning van Bob Dylan door de muzikanten wordt gezien als een kwalitatieve erkenning voor muzikale producten.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Bob Dylan', 'Nobelprijs', 'cultuursociologie', 'subsidies', 'media', 'Bourdieu', 'culturele productie', 'muziek', 'literatuur']"
De nieuwe generatie schrijvende journalisten,E. Ooms,2017-10-17,"['A.J.C. van der Hoeven', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het medialandschap is in de laatste jaren hevig gewijzigd, en evenzo het werkveld van journalisten
van de schrijvende pers. Economische en technologische veranderingen hebben de context van de
media fors veranderd. De digitalisering heeft de nieuwsvoorziening sneller, gratis en toegankelijk
gemaakt. Hetgeen heeft een stortvloed aan concurrentie ten gevolg, naast de economische recessie die
in 2008 z’n intrede heeft gedaan. Teruglopende oplages en advertentie-inkomsten hebben de
traditionele mediaorganisaties genoopt tot ernstige bezuinigingen. Gevolglijk heeft er een aanzienlijke
daling van journalisten in vaste dienst plaatsgevonden en is daarentegen het aantal freelance -
journalisten flink toegenomen. Er is aldus sprake van een nieuwe context, waarin
socialiseringsprocessen en opvattingen over de professionele rol van een journalist zijn meeveranderd.
Socialisatie kan omschreven worden als een drukkend proces waarbij een persoon de
normen, waarden en andere cultuurkenmerken van een groepering krijgt aangeleerd, zij het bewust of
onbewust. Het conformeren aan deze criteria is een voorwaarde om volledig te kunnen integreren. Tot
nu wordt er in de academische literatuur van uitgegaan dat dit proces plaatsvindt bij de
mediaorganisatie (één werkgever) alwaar een journalist werkzaam is. Die omstandigheden zijn
zogezegd echter niet meer zo eenduidig als voorheen. Dit gegeven vormt de insteek van dit onderzoek,
met de bijkomende onderzoeksvraag: “Hoe wordt het ‘socialiseringsproces’ gepercipieerd door
journalisten van de schrijvende pers in een veranderd medialandschap?”.
Vanwege de percentuele toename van het aantal freelance -journalisten in Nederland zijn dit
type ‘nieuw soort’ journalist ondervraagd om ervaringen en percepties van een nieuwe generatie
journalisten te toetsen. Hiertoe zijn veertien semigestructureerde interviews afgelegd, waarover een
thematische analyse is losgelaten. Dit heeft geleid tot een cluster van strekkingen, alwaar twee
verschijnselen het meest in het oog springen. Uit de gesprekken met de journalisten viel een teneur
waar te nemen over een grote discrepantie tussen vaste journalisten en freelance -journalisten, iets wat
tevens valt aan te wijzen als generatieverschil. De vaste journalisten, vaak journalisten van oudere
generaties, zijn in de regel in dienst bij traditioneel grote namen in de media en worden, of zijn, aldaar
nog op de ‘traditionele’ wijze gesocialiseerd. Dat geldt echter niet voor freelance -journalisten, in de
regel jongere collega’s. Deze nieuwe generatie is op zichzelf aangewezen om te conformeren aan de
identiteit van opdrachtgevende media. Dit doen freelance -journalisten door zogeheten ‘omgekeerde
socialisering’, waarbij de dynamiek met betrekking tot stijl, ideologie en waarden is omgedraaid.
Freelancers maken zichzelf op eigen initiatief bekend met deze voorwaarden. Een tendens die kan
worden beschouwd als een overlevingsmechanisme maar eveneens zeer goed past in een
medialandschap waarin media zich uitdrukkelijker formatteren. Allicht ook om in te spelen op het
nieuwe werkveld van mediaorganisaties en schrijvende journalisten","['media', 'cultuur', 'journalistiek', 'socialisering', 'freelancers', 'media', 'journalisten']"
Tijdschriftenmerken in het digitale tijdperk,S.I. Vonk,2017-10-17,"['J. de Haan', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De Nederlandse tijdschriftenbranche verkeert in zwaar weer. Het groeiende aanbod van online media betekent
voor veel tijdschriften een dalende oplage van het papieren materiaal. Via een crossmedia-aanbod proberen
tijdschriftenmerken de merkwaarde in de perceptie van de consument positief te beïnvloeden. Online materiaal
zou de merkwaarde – de merkkennis, de merkrelatie en de positie van het merk in het mediarepertoire van de
consument – moeten ondersteunen of zelfs versterken. Dit om de nadelige effecten van digitalisering op de branche
van papieren media te weerstaan. Het huidige onderzoek heeft als doel de perceptie van de merkwaarde van
tijdschriftenmerken door consumenten te verhelderen, op basis van de meest recente digitale merkextensies. Hoe
geven de lezers en gebruikers van de tijdschriftenmerken, Linda, Vogue, Voetbal International en Men’s Health,
betekenis aan de merkwaarde op basis van het tijdschriftenproduct én de digitale merkuitbreidingen? Lezers en
gebruikers van zowel het papieren als het online materiaal van deze vier Nederlandse tijdschriften zijn
geïnterviewd. Op een verkennende wijze is het proces van het tot stand komen van een merkwaarde in de perceptie
van de consument van online materiaal in kaart gebracht. De digitale merkextensies die als voorbeeld dienden in
het huidige onderzoek, varieerden van nieuwsblogs van Linda.nieuws tot aan fitnesoefeningen in videomateriaal
van Men’s Health. Hiermee zijn duidelijke resultaten aan het licht gebracht. Consumenten blijken aan online
materiaal een zeer verschillende merkwaarde toe te kennen dan wanneer het papieren materiaal betreft. Online
materiaal brengt minder emotie los waardoor de merkkennis van online merken negatief beïnvloedt kan worden.
De online consument verlangt tegenwoordig naar het ‘snacken’ van media: zeer vluchtig materiaal bekijken tussen
de alledaagse bezigheden door. Het juiste online snackmateriaal kan de merkrelatie met het tijdschriftenmerk dan
weer positief beïnvloeden. Het snacken van media blijkt voornamelijk plaats te vinden via links op sociale media.
Vooral het facebookgebruik van consumenten bleek van doorslaggevende betekenis in de perceptie van de
consument over het online materiaal. Naar aanleiding van deze resultaten is de volgende conclusie getrokken.
Digitale merkextensies van tijdschriften moeten aanvullend zijn op het papieren materiaal, moeten in stijl en
onderwerpen een herkenbaarheid met het moedermerk uitstralen en moeten voldoende aansluiten bij de huidige
mediabehoefte genaamd snacken. Op deze wijze kunnen digitale merkextensies van tijdschriften de merkwaarde
in de perceptie van de consument ondersteunen of zelfs versterken. Wanneer tijdschriftenmerken een crossmediaaanbod
op de markt brengen zonder deze criteria in acht te nemen, kunnen de digitale merkextensies de
merkwaarde van het gehele merk te niet doen in de perceptie van de consument.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'Tijdschriftenbranche', 'Digitalisering', 'Merkwaarde', 'Crossmedia', 'Online Snacken']"
Het kopen van vinyl,S.A. Nieuwpoort,2017-10-17,"['H.J.C.J. Hitters', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Uit cijfers van de afgelopen jaren blijkt dat de verkoop van vinyl elk jaar opnieuw
weer records breekt. Recent onderzoek gaat vaak in op de vraag waarom de
verkopen van vinyl stijgen. Er is echter nog maar in geringe mate onderzoek
gedaan naar de motieven van consumenten om vinyl te kopen, en ook naar de
motivatie om vinyl in een platenwinkel te kopen. Er is ook nog geen onderzoek
verricht naar hoe vinylconsumenten te werk gaan in een platenwinkel om een
potentiële nieuwe aanwinst te vinden in een platenwinkel. Hier komt nog bij dat de
verkoper ook invloed heeft op de keuze van de consument. Dit alles heeft geleid tot
de volgende onderzoeksvraag: Wat motiveert consumenten om vinyl te kopen bij
een platenzaak, hoe zoeken zij daarbij en wat is de invloed van de verkoper? Om
deze vraag te beantwoorden wordt er geput uit verschillende theorieën. Zo wordt
vinyl als artefact gebruikt, de theorie van curation, het Consumer Retail Search
Process (CRSP) en de stammentheorie met betrekking tot vinylconsumenten. Als
methode is er een combinatie van de participerende observatie en
semigestructureerde diepte-interviews gebruikt. Voor de analyse van de data is
gebruik gemaakt van een thematische analyse
Uit deze thematische analyse kwamen drie thema’s naar voren: de
motivaties om naar een winkel toe te gaan, het zoekgedrag in de winkel en de
verkoper. De motivatie van een consument is moeilijk eenduidig weer te geven. Een
aantal factoren kwamen steeds in wisselende samenstelling naar voren: routines,
sfeer, inrichting van de winkel, persoonlijke waarde van het medium en de
regressieve consumptie van vinyl. Het zoekgedrag van vinylconsumenten is wel
eenduidiger te vangen: men kan hedonisch of epistemisch zoeken. Deze twee zoek
strategieën komen overeen met het CRSP-model. Hier wordt nog een derde vorm
van zoeken aan toegevoegd in het geval van vinylconsumenten: ‘kratgraven’. De
invloed van de verkoper op het zoekproces van de klant wordt door de klant zelf niet
groot geacht. De fysieke aanwezigheid van de verkoper alsmede zijn kennis is
echter van grote waarde voor de klant. Dit proces van curatie is van onschatbare
waarde voor de klant. Echter, de curatie van vinyl moet voorzichtig gebeuren in
relatie tot de klant, anders wordt de curatie als opdringerig ervaren door de klant.","['media', 'cultuur', 'Vinyl', 'zoekgedrag', 'CRSP', 'participerende observatie', 'curation', 'artefact', 'tribal marketing']"
‘Hoe zit het met mijn online privacy?’,J.M. Snel,2017-10-17,"['M. Willekens', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het internet en sociale media bieden internetgebruikers de mogelijkheid om online te interacteren en
content te delen. Vooral jongeren maken hier op actieve wijze gebruik van. De vormgeving en de aard
van sociale media moedigen gebruikers aan om grote hoeveelheden persoonlijke gegevens weer te
geven en te delen. Dit brengt echter ook privacyrisico’s met zich mee, dankzij het surveillance
mechanisme waarop sociale media draaien. Sociale media en andere partijen gebruiken namelijk deze
gegevens om winst te maken, maar ook om individueel gedrag te voorspellen, te beïnvloeden en zelfs
te bepalen. Het behoud van (online) privacy is echter een probleem dat door velen wordt genegeerd.
Men vindt privacy over het algemeen wel belangrijk, maar handelt hier nauwelijks naar, wat de
privacy paradox heet. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor onder jongeren is onwetendheid; jongeren zijn
zich vaak onbewust van de bewustzijnsexploitatie gedaan door bedrijven en missen digitale
geletterdheid om zich hier beter tegen te beschermen. Dit onderzoek richt zich op in hoeverre het
privacybewustzijn, bestaande uit de perceptie, aandacht en kennis wat betreft online privacy-kwesties,
reikt onder Nederlandse jongeren vanaf 16 tot en met 29 jaar die gebruikmaken van sociale media.
Via een online enquête is er data verzameld van 260 respondenten. Bevindingen toonden aan dat
actief sociale mediagebruik en deels het opleidingsniveau van invloed bleken te zijn op de
privacyperceptie en geslacht op de privacykennis. Leeftijd en privacykennis bleken van invloed te zijn
op de kans dat respondenten van plan waren bewuste actie te ondernemen om de online privacy beter
te beschermen. Aan de hand van de resultaten wordt geconcludeerd dat ook onder de onderzochte
jongeren de privacy paradox aanwezig is, maar dat er een nuance noodzakelijk is, omdat de privacy
paradox gedeeltelijk wordt tegengesproken; respondenten die op actievere wijze gebruikmaken van
sociale media maakten zich namelijk minder zorgen over hun online privacy dan respondenten die op
minder actieve wijze gebruikmaken van sociale media. Daarnaast wordt geconcludeerd dat het gebrek
aan privacykennis onder de respondenten niet sociaal is gestructureerd, sinds leeftijd en
opleidingsniveau hier niet van invloed op bleken te zijn. Tot slot wordt geconcludeerd dat dit
onderzoek deels heeft bijgedragen aan het bijbrengen van reflectie, kennis en een kritischer bewustzijn
over online privacy onder de respondenten, waarmee zij op bewustere wijze om kunnen gaan met het
delen van persoonlijke gegevens op het internet en sociale media.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'Online privacy', 'internet', 'sociale media', 'privacy paradox', 'privacybewustzijn']"
Creative startups and the city Berlin,T.T. Trinh Thanh,2017-10-17,"['H.J.C.J. Hitters', 'M.N.M. Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The debate around the transformation of the new economic order in cities has gained momentum, particularly following the “creative city” policy. Despite the fact that major (capital) cities have focused on their image as a “creative city”, the benefits of such urban places for creative industries remain vaguely defined. As such, the study proposes to shift the attention to the main stands of thoughts that have focused on the relation between cities (place) and creative industries. In doing so, it attempts to (i) resynthesize the blurred and overlapped perspectives and (ii) redirect the focus from mature and growing firms to young and vulnerable startups. This allows for empirical evidence on the economic, social and symbolic value of cities from the perception of creative startups. Using qualitative interviews with international (co-)founders of creative startups in Berlin, this study finds that the complex nature and varied characteristics of creative startups explains how and for whom cities are perceived to be important sites of economic, social and symbolic manifestations in the production of creative goods and services. In addition, the study also draws attention to the ways in which new communication technologies mediates opportunities for creative startups.","['sociology of culture', 'sociology of media', 'sociology of the arts', 'Startups', 'Creative industries', 'Berlin', 'Creative city', 'Qualitative research']"
And the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Hollywood Film goes to…,T. van Meurs,2017-10-13,"['M.N.M. Verboord', 'M.S.S.E. Janssen']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This paper looks at the diversity in the Academy Award category
for Best Foreign Language Film to show how an international
process of consecration is still strongly nested in a Western gaze.
By studying consecration amongst an international collection of
productions, this study adds to previous consecration research
focusing mainly on domestic products, and previous cultural flows
studies focusing mainly on economic recognition. To do this, a
dataset of 2,219 films submitted for the Best Foreign Language
Film Oscar between 1956-2016 was used. With a multilevel
analysis, this paper uncovers which predictors affect the chances
of moving from submission to nomination, and subsequently from
nomination to winner. Results suggest the existence of a
Hollywood bias in the Oscar category, as films directed by a
director with previous ties to the industry, or distributed by a
distributor with a Hollywood office, have an increased chance of
getting nominated. The director-effect also holds up when
analyzing the move from nomination to winner. Additionally, this
paper argues that submitted films do not benefit from being
released prior to the awards, as this negatively affects their
probability to end up among the final nominated five films. The
study concludes that, while arguing for the category as one purely
for non-Hollywood related productions, Hollywood still votes for the
relatively familiar productions, challenging the idea that the
Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film celebrates world

The Art Gallery and The Market in a Digital Age,J.J. van der Schaaf,2017-10-09,"['N. Komarova', 'M.J. Berghman']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Digitization influences all part of society, from social interaction to commerce. While certain parts of the cultural field have already altered drastically under the influence of digitization (e.g., the music industry), the art market seems to be lagging behind. So, this thesis examines how, from a perspective of cultural production (Peterson & Anand, 2004), technology changes the art market. Specifically, it analyzes how the primary contemporary art market of Amsterdam changes under the influence of digitization and how different types of galleries embed digital tools and media in their activities. Four types of contemporary art galleries are identified: established commercial galleries, established avant-garde galleries, young avant-garde galleries, and young commercial galleries, to be able to specify how and why different types of galleries utilize digital tools and media. Semi-structured interviews were done with ten gallery owners in Amsterdam. The interviews were then analyzed and coded. From the perspective of cultural production (Peterson & Anand, 2004), technology has, to some extent, changed the primary art market in Amsterdam. In terms of communications, promotions, discovery of art, consumer engagement, and public reach, all interviewed art galleries have largely digitized their practices. However, information asymmetry and the sales aspect of the art market were found to be more complicated areas of the primary art market to change. As has become clear, the sharing of information is largely related the commercial attitude of galleries, who share this information because it assists their business strategy. Avant-garde galleries are more traditional in this sense, emphasizing the importance of social relations and face-to-face contact, as argument against sharing information. In terms of online sales, commercial galleries, both established and young, were found to be utilizing the possibilities of the digital environment, while avant-garde galleries, both established and young, seemed less willing to exploit the options of online sales to the fullest. The primary market of Amsterdam appears to have the possibility to change under the influence of digitization, however, this does not apply to all aspects of the galleries’ practices, i.e., information asymmetry and online sales, at this point.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'digitization', 'digital media', 'primary art market', 'contemporary art galleries', 'perspective of cultural production']"
Living a thousand lives,V.H.H.B. Bisschop,2017-10-09,"['N. van Poecke', 'S.L. Reijnders']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study investigates the role of young adult (YA) fiction in narrative identity construction among adult readers, as well as their cultural practices regarding YA fiction in everyday life. It bases its research on Paul Ricoeur’s (1991) theory of narrative identity, which argues that narratives – fictional and factual – are the medium through which we construct our life story. Studies report that YA fiction, or fiction specifically written for adolescents, is mostly consumed by adults. This is curious as YA novels are primarily coming-of-age stories and deal with issues regarding growing up and finding one’s identity. Thus this research studies this particular age group regarding narrative identity, especially because McAdams (1985) states that one’s life story does not emerge until (late) adolescence. The results of 9 in-depth, active interviews with adults aged 20 to 35, show adults utilize YA fiction in various ways, such as the structuring of time in everyday life, escapism, understanding one’s world around them, as well as finding oneself in fiction. The latter finding is connected to the second finding, namely discordancy in life. YA fiction helps readers understand discordant events, give them new perspectives and lead to changes in the self. It shows that YA fiction can influence readers, also with regards to beliefs, values and views on moral and societal issues. Lastly, many readers prefer YA fiction, because it provides possibilities. This is partly connected to the practice of escapism, though also to finding one’s identity. YA fiction provides answers to grand questions regarding one’s identity. Thus, this study demonstrates that YA fiction has a certain role in narrative identity construction.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Young adult literature', 'narrative identity', 'cultural practice', 'everyday life', 'self', 'pragmatism.']"
A Digital Space for the Displaced,J.S. Tossell,2017-10-09,"['I. Awad Cherit', 'D.D. Dumitrica']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study examines the increasing role played by information and communication
technology (ICT) in facilitating transnational migration by focusing on the mass resettlement
of Syrian refugees in Europe as a result of the ongoing conflict and displacement in Syria.
Although considerable academic attention has been paid to how modern technology is used
by migrants to navigate and overcome obstacles during their journey, less emphasis has
been placed on the role of ICTs once they arrive at their destination. Specifically, this study
seeks to identify the roles played by the mobile phone in contributing to a Syrian refugee’s
material and emotional wellbeing in a popular destination country, the Netherlands. A total of
ten in-depth qualitative interviews have been conducted with male Syrian refugees in various
parts of the country. Through data analysis, the study outlines the role of the mobile phone in
securing respondents’ access to practical opportunities and services, as well as its role in
facilitating contact and support both from local networks and those back home. The findings
indicate that refugees’ previous experiences with mobile technology, especially during their
journey, have fostered strong bonds with the device that can shape its subsequent usage in
the Netherlands. Yet even within the Dutch context, different usage patterns emerged
between resettled refugees and those awaiting status approval, and also between those who
actively embrace the multifunctionality of mobile technology and those who seek to limit
mobile usage to communication. The mobile phone seems unique in its rapid ability to
mobilize and canvas networks of support, but its role in generating such networks in the first
place is also highly user dependent. Finally, this study asserts that the mobile phone plays
an irreplaceable role in maintaining contact between refugees and their friends and families
in Syria, to the extent that all such communication is mediated through the device. This
dependency has redefined family practices and dynamics, and can also place a significant
burden upon the Netherlands-based refugee. With the Syrian refugee crisis ongoing and
Dutch society becoming increasingly digitally connected, the findings of this study provide
valuable insights into a particular user group that faces the prospect of a growing reliance on
mobile technology in the near future.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Migration', 'Mobile Phone', 'Refugee', 'Syria', 'Mobility', 'Networks', 'Connectivity', 'Transnationalism']"
Art Related Cultural Conflicts and How the Media presents them,L. Vogt,2017-10-09,"['P.P.L. Berkers', 'D. Stocco Ferreira']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study explores the complex and understudied relationship between the arts, (geo)politics and the media in an era of global cultural exchange by investigating how the media represents cultural conflicts over (satirical) art. Research in the past mostly concentrated on satire and politics itself, with its majority in the US; and relating to controversies over art, literature focused mostly on cases that touched upon religion. However, the interplay of culture, satire and international media coverage has received little attention as of today. This study argues that media writers actively influence the representation of cultural and political conflicts through selecting certain frames but not others.
By investigating the media coverage of the Böhmermann/Erdogan case by German newspapers, the following aspects and questions were addressed. First, how are art related cultural conflicts represented by the media, which aspects of the controversy are selectively included and which are excluded by the media writers. Second, which speakers were given a voice and which voices are worthy being heard. Third, which frames were selected by media writers to represent the controversy. Finally, this research also compared how ideological differences and target groups can influence the paper’s media presentation.
The quantitative and qualitative content analysis of the online media coverage of three German newspapers (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Kölner Express and Deutsch-Türkische Nachrichten) revealed the following insights. First, regarding the general development of the controversy, it was revealed that controversy raises attention especially when political leaders are involved and react to public criticism. Second, it confirmed how powerful cultural objects can be and how the impact of online media report and cross-cultural communication can increase conflicts as well as making them more difficult to solve. Third, through the distinct majority of mentioned speakers being politicians, lawyers and journalists, an existing hierarchy was proven, deciding on who is given a voice and whose voice is worthy being heard. Although the three observed newspapers had in common to include mostly politicians as speakers in the discourse, the presentation was shaped in different ways by means of including certain utterances to emphasize and support different stands in the discourse. Finally, newspaper’s ideologies and target groups considerably influence the way of reporting about them leading to the conclusion that media actively shapes the way cultural conflicts are perceived.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Cultural conflict', 'Satire', 'Media Coverage', 'Discourse', 'Erdogan/Böhmermann']"
Beauty vloggers and their influence on consumer-buying intentions,C.E. ten Have,2017-10-09,"['M.N.M. Verboord', 'D.D. Dumitrica']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study offers an analysis of the influence of a beauty vlogger’s persona on the buying intent of consumers. Through an experimental survey design Dutch consumers are asked how they perceive the persona of two beauty vloggers, after they are presented with two shortened YouTube clips per vlogger. Then they are asked how likely they are to buy the product recommended or discussed by the beauty vlogger in the videos. The beauty vlogger persona has been conceptualized with the help of theories concerning source credibility, para-social interaction and the Big Five Personality model, and hypotheses were formulated accordingly. The results showed that the dimension of social attractiveness, which is concerned with how kind someone is perceived to be, has the largest influence on consumer buying intentions, and is therefore the most important aspect of a beauty vlogger’s persona in light of this study. The character traits extraversion and conscientiousness closely follow the dimension social attractiveness and are also found to be important influencers. They are mainly concerned with perceived enthusiasm and responsibility of the beauty vlogger. However, where social attractiveness and extraversion influence buying intent positively, conscientiousness leads to a decrease in buying intent. This suggest that the more responsible a beauty vlogger is perceived to be, the less consumers are intended to buy products discussed by this person. As a beauty vlogger that expresses this personality trait will negatively influence any brand, it is important to consider these effects as well. Additionally, the familiarity of the consumer with the product a beauty vlogger discusses prior to watching the video is found to be important across all analyses conducted. Finally, the findings show that even though scientific research organizations point towards 18 to 34 year-olds as the most frequent watchers of online vlogs, a large group of younger and a small group of older people are interested in beauty videos as well. This can again have important implications for brands in creating marketing strategies. The study is mainly limited in its size. However, this study brings innovation to the debate on social influencing by researching a particular type of social influencer that has not been the focus point of any study before, the beauty vlogger, and thereby adds to existing knowledge on the exact workings of interpersonal relations online in this particular context.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Social influencers', 'eWOM', 'Vloggers', 'Interpersonal influence', 'consumer-buying intent']"

Willekens']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The aim of this master’s thesis is to assess the influence of the cultural background of primary teachers on their teaching arts. Earlier research has not extensively covered the influence of the background of the teacher on teaching methods, content of the lessons, or decisions when it comes to arts and culture education. The question that guided this research was: what is the impact of the cultural background of current primary teachers in and around Rotterdam on their practice of, and attitude towards arts and culture education? Six in-depth interviews with primary teachers in Rotterdam and its surroundings were conducted in May and the beginning of June 2017. 	
	In the first part, the theoretical chapter starts with an explanation of how arts education in the Netherlands came into its current form. When looking into the cultural background, Bourdieu and his concepts of cultural capital and habitus are key. They serve an important role when it comes to explaining the influences of family and education and their result on current primary teachers. 	
	The results of this research show how the attitudes of others in both the family or during the teacher’s own education can turn out to be decisive for the attitude a primary teacher now has towards arts and culture. A role model, religion, and the situation at home determine not just the childhood of the primary teachers. All these factors have shaped the primary teacher, they influence the current decisions the primary teacher makes, and thus also the cultural background of the children they teach nowadays. The interviews indicated that parental regret of missing out on unpursued talents is one of the factors that result in the primary teacher as a child being exposed to arts and culture. However, not just the parents of the primary teacher as a child, but also the adult primary teacher who feels (s)he has missed out, wants to make sure the current generation gets all the opportunities they need. Primary teachers in the more deprived areas of Rotterdam told how there are more subsidies available for the schools to make sure they offer the children every opportunity to develop themselves fully. Not growing up with arts and culture can still result in interest at a later age, when children start making their own decisions, as this is something that happened both to the primary teachers when they were young, and the children they teach nowadays. Still, as is true for the primary teachers as a child and the children they teach, the sooner people are introduced to arts and culture, the more it opens them up for appreciation in a later stage of their lives. Primary teachers who have had a lot of cultural experience tend to use it in their classes and base their decisions on it. On the other hand, primary teachers who did not participate in culture when they were young, use more recent experience in arts and culture, and they want to make sure that the children they teach do get every opportunity to get in touch with arts and culture.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'arts and culture education', 'attitude', 'cultural background', 'experience', 'primary teachers']"
Negotiating national identity through media  consumption,L. Bota,2017-10-09,"['D.D. Dumitrica', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","When people from a certain nation decide to move in another one and accommodate with a new life, their national identity changes. In order to integrate in a new country they speak a different language, learn various customs, while still keeping in touch with their families, friends, and consuming media from homeland. All these actions performed in both countries are transforming diaspora’s national identity in a hybrid identity. 
DoR magazine is a media product written in the Romanian language, a tool of nation-building along the social institutions who construct the Romanian nation, thus worth of research. This study researched a specific diaspora that reads the independent magazine DoR. I wanted to find whether the magazine plays a role in their national identity negotiation, and if so what is that. 
The theoretical framework used nationalism’s definition of Anderson (1991) in which the nations are ‘imagined communities’. Furthermore, the research drawn on theories regarding media’s role in nation building, diaspora and transnationalism, as well as the history and myths composing Romania. By applying the qualitative method of discourse analysis over the in-depth interviews with 14 subscribers located all over the world, findings revealed the negotiation of national identity correlated with the consumption of DoR magazine. 
The findings split between an analysis on the national identity invoked by participants when sharing their personal story and future plans, and the national identity invoked in relation with their DoR subscription. The results of each category mirrored, showing an on-going shift between the civic and ethnic identity, and a hybrid identity this diaspora is dealing with between their homeland and the countries they live in. In conclusion, the print magazine of DoR plays a role in the negotiation of national identity for its diaspora subscribers. From the language used, subjects approached, and the community it builds, this magazine is a reference for the ethnic identity these diaspora members ache for. Moreover, the magazine also appeals to a civic identity this diaspora discovered in their countries of residence, building an image of Romania with which this diaspora identifies. 
The role of media in nation building, especially for diasporas, has been approached through various mediums, such as television or newspaper prints. However, the role of magazines in the hybrid identities diaspora members develop has not been under focus.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'diaspora', 'nationalism', 'transnationalism', 'media and nation-building', 'hybrid identities']"
The legitimation of street art in Amsterdam,G. Di Giacomo,2017-10-09,"['D. Stocco Ferreira', 'P.P.L. Berkers']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Street art is originally a rebellious, illegal and underground practice that emerged on the city walls. Even though this cultural manifestation appeared outside of the art world, it is frequently found in art institutions. Considering that what is placed in such settings is more acknowledged as art, street art is framed by artistic and cultural value when exhibited in art galleries and museums. In such a way, it is moving from the periphery towards a central position in the art world. Due to the anti-institutional discourse that was originally part of street art, there is a controversy regarding its presence in art institutions, since it can be considered a threat to its marginal character. 
Currently, the organization Street Art Today is building a museum dedicated exclusively to street art in the city of Amsterdam. Therefore, the present thesis focuses on this case, in order to explore how a formerly rebellious artistic expression can be acknowledged as an art form by the traditional art world, without losing its roots. Thus, the following research question was addressed: What is the role of Street Art Today museum in the legitimation of street art in Amsterdam? In order to provide an answer, ten semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with actors from the Amsterdam’s street art scene. Also, SAT’s website was analyzed as a complementary data. 
Altogether this data revealed that street art is losing its rebellious character, due to its commercialization and institutionalization. Moreover, it was possible to infer that SAT’s creation was also motivated by trading interests. However, the interviewees of this study don’t perceive these aspects as negative, considering that they enable an income to the artists and contribute to the recognition of street art as an art form in Amsterdam. Thus, the respondents are positive about the creation of SAT museum, since they claim that this institution is going to support the legitimation of street art in the city, while preserving some of the main aspects of this cultural manifestation: the engagement with the urban space and the accessibility of its images.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'art world', 'legitimation', 'artistic value', 'street art', 'museum']"
Black athlete activism in the United States,I. Blum,2017-10-09,"['I. Awad Cherit', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Scholars investigating black athlete activism and anti-racist protests seem to have unanimously identified two time periods: the so-called “golden age” of activism and an era of political apathy. The golden age of activism was characterised by vigorous outspokenness, with politically engaged athletes; however, these were treated as deviants and punished for their forthrightness. The golden age of athlete activism has ended, and the era that followed is characterised by political apathy and passiveness. Arguably, athletes have begun pursuing financial wealth rather than focusing on addressing prevailing social issues. New and scholarly un-investigated examples challenge the perception that political commitment of black athletes is a story from the past. The changing media landscape seems to be playing an important role in this. An objective for this thesis is to identify the particularities of today’s protests and, in doing so, try to understand some of the factors that may be behind the potential re-politicisation of black athletes; specifically, new media. It will do so by analysing a case study about NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who has initiated a national anthem protest against racial inequality in the United States. The following research question has been posed: How does Colin Kaepernick use the media for activism and what does this say about the opportunities for anti-racist protest among top athletes nowadays in the United States? To answer the research question, Kaepernick’s activism from August 2016 to June 2017 is used as a case study. Additionally, a simple quantitative content analysis and an in-depth qualitative content analysis are carried out on data from January 2017, which is retrieved from Kaepernick’s personal Twitter account. The simple quantitative content analysis is used to quantify and directly detect patterns in the data. The in-depth qualitative content analysis is applied to analyse the content and meaning of Kaepernick’s media activism. The coding frame for this part of the analysis is built on theories of mediatisation, gatekeeping, new racism and previous research among others. The results show that, on the field, Kaepernick’s protest resonates as a revival of athlete activism. The number of athletes who have joined him, or in other ways protest themselves, indicates that a need for anti-racist protests remains despite the challenging social environment of new racism. In his online activism, it is found that Kaepernick functions as a gatekeeper, where he gives voice to not only those who currently do not have a platform, but also those who did in the past, but are now for one reason or another silenced. He does so by frequently referencing and establishing links to black social movement leaders of the past. It is found that athlete activism carries features of being mediatised. Conclusively, the results show that a trend of political engagement is -once again- emerging in sports. However, it seems that political outspokenness in sport venues still comes with career-compromising consequences.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Black athlete activism', 'Racial inequality', 'Political engagement', 'New racism', 'Mediatisation', 'Gatekeeping', 'Twitter', 'Colin Kaepernick']"
Documenting YouTubers and Female Empowerment,J.C. Heuillard,2017-10-09,"['A.C. Uribe Sandoval', 'J.S. Lee']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Vloggers became exponentially popular within the last decade, due to their trustworthiness and their status of “celebrities chosen” by the population. The fitness industry has seen a shift brought on by the new exposure to these same vloggers; between rising popularity of sportswear, of fit expositions, of fitness vlogs and athletes, a new audience became visible. As a matter of fact, these new communicators became leaders of positive and empowering movements for many, embracing female liberating movements.
Few studies focus both on female empowering movements and the role of female fitness vloggers as communicators. Platforms such as Instagram and written blogs have been investigated thoroughly in relation to female empowerment and sports, in contrast to YouTube which has not been related to female liberating improvements. Therefore, it has been decided to research the influence of Female fitness vloggers on the empowerment and positive liberation of their female audience.
To do so, twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted in a time frame of 40 days, allowing an in-depth qualitative research. Convenience sampling was used to acquire the respondents. Indeed, reaching out to women adequate for the research was interesting due to their very low visibility; making it difficult to locate and contact potential respondents. No age limit was determined, even though all respondents were aged between 18 and 26 years old and were women.
Many theories such as empowerment, opinion leaders and influencers, uses of internet and online participation, uses and gratifications, online communities as well as ‘edutainment’ and ‘infotainment’ were used to guide the data analysis. Five main dimensions of fitness vloggers’ positive influence on their female audience have been uncovered by the research. Firstly, vloggers establish a community of support for their followers by being the front runner of a group. Secondly, vloggers increase awareness and recognition for fitness as a sport, by offering their viewers new knowledge about the topic and a more feminine perspective on it. This new awareness and knowledge induces a social change within the community of viewers which is significant for empowering movements. Finally, vloggers affect their viewers by prompting personal gratifications such as increased self-esteem and confidence for instance, of their audience. Each one of these findings demonstrate the positive power of influence female fitness vloggers hold on their female public, triggering female empowering growth.","['media', 'culture', 'society', 'Female empowerment', 'Fitness vloggers', 'YouTube', 'Social change', 'Femininity', 'Influencers']"

Cooking in daily life,S.R. Maton,2017-10-06,"['S.L. Reijnders', 'N. Komarova']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Cooking and eating is an important part of our life, and therefore gets a lot of our time and attention. Existing empirical research on food and eating culture shows that cooking is primarily a social activity, closely connected to memories. These memories can cause culinary nostalgia, the emotional longing for a dish from the past. By means of dishes as cultural artefacts and traditions, cooking bonds people and strengthens their collective identity. This collective identity can be specified into a personal cooking related identity, which can be used to distinguish oneself from others. In the process of cooking, the kitchen forms a liminal space where nature meets culture: ingredients are turned into dishes with symbolical meaning.
By taking an exploratory approach, this study analyses the liminality in the act of cooking, which is used as a means to relate to the world. This qualitative research focusses on contemporary cooking culture in Western society and attempts to give an insight into the twofold liminality in cooking: liminality in time and in place. The research question is: ‘To what extent and in what way do selecting and cooking dishes provide a way for people to relate to the world, within the context of daily life?’.
During 10 semi-structured, in-depth interviews, 12 Dutch and non-Dutch respondents, most living in and around Rotterdam, were asked about their habits and thoughts on cooking. The results are analysed and structured by means of thematic analysis, resulting in two main themes: cooking in relation to time and cooking in relation to place.
Because of the liminality in cooking, the interpretation of time and place becomes indefinite. Cooking aided respondents in structuring their time and helped them to make sense of the vague concept of time. Through time related associations, cooking structured the hours in the day, the days of the week, the seasons, and phases in one’s life. By using cooking as social time, especially in the weekends, cooking for others helps to create and sustain social relationships and encourages social bonding. Furthermore, it is used to discover and make sense of the world, by discovering other places and their related cultures through cooking adventures. It helped respondents to get a sense of place and define their own place in this world. They related to the world in the way they valued awareness of the origin of their food and the sustainability of their cooking habits. Another way in which the respondents related to the world was by adjusting their cooking habits to the place they were in, it determined and limited one’s cooking options.
In contrast to most existing anthropological research on cooking, this research focussed on food and cooking culture in Western society and concentrated on present-day, contemporary daily cooking. It has explored the field of liminality in cooking and distinguished the themes of time and place in the process of relating to the world by means of cooking.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'cooking', 'domestic cooking', 'cultural identity', 'personal identity', 'liminality']"

The victims, who suffered the most, were performing arts organizations and this research aims to explore how some of them managed to survive. The two case studies include a youth theatre in Amsterdam and a regional opera house, which lost more than half of their subsidies. 
I conduct qualitative content analysis of the annual reports of both organizations in a period of 2011-2015 to trace the internal changes in organization, which happened after the cuts. The interviews with the directors serve as an additional source of data. Findings illustrate that both organizations mobilised all available resources to keep their doors open. Unfortunately, it included losses not only of the financial, but also artistic and human resources. Many cultural professionals became jobless, while the remained staff followed reorganization and pay cuts. However, both opera and youth theatre became incredibly active and entrepreneurial in search of a new funding sources, employing new marketing strategies and reaching new audiences, which in a long run may establish additional financial sources.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Subsidy cuts', 'performing arts organizations', 'artistic resources', 'entrepreneurship']"
In the light of uncertainty,M. Januseviciute,2017-10-06,"['S.L. Bolderman', 'P.P.L. Berkers']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Music therapy is a treatment that uses the combination of music, science, and communication to achieve therapeutic goals. Because it is a relatively new discipline most research conducted on music therapy addresses the complexity of the new field and its relation to medical and art fields. In the prevailing scientific society, the field is challenged by the notions of legitimisation within the frame of other medical fields. Hence, the history and the current state of the music therapy field influence the professional identity construction of music therapists. This research aims to look into the relationship between the present state of the music therapy field in Lithuania and the Netherlands and overview professional identity development in educational institutions. Hence, the main research question is as follows: To what extent does the current state of music therapy field influence the development of a music therapists’ professional identity? In order to answer the research question a method of constructivist grounded theory was used.  In addition, a hybrid utilisation of constructivist GT together with Bourdieu’s field theory as a theoretical framework was adopted to answer the research question. The data was collected through nine semi-structured in-depth interviews, five days of participant observation and document analysis. Initial and focused coding of data with additional information from research memos was used to conceptualise findings into the theoretical themes of studied phenomena. The study showed that professional identity development is influenced by context specific medical paradigm that music therapy follows. The upcoming therapists in both countries reflected on external pressures on the field. The main struggles of the field were identified as political and economic changes, scientification and clinification of the field(s), and split inside the therapist community. Hence, based on the external pressures, field(s) seek(s) to identify themselves with more established medical fields to gain a better public image, influence policies in relation to job opportunities, and feel equal to members in the healthcare system. Consequently, the professional identity development is affected by a focus on science-based research and the scientification of the field.  It implies that the primary purpose shifts from the ground values and purpose of the profession to the process of legitimisation.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Music therapy', 'Bourdieu’s field theory', 'Constructivist grounded theory', 'Legitimisation', 'Professional identity']"
This image does (not) make me feel climate change is important,U. Hahn,2017-10-06,"['P.P.L. Berkers', 'D. Stocco Ferreira']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Climate change is one of the most communicated topics of our time. Its communication is characterized by complexity, credibility issues, and information overload (Hagen, Middel, & Pijawka, 2015; Moser, 2009). In the Netherlands, many people are aware of the issue. It hence becomes essential to render it an important topic to consider, i.e. to create feelings of salience (Lorenzoni, Nicholson-Cole, & Whitmarsh, 2007). Communicators use different visualizations to achieve this, among them information visualizations (Johansson, Schmid-Neset, & Linnér, 2010). However, it is unclear how effective the artistic modifications of information visualizations, so-called artistic information visualizations (AIVs), are. This Master thesis therefore poses the following main research question: How engaging in terms of feelings of salience do viewers perceive AIVs on climate change, and what reasoning for felt salience can be identified? Three-part qualitative research consisting of a short survey, sorting task and semi-structured interview was employed (O’Neill, Boykoff, Niemeyer, & Day, 2013). Participants were asked to sort 25 visualizations: the AIVs and four other visualization forms, each form depicting the same five problem-focused climate change themes. The AIVs were found least engaging in comparison to the other four visualization types, i.e. they least made viewers feel climate change is important. In contrast, photos were found to be the most engaging, followed by artistic simulations, cartoons and information visualizations. Different possible explanations for this little engagement with AIVs could be identified. First, participants indeed made numerous references to the visual types’ capabilities concerning their cognitive and emotional engagement (sub-RQ1): clarity, immediacy, and emotional impact. These could largely be found in photos, and artistic simulations. Second, the audience’s educational background played a role in the decoding (sub-RQ2). Participants with art (science) education engaged more with AIVs (information visualizations) than participants without this education. It appears that – at least for this sample – the concepts of AIVs surrounding their free choice of data focus and artistic freedom (Kosara, 2007) need to be revised for a complex topic such as climate change. A need for clarity, at least when targeted at the general public might be necessary. This finding supports an art novice – art expert difference for the interest in, and understanding of complex artworks such as AIVs (Bourdieu, 1979; Silvia, 2005). Therefore in this research, both visual properties and audience background played important roles in the decoding, supporting recent research in the field of information visualizations (Kennedy, Hill, Allen, & Kirk, 2016). Third, art’s involvement in climate change (sub-RQ3) was generally not opposed to. This shows how scholars could be less concerned about art’s participation in the climate change debate, and more about how artists could be involved. While AIVs had clarity issues, apocalyptic artistic simulations suffered from credibility problems because of their drastic content. Cartoons elicited morality deliberations concerning the use of humour for such a serious topic. Further, more generalizable research is needed to support the present research findings.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Communication model', 'Climate change visualizations', '(Artistic) information visualizations', 'Engagement in terms of feelings of salience', 'Audience research']"
Political Correctness in Art Perception,L. Kraus,2017-10-06,"['M.J. Berghman', 'N. Komarova']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis explores the influence that the political attitude of an artist has on the perception of his paintings in a Western context. Using data gathered through an experiment, I apply a multilevel analysis to demonstrate that a right-wing attitude can have a negative influence on the perception of visual artworks. More precisely, discriminatory attitudes have a negative effect on the appreciation of paintings. Simultaneously, left-wing attitudes have no impact on the perception process, which suggests that left-wing attitudes are perceived as a default attitude for artists. It was further found that the degree and way of influence the attitude has on the viewer remains primarily a matter of cultural capital endowment. Whereas lower cultural capital respondents tend to behave in a politically correct manner, individuals with higher cultural capital draw from a greater pool of artistic background knowledge and are able to use the political attitude of an artist as a tool to enhance their cultural experience. Countering a strong body of opinion believing high cultural capital individuals to explicitly reject intolerant content as a way of symbolic exclusion, no significant outcomes can be detected in that regard. In fact, high cultural capital individuals demonstrate an increased interest in paintings made by artists with intolerant views. Different findings apply to artworks made by renowned artists. Political attitudes of canonised artists have no influence on the perception of their paintings which suggests that the socially constructed status of a creative genius prompts individuals to disregard their political attitudes. Finally, as cognitive dissonance theory suggests, artworks made by artists with the same political attitude as the respondents’ are preferred to paintings created by artists with different political inclinations than the respondents’. This behaviour is, however, confined to individuals with lower cultural capital since high cultural capital people do not specifically favour paintings made by an artist with left-wing inclinations.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'Art perception', 'context', 'cultural capital', 'political attitude', 'political correctness']"
Affective cartography,A.P. Figueiredo Teixeira Alvares,2017-10-06,"['S.L. Reijnders', 'S.L. Bolderman']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This study is an exploratory journey towards the concept designated affective cartography. Grounded on the assumption that people’s imagination is filled with meaningful places, the research proposed to go one step further and investigate if these places are somehow organized as to form an imaginary geography, and whether this imaginary geography could be represented in a map. 
Promoting an ongoing conversation between the world of the imagination and the real world that surround us, this study begins with an objective identification of the places that inhabit the mind and follows into the actual production of an emotional map. By intertwining these two worlds the expectation is to understand a little better how and in what ways the interaction between individuals and places develop. And by giving tangibility to a subjective matter the hope is to go deeper into the human capability to explore and produce space. 
Maps were the instrument chosen to mediate this conversation. As an important human artifact, maps are able to promote knowledge but also to reproduce or reinforce historical or subjective bias. Here they will be used as a useful, despite subjective, device, responsible for translating the individual topography of the mind into a symbolic tangible object, embedded both socially and culturally. 
Assuming that the map-making ability is universally given, just like imagination itself, this study worked with relative freedom in regards to the sample. Hence a qualitative research was conducted with Rotterdam (NL) residents during the month of April 2017. 
The results demonstrate that the concept is a valid one and one with many possibilities for further development. The results contribute to the already existent production regarding the human relationship with places and spaces, by identifying patterns and categorizing the places that are somehow related to affection. In addition the investigation process has verified that maps are a fascinating artifact with many possibilities for scientific production, however with modest attention from the contemporary sociological viewpoint. The implications have shown that, despite not being so frequent in people’s everyday lives, an affective cartography is possible and it can be a very fruitful route to human imagination.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'affective cartography', 'human geography', 'topophilia', 'everyday life', 'mapmaking']"
Escape at the Museum,K.A. Markeviciute,2017-10-06,"['D. Stocco Ferreira', 'M.J. Berghman']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","For a few decades now, there has been a significant increase of immersive installation art at art museums. Immersive installations differ from traditional art exhibitions as they are site-specific, resemble theatrical mise-en-scène and provide a hyper-realistic, sensory experience to visitors by requiring to physically enter the space a work occupies. Currently, the attention to this art has been growing together with the critique. On the one hand, experiential, entertaining immersive art draws crowds of people to museums and offers extraordinary art experiences. Thus, this art has become an important field of action of museums since they strive to attract larger audiences. On the other hand, these installations are criticised for resembling entertainment venues and negatively influencing the audience’s relation with art and encouraging passive consumption of “retinal art”. This qualitative study is aimed at researching the immersive installation experience at the museum and questions, how does the immersive art experience differ from that of the usual? By means of ethnographic research (participant observations, semi-structured interviews) comparison of visitors’ experiences and behaviour at two art settings, one traditional and one immersive type, have been presented. Both exhibitions chosen for the research: “Mad About Surrealism” and installation “Infinity Mirror Room” by Yayoi Kusama were situated at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, in Rotterdam. Visitors analysis revealed noteworthy differences between these shows. It was found out that people at the traditional exhibit mostly engaged with the artistic content at the cognitive level, they were also significantly calm, physically passive, did not have many social interactions, yet were significantly sensitive to the social environment around them. Whereas at the installation, visitors engaged intellectually at a lesser extent, were highly social but less sensitive to the social climate, appeared more active yet less than it was expected. Finally, there was different emotional engagement level between two shows, if, at the Surrealism exhibition, people were emotionally distanced from artworks, at the installation, the relationship with art was more personal and influenced introspective, embodied experiences. This proves that the immersive art changes the established museum experience and, moreover, suggests that other approaches, for instance, more attention to emotional, experiential, social dimensions instead of cognitive perception could help to comprehend this phenomenon better.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'museum experience', 'immersive installation art', 'aesthetic perception', 'museum visitors']"
‘Any Irish MCs out there?’,F. Vandenberg,2017-10-06,"['J.C.F. Schaap', 'P.P.L. Berkers']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","For the white working class male, recent developments in Western society have caused a surge in notions of wounded masculinity and the fragile state of whiteness. Advancements in technology, the widespread causes of globalisation and the acceleration of deindustrialization have left the white working class male in a state of crisis. Unemployment among the white working class male is at an all-time high, and with a political system that fails to acknowledge them, it is the identity of this group that is being precluded. Challenges to the traditional perception of masculinity, whiteness and working class culture are resulting in the loss of identity of the white, working-class male.
Broad consensus exists within sociology that culture is a key element of the construction of identity. Music is a crucial element in developing friendships and common bonds and can provide a sense of subjective and collective identity for youths. Through the formation of subcultures, youths can use music to create bonds and collectively come to terms with their social circumstances.  
The aim of this thesis is to uncover the relationship between the formation of postmodern subcultures and the loss of identity of the white working class male. By examining the case of the Irish MCs, an online rap scene, its purpose is to determine how the subculture is used to create a sense of community and maintain notions of masculinity and ethnicity. In doing this its hope is to obtain a better understanding of these youths, the working class position today, and the role that culture plays in identity formation.
Through the use of quantitative and qualitative content analysis of YouTube comments (n=2230), this thesis will analyse the boundary formation of this group. It will examine who and what these youths positively and negatively mark and what they leave unmarked. It will look into what auxiliary characteristics are required to be an ‘in’ member, and interpret the aspects of the subcultural capital needed. In researching the boundary work of the scene, it aims to get a deeper understanding of the collective identity of this group, in doing so exposing the relationship between the subculture and the class position of its members.
From the research, it emerges that there is a strong correlation between the formation of the scene and the present state of the white working class male. It demonstrates that in contrast to the members of traditional subcultures – who celebrated the working class condition and rebelled against ‘selling-out’ and popular culture – members of this group applaud commercialisation and discard working class values. Through the MCs positive marking of the commercial music industry and the negative marking of the working class condition, the analysis reveals that these youths express a longing to escape their working class position.","['kunstwetenschappen', 'cultuurwetenschappen', 'class', 'masculinity', 'whiteness', 'boundary work', 'Irish rap', 'YouTube']"
How can visual artists effectively use their online presence for self-marketing?,E.D Meinhardt,2017-10-06,"['S. Jacobs', 'P.V. Bhansing']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This qualitative research discusses artists’ use of their online presence for self-marketing. Marketing in
the arts has developed from an application of classical marketing theory to a separate discipline. In the
context of arts marketing, specific focus can be set on the entrepreneurial artist who is typically combining
his creative profession with managerial tasks such as self-marketing. These entrepreneurial artists are
expected to demonstrate high levels of professionalism and face various challenges related to an
increasing market orientation. As online channels are gaining more and more importance in all parts of
today’s arts market, the aim of this research is the discovery of their importance for the individual artists’
marketing practice and the formulation of practical implications. This can be summarized in the overall
research question How can visual artists effectively use their online presence for self-marketing? In order
to answer the research question, data has been collected in 17 interviews with visual artists as well as
several intermediaries and analyzed in a qualitative manner. The results show an overall professional
approach towards self-marketing, including the commercialism often connected to it in the arts. The use
of online channels such as personal website, social media and third-party publications is used as a costeffective
tool for promotion or even sales in most artists’ marketing activities. Nevertheless, also this type
of marketing requires specific skills and especially time, which can be difficult to combine with the creative
work. Despite the awareness that self-marketing is a necessity of the profession and even expected to
some extent, the findings show how much the enthusiasm towards and investment into (online) selfmarketing
can differ between individual artists. As possible explanations for those different approaches,
goals and personality are discussed. Concluding, not one winning formula for the most effective use of an
artist’s online presence for their marketing can be given. Rather, it should be determined individually
based on several factors such as the personal marketing orientation, the type of art, goals and personality.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Artists', 'entrepreneur', 'self-marketing', 'arts marketing', 'online presence']"
Audience development for classical music performances in The Netherlands,M.C.M. Vercammen,2017-10-02,"['S. Jacobs', 'P. Bhansing']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Audiences for classical music are ageing. Attracting younger audiences could
be helpful for classical music institutions in order to create a sustainable future. The
current study aimed to develop a deeper insight into the motivations of young people
(18-44 years old) in The Netherlands who don’t attend classical music concerts and
those who do attend (the demand side), and we examined what could be the role of
Dutch subsidized symphonic orchestras in this (the supply side). We examined the
motivations of the demand side with a questionnaire, and collected data on the age of
audiences at Dutch subsidized orchestras. Furthermore, we interviewed the marketers
of all Dutch subsidized classical symphonic orchestras, and conducted 4 additional
interviews with parties who are successful at reaching younger audiences for classical
music. Results show that concepts targeted at younger audiences specifically are
successful at reaching younger audiences, as these concepts respond to uncertainty
factors that would otherwise prevent new audiences from going to classical concerts:
they fear that the concert will take too long and that they don’t have enough
knowledge. Concerts with an informal presentation or at an informal location also
reach more young audiences than traditional concerts, at which 80% of the audience
is over 44 years old. When trying to reach younger audiences, lower pricing and peerbased
marketing are amongst the effective strategies. Younger audiences who attend
classical concerts do so because of the music itself and social factors, and they have a
slight preference for intellectually challenging music and innovative executions
compared to those who do not attend. Self-reported visits to non-classical live
concerts where similar for those who attend classical music and those who don’t.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepeneurship', 'audience development', 'classical music', 'performing arts', 'concert', 'attendance', 'non-attenders', 'young audiences']"

Although extensive literature research has focused on what attracts these creative individuals to places, these studies focus primarily on creative cities. However, practice shows us that creative individuals do not only move to creative cities and places that are considered attractive. They also locate in less attractive and creative cities, such as the Dutch New Town Almere. Although Almere is generally regarded as an unattractive city with a negative reputation, there appear to be creative individuals that seem attracted to the city by something. This is an important observation that needs to be further explored, as attracting creative individuals could benefit Almere’s cultural and economic position. This study examines the unique value of Almere for creative individuals. It begins by showing the theoretical concepts that discuss what attracts creative individuals to certain locations. Next, these concepts are tested for the case of Almere, through qualitative empirical research into the location perception and evaluation of creative individuals working in Almere. The study shows that the attractiveness of cities for creative individuals cannot easily be explained by external location factors, as expected from earlier studies, but is rather dependent on internal factors and transcendental values.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepeneurship', 'Creative Cities', 'New Towns', 'Creative Individuals', 'Almere', 'Urban Growth', 'City', 'Attractiveness', 'City Marketing', 'Creative Class', 'Creative Clustering', 'Cultural Entrepreneurs', 'Artists']"

Results showed that the optimum price level for premium streaming services is around

This research presents in-depth insights by valorizing perceptions of firm performance of 14 CEOs of creative enterprises with two objectives: Firstly, it generates insides of the needs for creative firms towards internationalization and can help to optimize instruments from a policy perspective. Secondly, this research will give practical process insights and can potentially motivate creative enterprises that have the aim to expand internationally but do not have the know-how.

What is the role of institutional logics in the creation and success in the arts in Hong Kong?,K.N. Chan,2017-10-02,"['S. Jacobs', 'A. Klamer']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis attempts to explore the institutional logics in the Hong Kong art world and the way that the identified institutional logics relate to the success of the Hong Kong artist. The existing literature seldom explores the Hong Kong contemporary art world and the concept of institutional logics is never analyzed in this context. The concept of institutional logics is to explain the behavior that the Hong Kong artist follows during their creation process, which is the first step of the research. The value-based approach is also covered in this study as I find out that some of the elements are similar to the institutional logics. The second step of this research is to explore how the artist defines success and analyze the relation between the identified logics and their defined success. The institutional logics vary from industries so this thesis is to explore what logics exist in the Hong Kong art world. A method to identify the institutional logics in the Hong Kong art world is through semi-structured in-depth interviews. 13 artists have been interviewed and they have talked about their creation ideas, how the artistic, sociological and market perspectives influence their creation ideas. The way of the existence of the Hong Kong art world was discussed, as well as their opinion on being a successful artist. The research result is that the three logics are identified in the Hong Kong art world. They are the artistic logic, the social logic and the market logic. It does not mean that each of the interviewed artist follows one logic exclusively. Instead, the phenomenon of following two or all the logics are discovered and the situation of the combined logics also exists. The artistic logic is contradictory with the market logic in nature but in the Hong Kong art world, actors like the art manager or the gallery owner tolerate the existence of the two logics at the same time. The artistic and the social logics are also co-existed. About the findings on success, the definition of success is discussed in two aspects, and they are internal success and external success. The internal success goes beyond our conventional way of understanding success because it focuses on the development of the artistic career of the artist themselves and their career in a life-long process rather than being recognized and the commercial success. The research result also shows that following the artistic logic is highly relevant to the internal success. This thesis also discovers that the Hong Kong artist is more favourable to the internal success rather than the external success, which is being recognized and recorded in the history of the arts. This thesis explains that the Hong Kong artists follows mainly the artistic logic and the importance of the market logic is the least.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'the contemporary art world', 'Hong Kong visual artist', 'value', 'success']"
How qualitative research and quantitative research are jointly designed to analyze the web-based contents,J. Jeong,2017-10-02,"['C.W. Handke', 'S. Jacobs']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The Internet is a powerful tool to build marketplaces. The Internet platforms play a role to help buyers and sellers to find each other. One of the Peer-to-Peer web platforms, Etsy, is the largest online marketplace for craft and vintages items. The Etsy platform is a community driven marketplace where all the members of Etsy share a buying, selling and manufacturing. To study the propensity of Etsy members, Etsy Discussion forum was investigated. The aim of this study is to design a combined qualitative and quantitative research method to analyze the web-based contents. Using the combined methods, 200 random samples from Etsy Discussion forum were analyzed under qualitative content analysis and statistical tests. The empirical research part of this study emphasized on qualitative content analysis in order to assume the propensity of users in Etsy Discussion forum.

Spatial Characteristics of internationally competitive cities,"Araripe Rand, L. (Larissa)",2017-10-02,"['Wall R. (Ronald)', 'Kaur R. (Rupinder)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Due to globalization, traditional factors of competitive advantage (e.g. markets, natural resources, and labour) have become highly mobile, thereby permanently transforming the way in which cities and businesses compete for economic development. In this context, innovation became the leading driver of economic development in advanced economies. Because innovation requires continuous and efficient interfacing, businesses in knowledge-intensive industries tend to seek physical proximity to external factors (e.g. complimentary and supporting businesses, markets demands, and highly-skilled workers). Businesses also cluster together to take advantage of factors that are available only in economies of scale (e.g. well-developed infrastructure). As epicentres of agglomeration, cities are uniquely positioned to provide the set of urban amenities necessary for innovation and business growth in a global economy. However, cities are very diverse, as are the amenities that they provide. Consequently, some cities outperform others in attracting innovation-driven, knowledge-intensive industries. This heightens competitiveness between cities as they strive to increase their social and economic development.
While many studies have investigated the impact of urban socio-economic characteristics on competitiveness, there is a knowledge gap in the specific study of urban spatial characteristics and their impact on the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment. To help fill the gap, this study was conducted to identify the most relevant urban spatial characteristics to the clustering of Multinational Corporations in mid-sized north-western European cities. The aim was to provide an understanding of which urban spatial characteristics should be prioritized for economic growth in order to guide local and regional policies as well as urban design.
A unique methodology was developed to generate proximity data from geographically mapped spatial characteristics in 11 cities, which were then analysed through multiple negative binominal regressions. Findings confirmed that proximity to architectural aesthetics, train stations, well-connected streets, and local service firms all increase FDI clustering. In contrast, proximity to road interchanges, parks, and local hi-tech firms were found to decrease FDI clustering. In the interest of investigating the effect of proximity at the regional level, additional analysis was conducted using proximity data from twin cities. Results confirmed nearness affinity between FDI clusters in a city and architectural landmarks, local firms, and road interchanges in a neighbouring city. This study culminates on a set of recommendation to the city of Rotterdam aimed at improving international attractiveness and competitiveness through urban spatial design.","['Globalization', 'Competitiveness', 'Innovation', 'Knowledge-Intensive', 'FDI', 'MNC Clusters', 'Urban Spatial Amenities', 'Architecture', 'Infrastructure', 'Local Firms', 'Street Connectivity', 'Borrowed Proximity', 'Economic Development', 'Economic Geography', 'Urban Design']"
"The influence of institutions in recycling markets, the case of Prishtina – Kosovo","Garcia Buitrago, C.P. (Cindy Paola)",2017-10-01,['Skinner J.M. (Julia)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The current thesis analyses the recycling activities in Prishtina, Kosovo. Punctually it focuses in the relation between the institutions and the recycling market of paper and plastic. The objective was to identify how the laws and policies (considered as institutions) influence the market, whether or not there are incentives or disincentives towards the companies and to the different stakeholders that participate in the recycling value chain of the city.
In order to conduct the research, the author chose the case study as a research strategy. It allowed the researcher to understand the particular characteristics of the context that had an impact on the variables of study. Likewise, the selected data collection methods were intended to mix primary and secondary data, the methods were the semi-structure interviews and the content analysis. In this sense, the researcher could add validity and reliability to the research by cross-checking information, and by triangulating documents with the responses from the different stakeholders of the recycling market in Prishtina.
The study found that Prishtina and Kosovo have some of the institutions (laws and policies) recommended by the literature in order to boost recycling, however, there is a mismatch in the implementation. As it will be described, some of the reasons behind this finding are related to the contextual particularities of the country, such as the decentralization progress, and the lakc of law enforcement. Similarly, the findings also concluded about the conditions of the market, the presence of market failures and the undeveloped value chain, which derives from the existent of incentives and disincentives for the private sector. Finally, the study also concludes about the positive and negative influence of the laws and policies towards the market, as it was analysed, few of them have facilitated the emergence of a market, while the majority of the institutions are constraining it.
Finally, the author offers a set of recommendations that could be implemented to increase the recycling rate in the city. They are in relation to the cooperation with the private sector, not only to start new actions but also to provide the right incentives. They also relate to information, from the gathering of data for decision making, to the availability and accessibility of it for future investors.","['Waste management', 'recycling markets', 'institutional analysis', 'Prishtina', 'Integrated Sustainable Waste Management Framework']"

Een onderzoek naar de aantrekkelijkheid van mediabedrijven in Hilversum voor 
IT-professionals",M. Botz,2017-09-30,['E. Hitters'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In de afgelopen jaren is er een groot tekort aan IT-professionals ontstaan. Dit tekort is sector breed, waardoor veel verschillende bedrijven kampen met een lage toestroom aan IT-personeel. Mediabedrijven in Hilversum merken dit tekort ook, maar weten niet goed hoe ze hierop in moeten spelen. Uit eerder onderzoek naar motivaties van werknemers is geen duidelijk antwoord gekomen waarom werknemers voor bepaalde bedrijven kiezen. Vanuit Hilversum Media Campus is daarom de vraag gesteld of er onderzoek gedaan kon worden naar de motivaties van IT-professionals op het gebied van de media-industrie en mediabedrijven in Hilversum. Door middel van de onderzoeksvraag: ‘Hoe definiëren IT-professionals de aantrekkelijkheid van mediabedrijven in Hilversum?’ is getracht hier meer inzicht in te vergaren. 
	Door middel van elf kwalitatieve, retrospectieve interviews met respondenten werkzaam bij verschillende, al dan niet faciliterende, mediabedrijven in Hilversum is er inzicht verkregen in de definitie die deze werknemers geven aan de aantrekkelijkheid van de mediabedrijven in Hilversum waar ze werkzaam zijn. Uit de analyse is naar voren gekomen dat het beeld wat IT-professionals hebben van mediabedrijven voordat ze hiermee kennis maken aanzienlijk verschilt van het beeld wat wordt gecreëerd nadat de IT-professionals bij mediabedrijven zijn gaan werken. Perceptie en praktijk sluiten dus niet goed op elkaar aan. De opleiding van werknemers is de grootste boosdoener, omdat het curriculum niet volstaat om als net afgestudeerde een baan in de media-industrie te vinden. Door middel van extra curriculaire activiteiten zorgen IT-professionals ervoor de juiste skillset te bemachtigen om in de industrie te kunnen werken. Mediabedrijven kunnen grote stappen zetten om de kloof tussen opleiding en werkveld te verkleinen, door actief betrokken te raken bij de vorming van het curriculum en relevante projecten aan te leveren. 
	Mediabedrijven stellen daarnaast steeds hogere eisen aan nieuwe werknemers, waardoor er weinig respons is op openstaande vacatures. De focus van mediabedrijven moet daarom minder liggen op het kunnen van de werknemer op IT-gebied en meer op de affiniteit die de werknemer met IT heeft. Het vervolgens in house opleiden van deze werknemers zorgt voor een betere match met de te bekleden functie in het bedrijf en kan het gat dichten wat tussen opleiding en werkveld aanwezig is.","['media', 'cultuur', 'IT-professionals', 'media-industrie', 'mediacluster', 'werk(on)tevredenheid', 'locatie', 'creatieve klasse', 'werkmotivaties']"
A Case Study of cultural entrepreneurs based in Barcelona,I. Salvador Ros,2017-09-29,"['P.V. Bhansing', 'C. Handke']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","This thesis aimed to study the motivations of cultural entrepreneurs based in Barcelona. In order to
explore this, cultural entrepreneurs were first classified into opportunity and necessity
entrepreneurs according to their start-up motivation. The next step was to analyse how certain
intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced differently opportunity and necessity entrepreneurial
intentions. The analyzed factors included passion, income, independence, risk of failure, skills and
the environmental conditions in Barcelona. A mixed research based in quantitative surveys and
qualitative interviews was conducted.
This investigation has provided several insights: firstly, a new perspective to study cultural
entrepreneurs needs to be implemented in replace to the opportunity-necessity classification which
does not work with cultural entrepreneurs. Secondly, intrinsic and extrinsic factors have not been
proved to influence strongly different opportunity and necessity entrepreneurs. They do exist slight
differences but in general, it has been tested that any factor has the power to hinder their
entrepreneurial intentions in a significantly high degree whereas some sources of intrinsic
motivation like passion play a very positive role in their intentions. This is in coherence with the
first conclusion, which proves the need for a new perspective with its focus on the cultural
entrepreneur’s start-up motivation, depending on if they are purely intrinsic or extrinsic or their
level of passion. This classification will provide a better understanding of the cultural
entrepreneur’s motivations and intentions.
Finally, the investigation has also provided clues about the negative environmental conditions in
Barcelona towards cultural entrepreneurship, which is incoherent with the creative and cultural
nature of the city. Further solutions need to be implemented in order to improve the cultural
entrepreneur’s situation in Barcelona and therefore, positively their intentions","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'cultural entrepreneurs', 'entrepreneurial intentions', 'motivation by opportunity', 'motivation by necessity', 'cultural entrepreneurship in Barcelona.']"

Specifically, the primary art market is usually avoided in research, related to issues such as uncertainty and non-transparency. Platforms such as Artfacts.Net and Google Trends offer research opportunities that can be applied for contemporary research. For this master thesis, the impact of 208 exhibitions on online attention in the Netherlands has been explored. Within the framework of the quasi-experimental design the time-series analyses have been used to define both popularity and proximity impacts on online attention before and after the exhibition. While the results show a significant impact of popularity on online attention, the trend has rather a short-term impact. The proximity of an exhibition has been explored for the province of the Dutch capital; North Holland in comparison to the other provinces in the Netherlands. Although this analysis shows a relation of the online attention to the proximity, due to a small sample size it is deemed non-significant. In other words, scaled online attention is on average higher in closer proximity to North Holland, but the results should further be confirmed by a larger sample of observations.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'primary art market', 'online attention', 'Google Trends', 'Artfacts.Net', 'proximity', 'time-series analysis']"
Hyperlokale Waarden,C.C. van de Velde,2017-09-29,"['B.C.M. Kester', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het doel van dit onderzoek was om de democratische meerwaarde te achterhalen van hyperlokale journalistieke producties in Rotterdam. Er is gekeken naar de manier waarop hyperlocals nieuws rapporteren en in hoeverre zij daarmee een aanvulling zijn op het lokale medialandschap. Door het hanteren van een gemengde onderzoeksmethode konden hyperlocals ten opzichte van de professionele lokale journalistiek worden vergeleken. Daarnaast biedt het onderzoek een bijdrage aan het in kaart brengen van de nieuwsecologie van Rotterdam voor het Stimuleringsfonds voor de Journalistiek (SVDJ).
 	Het theoretisch kader biedt meer inzicht in de rolpercepties van de journalistiek en diens verhouding en verplichtingen naar de democratische samenleving. Daarnaast is een beeld van democratische meerwaarde gevormd met bijbehorende verwachtingen met betrekking tot de hyperlocals. Door uitvoering van een gemengde methode is op kwantitatieve wijze naar de diverse onderwerpen en journalistieke rollen gekeken die hyperlocals rapporteren. Op kwalitatieve wijze zijn de journalistieke rollen verder uitgewerkt met de roloperationalisering van Mellado (2015) als leidraad. Het onderzoek heeft gekeken in hoeverre hyperlocals deze traditionele journalistieke rollen al dan niet uitvoeren en in hoeverre zij er hun eigen unieke uitvoering op nahouden.
	Uit de resultaten bleek dat de hyperlocals en lokale omroepen niet veel van elkaar verschilden qua onderwerpselectie. Bij beiden was binnen de afgebakende periode een gebrek aan Wetenschap en Onderwijs gerelateerde artikelen. Verder waren de meest frequente onderwerpen, waaronder bijvoorbeeld Uitgaan & Vrije tijd, vrijwel identiek. Wat betreft journalistieke rollen was de verdeling van frequenties ook vrijwel gelijk. Bij hyperlocals was echter sprake van volledige afwezigheid van de waakhondsfunctie (Watchdog) en een hogere mate van interventie (Intervention) ten opzichte van de lokale omroepen.
	Veel van de traditionele journalistieke dimensies uit het model van Mellado (2015) waren terug te vinden in de hyperlokale artikelen. Verder zijn aan de hand van de kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse drie nieuwe thema’s opgesteld – Thuishoren, Inbedding, en Trots – die meer inzicht bieden in de hyperlokale functies. Al in al leek de meerwaarde van hyperlocals vrij bescheiden, maar dat wil niet zeggen dat zij niet meetelt. Hyperlocals laten een positief beeld zien van de lokale gemeenschap en versterken sociale cohesie. Met enige sepsis met betrekking tot financiële motieven kan gezegd worden dat de democratische meerwaarde, ook al gering, wel degelijk aanwezig is.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'hyperlocal', 'journalistiek', 'democratie', 'nieuwswaarden', 'rollen']"

Navarrete Hernandez']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The aim of this research is to find out to what extend private support can compensate for the budget cuts in government support for Dutch museums. This is done by looking at the crowding effects between different funding sources. The question answered in this research is: How does the amount of government funding relate to corporate and private support for Dutch museums?
The empirical work is based on information from financial statements from the 405 members of the Museum Association. To find the relation between different funding sources, a regression analysis was performed using a sample of 78 museums. The results show no significant crowding in or out effects between government support and private support for museums. However, crowding effects are found between different sorts of government support and between different sorts of private support. These findings have a major impact on cultural policy. It shows that it is unrealistic to assume that private support will compensate for the cuts in public funding for the arts.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Dutch museums', 'crowding effects', 'public funding', 'private contributions', 'corporate support']"
IT’S GALLERY TIME!,"Thürer, T",2017-09-29,['Vecco M'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Although the image of the gallerists as the ‘lone wolf’ has been altered by
more prominent collaborative manifestations ever since the turn of the century,
collaboration among contemporary art galleries remains an opaque field.
This thesis seeks to take a first step into the realms of collaboration among
contemporary art galleries exploring the phenomena of gallery weekends.
Gallery weekends have united the highest numbers of galleries joining forces
and thus attracted major attention in the art world over the last years. Approaching
this form of interorganisational collaboration as cooperative projectbased
alliances among organisations within local proximity, the aim is to identify,
compare and contrast underlying significant motivations and structural
processes.
Following an explorative approach, this comparative multiple-case study employs
semi-structured interviews and content analysis as qualitative research
methods. Set in the context of Germany, the three gallery weekends OPEN
Art in Munich, Gallery Weekend Berlin in Berlin, and DC Open in Cologne and
Düsseldorf are investigated. Employing a qualitative research design, data
was collected through semi-structured interviews and verified by consulting
secondary sources.
Key findings reveal that a unified mask ‘gallery weekend’ does not and cannot
exist due to their specific local and organisational context and relational structure.
Their development has to be seen in close relation to primary factors
such as galleries participating, internal factors affecting the alliance as well as
its local and regional business reality.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'Commercial art galleries', 'Contemporary art market', 'Gallery collaboration', 'Gallery weekends', 'Germany', 'Project alliances']"

Deze masterthesis onderzoekt de manier waarop Nederlandse populaire- en kwaliteitskranten schreven over Donald Trump tijdens zijn verkiezingscampagne tot aan de inauguratie (20 juli 2016 t/m 19 januari 2017). Zijn verkiezingscampagne was in alle opzichten opvallend, met veel nadruk op negativiteit, schandaal en een uiterst onverwachte ontknoping, wat veelvuldig besproken werd in de media. Deze thesis richt zich ten eerste op de verschillen tussen populaire- en kwaliteitskranten in de hoeveelheid aandacht voor Trump. Daarnaast worden verschillende nieuwswaarden met betrekking tot hard en zacht nieuws vergeleken in de kranten. Tot slot wordt de inhoud van de berichtgeving geanalyseerd op de aanwezigheid van drie politiek relevante frames, namelijk het horse race frame, het human interest frame en het privatiseringsframe. Om de onderzoeksvraag “In hoeverre en op welke manier berichten de Nederlandse populaire- en kwaliteitskranten over Donald Trump?” te beantwoorden is gebruik gemaakt van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse met een steekproef van 350 artikelen, waarvan 175 in De Telegraaf en 175 in de Volkskrant. Een eerste bevinding betrof de hoeveelheid aandacht voor Trump, welke altijd hoger was in de Volkskrant als kwaliteitskrant. Toch vertoonden beide kranten wel dezelfde pieken en dalen in de hoeveelheid berichtgeving, duidend op een gelijksoortige nieuwsselectie. Uit de analyse naar hard en zacht nieuws, blijken beide kranten opvallend meer gebruik te maken van zacht nieuws in hun berichtgeving over Trump. Tot slot vertoonden de kranten overeenkomsten in de wijze waarop frames werden gebruikt. Zo maakten beide kranten opvallend veel gebruik van alle drie de frames, maar bleken het horse race frame en privatiseringsframe beduidend vaker voor te komen in de Volkskrant dan in De Telegraaf. Deze resultaten vormen ondersteunend bewijs voor de commercialisering en institutionalisering van Nederlandse kranten (Cook, 2006; Habermas, 2006). De resultaten van dit onderzoek bevestigen het onderzoek van Reinemann et al. (2011) dat de verdeling van hard en zacht nieuws niet enkel afhangt van nieuwswaarden, maar dat ook framing een rol speelt. Zo bleken het human interest frame en privatiseringsframe typerend voor zacht nieuws. Frames typerend voor hard nieuws behoeft meer onderzoek.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Trump', 'Amerikaanse verkiezingscampagne', 'media', 'functies van media', 'populaire- en kwaliteitskranten', 'nieuwswaarden', 'hard en zacht nieuws', 'framing']"
Health communication in a Dutch hospital serial,A. van der Riet,2017-09-25,"['M.P.A. Bouman', 'J.M. Engelbert']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","One way for health communication professionals to reach a large audience with their health message is the Entertainment-Education (E-E) strategy, which means that their message is incorporated in an entertainment program. The most recent E-E production in the Netherlands is the hospital drama serial Centraal Medisch Centrum, which was broadcasted in the last months of 2016 on the commercial channel RTL4. The aim of this thesis is to shed light on how the different involved professionals collaborated in the designing, production and implementation of CMC and it examines how the health messages in the serial are appreciated by the professionals and by viewers. Furthermore, a narrative analysis of three storylines explores how the health issues are incorporated in the serial.
 	Results of six in-depth interviews with respondents from different health organizations, the Friends Lottery and RTL, suggest that the health organizations played the smallest role during the collaboration process. Their role was mainly to provide facts and information, whereas the production company Talpa had the biggest influence on the scripts. The health organizations were not involved in the decision-making process, rather they were dependent on the choices of the Friends Lottery, RTL and Talpa. Therefore, this collaboration process bears most resemblance to an E-E service partnership arrangement. The results also suggest that the interviewed stakeholders are content with both the process and the results. 
 	By conducting three focus groups with members of the audience, this thesis shows that even though it is argued that the serial is not very sensational and the health messages are not very strong, the viewers are still able to reproduce health information from the episodes. Therefore, this thesis shows that this particular type of E-E collaboration can lead to increased awareness and knowledge among viewers about health issues. As such, it hopes to provide useful information for professionals who want to produce a similar E-E hospital serial in the future. Further research is suggested to explore the long-term effects of this E-E production and to keep improving this type E-E collaboration.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Entertainment-Education', 'E-E service', 'collaboration', 'appreciation', 'health communication', 'health professionals', 'television professionals', 'Centraal Medisch Centrum', 'hospital serial']"
Trump en de media,M.K.J.T. van Hunnik,2017-09-25,"['P.C. Ruigrok', 'M.N.M Verboord']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Dit onderzoek analyseert de dynamiek tussen Trump en de media tijdens de Amerikaanse presidentsverkiezingen. De Amerikaanse media in het bijzonder ondervinden in de moderne tijd een proces van commercialisering. Nieuwswaarden die journalisten moeten sturen in het maken van nieuws, zijn tegenwoordig gebaseerd op commerciële doeleinden in plaats van ethische normen. Hierdoor is volgens voorgaande literatuur het Amerikaanse medialandschap gelijkgeschakeld in zijn productie en vindt institutionalisme plaats. Politici en met name degenen met een populistische communicatiestijl, zijn zich bewust van de commerciële nieuwswaarden die de keuzes van journalisten beïnvloeden en spelen hierop in. Populisten laten politieke logica links liggen en implementeren medialogica in hun uitspraken naar de media om media-aandacht te maximaliseren. Zodoende bevinden politici en de media zich in de vierde fase van mediatisering. De interactie tussen Trump en de media heeft een effect op de vormgeving van berichtgeving. In het huidige onderzoek is daarom aan de hand van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse onderzocht hoe Amerikaanse populaire- (USA Today) en kwaliteitskranten (The New York Times) Trump en zijn populistische manieren framen, personaliseren en in welke hoeveelheid en op welke toon over hem bericht wordt gedurende de Amerikaanse presidentsverkiezingen. Op deze wijze kan ondervonden worden of de Amerikaanse journalistiek haar maatschappelijke taak nog kan vervullen, of dat Trump de dans met de media leidt.
	Uit de analyse blijkt dat de Amerikaanse kranten weldegelijk geleid worden door dezelfde commerciële logica. De proportionele berichtgeving over Trump piekt bij beide kranten op dezelfde momenten, al is de hoeveelheid berichtgeving van de meer commerciële krant USA Today aanzienlijk groter. Opvallend is dat beide kranten zich expliciet distantiëren van Trump en negatief over hem berichten, waarbij de kwaliteitskrant het voortouw neemt. Zo wordt hier een nuance gevonden in het institutionalisme en stellen de kranten zich weerbaar op in de strijd tegen Trump. Daarnaast worden sensationele frames zoals het conflictframe en het populistische frame intensief gebruikt in de berichtgeving, vermoedelijk omdat deze frames een hoge commerciële nieuwswaarde bevatten. Alle frames komen vaker voor wanneer de verkiezingen gaan tussen enkel Trump en democratische rivaal Clinton. De populistische frames lijken gebruikt te worden om Trump negatief neer te zetten in de berichtgeving. Tot slot wordt aangetoond dat Trump continu wordt gepersonaliseerd als buitenstaander van het politieke systeem, terwijl de personalisering van charismatische leider uitblijft. In het onderzoek komt vooral de samenhang van variabelen naar voren, omdat alle variabelen in dit onderzoek verband houden met het populistische frame. Het populistische frame presenteert zich als een complex en vloeiend concept.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'populisme', 'Donald Trump', 'Amerikaanse verkiezingen', 'framing', 'personalisering']"

Er is gekeken naar de invloed van economische en technologische ontwikkelen op de invulling van de professie, de veranderende vraag naar buitenlands nieuws, journalistieke waarden, routines en rolinvullingen en tot slot naar de afname van vaste aanstellingen en daardoor de toename van freelancers. Door middel van interviews met vijftien Nederlandse freelance correspondenten is het onderzoek uitgevoerd. Met deze interviews is inzicht verkregen in de ervaringen van de correspondenten. 
Uit de resultaten van deze studie kan geconcludeerd worden dat Nederlandse freelance correspondenten meer moeite moeten doen dan ooit voor een lager salaris. Zij bevinden zich in een nadelige positie ten opzichte van de Nederlandse media. Opdrachtgevers bepalen wat er aangekocht wordt aan verhalen en dus wat er gepubliceerd wordt. De correspondent en zijn opdrachtgevers zijn wel loyaal aan elkaar ondanks de absentie van een vast of retainer contract. Op freelance basis werken betekent hier niet dat de correspondent vrij is om voor elk medium te pitchen. De loyaliteit staat deels vastgelegd in een freelance contract dat meer een exclusiviteitscontract genoemd kan worden: de correspondent mag niet voor een directe concurrent van het medium werken. Hierdoor zijn bijna alle mediumtitels verdeeld en zijn er nog weinig kansen voor correspondenten om nieuwe Nederlandse opdrachtgevers te vinden. Dit betekent dus dat de freelancer geen echte freelancer meer is.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Freelance correspondenten', 'buitenlandjournalistiek', 'macht van de media', 'berichtgeving', 'productie van buitenlands nieuws', 'commercialisering', 'beeldvorming']"
Journalistiek per stuk - dé oplossing voor de (freelance)journalistiek?,R.M. Wijnen,2017-09-25,"['C.E. Aalberts', 'H.J.C.J. Hitters']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Sinds 2014 is het voor freelance journalisten mogelijk om via Reporters Online op Blendle artikelen aan individuele lezers te verkopen, dus zonder tussenkomst van een traditionele redactie. Het nieuwe verdienmodel wordt gezien als een vorm van ondernemende journalistiek, maar door de stormachtige ontwikkelingen op dit gebied en een gebrek aan empirisch onderzoek blijft onduidelijk hoe zij hier invulling aan geven. Door middel van het afnemen van diepte-interviews met freelance journalisten die ervaring hebben met het nieuwe verdienmodel is hier inzicht in verkregen. Onderzoek naar deze specifieke vorm van ondernemende journalistiek is van belang omdat freelance journalisten zich in het veranderende medialandschap, deels noodgedwongen en deels omdat hier nieuwe kansen liggen, meer moeten gaan opstellen als ondernemers. Dit onderzoek biedt hen handvaten om zichzelf meer als ondernemers op te stellen. 
	Uit de resultaten van dit onderzoek kan de conclusie worden getrokken dat de mate waarin het nieuwe verdienmodel rendabel kan zijn weerslag heeft op hoe freelance journalisten er invulling aan geven. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat het nieuwe verdienmodel slechts voor een beperkte groep freelance journalisten rendabel kan zijn en voor een grote groep vooralsnog niet. En zelfs voor deze selecte groep freelance journalisten lijkt dit meer uitzondering dan regel. Dit valt te verklaren door de inwerkingtreding van het winner-takes-all principe. Er zijn freelance journalisten die proberen rendabel te zijn door originele content te publiceren, maar dit blijkt enkel rendabel voor een selecte groep freelance journalisten die gezien kunnen worden als ondernemende journalisten. Zij bepalen onderwerpen op basis van wat scoort en ondernemen veel activiteiten om hun product aan de man te brengen. Tegelijkertijd roept dit op zijn beurt vragen op over de journalistieke onafhankelijkheid.  De meer traditionele freelance journalisten zijn niet bereid om hun journalistieke onafhankelijkheid op het spel te zetten en zien dan ook weinig terug voor hun originele content. Een grote groep freelance journalisten ziet deze ontwikkeling en kiest voor een nagenoeg risicoloze invulling. Zij publiceren oude content in de hoop dat dit iets extra’s oplevert. Dit onderzoek heeft het gebrek aan empirisch onderzoek opgevuld en de algemene literatuur over ondernemende journalistiek verrijkt met inzichten over een specifieke vorm van ondernemende journalistiek.

Craftsmanship: A renovated way of making and marketing a job,"Sparacino, B.",2017-09-22,['Klamer A.'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Is it possible for craftsmanship to survive today? And how?
These are the questions from which this work moves. Everyone can see the objective
difficulties that small production and manufacturing realities have to deal with today. This is
something that was bothering me personally, and as my professor has always used to say, if
something bothers you it is because it’s important. And it might be important also for others.
Therefore I thought about my Italy and all the incredible heritage of craftsmen and craft skills
we have and we are getting to lose. I met in my past some cases that led me to reflect upon
this issue, the conditions and problems that create a limit for craftsmanship today and make
difficult for it to survive.
I wondered: how could it be possible? How could it be that we don’t mind about loosing
something so precious, a richness for our economy and a powerful resource and potential for
the future?
Thus I decided to dedicate my master thesis to investigate my questions and look for a viable
solution to this issue.
This thesis develops with a non-typical approach as an experimental research that builds up
and takes shape during the process. It starts from a questioning and investigation around the
concept of craftsmanship, its meaning and authenticity for then moving on to gather
interesting insights from real cases and life experiences.
After a first approach though the literature, I analysed successful cases and stories with a
critical approach to find relevant insights. In many passages of the process I was also inspired
by events of my personal experience, that I used to frame a new scheme of reference to look
at my issue.
I found that craftsmanship is about the “how”, the specific way of doing something in a
certain way. It is, in the end, about realising one’s own values through an activity. This led
me to investigate how it is possible to valorise craftsmanship, where valorisation means
specifically to realise the values behind that activity. This consideration connects to a
reflection on the theme of education and how education can help in creating the premises and
best conditions for a valorisation of craftsmanship, both as a manufacturing activity and a
broader concept of making a job in a certain way. At this point the research met my personal
and professional experience and I introduced in the thesis a disquisition on how
communicating at the outside a professional’s values enables people to attract the resources
and contribution required to realise their projects.
The result of this long process of research is a new way to look at craftsmanship. It is not
only something dealing with a manufacturing activity, but a way broader concept that can be
applied to an any kind of activity and deals with the realisation of one’s values behind that
activity. Adopting a value based approach to look at the issue, this thesis becomes an address
to the entire job market and world. It is about bringing back an idea of craftsmanship into our
economy and working life in general, and make it the strength and starting point of a new
way of making and marketing a job, where values and economy are synthesised in a
renovated and innovative way.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'craftmanship', 'value', 'valorisation', 'education', 'contribution', 'entrepeneurship', 'economy']"
Mahanisme in Nederland 1890-1914,J.F. Ebeltjes,2017-09-22,"['B. Wubs', 'M. Lak']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","De Amerikaanse admiraal, geostrateeg en historicus Alfred Thayer Mahan publiceerde in 1890 het baanbrekende boek The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660-1783. In dit werk betoogt Mahan dat de sleutel voor staten om een wereldmacht te worden op zee ligt. Over de hele wereld moesten westerse staten volgens hem handelsroutes, koloniën, militaire bases, havens en kolenstations beheersen en controleren. De inzet van oorlogsschepen speelde daarbij een belangrijke rol. Mahan zag de vloot namelijk als de schakel die het moederland met de rest van de wereld verbond. Staten als Groot-Brittannië, Duitsland, Rusland, de Verenigde Staten en Japan lieten zich inspireren door het werk van Mahan en bouwden daarom steeds grotere en zwaarbewapende schepen. 
 	In 1890 was Nederland niet meer de grote zeemacht die het tijdens de Gouden Eeuw was. Toch speelde de zeevaart nog een grote rol. Schepen voeren af en aan naar gebieden als Suriname, de Nederlandse Antillen en vooral Nederlands-Indië. Bijna de gehele negentiende eeuw maakte Nederland dankbaar gebruik van de Britse dominantie op de wereldzeeën, die ook bescherming bood aan de schepen van bevriende naties. Rond 1890 begon de Tweede Kamer zich echter steeds meer zorgen te maken over de landsverdediging en de bescherming van Nederlands-Indië. Het besef ontstond dat er oorlogsschepen nodig waren om kustgebieden, handelsroutes en Nederlandse belangen over de hele wereld te beschermen. Zonder vrije toegang tot de wereldzeeën zou een handelsnatie als Nederland immers reddeloos verloren zijn. Daarnaast moest de neutraliteit in eigen wateren gewaarborgd worden en was Nederland erg bang om zijn kolonie Nederlands-Indië te verliezen aan een grootmacht in opkomst: Japan. Nederland moest en zou daarom een eigen sterke vloot opbouwen, waarmee het zichzelf kon beschermen. De strategie van Mahan was ideaal voor Nederland. Met een sterke vloot kon een klein Europees land met een gigantisch koloniaal rijk, zich staande houden op het (politieke) wereldtoneel. 
 	Deze masterthesis beantwoordt de vraag welke invloed de theorie van Mahan heeft gehad op het Nederlandse denken over de Koninklijke Marine en over zijn strategie binnen die organisatie tussen 1890 en 1914, en waarom. In dit onderzoek is gebruik gemaakt van een groot aantal primaire bronnen in het archief van het voormalige ministerie van marine, dat van de Tweede Kamer en dat van verschillende kranten en tijdschriften. De bevindingen uit het brononderzoek zijn uiteindelijk gekoppeld aan de werken die Mahan tussen 1890 en 1914 schreef. Vooral betreffende de redenen om het Mahanisme in Nederland toe te passen en welke rol de theorie speelde in de discussie tussen voor- en tegenstanders van een grootschalige vloot, biedt dit onderzoek nieuwe inzichten. Nederland was namelijk veel te klein, arm en zwak om een vloot op te bouwen die het tegen een grootmacht op kon nemen. Er was daarom een eigen interpretatie van de theorie nodig om de internationale positie van Nederland te versterken. Desondanks heeft het Mahanisme een grote invloed gehad op het bouwbeleid van Nederlandse oorlogsschepen en de strategie van de Koninklijke Marine tot ver na het uitbreken van de Eerste Wereldoorlog.","['Alfred Thayer Mahan', 'Mahanisme', 'Navalisme', 'Koninklijke Marine', 'Vlootplan', 'Vlootwet', '1890-1914', 'Nederland', 'Nederlands-Indië', 'slagschepen', 'Evertsen', 'Hr.

Steun aan de Nederlandse scheepsbouw door de regering tussen 1934-1939,C. Kremer,2017-09-22,"['M. Straver', 'B. Wubs']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Deze scriptie heeft als onderwerp de overheidssteun van de Nederlandse regering aan de scheepsbouw in de jaren ’30. De Nederlandse regering voerde tijdens de jaren ’30 een zuinige begrotingspolitiek, de aanpassingspolitiek. Ondanks deze politiek is de scheepsbouw tijdens deze periode wel gesteund. Op dit punt is een hiaat aanwezig in de bestaande literatuur over de crisis en over de scheepsbouw Om de redenen achter het geven van steun te onderzoeken is de onderzoeksvraag van deze scriptie: Waarom steunde de Nederlandse regering, ondanks de bezuinigingspolitiek, de scheepsbouw tussen 1934-1939? 
 	Om antwoord te geven op deze deelvraag is gekeken naar vier zaken. Ten eerste is onderzocht wat de steun aan de scheepsbouw precies inhield. Ten tweede is de steun aan de werven in Groningen onderzocht. Hier is naar gekeken omdat deze werven een substantieel deel van de steun hebben ontvangen. Ten derde is onderzocht waarom de Nieuw Amsterdam steun heeft ontvangen. De Nieuw Amsterdam was een passagierschip die gebouwd is met overheidssteun. Dit was veruit het grootste project in het kader van steunverlening aan de scheepsbouw in de jaren ’30. Als laatste zijn de verschillende visies binnen de regering op de steunverlening aan de scheepsbouw onderzocht. Daarvoor is naar de visies van regeringspartijen, de grootste oppositiepartij en de commissies die de steun uitkeerden gekeken. Dit zorgt voor een beter inzicht in de steunverlening en de redenaties waarom deze steun is gegeven.
 	De conclusies van het onderzoek zijn dat de scheepsbouwsector vanaf 1934 vanuit het Werkfonds steun heeft ontvangen. De steunverlening werd met name gegeven vanwege de hoge werkloosheid in de sector en de mogelijkheid om de werklozen in dezelfde sector aan het werk te houden. Hierbij was het belangrijk dat de hoge werkloosheid ontstaan was door een slechte internationale concurrentiepositie. Deze slechte internationale concurrentiepositie kwam door het vasthouden aan de gouden standaard van de regering. Vanaf 1936 werd er minder steun gegeven, omdat de werkgelegenheid verbeterde en er vanaf toen marineschepen gebouwd werden. De werven in Groningen hadden daarbij een uitzonderingspositie en deze kregen sowieso een substantieel deel van de steun. Dit had te maken met het effectieve lobbywerk van Mellema, scheepsvaartinspecteur van Groningen. Daarnaast had de Nieuw Amsterdam steun ontvangen door druk vanuit de media en de oppositie en de bereidheid van de werven om samen te werken. Verder hadden de andere werven in Nederland steun ontvangen vanuit het Werkfonds omdat de scheepsbouw een geschikte sector was voor werkverruiming. Ook hadden de werven steun ontvangen omdat het kostenverschil met het buitenland groot was. Hiernaast werd ook nationale trots gebruikt als argument voor steun, maar dit werd niet vaak benoemd. Als laatste werd het belangrijk geacht dat de werven niet verdwenen, omdat werd gedacht dat de sector niet snel zou kunnen terugkeren. Zo is er dus een breed scala aan redenen waarom de Nederlandse scheepsbouw is gesteund door de Nederlandse regering in de jaren ’30..","['Scheepsbouw', 'Jaren ’30', 'Financiële crisis', 'Overheidssteun']"
Portretten en publieke figuren,T. Suijkerbuijk,2017-09-22,"['A.J. Baggerman', 'M.F. van Dijck']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Publieke figuren zijn vandaag de dag in Nederland en in andere westerse landen niet meer weg te denken uit het journalistieke vakgebied en de vele verschillende massamedia. Binnen een menselijk ‘frame’ worden brede (actuele) nieuwsonderwerpen concreet gemaakt doordat bekende en tegenwoordig ook veel onbekende personen als ‘exemplars’ fungeren. Er bestaan echter geen specifieke historische studies naar de opkomst van de publieke persoon als nieuwsonderwerp, oftewel het bredere journalistieke fenomeen ‘human interest’ in Nederland. In het bijzonder is er door historici nauwelijks aandacht besteed aan de wortels van het Nederlandse vraaggesprek. In deze scriptie worden daarom de methoden van vier vroegere human interest- journalisten onderzocht met behulp van zes zogenaamde ‘literaire interviews’ uit het tijdschrift Elsevier’s Geïllustreerd Maandschrift (1891-1940), de voorganger van de tegenwoordige Elsevier en één van de pioniers op het gebied van vraaggesprekken. In mijn thesis staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: wat waren de kenmerken van de human interest- journalistiek in Nederland tussen 1893 en 1907 en hoe komen deze in portretterende interviews uit Elsevier’s Geïllustreerd Maandschrift tot uiting? De kenmerken van de door mij geanalyseerde ‘portretterende’ interviews kunnen meer inzicht geven in de vroege ontwikkeling van de nu dominante human interest- journalistiek en daarom ook in de Nederlandse eind-negentiende- en begin-twintigste-eeuwse journalistiek in het algemeen. Op basis van secundaire literatuur wordt er op nationaal en internationaal niveau ingegaan op verschillende processen binnen de geschiedenis van de moderne journalistiek, zoals de beginperiode van New Journalism in de Verenigde Staten en de gevolgen van de afschaffing van het Dagbladzegel in Nederland. Daarnaast krijgt de opkomst van de celebritycultuur de aandacht en worden de internationaal gerichte theorieën hierover (van onder meer Charles L. Ponce de Leon, Daniel J. Boorstin en Leo Braudy) gebruikt om de ontwikkeling van de publieke persoon als nieuwsonderwerp in een Nederlandse context te plaatsen. De perspectieven van de interviewers, die in de navertelde vraaggesprekken van Elsevier’s sterk tot uitdrukking werden gebracht, staan in de bronnenanalyse van mijn onderzoek centraal en dienen als instrument om de interviewstijl, de aandacht voor de publieke persoon en de constructie van zijn of haar publieke persoonlijkheid te onderzoeken. Uit de vergelijkingen tussen de concrete kenmerken van de interviews, het theoretisch kader en de historiografie concludeer ik dat er in Nederland aan het einde van de negentiende eeuw een wisselwerking ontstond tussen de populair wordende (auto)biografie en de ontwikkeling van de zelfstandige, creatieve en geïnteresseerde journalist. Het autobiografische ooggetuigenverslag, oftewel het persoonlijke verhaal van de verslaggever als onderdeel van zijn nieuws, werd gecombineerd met het geschreven portret van de publieke figuur, waardoor de human interest- journalistiek in Nederland op een experimentele wijze gestalte kreeg.","['human interest', 'journalistiek', 'literaire interview', 'vraaggesprek', 'biografisch portret', 'celebritycultuur', 'publieke figuren', 'Elsevier', 'Elsevier’s Geïllustreerd Maandschrift', 'Nederland']"
"Nieuwsconsumptie via Facebook, sociaal-economische status en Bourdieu",N.Z.T. van Mil,2017-09-22,"['J. de Haan', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Sinds de oprichting van Facebook in 2004 is er veelvuldig onderzoek gedaan naar hoe dit social media platform zich verhoudt ten opzichte van verschillende aspecten van de maatschappij. Met twee miljard maandelijkse gebruikers is Facebook het grootste social media platform ter wereld. In voorgaand onderzoek zijn de risico’s en van het gebruik van Facebook onderzocht. Onderwerpen zoals gezondheid, privacy issues en de manier waarop nieuwsmedia gebruik maken van Facebook zijn hier voorbeelden van. In dit onderzoek wordt er op een sociologische manier gekeken naar de relaties tussen nieuwsconsumptie op Facebook, de kapitaalvormen van Bourdieu en sociaal-economische status (SES). De hoofdvraag is: ‘In hoeverre zijn er relaties tussen sociaal-economische status (SES), kapitaalvormen en nieuwsconsumptie op Facebook?’. Er is gekeken naar de samenstelling van het kapitaal dat een respondent bezit, tot welke SES groep hij/zij behoort en of hierdoor verschillen in nieuwsconsumptie via Facebook door ontstaan. Er is onderscheid gemaakt tussen twee SES-groepen (laag- en hoogopgeleiden) gezien bestaande theorie stelt dat deze groepen een verschillende voorkeur hebben met betrekking tot nieuwsconsumptie. Dit uit zich in twee verschillende culturele families, dat enerzijds populair nieuws prefereert en anderzijds kwaliteitsnieuws prefereert. Kapitaal van Bourdieu wordt ook in verband gebracht met verschillen in offline nieuwsconsumptie. Met name cultureel kapitaal en de relatie met nieuwsconsumptie is in voorgaand onderzoek beschouwd. Ook sociaal kapitaal is in positief verband gebracht met het lezen van kranten. Laagopgeleiden hebben significant minder sociaal en cultureel kapitaal dan hoogopgeleiden. Dit komt overeen met Fokkema & Knipscheer (2006), die ondervonden dat laagopgeleiden meer moeite hebben met online sociaal netwerken door een achterstand in digitale en communicatieve vaardigheden. Laagopgeleiden hebben significant minder sociaal en cultureel kapitaal dan dat hoogopgeleiden dat hebben. Minder cultureel kapitaal onder laagopgeleiden is een mogelijk gevolg van een gebrek aan bijscholing en verdieping van de algemene kennis binnen deze groep. De Onderwijsraad (2016) benoemt betrokken blijven met de samenleving en het ‘bij de tijd’ blijven van mensen essentieel. Van alle kapitaalvormen bleek cultureel kapitaal de grootste invloed te hebben op nieuwsconsumptie op Facebook. Cultureel kapitaal hangt samen met (actieve/passieve) culturele participatie, nevenopleidingen en algemene kennis. Algemene kennis vergroten hangt samen met kennisvergarend lezen en dit blijkt overeen te komen met nieuwsconsumptie via Facebook.","['Nieuwsconsumptie', 'Facebook', 'Bourdieu', 'Sociaal-economische status', 'Kranten']"

Base building by invitation. The Origins of American military bases in the Netherlands 1945-1960.,C. Hoogenboezem,2017-09-18,"['B. Wubs', 'M. Lak']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","American overseas military bases are an important part of American foreign policy since the Second World War. From Asia to Europe, the American armed forces have an important military presence on every continent. After September 11 2001, there has been a renewed discussion on the American overseas presence. Questions such as if overseas bases are harmful to American policy and why does the United States continue to maintain such a large presence after the end of the Cold War are prevalent in this debate. While there has been some research into the origins of American military bases in the late 1980’s and  early 1990’s, a detailed study of the origins of American military bases in the Netherlands was lacking. This thesis aims to contribute to the current debate about American overseas bases by examining the origins of these bases in the Netherlands. The central question of the thesis is why did the United States establish military bases in the Netherlands and why did the Dutch government agree to this. The period examined is 1945 to 1960. 1960 was chosen as the end date because social and political relations in both the Netherlands and the United States changed after 1960. The thesis explains the base building by using Lundestad’s Empire by Invitation thesis and examining American bases in the Netherlands through this lens using both existing literature and primary sources from both the Netherlands and the United States. First the thesis examines theories, mainly Calder’s Embattled Garrisons and Harkavy’s Bases Abroad, regarding overseas bases and uses their explanatory power on the Dutch case. The origins of American overseas basing are examined and the possible alternatives instead of a large system of bases, such as those presented during the Second World War, are used to explain why the United States established military bases in Europe on a large scale. The legal and political framework of the bases and the strategic benefits of overseas basing are examined. The first part of the thesis focuses on American interests in Europe and the Netherlands during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. Also political and economic changes that affected base building for the United States are examined. The second part of the thesis examines the Dutch perspective and places the Dutch invitation to the United States in the context of a larger European political environment. The diplomacy the Netherlands employed and the social and political dimensions of base building in the Netherlands as host state will also play an important role. The thesis concludes by arguing that the Netherlands invited the United States to establish military bases in the Netherlands because this would increase the ability of the Netherlands to affect European politics and because this would provide more security for the Netherlands since it could not support an armed force strong enough to defend its own territory and ensure that (NATO) defense plans would view the Netherlands as strategically valuable because of the established American bases.","['American Overseas bases', 'base politics', 'Empire by invitation', 'Military history', 'overseas bases', 'Lundestad', 'Calder', 'Base building by invitation', 'political history', 'Cold War', 'Vine', 'Drees', 'Eisenhower', 'Truman']"

From Blue Jeans to Royal Blue: How denim jeans became acceptable to wear in the Netherlands during the 1960s,T. de Bruijn,2017-09-18,"['B. Wubs', 'G. Oonk']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","A Dutch person buys on average 1.82 jeans a year. In comparison to the Italians, who buy 0.6 denim jeans per person, this is quite a lot. Though almost everyone now owns a pair of denim jeans, only fifty years ago it was not that common to wear them. During the 1960s denim jeans, a garment representing the working class, became appropriated by the middle class in The Netherlands. This thesis discusses this appropriation of denim by the middle and upper classes in the Netherlands during the 1960s. This was accomplished by analysing how denim was discussed in two youth magazines and two major newspapers. The first chapter discusses the meaning of denim jeans during the 1960s. The second chapter discusses push-and-pull factors within Dutch society which caused a change in how people dressed. The third chapter deals with how the main youth magazines in the Netherlands discussed denim during the 1960s. Finally, the fourth chapter analyses the way denim was discussed in the two main newspapers in the Netherlands during this same period. 
This thesis uses the leading fashion theorist Georg Simmel’s theory on fashion appropriation. In his article, ‘Fashion’, Simmel argues that fashion unites certain classes horizontally but divides them vertically. Through fashion, the individual is able to pursue desires for group identity and individual expression. Thus, one can express personal value while following the norms of a certain group. In Western capitalist societies, individuals use clothing to show that they belong to a certain social group and to display individual identity
The research on youth magazines showed a strong focus on the US and the emergence of an international youth culture. Denim jeans played quite an important role in this. The newspaper research showed that young people wearing denim jeans were considered too casual. Women wearing denim jeans were discussed with disgrace. Royal families, however, started appropriating denim jeans around 1965. During the second half of the 1960s denim jeans were slowly becoming more acceptable once not in a young deviant connotation, but with an American connotation. All in all, denim became more acceptable during the 1960s in both of the newspapers and magazines that have been researched. The research on these publications provides insight into how denim jeans were appropriated by the middle class during the 1960s.","['Denim', '1960s', 'The Netherlands', 'Fashion history', 'Simmel', 'fashion appropriation', 'American influence', 'American popular culture', 'Youth magazines', 'Newspapers']"

The Ems-Dollart Predicament,T. Kohn,2017-09-18,"['H. Klemann', 'B. Wubs']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","The central case in this thesis is a border dispute between the Netherlands and Germany in the Ems-Dollart estuary. The dispute has been traced back to 1464, and has been almost continuously in place until the present day. The main question posed in the thesis is: ‘Why did the Dutch government refrain from resolving the Ems-Dollart dispute with Germany after 1945’. In terms of international relations theory being used, the thesis underpins the importance of looking beyond a state-centric approach. Dutch-Germans relations are therefore placed in a wider context of political and economic interests of both countries. The political and economic interests as to why there is a predicament change with the historical circumstances, while the core of the dispute – the border delimitation itself – has remained firmly in place. The political-psychological relationship between the Netherlands and Germany in the years after the Second World War was an important impetus as to why the dispute remained unresolved in the years after the war. At the same time, new developments in maritime law in combination with newly arisen economic interests in the area in the form of a transboundary gas deposit, made it so that the two countries came to a series of bilateral agreements which took into account the (economic) interests of both countries, while at the same time letting them keep their respective interpretations of where the border should be. It is concluded that only due to good neighbourly relations both parties have so far always managed to reach a satisfactory bilateral agreement, guaranteeing the interests of both parties and therefore rendering it a mutually costly and therefore undesirable exercise to pursue a border settlement. As long as the core of the predicament itself, the delineation of the Ems-Dollart estuary, has not been resolved however, bilateral solutions will always be a requirement should the lack of a border give rise to any more eventualities in the future.","['Dutch-German relations', 'Ems-Dollart', 'Border disputes', 'Maritime border disputes', 'Law of the Sea', 'Continental shelf', 'Truman proclamation', 'Transnational cooperation', 'Joint exploitation of natural resources']"
Did America learn to stop worrying and love the bomb?,R. McGlynn,2017-09-18,"['M. Lak', 'B. Wubs']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Dr Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is one of
history’s most iconic films and seen by many as the greatest political satire of all
time. Yet did millions of ordinary Americans learn to love the bomb? And to what
extent did popular culture and the media play a role in forming public opinion on
nuclear weapons? Many see the nuclear arms race of the Cold War as a period
characterised by fear and panic about nuclear annihilation, but was this actually the
case? Throughout the Cold War the public perception of nuclear weapons fluctuated
significantly during various points of the conflict. This thesis concentrates on key
events throughout the Cold War in order to track the development of nuclear weapons
and their reception by the American public. Focusing firstly on Cuba in 1962, then on
Détente throughout the 1970s, followed finally by the airing of the TV-movie The
Day After in 1983. The aim of the thesis is to use these events to track the reception of
nuclear weapons by the American public throughout this roughly twenty-year period.
The Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) and the Able Archer Crisis (1983) are seen as the
two most dangerous moments of the Cold War, this thesis will track the development
of public opinion between and including these two events.
This thesis has found that America never learned to stop worrying about the
bomb, yet they did learn to live with it. Public fear and concern never developed into
widespread calls for disarmament, as fear of the Soviet Union often prevented such a
thing. Specific events altered this outlook massively; at a time of good relations, such
as Détente, more Americans supported limitations. However, during a period of
hostilities such as the late seventies, the arms race was supported due to the mistrust
of Soviet intentions. Ultimately, the outlook of Americans covered over time, based
on world events and expectations of war.","['Cold War', 'Nuclear War', 'USA', 'Soviet Union', 'Cold War Culture', 'Popular', 'Culture', 'Arms Race', 'Dr Strangelove', 'The Day After', 'Détente', 'Cuban Missile Crisis', 'Able Archer Crisis', 'Public Opinion.']"

Budding-Polo, M. (Monserrat)",2017-09-07,,Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The concept of Ecosystem Services originated in the 1970’s and much research have been done to determine the economic value of the services provided to humans by nature. The monetary assessment of the benefits of nature can be used to inform decisions, make trade-offs, make the benefits of nature visible, drive the conservation agenda and be used as an effective way to communicate the value of nature. The Netherlands embraced an Ecosystem Services policy approach and various Municipalities in the Netherlands agreed to work towards the implementation of “The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity” with the use of the TEEB-City Tool. The existing literature, as well as the Dordrecht Municipality, agree that the assessment of the Cultural Ecosystem Services provided by an ecosystem is the most neglected Ecosystem Service and considered difficult to undertake. This results in the omission of Socio-Cultural Value in economic assessments of ecosystems. In this study, a Cultural Ecosystem Services Framework is proposed to clarify concepts and is based on the end result in mind, namely five Socio-Cultural Values to be quantified.
In line with this policy approach, an existing project, the Dordwijkzone Green Infrastructure Project in the city of Dordrecht, was selected for assessment of the Cultural Ecosystem Services to the users. In addition, the quantification of the Socio-Cultural Value of the Dorwijkzone Green Infrastructure Project was undertaken, based on the subjective, self-reported appreciation of the social benefits to the users. Finally, an analysis was undertaken to determine to what extent these two aspects differ between different user groups. Gender was the only socio-demographic aspect included in this research to determine the differences in self-reported benefits and subjective appreciation between groups. The hypothesis that gender has an impact on the Cultural Ecosystem Services with differences in the way that men and women passively or actively use, experience and assign meaning to the Dordwijkzone and the hypothesis that no significant variation exists between men and women in their perceived or assigned Socio-Cultural Value to the Dordwijkzone, were both confirmed.
An evaluation was included to determine to what extent the Dordrecht Municipality achieved the ecosystem functions for which the Dordwijkzone Green Infrastructure was intended in 1999. The findings show that the Municipality was successful in making provision for the “Information Function”, but less successful in achieving the “Habitat Function”.
Recommendations include the refinement of the Cultural Ecosystem Services framework for conceptual clarity. Further research is suggested to incorporate non-monetary value in existing tools or institutions to make society aware of the value of Ecosystem Services and to serve as a communication tool to inform the evaluations and trade-offs being made in land use and development decisions.","['Green Infrastructure', 'Ecosystem Services (ES)', 'Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES)', 'Socio-Cultural Value', 'Subjective Appreciation of Life', 'The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB)']"
Paratransit Transportation as a feeder for Rail-Based Transportation,"Nagari, B.K. ( Bramanti Kusuma)",2017-09-07,['Mingardo G. (Giuliano)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Connectivity is still one of the most crucial issues to be solved in Bandung Metropolitan Area. A limited number of adequate mass transits convinced the informal operators to provide the market demand for movement (Cervero and Golub, 2007b) and establishment of Paratransit Transportation is inevitable. Angkutan Kota, as one of Paratransit Transportation, is considered as most reliable transportation with 91% loyal users (Tarigan, Susilo, et al., 2014). It suitable for Bandung’s geographical landscape, and has acceptable fares for its service. Conversely, many residents of BMA perceived Angkutan Kota as the sources for traffic problems and crime issues, and 56% of online respondents want Angkutan Kota to be eliminated from the city.
Despite these situations, it was confirmed that Angkutan Kota has a potential in enhancing the mass transit ridership. This idea is supported by the previous studies about the connectivity of mass transit, in which might influence the satisfaction level from mass transit (Okada, et al., 2003; Tangphaisankun, Okamura, et al., 2009, Givoni and Rietveld, 2007). Moreover, another study reveals that around 68% train passengers in Bandung city use Angkutan Kota to access its main station (Rohjan, Surdia, et al., 2012).
This paper aims to explain the capability of Angkutan Kota as a feeder to complement connectivity for existing Bandung Metropolitan Area’s commuter train services, based on its user satisfaction and intention to use, specifically in Cimahi City. Several studies emphasize the importance of user satisfaction as the determinant for behavioral-intention (Zeithaml, 1988; Cronin and Taylor, 1992), by utilizing perceived value and service quality for the empirical measurement. (Lai and Chen, 2010; Joewono and Kubota, 2007; Sumaedi et al., 2012; de Ona, 2016). Surveys was employed as the main research strategy, by applying quantitative data analysis. The data set for this research was obtained via questionnaire, in which assessing users’ opinion about their satisfaction and loyalty through Angkutan Kota, and their present journey characteristics. The data set was analyzed on SPSS software.
In brief, the demographic background indicates that the most common respondents were women (66,8%), generally dominated by full-time employees and students, in the age between 16-25, and 40,3% of them are living in Cimahi city. Based on their livelihood, 52% of the respondents classified as low-income residents. Regarding their present journey, 34,3% of the respondents are considered as a frequent rider of Angkutan Kota. However, only 21,1% are the frequent rider of a commuter train, while the other respondents only use it occasionally. The present journey characteristics also indicate that in general, the respondents spend more than 10 minutes to go to the station from their home and depart from station to their destination. Accordingly, 57,4% of respondents access the station by Angkutan Kota, and 49,8% also ride with it to reach their workplace or school.
Addressing the satisfaction score for Angkutan Kota, on average, respondents affirm its perceived value and service quality by assign the decent scores for both variables. However, the ratings from its intention to use indicators illustrate the uncertainty of future use of
Paratransit Transportation as a feeder for Rail-Based Transportation iv
Angkutan Kota, because most of the respondents keep being neutral in their opinion about it. For this reason, the Ordinal Logit Regression (OLR) analysis was employed, to figure out the probability from the commuters to use Angkutan Kota in the forthcoming events. In summary, the results from data analysis and interpretation indicate that the perceived value from Angkutan Kota have seen as the key aspect to determine the future use of Angkutan Kota, especially in developing countries (Joewono and Kubota, 2007; Tangphaisankun, 2009). Similarly, cleanliness, reliability in time, accessibility of the vehicle, emergency information and drivers’ skill and attitude perceive as important aspects to motivate people to keep travel with Angkutan Kota in the several years ahead.
In regards to commuter train connectivity, loyalty indicators of Angkutan Kota evidently have a significant influence on commuter train ridership. However, even if the perceived value and service quality have a relatively small influence on commuter train ridership, it has a considerable indirect impact towards train services. In this intention, the operators and regulators should manage the plan for both modes of transportation, and improve the attractiveness of public transportation, and reduce the dependency on a private vehicle.","['Paratransit Transportation', 'Perceived Value', 'Service Quality', 'Commuter Train', 'Intention to Use']"
Creativity as Engine for Regional Growth: Identification and Interpretation in the Netherlands,"Adista Girana, D. (Dhanya)",2017-09-01,"['Oort F. van (Frank)', 'Cortinovis N. (Nicola)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The relationship between creative class and employment growth has been established in numerous studies. In the context of the Netherlands, the impact of the creative class to employment growth is demonstrated as significant and positive. However, the issue of identification robustness daunts the extent of the relationship. The creative class may drive the urban growth, but it is also possible that endogenous effects between the two variables generate unobserved bias, which undermines the robustness of the relationship.
This study aims to make a contribution particularly on the issue of identification robustness between the creative class and urban growth in the context of the Netherlands. In addition, this study has several comparative features in order to gain deeper insight into the causal relationship between creative class and employment growth. Three most important features are namely the comparison with the causal identification for creative industries - being the other aspect of the creative economy, the comparison of three different definitions of the creative class and the typical comparison with human capital. Other than analysing the identification robustness, this study also examines the spatial distribution and the explanatory factors for the creative class and creative industries. These analyses utilize panel data of the 40 COROP regions of the Netherlands over the course of 19 years (1996-2015).
It is concluded that indeed creative class drives employment growth, even with the controlled endogenous effects through instrumental variables. However, regard for the possible consequence of creative class in increasing inequality must be undertaken, as striking balance between the creative class and working class should be the aim rather than to choose one over the other. Improving education, stimulating related variety and providing accessible amenities might aid cities to achieve the positive growth potentials from the creative class.","['Creativity', 'regional growth', 'identification', 'instrumental variables', 'amenities', 'human capital', 'agglomeration']"
The relationship between street network and land use,"Yang, C. (Chenxue)",2017-09-01,['D’Acci L. (Luca)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Since the opening-up policy in 1980s, there has been a fast expansion of China’s transport facilities, and the construction of a transport network covering the whole country. With the high-speed development and huge amount of financial investments, it is important to better understand urban development and make policy based on these objective regularities, so to improve the resources use efficiency and achieve the goal of sustainable development.
Based on this background, this research aims to investigate the relationship between land use and street network, so to find whether street properties can capture the land development patterns of different land-use types. This paper investigates this relationship in Ningbo, China. Street property is measured by centrality indicator: closeness, betweeness and straightness on the street network. Six land use types are collected in the study area: commercial land, residential land, industrial land, public services, grass land and forest. Kernel density estimation is used to convert datasets into a basic raster unit. The relationship between each land use and each street network centrality is analyzed by Pearson’s correlation. In addition, geographically weighted regression was used to show how this relationship varied across space.
The results indicate that commercial land, public services land and residential land are highly correlated with betweeness and straightness centralities. For the industrial, forest and grass land, there is almost no correlation between three centrality indices and these land uses. Furthermore, the relationships vary not only among different land-use types but also in a single land-use type. Spatial heterogeneity also exists in these relationships. This finding confirms that street centrality can capture the land development of different land uses and plays a important role in shaping urban fabrics.","['Street centrality', 'Land use', 'Kernel density estimation', 'Spearman correlation', 'Geographically weighted regression']"
"Explaining the relations between bus public transport governance-management operational factors, and the service quality perceived in pristina, Kosovo","Simborth Escudero, C.E. (Cesar Eduardo)",2017-09-01,['Sharma S. (Somesh)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Polluting aged buses stuck in traffic, non-integrated ticketing, reduced quantity of service over the weekends, and crowded vehicles in the peak hours with poor ambient conditions, are some of the features that describe the “non-integrated low quality perceived” bus public transport service in Pristina, the capital city of Kosovo. The Bus Public Transport system, is governed by the Municipality, and managed and operated by public and private companies. From the study pursued evidence was found that there are critical concerns regarding the quality of the service perceived by users.
What are the factors contributing to it? What decisions or functions are the operators and the Municipality making or fulfilling to facilitate the operation of the service? Are these decisions made and functions performed, causing harm or goodness? How are citizens really perceiving the quality of the public and private bus services? Are there lines or companies doing better than others? These are some of the questions being addressed by this research work. Finding out to what extent, the decisions and practices regarding operations pursued by the bus operators and the Municipality, are affecting the users’ service quality perceptions, lay at the core of this research.
To achieve the objective a “case study” strategy was pursued, a surveying team jumped into the buses of four of the most representative lines in Pristina, for near 3 weeks, and asked 402 passengers, “what they think about different aspects of the service”. Also, the three most representative bus service providing companies and the Municipality were interviewed (11 interviews) about their management practices. Two levels of analysis were pursued (descriptive and inferential), and their results, were complemented by the qualitative inputs from the interviews. In the end, some critical findings were obtained:
Two of the four bus services studied (one operated by a public, and one by a private company) were rated very positively by bus users in terms of quality perceived.
For the users’ some aspects (criteria) of the quality of the service ended up being more sensitive and influential to their overall perception, like comfort, time, and staff kindness. Likewise, some functions performed by the organizations involved (Municipality and operators), ended up being more influential to those criteria, like Vehicle renewal, Vehicle maintenance, Personnel, among others. The relation between “vehicle renewal and comfort” happened to be one of the most significant and strong ones, both positively and negatively.
Based on the findings and outcomes obtained from this research work, the Municipality could focus and prioritize its actions on the evolution of the management and operational aspects of the bus system that are more influential towards the overall quality of the service. The vision of having a “High quality integrated bus public system transport” in Pristina should be the light that guides the path to follow.","['Bus transit management', 'bus transit governance', 'bus service quality perceived', 'bus public transport', 'bus operations']"
"Basic Infrastructure Improvement and Livelihood Strategies of Female-headed Households of Swahili Informal Settlement in Machakos, Kenya","Nduta, C. (Caroline)",2017-09-01,['Ayala A. (Alonso)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Informal settlements in Kenya date back to the colonial era when segregation policies designated living areas according to race for European settlers, Asians and Africans with unbalanced resource allocations to these different segregation areas for infrastructure development and housing. African settlers were allowed to build shanties so long as they were not near the central business district. This, coupled with rapid urbanization, has seen informal settlements grow at an unprecedented rate. They are characterized by squalor conditions evident through dilapidated housing of poor quality building materials and the absence of basic infrastructure services. The lack of basic infrastructure weighs heavily on women due to their gendered roles of home maintenance. This burden is particularly felt more by women in female-headed households as they are more vulnerable. Women are charged with responsibilities such as fetching water, washing, cooking, looking for energy sources as well as taking care of children and the elderly. Proponents of infrastructure services postulate that improving infrastructure services, though it benefits men and women, it is bound to accord more benefits to the women.
The Government of Kenya is intent on improving the living and working conditions of the people in the informal settlements. In collaboration with the World Bank, French Agency for Development and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, it initiated an infrastructure improvement programme in Swahili Informal Settlement in Machakos, Kenya. The project commenced in June 2011. This project was part of Kenya Informal Settlements Improvement Project (KISIP) programmes. The objective of KISIP is to improve the lives of approximately 700,000 people living and working in fifteen preselected urban areas. It aims to benefit both men and women equally, but it purposes to ensure that women benefit fully. The initiative therefore, anticipated that women would benefit disproportionately in their favour with the installation of water and sanitation facilities.
The main objective of this study was therefore to examine the influence of gender sensitive basic infrastructure improvement on the livelihood strategies of female-headed households of Swahili Informal Settlement. The study sought to understand this through the exploration of the linkage between access to gender sensitive basic infrastructure improvement and the livelihood activities of female-headed households by comparing their livelihood strategies before and after the improvement project.
The study adopted a quasi-experiment research design. Two informal settlements were compared in order to effectively establish the influence of gender sensitive infrastructure improvement. Swahili Informal Settlement, the experiment group, with KISIP infrastructure improvements was compared to Kathemboni Village, the control group, with no infrastructure improvements on account of KISIP. These settlements were compared in two time periods. The pre-test period, 2011, representing the conditions in the settlement before infrastructure improvement. The post-test period, 2017, representing the post-test period, after the intervention. The study used both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data were collected from the two settlements by administering questionnaires. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in the experiment group with key informants, targeting representatives of the Settlement Executive Committee and officials from KISIP, the implementers of the project. This information was supplemented by observations and further substantiated with secondary data from project reports.
Research findings indicate that investing in gender sensitive basic infrastructure does have an influence on the livelihood activities of the respondents. Notable is the significant increase in the perception of safety brought about by the installation of high mast flood lighting. This in

return has had ripple effects, for instance, enabling the residents to engage in business activities for extra time in the evening. Findings also show that the respondents had more time to carry out business activities as they had time saved from carrying out domestic chores such as fetching water. In addition, there was an improvement in accessibility of the settlement as well as within the settlement especially for residents on foot. On the contrary, there was no impact felt by the respondents with regards to disposal of solid waste.
The study concludes that access to gender sensitive basic infrastructure is indeed critical to the changes in livelihood strategies of women. There is evidence that the livelihoods activities of the female-headed households have transformed for the better albeit statistically not significant perhaps due to the small sample size and the vulnerability of the focus group in this study.","['Informal settlements', 'Improvement', 'Gender sensitive basic infrastructure', 'Female-headed households', 'Livelihood strategies']"
How investments in urban services can be financed by the land value capture instrument “Sale of Development Rights” – the case of Curitiba,"Marcelino, M.A. (Marcio Alex)",2017-09-01,['Gielen D.M. (Demetrio Muñoz)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This research studies the use of the land value capture (LVC) tool Sale of Development Rights (SDR) to finance infrastructure and services that allow urban development to happen. Local governments work under pressure of tight budgets to manage the urban environment and provide needed services for citizens. In this context, LVC tools appear as an additional source of revenues still underutilized and with great potential to rebalance inequalities in urban development. LVC is the conversion of increases in land value – the unearned increment - into extra-budgetary public revenues available for investments in urban demands (Alterman, 2012; Furtado, 2012; Walters, 2016). Therefore, the main goal of this work is to explain how the way the instrument SDR is designed and operated impacts the amount of value captured from increases in value of private land to be invested in urban services.
The study was made with data from Curitiba, in south Brazil. This city uses the SDR to aid financing urban services for almost three decades. It was also one of the pioneer Brazilian cities to use the instrument in the 1990s. The tool was implemented in stages and suffered several modifications, outcoming three different models of SDR currently in operation: Onerous Concession of the Right to Build (OODC), OODC sale through Shares (OODC-S), and the Certificates of Additional Potential Construction Bonds (CEPACs). Each model of SDR is used for different purposes and since 2011 they coexist embedded in the municipal land use plan, raising an opportunity and a need to evaluate its operation in converting increments into public funds.
Based on a theoretical debate, a conceptual framework was elaborated to guide the empirical research made through the method of multiple case study. This methodology allowed observation of the impact of variations of the independent variable the way SDR is used in the dependent variable amount of value captured, also considering influence of context variables like culture and land markets. The time frame analyzed was between 2011 and 2016. The first investigation made was regarding the way the SDR is used, regarding what rights are charged, where they are charged, how they are charged, how much they cost, when they are charged, and what the revenues are used for. The second examination identified how much the SDR captures in relation to current and increments in value of land and generates revenues in Curitiba. Finally, the data analyzed allowed the drawing of conclusions inferring the causal relation between the studied variables.
The findings exposed that the design of the calculation of the charge affects hardly the amount of LVC. Calculating the price of building rights considering current market values of land or even auctioning the rights produce higher rates of capture than using flat rates. Besides that, the relation between the amount of basic rights that is already in the bundle of rights of the developer and the possible upgrade of these rights also affects how much value of land the tool will be able to capture. The fine tuning of this relation is more important than the adoption of unique FARs when considering LVC capacity. The higher is the result of this relation, the higher is the LVC rate. Moreover, measures to guarantee full purchase of the offered additional development and a long term vision plan embedded in the tool are necessary for higher efficiency. Instruments better planned captured more than the ones used for punctual demands. Finally, the results showed that the coexistence of the many models generates internal competition between the tools impairing their capacity to capture and redistribute resources.
The results also showed that the LVC mechanism of the SDR helped containing land prices’ increase in Curitiba. Areas where the instrument operates expressed fewer value increase than areas where upgrade in development is not allowed. When the obligatory payment of charges

is known beforehand by the developer, he may pass this cost to the landowner (Muñoz Gielen, 2010, p.48, 201), converting the raises in public revenues.
The conclusions of this research help understanding how the adjustments of key variables in the use of the SDR impacts the efficiency of the instrument. The Sale of Development Rights is a powerful tool to recover plus values, generate and redistribute funds, aiding finance urban development. But its operation demands a very active market associated to a careful design and implementation. Therefore it should not be used indiscriminately. Constant monitoring of the context including the land and real estate markets, political and tax payer resistance and cultural ideological debates is crucial for the operation of the SDR and promotion of a more balanced urban development.","['Municipal finance', 'land value capture', 'property rights', 'land markets', 'sale of development rights', 'urban services', 'Curitiba']"
Room for the river waal,"Quadros Aniche, L. (Laura)",2017-09-01,['Scholten P. (Peter)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Cities are the place of the future, sheltering 66% of world’s population by 2050. Climate change is increasing the already complex task of urban planners to create resilient cities. The challenge is to find a balance between social and economic development, technology, and a sustainable use of nature. This means a transition towards a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach. At the same time, this approach must be open and accessible to multiple stakeholders, with different aims and perspectives, to achieve legitimacy. Moreover, it is fundamental to understand the social-cultural values that connect the individuals and can empower the actors, framing the new model of water governance. In the context of these Integrated Water Management approaches, there is a trend to ‘make space for rivers’ aiming to restore the original attractiveness of rivers combining economic development, water safety, ecological sustainability and social-cultural values. River restoration programmes is a hot topic both in research and in practice, reflecting the more natural connection between urban societies and the environment.
In this study, the researchers analyse the river restoration programme ‘Room for the Waal’, in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Their objective is to investigate how citizens who were mostly affected by the project (living on the neighbourhoods transformed), and experts involved in the decision-making, perceive: A) the changed urban landscape, regarding social-cultural values, and B) the ex-post legitimacy of the programme outcome and process of decision-making. Moreover, the aim is to discover and explain whether C) a relationship can be established between these two perceptions (A and B).
Regarding the research methodology, the strategy chosen was the Case Study. Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with inhabitants affected by the programme, living in the area transformed, and with experts involved in the decision-making, from different government levels and consultancy firms. Furthermore, secondary data were analysed to support the primary data collection.
The data analysis showed that citizens and experts have a very positive perception on the transformed urban landscape in Nijmegen, after the ‘Room for the Waal’ realization. Four social-cultural values were analysed in this study to understand landscape perception: aesthetic and symbolic, place attachment, recreation, and values of nature. Furthermore, it was found that the perception on legitimacy, both on the outcome and on the decision-making process is overall positive among the citizens who were mostly affected by the programme and experts involved in it, with some reservations.
The main research finding on this study is that a relationship can be established between perceptions on the transformed urban landscape and on the programme legitimacy. The findings supported the expectations that a positive perception on the transformed landscape, now that it is completed and usable, would lead to a more positive perception on the outcome legitimacy – that the result is in their best interest – and even on the decision-making process legitimacy – a feeling that ‘it was worth it’. Furthermore, the vice-versa also could be applicable: a good perception on legitimacy might increase the appreciation for the changed urban environment. Indeed, it can be concluded that a both-way relationship has occurred between the two variables. This research has both academic and practical implications, suggesting a proximity between the fields of water governance – legitimacy and landscape perception – social-cultural values.","['Netherlands', 'urban', 'water governance', 'legitimacy', 'landscape perception']"

the impacts of construction of the sponge city on the housing value. The research result shows
that more than half of the residence are willing to pay for sponge city but the amount they are
willing to pay is limited. Compared with the ability to reduce flood risk, more residence is
willing to pay for the ability to improve their living environment such as the increment of green

This investment is critical for Africa’s development path as it seeks to diversify its economy from agricultural products and extractive minerals to more manufactured goods which are seen to be resilient to fluctuations of prices in the global markets. Moreover, this investment is also important to Africa in developing its physical infrastructure which are key for providing networks for the free movement of goods, people, information and capital and which are currently seen as barriers to trade, which is a very key economic activity in most African countries economy.
To benefit from integration, countries must be willing to do away with trade barriers that limit this free movement of commodities. With trade openness, a country is able to promote the efficient allocation of resources, enhancing both local and international competition and allowing for the diffusion of technology and knowledge across the countries. Proponents of integration have argued that integration will help African countries in improving their competitiveness by increasing their market size from the small fragmented economies they currently have (Artige and Nicolini, 2006) while those who oppose argue that African countries are too different in terms of country size, population, level of infrastructure development and market size and that this lack of symmetry will lead to some countries benefiting more than others when they integrate into a single bloc, in this case those countries that are perceived to be most developed ones (Venables, 2006, Krapohl, 2010).
It is based on these arguments that this study sought out to find out the relationship and extent at which regional economic integration contributes to a country’s competitiveness. A panel regression random effects model was used to analyse this relationship for 52 African countries across 10 years from the period 2006-2015. The outcome of these results was positive and significant implying that indeed, regional economic integration does have a positive and significant relationship with a country’s competitiveness. To increase robustness of the model and to test for the mediating factor of asymmetry which I generated by calculating the ratio of nominal GDP of countries with the highest GDP for that year, I ran a combined panel regression whereby I included all the independent variables and their interaction and the control variables step by step. The outcome of this model also gave out significant outcome showing that still regional integration has a significant relationship with FDI. However, for the interaction terms, only two variables were significant.","['Government Effectiveness', 'Political stability', 'lack of violence/terrorism', 'Tertiary education enrolment', 'Total Population', 'Country land size', 'Common language']"
Impact of transition on transformation of public green spaces in Yerevan,"Hovhannisyan, A. (Anahit)",2017-09-01,['Krabben E. van der (Erwin'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"During the period of Soviet Union, large number of public green spaces, parks and forests were implemented and integrated in the daily lives of citizens. The land was totally owned, managed and developed by the central government. After the dissolution of USSR in 1991, dramatic social, economic and political changes were reflected in urban transformations especially in central locations of former communist cities including Yerevan. Several public green spaces including parks, green courtyards and lawns were privatized and constructed into private amenities.
The aim of the research is to reveal what kind of transformations happened with public green spaces in Yerevan during the period of transition and to explain how changes of transition impacted those transformations. The study focuses particularly on the city centre due to its cultural importance, and through 4 case studies explains the causality of various interdependent factors on certain transformations. Various methods of primary and secondary data collection and analysis, such as observations, content analysis and interviews have been used for further research. Methodological and source triangulations were done in order to strengthen internal validity of the study. Moreover, the research provides a micro-level study of the qualitative outcome of those transformations. Additionally, general analysis at city-scale strengthens the external validity of the study and enables to generalize the findings.
The research revealed that emergence of a new actor in the market (the private develop) was essential. Becoming dependent on private investments, the state was willing to sell or to lease the publicly owned land, which was being commercialized and constructed into private uses. The greatest power of developer was also supported by a flexible legal framework, lack of adopted laws, regulations and planning policy for the new market economy, as well as fragmented society, which was lacking of collective actions for preservation of public green spaces.
Furthermore, it was found that drastic changes in social perceptions and trends, such as the shift of preferences from outdoor to indoor commercial activities resulted in establishment of consumerist-society and greater demand on commercial amenities. Additionally, lacking of up-to-date knowledge and experience in urban management in the conditions of new market economy resulted in short-term interventions and urban errors in the city. Particularly, the city centre was affected by transformations to a great extent due to high attractiveness for commercial developments.
The transformations of public green spaces into private uses continue to happen in Yerevan until nowadays. It is important to mention that the unique spatial structure of the centre, where the green belts play a significant role in forming the historical layout of the small centre, represents an important cultural value at a national level. Thus, the urgency of the investigated issue remains on the urban agenda due to its environmental, economic, social and cultural importance.","['Transition', 'transformation', 'public green space', 'land market', 'privatization', 'tragedy of commons']"
"Assessing the Impact of Urban Streets Networks Connectivity on Vehicular Movement and Urban Air Quality for Lahore City, Pakistan","Shahid, A. (Anum)",2017-09-01,['D’Acci L. (Luca)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Urban environment is considered as a complex system comprised of physical, social, economic and environmental features and activities. With the passage of time, after realising its contribution in changing the function and morphological pattern of cities, researchers are keenly interested to explore the relationship of its physical component among social, economic and environmental activities. Among all physical components, buildings and street networks are considered as main morphological elements of urban cities.
By keeping in view, the above illustrated importance of urban environment: different component, this research study has been planned to carry out for a city of Lahore, Pakistan by focusing physical built environment, particularly urban street networks and its associated impacts on vehicular movement in addition to urban air quality. Street networks are being considered as facilitator of the human movement in a city based on its capability to join or to segregate different parts/areas of city and this feature of urban street networks is strongly dependent on degree of accessibility of street networks. As accessibility is very vast concept and have different definitions which are used according to research objectives of the study. For this research study, accessibility is considered in terms of integration (closeness of one street to another street) and choice (street which is likely to pass through while moving in a city) of urban street networks. These accessibility measures are used as a determinant to describe the extent of urban street networks connectivity of a city, measured through axial lines (number of turns: topological point of view) using space syntax as a measuring tool. From applications of space syntax in different field like crime, land particularly in transportation sector, it is considered a good predictor of pedestrian as well vehicular movement. In this research, it is used to investigate the extent of influence of urban street connectivity on vehicular movement as well as on urban air quality by finding out relationship of integration and choice with vehicular movement first, and then determining the relationship of vehicular movement with urban air quality through research model 1 (Urban Street Connectivity and Vehicular Movement) and research model 2 (Air Pollution with Urban Street Connectivity in terms of vehicular Movement) by using multiple regression and simple linear regression as a statistical analysis methods.
From the results of first part of research study, it is examined that there is a significant relationship exists between vehicular movement and urban street connectivity shows that approximately 48-50% of the variance in traffic flows is accountable by the urban street connectivity for the city of Lahore, Pakistan. Outcomes of the statistical analysis also demonstrate that choice_Nor has a slightly greater impact on vehicular movement as compared to integration. Furthermore, second part of the research study based on research model 2, in this case urban street connectivity is taken in account in terms of vehicular movement and PM10 as indicator of urban air quality. Results explained that only 20% variance is occurred in PM10 concentration due to vehicular movement which shows a very weak relationship between urban street connectivity in terms of vehicular movement and urban air quality.
Due to unavailability of data for controlled variables they are not taken in account during analysis and considered as a limitation of research study. Therefore, it is recommended to do the same research for same city under similar circumstances by collecting the data of control variables to analyses how significantly other variables have an influence on vehicular movement and on urban air quality along with urban street connectivity. It is also suggested to perform the same research by taking in account geometric analysis for urban street connectivity to explore the difference in results among both type of analysis and discover which analysis best fits to describe the vehicular movement flow.","['Urban Environment', 'Space Syntax (Integration', 'Choice)', 'vehicular movement', 'urban air quality']"
The impact of credit rating on FDI attraction into Africa,"Alemayehu Kinato, H. (Hareg)",2017-09-01,"['Wall R. (Ronald)', 'Yilema M.G. (Mahlet)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"As one of the tools that have been used to measure a country’s investment environment to inform potential investors, credit rating given by a third party is very important to cross-border investors. It serves as a base for shaping the perceptions of investors about countries and has a substantial impact on inward investment flows. Foreign investors consider credit rating critically when planning to invest in a different country particularly countries in Africa where investments are perceived as risky. Understanding whether credit ratings has various explanatory powers on foreign direct investment attraction in Africa is worthy of attention, hence, the main purpose of this study. Accordingly, the study used a 10-year (2007-2016) data and conducted a panel regression model to answer the research question “To what extent does credit rating change affect the flow of inward FDI into Africa?” A total of 136 countries (Asia 35, Europe 41, Africa 26, Latin America and the Caribbean 26, North America 3 and Oceania/Australia 5) are taken as samples for this study. From the results of the study, it was found out that credit rating has a positive significant effect on the attraction of FDI at the global level and continentally in Asia and Europe however not in Latin America & the Caribbean. In the case of Africa however, credit rating does not have a significant impact on FDI but natural resource availability came out as significant for inward investment into the continent. Indeed, many theoretical and empirical literature has shown that the main motivation of multinational companies (MNCs) driving to Africa is that to get a secure access to those natural resources.","['Sovereign credit rating', 'Foreign direct investment', 'Global financial integration', 'Moody’s', 'Standard & Poor’s and Fitch']"
Urban attractiveness,"Alforque, J. (Jeancyn)",2017-09-01,"['Wall R. (Ronald)', 'Yilema M.G. (Mahlet)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The study takes off from the more general notion of globalization as a dominant force that enables mobility and openness of capital, markets and society as well as global integration. Along with keeping at pace with globalization, comes the understanding of its manifestations and effects. Foreign direct investments (FDI), by acting as a global network, internationalizes economic activities as well facilitates the transfer of knowledge, technologies and human capital. On the other hand, manifestations of globalization are most evident in cities through geographical agglomeration of FDI clusters across space. Production activities taking place in these clusters, in turn, transform cities from industrial sites to centers of “advanced services”. Competitiveness is argued to result from the presence of these clusters of specialized and innovative global institutions. Where globalization leads to the increasing competition among cities to pull in foreign investments, spurs the need to develop FDI-attractive cities. While the premise has been set, attractiveness of cities to FDI tends to be a broad subject. Despite a large body of knowledge dedicated to the study of urban attractiveness in general as well as locational preferences of FDI firms. However, only a few tackle urban attractiveness from a different perspective. With supporting relevant literature and theory, this study argues that an added component such as that of spatial qualities and urban character also constitutes urban attractiveness and has bearing to the overall ability of cities to attract FDI. The variables Distinctiveness, Diversity and Vitality sprang from notable studies on place imaging, place marketing, place-making and the sense of place as well as various urban design and architecture theories that attempt to create and package cities attractive to visitors, investments and for citizens alike. However, an empirical approach to examine the relationship and the extent upon which spatial qualities and urban character can attract Foreign Direct Investment inflow is the objective of this paper. Taking as scope of the study is the East and Asia Pacific region where a surge of FDI inflow is proved to be directed towards. The scope further narrows down into two cities per high and medium FDI inflow categories, selecting Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Metro Manila. FDI inflow counts of these cities, coupled with locational data are geomapped into GIS. Where FDI sectors agglomerate themselves are taken as samples or FDI districts. Urban attractiveness variable and indicator values are then derived, tested and analyzed relative to these sample FDI districts. Considering the theoretical and empirical results of this study, not only has the positioning of East Asia and Pacific cities been established but the need to develop FDI-attractive cities with an emphasis on spatial qualities and urban character as a component that help shape cities as holistic places. Results yielding substantial significant variables prove that spatial qualities and urban character have bearing over the attractiveness of Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Metro Manila, especially on the Central Business Districts, to FDI inflow.","['Globalization', 'Foreign Direct Investment Inflow', 'Urban Attractiveness', 'Spatial Qualities and Urban Character', 'Competitiveness', 'East Asia and Pacific']"
Sexual violence in the city,"Miranda, J.V. (Júlia Vansetti)",2017-09-01,['Nes A. van (Akkelies)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Violence limits freedom and citizen’s access to opportunities in the city. In the Netherlands, 35% of women have experienced physical or sexual violence by a non-partner and 7% have experienced it in the previous 12 months. Such statistics place women’s safety concerns as a problem still present in the twenty-first century and well worth of study.
This research’s main objective is to explain the relationship between built environment’s spatial features and gender-based sexual violence in public streets through the quantitative analyses of micro and macro spatial features of the streets of four neighbourhoods of Rotterdam: Cool, Nieuwe Westen, Hillesluis and Pendrecht. The micro spatial features are the function of the street, it’s constitutedness, the density and inter-visibility of entrances. The macro spatial features were obtained with the use of Space Syntax: angular analyses with low and high metrical radius, local and global integration. Sexual violence reports were provided by Rotterdam’s police (from 2012 to 2017).
Results indicate that neither Jane Jacobs’ ideals of safety through eyes on the streets, nor Oscar Newman’s defensible space can be defended separately when aiming the safety of women in the streets. Pooled Poisson regression models were created to explain the number of sexual violence reports per street and per block. The resulting models at both scales show significant positive correlation between the occurrence of sexual crimes and the amount of women in the streets, local integration and function of the street. This indicates that non-residential streets that may be safe during the day become more dangerous during the night, when natural surveillance disappears. Results also suggest that mixed use is safer when there is a higher share of residences. Both hypotheses are supported by findings of Hillier and Sahbaz (2008).
Inter-visibility of entrances is a negative correlate of crime, supporting that greater natural surveillance results in greater safety in the streets. Coefficients of to-movement could indicate that, on average, a street with higher flow of people has fewer crimes (especially in residential neighbourhoods), but the block that attracts such movement (usually a commercial one) has more crimes because of the lack of surveillance after stores close.
A second conclusion is that the amount of people in the streets and the time component of crimes are essential elements in the analysis of the spatial distribution of sexual violence in the streets. Third is the conclusion that there seems to be more than one mechanism that governs the spatial – and temporal - distribution of sexual violence in the streets.
The findings are in line with previous researches in the fields of sexual harassment in the streets, crime research, street robbery in public spaces, and gender differences in the use of streets.
As recommendations for urban policy practice, results suggest that women’s safety in residential streets could benefit from a design that includes residences on both sides, with good inter-visibility between entrances. In commercial areas, land use should allow and encourage the inclusion or construction of residences, to provide mixed-use. Yet, more research is advised to confirm these ideas. Nevertheless, women’s safety in the city can benefit from greater gender equality in the employment of urban practitioners, and from the inclusion of gender mainstreaming in urban design.","['Sexual violence', 'women’s safety', 'built environment', 'micro spatial features', 'Space Syntax']"
The creative actors influence on Beirut’s socio-cultural resilience.,"Saad, H.A. (Hala Abi)",2017-09-01,"['Ruijsink S. (Saskia)', 'Lunetta C. (Carolina)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The 15 years Lebanese civil war created a quick city decentralization, and destroyed the city center that was once a bustling social, cultural and economic hub. The city center regeneration plan failed to achieve its vision in recreating the unifying element of Beirut, leaving the city chattered in all possible ways. Life started to regenerate in the surrounding clusters around the city center, dividing the city into parts, and creating complex urban dynamics, where certain resistance is evident through some urban interventions. This is the clash between the ‘creative resistance’ and the ‘neoliberal investors’. This creates challenges to Beirut’s socio-cultural resilience, especially in terms of capacity to regenerate the cultural place. However, the creative actors seem to be the centre of discussion in the creative city debate, but there is a lack in understanding the role of creative actors in terms of promoting urban resilience from a social and cultural perspective, especially in Beirut, which is still suffering from unhealed wounds after the civil war.
The objectives of this research mainly consist of developing an understanding of the impact of the actions of Beirut’s creative actors on the city’s social benefit; through understanding the stimulus, inputs, outputs, and interactions of creative actors in the cultural sector, within a complex context of strong power dynamics. This will help in building knowledge on how top-down and bottom-up forces interact in the case of Beirut. In other terms, this would entail looking for the facilitators and barriers for urban processes in the social and cultural sector that should advocate the city’s robustness in encountering shocks.
A Comparative case study strategy was used for this study since this methodology allows examining a small number of units (Beirut’s cultural place regeneration) with assumed independent variables (creative actors) influencing the dependent variable (Socio-cultural resilience). The selected cases are the deserted City Centre of Beirut, were it is not expected to find socio-cultural resilience, unlike the neighbourhood of Mar Mikhael that visibly and presumably managed to regenerate a certain activity leading to the assumption that there is a certain level of socio-cultural resilience in that neighbourhood. The main source of data for this research is primary qualitative data collected through interviews with various identified actors.
One of the main findings supports that creative actors are divided into three categories: the creative activists, the creative placemakers, and the creative entrepreneurs. They all influence socio-cultural resilience in a certain manner. Creative activism interventions are the ones that push the most towards resilience because they bring a social benefit and build a collective identity to a certain extent, due to the strong opposition of the contextual conditions and other actors. Creative placemaking interventions do not have a great positive or negative influence on resilience unless it is combined with creative activism. However, creative entrepreneurial activities can push towards collapse, due to the fact that this category is directly involved in the gentrification of neighborhoods with a clustering of creative industries. The same actor can fit in the three categories making the boundaries between them blurry. Therefore, decision makers have to support certain types of interventions and not certain actors in the city. In the case of Beirut Creative activism interventions have to be supported in order to further guide Beirut towards resilience since it is currently right on the edge of collapse, but still leaning towards resilience.","['Creative activism', 'creative placemaking', 'creative entrepreneurship', 'Cultural place regeneration', 'Socio-cultural Resilience']"
"Which institutional barriers (and opportunities) exist in the
climate adaptation planning process and how they interact with each
other in the Municipality of Beirut (Lebanon)?","Reyes, L.Z. (Leonardo Zea)",2017-09-01,['Olivotto V. (Veronica)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The Municipality of Beirut has not up-taken climate adaptation policies nor has a climate
adaptation action plan per se, at least there is no clear evidence. It seems that the need to plan
for climate adaptation is not understood. The objective of this study is therefore to explain
possible institutional barriers (at the Individual level, Organisational level and Enabling
environment level) within the Municipality of Beirut that are hindering the adaptation process
and in addition explain how they interact leading to ‘vicious cycles’ of barriers in the
understanding phase (Problem detection, Information gathering and use and Problem
redefinition. On the other hand, the study also explains opportunities to overcome barriers.
The research strategy is a single case study. The study uses a mixed method approach. The
main research method is interviews together with expert consultations and content analysis.
Experts with a working background in Beirut are consulted to compare information provided
by members of the Municipality. Similarly, analysis of existent written information such as a
local publication or an official statement, are analysed to compare it with information
provided by members of the municipality and the experts. To analyse data, barriers, vicious
cycles and opportunities were quantified by the number of times they were suggested by
informants.
The main barriers hindering the adaptation process are: Climate scarcely on the
municipality’s agenda (Enabling environment) that affects the Problem detection. The Lack
of interest (Individual level) that affects the Problem detection and Information gathering and
use, and the Lack of a specialised department (Organisation level) that affects the Problem
detection, Information gathering and use and the Problem redefinition.
There are barriers that form vicious cycles. The main cycle is between Climate scarcely on
the municipality’s agenda and the Lack of individual interest. To some extent, most barriers
are associated to them. From this cycle, other cycles can appear augmenting the magnitude of
the problem. However, the simple existence of an institutional barrier does not necessarily
imply the creation of new barriers.
On the other hand, the main opportunities to overcome institutional barriers are: Central and
international support (Enabling environment level), Data bank creation (Organisational
level), and in equal importance Awareness of current climatic threats (Individual level) and
NGO’s and civil society pressure.
It is concluded that there are crucial issues in the whole setting of the Municipality of Beirut
that are hindering the understanding of climate adaptation. Vicious cycles perpetuate some
existent barriers hindering the municipality’s ability to continue the adaptation process. It is
recommended for the Municipality of Beirut to address top barriers that it has relative control
of strategically. The Lack of interest can be addressed through Capacity building workshops.
The Lack of a specialised department can be tackled through the Creation of a specialised
department. Further research is recommended on possible virtuous cycles of opportunities.","['Adaptation process', 'institutional barriers', 'interconnections', 'opportunities', 'Beirut']"
"Factors influencing land circulation in urban villages, through the cases of Beijing","Chen, Y. (Yichang)",2017-09-01,['Rabé P. (Paul)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"There are many urban villages in Beijing, which disorders the planning of the whole city and the construction of infrastructure. The government is studying on how to implement different policies to redevelop them, and the land circulation is closely relative to the mode of redevelopment. The main objective of the research is to test whether land circulation is more widespread in urban villages in the centre of city than those in the suburbs. This research chooses the combination strategy of survey and case study. Questionnaires and interviews are done in an urban village in the centre of city and one in the suburb. T-test is used to analyse the difference in land circulation in these two villages, and logistic model is used to explore the relationship between urban village and land circulation. Conclusions are drawn as follows. Firstly, villagers in Huairou Town (in the suburb) may depend more on agriculture, and their income is less than income in Xibeiwang (in the centre of city) Town. At the same time, their comprehension and acceptance of policy are similar. Secondly, area of land flowing out and the percentage of people who have transferred their land under use rights in Xibeiwang Town is more than those in Huairou Town. Thirdly, men, elderly people, villagers with higher education level and income may be more active and willing to participate in land circulation. Age, education level, part-time job and insurance seem to have a positive relationship with the area of land flowing out. The effects on inflow of land are in reverse. However, the influence of another variable perception is confusing. The acceptance of laws/regulation tends to have the negative effects, while the effect of comprehension of policy, acceptance of pricing mechanism and management of transaction is positive. At last, cases from interviews are clarified into six types. Three reasons for inflow are low price of land use right, help of government and economies of scales, and three reasons for outflow are benefits from transfer, lack of labours in household and higher income of other jobs.","['Urban village', 'land circulation', 'land use right', 'logistic model', 'willingness']"

Exploring the factors that correlate with the achievement of GHG emissions reduction targets of 59 cities from different continents,"Isakhanyan, V. (Voskehat)",2017-09-01,['Grafakos S. (Stelios)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"The global warming is one of the biggest problems which faced nowadays humanity. Acknowledging the critical role of urban areas in the process of generating the greenhouse gases, the achievability of climate mitigation goals acquires special importance and meaning.
The majority of cities as a significant player of producing GHGs has been coped against climate mitigation under the umbrella of national pledges, however, the new mechanisms established by Paris Agreement re-assessed the role of local actors and evaluate the potential of local governments mitigation plans and their value in limiting the rise of global temperature to 1.50C. In respect of this, it becomes more important the assessment of the level of achievement of GHG emissions reduction targets of cities, that is one of the main objectives of this thesis.
The research assessed the level of climate mitigation target achievement of 59 cities from different continents and delineate the external and internal factors that correlate with the achievement of GHG emissions reduction target. The assessment of climate mitigation for 59 cities highlighted the consistencies or inconsistencies of local authorities climate mitigation pledges and estimated results, the effectiveness of the local climate mitigation actions.
Different indicators have been measured to realize the level of achievement of GHG emissions reduction target in absolute and per capita terms. Trend analysis has been conducted for determining the GHG emissions reduction pathway of selected 59 cities. Thanks to the linear extrapolation have been assessed the target achievability in the targeted year. Correlation and T-Test analysis has been conducted by using SPSS, which helps to find the interrelation between the GHG emissions reduction target achievement and external, internal factors.
Among internal factors were studied: socioeconomic, demographic, urbanization degree, climate, biophysical factors. As an external factor has been analyzed the membership of international climate networks Covenant of Mayors, C40 climate leadership group and Local Governments for Sustainability.
The research findings indicate that 36% of cities will achieve the GHG emissions reduction target, 15% of cities are close to achieving and 49 % of cities will not achieve the committed target based on trend analysis. The cities with successful performances of the climate mitigation plans are mainly from European and North American continents.
One of the important findings of this research is the GHG emissions reduction per capita depends on the ambitious level of cities target commitments. Those cities that have ambitious target the level of trend emission per capita is low. It is also worth to mention that with ambitious target gives a possibility to have significant decrease of the GHG emissions.
The correlation analysis indicates a moderate correlation between cities achievement level of the GHG emissions reduction target and GDP per capita, cities geographical location, density. The T-Test analysis allows to exploring two external sufficient factor that are related to achievement of climate mitigation targets, that are a member of the Covenant of Mayors and being a member of more than one climate network. There is enough evidence to emphasize that CoM is the effective initiative among others in this used thesis sample, with its guidelines, coordination with local governments is more effective compared with other climate networks.
The key achievement of this research is the exploration of factors that mainly interrelated to the achievement of climate mitigation goals.
Exploring the factors that correlate with the achievement of GHG emissions reduction targets of European cities iv
In total, the combination of socioeconomic, climate, the degree of urbanization factors with effective international cooperation for urban climate mitigation governance are essential elements to achieve climate mitigation goals.
The results of this research can contribute the efforts of local governments to chose the right climate mitigation policy, thereafter to have a significant investment in the process of coping against global warming.","['Climate Change', 'mitigation', 'GHG emissions', 'emissions reduction target', 'target achievement']"
Individual decisions towards intercity rail,"Bowen, J. (Jacob)",2017-09-01,['Sharma S. (Somesh)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"In recent years various intercity rail projects have moved into construction and late planning phases for the first time in the past fifty years in the US. These projects have faced and continue to face many challenges towards implementation including conflict with communities and regions in which these projects affect. This study explains which factors influence individual decisions as to support, oppose, or have no opinion towards an intercity rail project that will affect their community. Looking at the Brightline rail project, a controversial intercity rail project in the US state of Florida, the factors that most determine individual decisions towards the project were determined. How these determinate factors were first identified was through an overview of research into decision theory from the physiological perspective in which perceptions overtly determine the decision outcomes of individuals. The constructs of perceptions and decision theory were connected within the context of transportation in the US in order to form a concise research strategy that identified how individuals perceived the impacts of the project and some of the constructs that build perceptions through measurable individual characteristics. Perceptions towards the Brightline projects impacts and characteristics of individuals were gather through an online and paper survey allowing for a quantitative analysis that was conducted to see precisely what role perceptions and individual characteristics played in determining how someone responded to the project. It was found that how an individual perceived the future impacts of the project overwhelmingly determined their response towards the project. The results also reviled how particular characteristics of an individual had some influence on their decision outcome while other characteristics had little to no influence. This study provides insight into the role of decision making from the individual level in relation to a major infrastructure project. To summarize the analysis the extent of individual characteristics and perceived project impacts is high in understanding the effects on decision outcomes towards the project understood through a variance of (80.08%). Perceived project impacts had both the greatest control amongst (IV’S) and the highest odds of predicting individual decision towards the Brightline project. Despite this control and high predictive power of perceived project impacts, risk and exposure still maintained a significant association with individual decisions towards the project. This study concludes that individual perceptions of project impacts has the greatest control in people’s decisions towards the project while their risk and exposure to the project still retains a strong influence on overall decision outcomes.","['Perceptions', 'Brightline project', 'decision making', 'ration choice theory', 'cognitive constructs', 'intercity rail', 'community impact']"
The self-organized citizen and its outcome in urban regeneration,,2017-09-01,,Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"This research is a case study of self-organization, namely, “The Creative District Foundation” who aims to drive as the central roles on urban regeneration emphasizing creative economic approach in significant value of the heritage of Bangkok, Thailand. This phenomenon is not common to see local stakeholders trying to initiate volunteering actions which embed in governmental organizations based on a notion of hierarchical instrumental policy and decision- making in the context of Thailand.
The research objective is to understand how local stakeholders evolve themselves that are involved in a process of self-organization and affect the outcome of urban regeneration in Bangrak-Khlong San district.
The main research question is: How does the self-organizing process by local stakeholders affect the outcome of their process in the field of urban regeneration in Bangrak -Khlong San District, Bangkok?
The sub-questions are; what are the factors which facilitate the self-organizing process by local stakeholders? What are the outcomes of their process in the field of urban regeneration? And how is the relation between the self-organizing process by local stakeholders and their output of their process in the field of urban regeneration?
The formulation of the conceptual framework was based on literature on Network governance, self-organization, and a combination between Network governance and Self-organization which focused on boundary-spanning activities and the conditions of self-organization citizen in the field of community-led urban regeneration. In this way, the factors facilitating the self- organizing process and the quality of the outcome’s factors are formulated to evaluate their performance on urban regeneration and see how was the relation between the self-organizing process by local stakeholders and their outcome.
In order to operationalize the conceptual framework and measure them, this single holistic case study is used for research strategy which based on the collection and analysis of qualitative data. The primary data was collected by in-depth interview with semi-structured and the secondary data was also collected for triangulating data which included policy documents, magazines, websites and social media.
The result of the research can be concluded that the succession of the self-organizing process by local stakeholders in order to deal with urban regeneration which is complex public issues, is not processed on itself. The self-organization needs to collaborate intensively with the local community and governmental organizations. The trust and social capital, and boundary spanning activities are the important factors and needed to develop within the community group boundary and the community-administrative boundary in order to generate the quality of the outcome of urban regeneration more effective. However, this collaboration is not easy because the self-organization still exists within governmental organizations environment which based on a notion of hierarchical instrumental policy and decision-making, as well as, the absence of organizational and community governance arrangements in a policy context. This situation frustrated self-organizing process of the initiators which the governmental organizations and community do not have the room to cooperate together as a partnership in order to generate urban regeneration process in the neighborhood. However, more knowledge is therefore needed how and what to extend those the direct organizational environment, and wider political and

Impacts of Condominium Housing Development (CHD) on the property rights and tenure security of smallholder farmers in peri-urban area of Addis Ababa,"Alemu, G.M. (Girma Mulu)",2017-09-01,['Fika O. (Ore)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Addis Ababa City Administration is implementing various Condominium Housing Development (CHD) projects in its outskirt peri-urban area. Nevertheless, so far there has been no study conducted to specifically explain impacts of CHD on the property right and tenure security of smallholder farmers in the study area. The study explains the impacts of CHD on the property right and tenure security of smallholder farmers in the peri-urban area of Addis Ababa taking Koye Fache and Bole Arabsa localities as the case study. The study used a qualitative approach to collect the required data and, hence, both secondary and primary methods of data collection were employed. The secondary method used includes desk review of the relevant secondary, as well as analysis of unpublished primary documents, was conducted. The primary data collection methods employed are in-depth interviews and FGDs. In-depth interview and focus group discussion (FGD) was conducted displaced smallholder farmers. A total of 22 in-depth interviews with affected farmers and officers working in government agency and two (2) FDG were conducted with affected farmers. The finding of the study was analysed using qualitative methods of analysis.
The study found out that, expropriation of agricultural land in the peri-urban area for CHD caused the transformation of landholding system from unlimited freeholding rights to public land leasing system in the study area. As a result, the smallholder farmers in the peri-urban area were forcefully displaced from their property they held for generations and lose their use rights and tenure security in the study area. The study also reveals that the expropriation of land for CHD in the peri-urban area was implemented without informed consent and genuine participation of smallholder farmers in the study area. The study revealed that there was a high prevalence of the problem of governance expressed regarding forced land acquisition without smallholder farmers consent and participation for CHD. Also, unfair compensation was provided for displaced smallholder farmers not based objectively on available legal frameworks rather official’s judgments and goodwill in the study area. Thus, the government did not neither protect their property rights and tenure security nor provide fair compensation for their expropriated properties.
The study revealed that there is no separate legal framework governs acquisition of land for CHD in the peri-urban area. Farmers residing in urban and rural areas are guided by the same existing legal frameworks regarding the land acquisition for development endeavours. The study also found out that, lack of single responsible organization for managing land acquisition for CHD, but the existing agencies accountable for availing land for other development activities are undertaking are shouldering the task with dual responsibility leading lack of concern for the displaced farmers for CHD projects. Also, the low commitment of government officials to implement the existing laws and regulations for land acquisition and lack of organized community organization within displaced smallholder farmers aggravated effects of CHD on the property right and tenure security of displaced smallholder farmers in the study area. The study found that the deterioration and reduction of smallholder farmers property rights was not as a result of change in tenure system rather change in landholding system from freeholding to public leasing due to CHD in the study area.","['Property Right', 'Land Tenure', 'CHD', 'Compensation', 'Expropriation', 'Smallholder Farmers']"
The utilization of social and political strategies of the urban poor in coping with the impact of forced evictions,"Adeniran Folashade, R. (Rebecca)",2017-09-01,['Eerd M. van (Maartje)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Cities in the 21st century are fast developing with rapid increase in urbanization. The implication of this is the rapid deterioration of housing conditions, as there is more demand for housing than supply. As a result of lack of adequate housing alternatives for the urban poor it has led to large numbers of slums and informal settlements. This is a settlement with little or no basic services and infrastructures like good roads, sewage facilities, drainage system, water etc. People tend to live in illegal settlement which are mostly slum areas when the option of settlement in a legal settlement is unavailable and also due to their inadequate livelihood assets. The main reasons for forced evictions in most developing countries is due to the beautification of cities, large developmental project and mega events which have been a challenge for the government to manage urban development project without having a negative impact on the lives of citizens. This development often time result to displacement of millions of people.
Forced eviction in itself is not the solution for having cities without slums, but it has helped to fuel the growth of a new slums and the increase of people living in existing slums. Due to unplanned evictions and without proper relocation plan for the evictees, evictees are again forced to move to another neighbouring slums leading to great increase in the number of slum dwellers.
The enormous population in Lagos state has posed a challenge to the state government as there are increase in rural-urban growth due to its being a commercial capital of the country. This has resulted to acute shortage of standard housing which has led to the development of prolific growth of slums, the deterioration of the existing houses, as a result of lack of consistent maintenance. People live in slums and squatter settlements scattered around the city. This also resulted to frequent forced evictions in the city, this has accelerated the displacement of thousands of people from their homes every year. In 2013 over 9,000 persons were rendered homeless without any appropriate form of alternative relocation.
This research centres on the utilization of social and political strategies adopted by urban poor in coping with the impact of forced evictions. More concentration was based on the strategies evictees adopted in coping with evictions impacts. The study debate on the livelihood framework, livelihood assets, vulnerability context, forced evictions and its impacts, social capital as a coping strategy, political capital as a coping strategy and right to the city was all used in analysing theories and having a broader knowledge on the study.
The study is based on contributing to the understanding of forced evictions and the impact of unplanned actions by the government in removing evictees from their communities without adequate provision of alternative relocation which have a huge effects on their livelihoods. The research also explained the strategies adopted by evictees for surviving after encountering an adverse form of forced eviction. The research was qualitative in nature and as a result of that case study as a research strategy was used. As it enables research to be studied in depth and closely examine a study within a specific context. This was also supported with the administration of questionnaires.
The study reveals the impact of forced evictions on the livelihood of the evictees. Most of the evictees suffers from different forms of diseases and sickness due to the unhealthy environment they find themselves after evictions, evictees children could no longer continue with their education after the evictions because they have to assist in meeting the needs of the family so reliance on child labour was encouraged. Most of the evictees lost their home-based business, their houses and personal belongings was also lost due to the eviction. However, they were able to use their social and political capital to cope with the impact of forced eviction. In regards to their social strategies, family and friendship ties were mostly adopted by evictees and this

Finally, their political strategies was in great advantage to them also, with the help of their NGOs and Community leaders, they were able to access compensation from the government.

"The influence of paratransit – informal transportation on public bus policy implementation in Phnom Penh, Cambodia","Sorn, S. (Sopheavatey)",2017-09-01,"['Canelles G. (Genea)', 'Ruijsink S. (Saskia)']",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"Rapid urbanization and increased of motorization have resulted in congestion and pollution that requires the need for a shift towards the use of more sustainable transportation mode like public transportation. In most major cities of developing countries, traffic congestion and air pollution have been observed to be associated with the operation of informal transportation and huge number of private vehicles uses, and there is no exception to Phnom Penh. Since public transport such as buses and subways is not well developed in the city, paratransit, such as motor taxis and auto rickshaws is the main mode of travel. In order to deal with serious traffic congestion, city bus was introduced in 2014, expecting to reduce the number of vehicles commuting on the roads. However, this initiative has not been successful since paratransit is still the most preferred mode for travellers though the trip fare of city bus is relatively cheap.
The purpose of this study is to provide insights about the influence of paratransit in application of city bus policies and also explain the reasons why travellers do not prefer to use public bus services for commuting. The research method is a mixed strategy of using survey and semi-structured interview. A total number of 335 commuters in Phnom Penh were interviewed to hear their perceptions on the level of service delivery of both public bus and paratransit and particularly the reasons behind non-preference of city bus service. The key informants are users of public bus and paratransit, and experts who involved with public transport improvement project.
Major findings and analysis cover four main categories including 1). Differences in perception between public bus and paratransit, 2), Encouraging factors for using public bus, 3). Encouraging factors for using paratransit, and 4). Discouraging factors for using public bus. The study shown that commuters have positive perception on paratransit in terms of its availability, accessibility, reliability and flexibility, while they perceived these characteristics provided by public bus were poor. Nonetheless, commuters were satisfied with public bus when it comes to trip fare, comfortability, safety and driver’s behavior. The study further revealed that students and elderly were in favor of using public bus, while middle age people and wage-paid employees were not satisfied with its services.
It was observed that the reasons that travellers do not prefer to use public bus are because of low level of flexibility, reliability and accessibility that resulted in longer travel time, being delayed and especially they still have to use another transportation mode in order to connect with bus service. These three indicators were considered as priority factors that needed to be improved. Public bus quality could be improved by expanding bus routes to sub-urban areas and increasing frequency of bus operation. It is also recommended that law enforcement should be done on on-street parking, illegal use of sidewalks, traffic management and vehicle growth control to enhance the smooth operation of public bus. Finally, awareness campaigns should be highly promoted to spread the information of bus operation networks as well as the necessity of using formal public transportation to reduce the serious traffic congestion.","['Phnom Penh', 'Public Transport', 'Paratransit', 'Perception', 'Travel mode choice']"
A Curse or A Blessing,"Agyepong, A.A. ( Afua Appiah)",2017-09-01,['Stavropoulos S. (Spyridon)'],Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"“With almost 23 million people unemployed and another 91million inactive in the labor market of Europe within the second quarter of 2015, promoting entrepreneurship and self-employment has become very important on the agenda of European national and regional policymakers because it is believed to have a strong potential to create jobs, strengthen the EU’s innovation capacity and give unemployed and disadvantaged people an opportunity to fully participate in society and the economy” (European Commission, 2016 pg 41). Policymakers and researchers therfore trust self-employment is an option to unemployment and a solution to poverty (Bogan and Darity, 2008). Self-employment has recently become an important topic in immigration studies. It has become an important avenue for the immigrant's social mobility as they face disadvantages in their host countries (Raijman, 2001). Hence, it performs an important role in the process of immigrant adjustment and integration in their host countries, making it worth studying (Le, 1999).
Whiles, there have been substantial studies conducted on the changing relationship between self-employment in general and unemployment in OECD countries, few studies have been done in the context of most European Union countries. Also, little or no studies exist specifically on immigrant self-employed and their possible influence on the unemployment rate of their host countries. This studies objective is to, therefore, explain the impact of self-employment on unemployment and explore the influence of immigrant self-employment on unemployment in EU 28 member countries.
The research is explanatory in nature and uses quantitative research approach and basis its secondary data from Eurostat, World Bank’s World Development Indicators and UN Population Division and ILOSTAT. Two types of statistical analytical software tools, Stata and Excel were used for the analysis of existing data on self-employment (both immigrant and native) and unemployment within the period 2007-2015 for all EU 28 member countries. In the process of addressing the nature of the relationship between self-employment and unemployment and also explore the possibility of the immigrant self-employed reducing unemployment through their indirect job creation, a fixed effect regression model in Stata was estimated.
From the analysis, the study identifies a negative significant relationship between self-employment and unemployment in EU 28 member countries. However, the self-employed immigrants, unlike the natives, were less likely to reduce the unemployment rate in their EU 28 host countries considering their low representation in the sector. Nevertheless, it was also confirmed from the analysis that an increase in the immigrant and native employers (who hire others) unlike own account workers (in the self-employment sector) are likely to reduce the unemployment rate since they do not only create jobs for themselves but also create employment opportunities for other unemployed persons.
The study, therefore, concludes that indeed self-employment is a possible alternative to unemployment in EU 28 member countries of which the immigrant self-employed have a role to play as more of them dive into the sector due to the discriminations they go through in the labor market. Irrespective of this, self-employment can only be sustainable if governments of

Nietzsche wil af zien van een dialectische positie van het moderne subject zodat alleen wreedheid van taal blijft. Verlies van levenskracht door oordelen wil Artaud in een theater van de wreedheid vermijden. Werkelijk ophouden met oordelen kunnen we volgens Deleuze door het oordeel te vervangen door een non-organische levenskracht, door strijd. Deleuze ziet niet een modern subject, maar verschillende verlangensmachines, gekoppeld op basis van verlangen, gemis.

Sports clubs in general are regarded as places that connect people regardless of their education level, and respondents in most cases did not experience any gap between themselves and others regarding their education level. However, the results also strongly depend on local and cultural factors. In general, the cultural and education level gap is more often felt among people living in large cities.","['community element', 'contacts', 'level of education', 'regional effect', 'separate worlds']"
Go With the Flow: How young people define and practice good sex at techno parties,"Roeling, A.",2017-08-07,"['dr. SRJM van Bohemen', 'prof.dr. F Koster']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"The way young people engage in the techno scene has been described in highly contrasting ways. On the one hand, the techno scene is portrayed as a place of risk, where partying becomes a vehicle for excessive sexual behavior. On the other hand, it has been attributed a culture of sexual avoidance. This ethnographic study demonstrates that neither of these two opposites are true. By conducting participant observations, interviews and an analysis of social media activity, this study provides an account on the definition and practice of good sex from the perspective of young people themselves. The results demonstrate that good sex at the techno party can evoke experiences of flow by addressing its autotelic nature. Due to the high level of self-determination and control perceived by its visitors, the techno party enables its visitors to engage with sex and sexuality in a way they experience as pleasurable. The open and friendly environment allows a fluid and elusive understanding of sexuality which leaves much room for individual interpretations of sexuality. Although this pleasure found in flow is experienced on an individual level, it does not mean that is not social. Even more so, in order for sex to transform into flow, it is necessary to have a social other who guarantees a socially safe space by eliminating feelings of insecurity, hesitation and awkwardness. This study therefore does not only provide an alternative view on the way young people engage with sexuality at techno parties, but also demonstrates that the experience of flow during good sex is autotelic, but requires a social other as well.","['Sexuality', 'youth', 'techno', 'flow', 'autotelic']"
‘Onze leidinggevende stimuleert de organisatieontwikkeling!’,"Wit, B. de",2017-08-07,"['prof.dr. F Koster', 'prof.dr. RJ van der Veen']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"De ontwikkeling van een organisatie kan worden gestimuleerd door de manier van leidinggeven. Afhankelijk van de fase waarin de organisatie zich in haar ontwikkeling bevindt, stellen Beck & Cowan (2002) dat de teams om een bepaalde manier van leidinggeven vragen om optimaal te kunnen presteren. Binnen dit onderzoek is onderzocht welke leiderschapsstijl als meest effectief wordt beschouwd door teams rondom Project Portfolio Management (PPM) binnen organisaties, die zich in de verschillende fasen van de organisatieontwikkeling bevinden. Hierbij wordt de benadering van Beck & Cowan (2002) omtrent effectief leiderschap in verschillende ontwikkelingsfasen getoetst, want ondanks dat deze benadering al een periode wordt toegepast in het bedrijfsleven en in de wetenschappelijke literatuur is de toetsing ervan uitgebleven. In de benadering wordt gesteld dat de organisatie afhankelijk van de ontwikkelingsfase waarin zij zich bevinden, een bepaald type leiderschap nodig hebben om het meest effectief te zijn. Met name in de eerste fasen van de organisatieontwikkeling wordt verwacht dat men een leider met een transactionele leiderschapsstijl nodig heeft om effectief te zijn. Pas in een later stadium van organisatieontwikkeling zullen teams de transformationele leiderschapsstijl als de meest effectieve leiderschapsstijl beschouwen. 
     Om te kunnen toetsen wat de teams als effectieve leiderschapsstijl beschouwen in de verschillende fasen van de organisatieontwikkeling, zijn er 13 verschillende organisaties onderzocht. De onderzochte organisaties bevinden zich in de eerste drie fasen van de organisatieontwikkeling. De manier waarop een organisatie zich ontwikkelt volgens Beck & Cowan (2002), is gebaseerd op de waardensystemen van Graves (1974). Door middel van interviews zijn in totaal 38 respondenten bevraagd naar hun ervaringen rondom leiderschap ter bevordering van de organisatieontwikkeling. 
     Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de transactionele leiderschapsstijl enkel als effectiever wordt beschouwd in organisaties, die bezig zijn om structuur en orde aan te brengen. De organisatieontwikkeling in de overige ontwikkelingsfasen wordt volgens de respondenten meer gestimuleerd door het gebruik van de transformationele leiderschapsstijl. Concluderend kan dus gesteld worden, dat beide leiderschapsstijlen de organisatieontwikkeling kunnen stimuleren volgens de respondenten. Echter blijkt dat in een eerdere ontwikkelingsfase dan verwacht, dat de transactionele leiderschapsstijl niet meer als effectiever wordt beschouwd dan de transformationele leiderschapsstijl. Hiermee is de benadering van Beck & Cowan (2002) deels ontkracht.","['waardensysteem', 'transformationeel', 'transactioneel', 'leiderschapsstijl', 'organisatieontwikkeling']"
Het platteland: bron van populisme?,"Spruijt, M.",2017-08-07,"['J. Harambam', 'E.H. Steenvoorden']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"In dit kwalitatieve onderzoek is gekeken naar de vraag ‘Wat zijn de motieven van plattelandsbewoners om op de PVV te stemmen?’. Aan de hand van twaalf semigestructureerde interviews is gekeken in hoeverre de drie thema’s die het populisme behelst, een rol speelt bij de keuze voor de PVV. De drie thema’s van een populistische partij zijn nativisme, anti-elite gevoelens en autoritarisme. Nativisme legt nadruk op het belang van een homogene samenleving. Anti-elitegevoelens behelst de overtuiging dat de wil van het volk leidend moet zijn voor de politiek. Als laatste thema is er autoritarisme die de samenleving ziet als een streng gecontroleerde samenleving waarbij inbreuken daarop, zoals criminaliteit zwaar bestraft moet worden. Binnen deze thema’s werd gekeken naar de invloed van de mediamalaise (Culbertson & Stempel, 1985) op iemands eigen perceptie en ervaringen. Uit het onderzoek komt naar voren dat vooral nativisme en anti-elitegevoelens worden genoemd, binnen dat kader komen voornamelijk culturele dreiging en gevoelens van dat de politiek de stemmer negeert en bedriegt als argumentatie naar voren om op de PVV te stemmen. De gegeven motivaties zijn echter niet eenduidig en bij elk thema zijn verschillende typen respondenten te vinden als het gaat om hun ervaringen en percepties.","['Populisme', 'nativisme', 'anti-elite gevoelens', 'autoritarisme', 'politiek']"

Op zoek naar de democratische meerwaarde van particuliere nieuwssites in Rotterdam",C. van de Velde,2017-08-01,['B. Kester'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Het doel van dit onderzoek was om de democratische meerwaarde te achterhalen van hyperlokale journalistieke producties in Rotterdam. Er is gekeken naar de manier waarop hyperlocals nieuws rapporteren en in hoeverre zij daarmee een aanvulling zijn op het lokale medialandschap. Door het hanteren van een gemengde onderzoeksmethode konden hyperlocals ten opzichte van de professionele lokale journalistiek worden vergeleken. Daarnaast biedt het onderzoek een bijdrage aan het in kaart brengen van de nieuwsecologie van Rotterdam voor het Stimuleringsfonds voor de Journalistiek (SVDJ). Het theoretisch kader biedt meer inzicht in de rolpercepties van de journalistiek en diens verhouding en verplichtingen naar de democratische samenleving. Daarnaast is een beeld van democratische meerwaarde gevormd met bijbehorende verwachtingen met betrekking tot de hyperlocals. Door uitvoering van een gemengde methode is op kwantitatieve wijze naar de diverse onderwerpen en journalistieke rollen gekeken die hyperlocals rapporteren. Op kwalitatieve wijze zijn de journalistieke rollen verder uitgewerkt met de roloperationalisering van Mellado (2015) als leidraad. Het onderzoek heeft gekeken in hoeverre hyperlocals deze traditionele journalistieke rollen al dan niet uitvoeren en in hoeverre zij er hun eigen unieke uitvoering op nahouden. Uit de resultaten bleek dat de hyperlocals en lokale omroepen niet veel van elkaar verschilden qua onderwerpselectie. Bij beiden was binnen de afgebakende periode een gebrek aan Wetenschap en Onderwijs gerelateerde artikelen. Verder waren de meest frequente onderwerpen, waaronder bijvoorbeeld Uitgaan & Vrije tijd, vrijwel identiek. Wat betreft journalistieke rollen was de verdeling van frequenties ook vrijwel gelijk. Bij hyperlocals was echter sprake van volledige afwezigheid van de waakhondsfunctie (Watchdog) en een hogere mate van interventie (Intervention) ten opzichte van de lokale omroepen. Veel van de traditionele journalistieke dimensies uit het model van Mellado (2015) waren terug te vinden in de hyperlokale artikelen. Verder zijn aan de hand van de kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse drie nieuwe thema’s opgesteld – Thuishoren, Inbedding, en Trots – die meer inzicht bieden in de hyperlokale functies. Al in al leek de meerwaarde van hyperlocals vrij bescheiden, maar dat wil niet zeggen dat zij niet meetelt. Hyperlocals laten een positief beeld zien van de lokale gemeenschap en versterken sociale cohesie. Met enige sepsis met betrekking tot financiële motieven kan gezegd worden dat de democratische meerwaarde, ook al gering, wel degelijk aanwezig is.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'hyperlocal', 'journalistiek', 'democratie', 'nieuwswaarden', 'rollen']"
Vegetal Roots,Priscilla van den Berg,2017-07-28,,Erasmus School of Philosophy,"ABSTRACT. This study is an attempt to open up new ways of thinking about plants. The aim of the thesis is to give attention to the fascinating world of plants, by making a philosophical analysis of the relations between plants and human beings. The first part explores which problems in philosophy this ‘vegetal turn’ is meant to overcome, namely our anthropocentric ranking of plants as inferior to us and the sharp divisions philosophers have created in order to understand the world around them. This classical thinking started with Aristotle, who was one of the first philosophers who defended a strict hierarchical order of life. The idea that plants are distinct from animals and humans was shaken up by the botanical work of Charles Darwin. He showed that plants are more active and sophisticated organisms than previously understood. The second part investigates what recent research in plant biology reveals about the life of plants. It presents three aspects of plant abilities: the power of sense-perception in plants, the way plants communicate and their abilities to store and recall biological information. The biological discoveries provide a framework for making a philosophical analysis of the reciprocal relations between plants and humans. The thesis then illustrates how it is possible to formulate an alternative approach to humans and plants which is related to the term ‘emergence’. A ‘philosophy of plants’ can help us better understand the multitude of ways in which plants make us human.",

Perceived Discrimination in ’our’ Nation,"Kanters, S.",2017-07-17,"['R Gowricharn', 'dr.

The distinction between the three types of national identification is proposed as a more complete understanding of the processes through which national identification develops. It was hypothesised that perceived discrimination would have a negative effect on all three types - functional, normative and emotional – of national identification for both Turks and Moroccans. Additionally, it was hypothesised that functional and normative identification would mediate the relationship between perceived discrimination and emotional identification. The research is based on multiple regression analysis and data from the ‘Netherlands Longitudinal Life Course Study’ (NELLS). Results show that the effect of perceived discrimination on the three types of national identification differ between Turks and Moroccans. For Turks, perceived discrimination only negatively affects their emotional identification with the Netherlands. For Moroccans, perceived discrimination negatively affects both their functional and emotional identification with the nation. These findings contribute to existing literature by demonstrating the (distinct) effect of perceived discrimination on the functional, normative and emotional identification of Turks and Moroccans with the Netherlands.","['Moroccans', 'national identification', 'national identity', 'perceived discrimination', 'Turks']"

Zij beschrijft hoe, waarom en waardoor de totalitaire regimes van Stalin en Hitler aan de macht konden komen.

Deze groepen lieten zien dat mensenrechten, zoals deze in de Franse Verklaring van de Rechten van de Mens en de Burger waren geformuleerd, in de praktijk onbruikbaar bleken. Volgens deze verklaring waren mensenrechten een natuurlijk verschijnsel en universeel toepasbaar. Door de komst van grote groepen staatlozen werd duidelijk dat deze geen aanspraak konden doen op mensenrechten en zo rechteloos werden. Arendt concludeert dat het enige mensenrecht dat kan bestaan ¨het recht om rechten te hebben¨ is; het recht om te behoren tot een vorm van een georganiseerde gemeenschap, een plek in de wereld. Het is een middel om te verzekeren dat mensen toegang hebben tot de wereld, noodzakelijk om een waardig menselijk bestaan te kunnen leiden.",

"Framing van Erdoğan in de Nederlandse media

Hoe Erdoğan tussen 2001 en 2016 in de Volkskrant en
de Telegraaf is geframed",N. Verhoef,2017-06-21,['C. Aalberts'],"Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","In 2001 werd de Turkse Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi (AKP) opgericht onder leiding van Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. De partij won in 2002 de parlementsverkiezingen en is ook nu nog steeds de grootste partij, met Erdoğan als de president van Turkije. Toen op 15 juli 2016 de couppoging plaatsvond, steeg de media-aandacht voor Erdoğan in Nederland. Dit kwam onder andere door de zuiveringen die hij na de coup doorvoerde, die ook in Nederland merkbaar waren. Soortgelijke grote gebeurtenissen hebben naar verwachting invloed op hoe er in de media wordt berichtgegeven over de Turkse president. Aangezien de media weer invloed hebben op hoe het publiek over Erdoğan denkt, wat uiteindelijk ook weerslag heeft op de politiek, is er onderzoek gedaan naar hoe er wordt berichtgeven over Erdoğan in Nederlandse kranten.
	De hoofdvraag van het onderzoek luidt als volgt: Hoe wordt Erdoğan in de periode van 2001 tot en met 2016 geframed in de Volkskrant en de Telegraaf? Daarnaast zijn er ook twee deelvragen geformuleerd die ingaan op in hoeverre de frames zijn verandert door de tijd heen en of de frames in de kranten van elkaar verschillen. Om dit te onderzoeken is er een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse uitgevoerd op basis van 78 artikelen. De resultaten van de analyse laten zien dat er vier frames zichtbaar zijn in de berichtgeving over Erdoğan: het populariteits-, machtsbelustheids-, strategie- en islamitische doelenframe. Deze omschrijven hoe Erdoğan zeer populair is bij het volk, hoe hij zijn greep naar macht alsmaar vergroot, hoe hij strategisch te werk gaat binnen de Turkse politiek en hoe hij zijn islamitische plannen zou willen doorvoeren in samenleving.
	Wat betreft de veranderingen door de tijd heen, is er een verschuiving in de toon zichtbaar waarmee de frames tot uiting komen. Voor de frames geldt dat ze naarmate de tijd volgt, de toon steeds negatiever worden, met uitzondering van het populariteitsframe. Daarnaast blijkt dat de Telegraaf iets kritischer is over het islamitische geloof van Erdoğan dan de Volkskrant.","['media', 'journalistiek', 'Erdogan', 'Framing', 'Turkije', 'Nieuwsmedia', 'Inhoudsanalyse']"

In de analyse zijn de Marokkaanse en Turkse vaders (n = 193) en Surinaamse en Antilliaanse vaders (n = 78) samen genomen. Uit de regressie analyses is gebleken dat onder Turkse en Marokkaanse vaders alleen egalitaire genderattitudes een voorspellende factor is voor betrokken vaderschap, terwijl voor Surinaamse en Antilliaanse vaders geen enkele factor voorspellend was. De verschillen in groepskenmerken tussen de verschillende etnische groepen zijn klein gebleken. Naar aanleiding van deze resultaten is het aan te bevelen om in toekomstig onderzoek ook andere factoren mee te nemen in de analyse, aangezien de factoren die in deze scriptie centraal stonden betrokken vaderschap onder Surinaamse en Antilliaanse vaders voorspellen. Voorbeelden van deze factoren zijn kind-, partner en buurtfactoren.","['Betrokken vaderschap', 'determinanten', 'etnische minderheden', 'Nederland']"
Inter-organizational cooperation and organizational innovativeness: Is collaborative community the answer?,"Bloem, D.",2017-06-18,['prof.dr. F Koster'],Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"This explorative study investigates the relationship between inter-organizational cooperation and organizational innovativeness within an explorative study. In this respect, several scholars have argued that the trust-based collaborative community is and appropriate form of cooperation for dealing with complex, knowledge-intensive assets. The notion of trust in capitalism, however, causes theoretical contradictions. This paper tries to overcome these by synthesizing constructs from classical organization theory within a trustful context. Next to this, the trust thesis is tested. In addition, this paper tries to provide answers to the question of how inter-organizational cooperation influences organizational innovativeness by building a comprehensive framework of inter-organizational cooperation. Both the trust thesis and framework are tested by using an experimental vignette design. The results from the multilevel analysis indicate that trust is the most significant dimension within inter-organizational cooperation that positively influences organizational innovativeness. In addition, the results suggest that the more inter-organizational cooperation approaches the collaborative community form, the greater its positive influence on innovativeness. Yet, when the trust dimension is fulfilled, the findings show little difference in terms of innovation outcomes between partnership types. Since this study was merely explorative, more research is needed in order to investigate if, and how, different dimensions of inter-organizational cooperation interact.","['innovation', 'inter-organizational cooperation', 'collaborative community', 'organizational trust', 'vignette studies']"

Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de besneden vrouwen allen een westers perspectief aanhangen en tegen het besnijden van vrouwen zijn. De respondenten zien samenhang tussen vrouwenbesnijdenis en cultuur, maar nu zij in Nederland leven, nemen zij afstand van dit deel van hun cultuur. Zij lijken hierbij hun eigen meningen te vormen. Toch komt dit narratief niet altijd overeen met de handelswijze van besneden vrouwen. De Soedanese gemeenschap in Nederland lijkt dan ook om uitvoeriger aandacht te vragen. Vanuit deze gemeenschap is de druk om vrouwenbesnijdenis doorgang te laten vinden aanwezig. Deze druk komt voornamelijk uit vanuit Soedan. Een deel van deze gemeenschap lijkt inmiddels andere manieren te hebben gevonden om in Nederland wonende vrouwen toch te besnijden ondanks de strafbaarstelling van vrouwenbesnijdenis in Nederland. Een ander opvallend punt is dat de respondenten aangeven dat zij vraagtekens zetten bij de inrichting van de huidige gezondheidszorg in Nederland betreffende vrouwenbesnijdenis.

Leading ambidexterity,"Bree, G. van",2017-06-18,['prof.dr. F Koster'],Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"Health insurers in The Netherlands are becoming more powerful and more demanding towards healthcare organizations. Therefore, healthcare organizations are expected to work as efficient as possible, but also to be constantly innovating (Adler et al., 2003). How these organizations manage to do so, is still unknown. In order to investigate these developments, the concepts of collaboration and organizational ambidexterity were used. So far, it is only known from studies that there is a connection between management and collaboration and between collaboration and ambidexterity, but not how it exactly works out in practice (Adler & Heckscher, 2013; Carmeli & Halevi, 2009; Ghoshal & Bartlett, 1994).	On the basis of a qualitative study at a Dutch hospital, this study examines what managers do to create collaboration within the hospital and how collaboration can lead to organizational ambidexterity on its turn. 	
	However, collaboration and organizational ambidexterity as two static concepts are being challenged by the narratives of the respondents. They describe the concepts more as ongoing processes. For accomplishing organizational ambidexterity, collaboration or collaborative communities have to be created. In order to do so, healthcare organizations need to loosen the interdepartmental boundaries and they need professionals in the lead. A way to do this is by creating dual management within organizations in which professionals and managers collaborate and integrate their knowledge and by creating multidisciplinary teams around patients with a specific medical condition.","['Ambidexterity', 'collaboration', 'collaborative communities', 'management roles', 'Dutch healthcare']"

Tegelijkertijd blijken de Droomstraten voor spanningen en discussies te zorgen bij de initiatiefnemers en overige (oorspronkelijke) buurtbewoners. Opvallend is dat alle initiatiefnemers van de Droomstraten kapitaalkrachtige autochtone bewoners zijn en in een koopwoning wonen. De overige straatbewoners variëren in etniciteit en sociaaleconomische status, en zijn veelal woonachtig in huurwoningen. Beide groepen komen ondanks de Droomstraten nauwelijks met elkaar in contact en lijken in gescheiden werelden te leven. Dit kan mogelijk verklaard worden door verschillen in leefstijlen, hetgeen betekent dat sociale menging, ook in de context van Droomstraten, vooralsnog een utopie is.","['gentrificatie', 'buurtcontact', 'buurtinitiatieven', 'buurtparticipatie', 'sociale mix']"

Er bestaat discussie over de theoretische veronderstelling van Snow, Fjeldstad, Lettl en Miles (2010), dat inter-organisationele samenwerking ontstaat vanuit een behoefte aan kennis en middelen, om te kunnen investeren in R&D, en concurrenten uit de weg te gaan en de resultaten van dit onderzoek bieden meer diepgang. Door een rationeel mechanisme, begrepen vanuit de transactioncost theory van Williamson (1979 & 1981) en resource dependency theory van Pfeffer en Salancik (1978), en een relationeel theoretisch mechanism, begrepen vanuit network theory zoals beschreven in Katz, Lazer, Arrow en Contractor (2004), tegenover elkaar te zetten is niet alleen het ontstaan van inter-organisationele samenwerking verder uitgediept, maar tevens blijkt dat er verschillende behoeften aan kennis en middelen zijn, die zowel positief als negatief gerelateerd zijn aan inter-organisationele samenwerking. In dit onderzoek is slechts deels ondersteuning gevonden voor zowel het rationele als het relationele mechanisme, waardoor er geen duidelijk antwoord op de onderzoeksvraag geformuleerd kan worden. De voornaamste bijdrage van dit onderzoek aan de discussie in de literatuur over het ontstaan van inter-organisationele samenwerking is dat organisaties verschillende aspecten van kennisintensiteit hebben, die zowel positief als negatief kunnen zijn.",

Through qualitative interviews and document analysis three topics related to the research question came forward. (1) Blockchain technology and disruption, (2) blockchain technology and (self-)regulation, and (3) Blockchain technology and challenges. The main message conceived by the respondents was that while the technology is currently being gradually implemented, it is too early to identity how regulating entities are going to react to a widespread implementation of blockchain technology into the financial sector. Some professionals argue that regulating accords are not necessarily going to be changed because of the technology. While others argue that the technology will be implemented into the banking sector with regards to compliance and (self-)regulation without a large change in the actual legislation. The overall argument is that financial professionals’ belief in the influence of blockchain technology can make it influential, however, not in predictable ways. The effects of power and the struggle for control involve a certain amount of unpredictability.","['blockchain technology', 'banking', 'regulation', 'self-regulation']"

This study is aimed at connecting the theoretical concepts of interface and cultural performance in order to analyze interfaces in a structured and detailed manner. To reach this goal a discourse analysis of written and audio-visual material has been conducted. The analysis shows that while in GBBs written interfaces a careful and strict narrative is repeatedly presented that follows a stable script, the staged interface is where the cultural performance of the GBB really come to life. This is interesting, because exactly in this staged interface the performance derailed from the pre-arranged script. It is argued that this changing role of the script, from mediating between to resembling the background representations, is the reason the staged interface by the GBB can be considered a successful cultural performance. For future research it is recommended to take more concepts of the model of cultural performance into consideration to come to a more detailed understanding of interfaces.","['Cultural performance', 'Groningen', 'Induced Earthquakes', 'Interface', 'Public Issue', 'Script', 'Text']"
Privacy in e-government 2.0. The case of Utrecht,"Reedijk, M.",2017-06-18,"['dr. JL Bier', 'dr. JA Holland']",Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"As local e-governments are transitioning towards the model of e-government 2.0, they are increasing their technological capabilities for collecting and analyzing data, making privacy issues become more apparent. Little scientific attention has been given to the privacy complications of e-government 2.0, and it mostly aimed at the benefits of the concept. Document analysis, interviews and participant observations are performed to determine how privacy is managed within Utrecht’s e-government 2.0 design. The analysis shows that two recurring dimensions have played a crucial role in protecting citizens’ privacy: awareness and transparency. Awareness embodies a conscious state of mind, is especially important with respect to the components of framework and data. Since e-governments operate in a digital context, perfect security does not exist. As mistakes are inevitable, the dimension of transparency represents the idea that trust of citizens’ has to be maintained by being open about mistakes. In addition, when e-governments are transparent about which data is collected and for which purpose, privacy concerns among citizens will be reduced. The largest threat to privacy in Utrecht’s e-government 2.0 is (a lack of) information security. Local municipalities, such as Utrecht, have the weakest information security of all government institutions, making them vulnerable to attacks from outside.

Volgens de assimilatietheorie zullen migranten langzamerhand de heersende gebruiksnormen van de samenleving in het vestigingsland overnemen naarmate zij meer in contact komen met deze opvattingen. Er kan echter ook sprake zijn van een botsing tussen culturen waardoor migranten zich juist sterker gaan hechten aan de eigen gebruiken. In het onderzoek werd er een vergelijking gemaakt tussen Poolse migranten in Nederland, Nederlanders en Polen in Polen en de manieren waarop zij hun taken verdeelden, om te analyseren in hoeverre de verdeling van huishoudelijke taken beïnvloed werd door de sociale context. Daarnaast werd er gekeken in hoeverre migratie gerelateerde factoren een invloed hadden op de verdeling van huishoudelijke taken. Aan de hand van multivariate logistische regressieanalyses is er onderzocht wat het verband is tussen de huishoudelijke taakverdeling en de sociale context en tussen de huishoudelijke taakverdeling en migratie gerelateerde factoren.  Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat de sociale context de hoofd verklarende factor is voor de verdeling van huishoudelijke taken. Er werd zowel bewijs voor als bewijs tegen de assimilatietheorie gevonden. Daarnaast werd er één scenario gevonden waarbij Poolse migranten juist de gebruiksnormen van eigen land overstijgen.","['Huishoudelijke taakverdeling', 'migranten', 'sociale context', 'assimilatietheorie']"

Deze partijen geven in de media aan voorvechters te zijn van homo- en vrouwenrechten. Echter toont de literatuur over rechts-populistische partijen aan, dat ze gekenmerkt kunnen worden als männerparteien (Mudde, 2007), waarbij een conservatieve blik op genderissues de norm is (Akkerman, 2015). In dit onderzoek wordt gekeken of dit schijnbare tegengestelde gedrag zich ook voordoet bij de PVV, een Nederlandse rechts-populistische partij. Daartoe wordt onderzocht of er verschil bestaat tussen het woord en de daad van de PVV betreffende genderissues. Via een media-analyse is het woord in kaart gebracht en via een analyse van stemmingen in de Tweede Kamer is de daad in kaart gebracht. Uit deze studie komt naar voren dat de PVV duidelijk is betreffende de meeste genderissues, er bestaat weinig verschil tussen woord en daad. De PVV stemt, voornamelijk met betrekking tot homo- en vrouwenrechten, enkel in met voorstellen wanneer er een koppeling gemaakt kan worden met de Islam. De PVV stelt in de media dat de vrijheid en veiligheid van vrouwen en homo’s in gevaar is door de komst van de Islam. De PVV vindt symbolen van emancipatie, een homozebrapad of genderneutrale toiletten, niet van belang. Dit toont de PVV zowel in woord als in daad. Deze studie sluit aan bij de literatuur die stelt dat rechts-populistische partijen genderissues inzetten als anti-Islam agenda’s.

De internationale verspreiding van de Efficient Market Hypothesis en de rol van insitutionele context,"Birkenhager, M.",2017-06-18,['dr. RMMWE Timans'],Erasmus School of Social and Behavioural Sciences,"First coined by Nobel prize winning financial economist Eugene Fama in 1965, the EMH remains a fundamental theory in financial economics. This study researches the international dissemination of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) using a combination of exploratory and explanatory methods. A temporal and geographical analysis of citations in academic publications of the seminal articles (1965; 1970; 1991) regarding the EMH, following Wojcik, Kreston and McGill (2013), reveals that there is widespread internationalization, but this only took off after the year 2000. It is found that the United States still appears to be a dominant force in the field. Furthermore, supporting the propositions of Fourcade (2009) and institutional theory, institutional context seems to be a structuring factor for economists. Using panel GLS regression analysis, it is found that the institutional context of a country, characterized by the Liberal Market Economy (LME) – Coordinated Market Economy (LME) distinction of Hall and Gingerich (2009) is a significant factor in the international diffusion of the EMH. The EMH, interwoven with the Chicago School’s laissez-faire principles, is more likely to spread to countries characterized by an institutional context that resembles a LME. A convincing longitudinal effect of changes in institutional context on the citation pattern is not found. Further research should evaluate whether this relationship is structurally altered since the development of the internet as the exploratory results seem to suggest.","['Efficient market hypothesis', 'Institutional context', 'Citation analysis', 'E.

Because of this gap prejudices are formed, dividing both groups even further from each other. However, there are some locations where these groups still mingle, one prominent meeting place is in leisure associations. Allport’s (1954) intergroup contact theory states that when four factors are in place, prejudices between groups can be reduced. These four factors are, 1. The feeling of equal status, 2. Shared goals, 3. Common effort and, 4. Support by the authority. This research will test Allport’s (1954) theory in the setting of a meditation association, where individuals from different high and low educated groups come together to meditate. Theory about the activity meditation states that it also reduces prejudices, making this setting a testing ground for two prejudice reducing factors. This research shows that contact between intergroups in meditation associations does indeed reduce prejudices. The contact in these associations is in line with Allport’s (1954) four factors of the intergroup contact theory. Also the activity meditation does reduce prejudices. However it turns out that the activity meditation has a larger effect on the reduction of prejudices in the experience of participants than intergroup contact.","['Highly- and lowly educated', 'intergroup contact theory', 'meditation', 'prejudices']"

Even though the effect of these practices on employee work effort has been researched, little attention has been paid to the effect that individual cultural values held by employees have on the success or failure of the implementation of these HR practices in terms of individual performance. Using data collected from 25 European countries, this study focuses on three broad categories of values, namely openness to change, self-enhancement, and conservation, each inclusionary of a number of values. The results from the regression analyses indicate that only the value of conservation has a positive effect on the relationship between these HR practices and work effort. The effect that HR practices focusing on skills-enhancement have on work effort is moderated to a greater extent by values related to conservation in comparison to HR practices related to autonomy. The value of openness to change is found to have a negative effect on the relationship between these practices that are related to autonomy, while the value of self-enhancement affects negatively the relationship between practices related to skills-enhancement and work effort.","['Autonomy', 'cultural values', 'high-performance human resource practices', 'skills-enhancement', 'work effort']"

Het resultaat uit het kwalitatieve deel biedt hier een mogelijke verklaring voor; uit gesprekken is gebleken dat het gebrek aan functionele verbinding tussen de organisatie, de leidinggevende en de werknemer, én de asymmetrische verhoudingen (conflicterende belangen) belemmerend werken. Daarnaast speelt de werkomgeving, die gekenmerkt wordt door een langdurige cultuur van ‘eilandvorming’ en instabiliteit en onrust als gevolg van continue reorganiseren hierbij een rol. De werknemer bevindt zich in een omgeving waar interne mobiliteit niet vanzelfsprekend is. Deze factoren alsmede de wijze van leidinggeven spelen de werknemer parten bij het bewustzijn ten aanzien van interne mobiliteit en de eigen inzetbaarheid. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat de invloed die determinanten, welke bij gewenste interne mobiliteit een rol spelen, op elkaar hebben voor complexiteit kunnen zorgen waar juist een onderlinge balans voor een positief resultaat van belang is.

While creative class initiatives have been subject to much research, this has rarely been done in relation to workfare voluntarism. By means of qualitative research, the experiences of workfare volunteers are investigated based on workfare voluntarism theories of empowerment and employability. The creative class seems to add no particular value to the workfare volunteers’ search for paid work. However, the manufacturing industry appears to be a suitable fit with volunteers’ interests.

Using a Foucaultian inspired discourse analysis following articulations and interpellation, power and practices were scrutinized. The study focussed on imaginaries, infrastructures and identities, which underlie the issue or are produced by it. The analysis shows that the imaginary underlying the issue is risk, theorized from a biopolitical and governmentality perspective. Risk of HPV is rendered calculable and governable, therefor urgent and in need of action. The vaccine as a biopolitical tool, is being applied on the population on an infrastructure of gender, enabling some possibilities while constraining others. Together, risk and gender transform the HPV vaccine into a cervical cancer vaccine, producing gendered at risk identities, vulnerable in the face of HPV and responsible for preventing the virus to enter bodies and circulate in society. While men are put into the black box of the vaccination, they remain at risk. There is a compulsive focus on cervixes, the symbol of reproduction, that must be protected. Images of dominance are being confirmed and reproduced. This case reveals a gendered asymmetry in the governing of bodies.","['vaccination', 'HPV', 'cervical cancer', 'gender', 'risk', 'biopolitics', 'governmentality', 'public issue', 'imaginaries', 'infrastructures', 'identities']"

performing art classified as intangible cultural heritage as perceived by tourists in the cultural
supply of a city. The aim of this cross-sectional case study was to examine the part that fado
has in the total offer of cultural attractions and activities in Lisbon. The main research question
was as such: What is the role of fado concerts in the cultural supply of Lisbon as perceived by
tourists in terms of participation and attached importance? In addition, this research aimed to
discover the role that the tourists’ perception of authenticity has in this. As such, the sub
question read: What is the relationship between perceived authenticity and participation of
tourists on the one hand, and attached importance on the other hand? The research consisted
of a quantitative research, with a survey design. Self-completion questionnaires were employed
to question tourists in four tactical sites in the centre of Lisbon. Previous empirical research
has shown a considerable influence of perceived authenticity on tourists’ behaviour. This
research confirms this influence of perceived authenticity on the importance attached to
attractions and activities as well as on the participation in these. Next to previous research that
finds a positive relationship between the performing arts and tourism, as well as between
intangible cultural heritage and tourism, the intangible, traditional and experiential features of
fado make it seem a potential tourist activity. However, fado does not appear to figure
prominently among Lisbon’s tourists’ behaviour and preferences, despite its high scores on
perceived authenticity.","['Cultural Economics', 'Cultural Entrepreneurship', 'cultural tourism', 'fado', 'performing arts', 'intangible cultural heritage', 'experiential tourism', 'participation', 'tourist preferences', 'tourist behaviour']"

Disability advocacy: towards a legal framework for the inclusion of PWs in complex humanitarian emergency in Nigeria,"Nwanegwo, Daniel",2017-04-28,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study is about the inclusion – or rather non-inclusion till today - of persons with disabilities in the management of complex humanitarian emergencies in Nigeria. The focus is on the key role that can be played by law as an instrument of protection through a legal framework that protects persons with disabilities during natural disasters and in situations of high risk such as armed conflict or civil and religious disturbances. These we call complex humanitarian emergencies in this study (CHEs). People with disabilities (PWDs) tend to be forgotten during planning for emergencies, despite being a special group of persons requiring protection. Sometimes they are simply forgotten or left behind in the crisis. In Nigeria, there is still no legislation or policy that seeks to guarantee the inclusion of PWDs in the management of complex humanitarian emergencies. Despite the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) having been ratified by Nigeria, there is no provision in domestic law to address the plight of PWDs in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters. Yet such provisions are contained in Article 11 of UNCRPD. The problem is that they are not yet domesticated in Nigeria, as required by the Constitution of the country. These provisions are so far non-justiciable therefore, and outside the scope of domestic legal remedies or rights.
Interestingly, no other study has so far been conducted on this subject in Nigeria, and on this gap in legal protection for people with disabilities in times of emergencies. This study uses as its basis secondary sources, and the texts of laws and regulations, especially the legal provisions specifying the responsibilities of NEMA (National Emergency Management Agency), which was established in 1999. Interviews were also conducted with some key decision-makers in the field. On this basis, the study identified a clear ‘gap’ in domestic legal protection. The study then examined the role of civil society, and especially of Disabled People’s Organisations (DPOs) in bringing about pressure on government to provide a legal framework that guarantees inclusion of PWDs in management of CHEs. Some obstacles to realizing this objective are identified, and the consequences of failing to provide legal protection will be highlighted. The hope ultimately is to show that such a legal framework is urgently required in Nigeria.
Through a range of different examples and experiences, insights are sought for advocacy for inclusion of PWDs in all aspects of planning and management for complex humanitarian emergencies. Occasionally, DPOs have advocated in partnerships with international organisations, but the main focus of this study is on domestic actors engaged in Disability Advocacy.","['Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)', 'Disability', 'Complex Humanitarian Emergencies (CHEs)', 'Legal Protection', 'Human Rights-Based Approach', 'Disability Bill', 'Advocacy']"

Prospects of Durable Solutions in Changed Circumstances: The Case of Former Rwandan Refugees in Uganda Post the 2013 Cessation Agreement,"Akugizibwe, Mary",2017-03-31,['Handmaker Jeff'],International Institute of Social Studies,"In 2003, a Tripartite Agreement between Uganda, Rwanda and UNHCR for the voluntary repatriation of Rwandan refugees that had been displaced be-tween 1959 and 1998 was signed. It is upon the success of the programs under this agreement that the Cessation Clause under Article (1) (C) 5 of the 1951 Refugee Convention would be based. On the 30th June 2013, the cessation was declared and consequently protection of all Rwandans within its scope came to an end. Using legal and socio-legal theories, together with the con-cept of social exclusion, this study gives a background to the Cessation Agreement of 2013 on Rwandan refugees in Uganda and evaluates the imple-mentation of its processes conducted through the Tripartite Agreement of 2003. The study reveals the social problems posed to the Rwandan popula-tion in exile in Uganda following the 2013 Cessation Agreement. It shows how these problems stem from ineffective implementation of the Tripartite Agreement. The study concludes that arrangement between the host state, the state of origin and UNHCR to finalise the cessation programs within a very limited time period, by December 2017, will leave a number of former Rwan-dan refugees undocumented and without a solution. If previous conditions that drove them into exile are not resolved, it is hard to envisage any durable solution to their social exclusion and the human rights violations they may face.","['Cessation Clause', 'local integration', 'refugees', 'Rwandans', 'repatriation', 'social exclusion', 'Uganda']"
Representations of humanitarian action in the media at the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War: a discourse analysis (Jan 2009- May 2009),"Kadam, Akshay",2017-03-31,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,The reputation of Humanitarianism in Sri Lanka wavered tumultuously over the last half-century.

Humanitarian in-terventions contributed positively to bring about limited peace between the LTTE and the government in 2002 but failed to sustain that peace. This paper argues that humanitarian action in Sri Lanka in the final stages of the war was ineffective because of its delegitimation in Sri Lankan society and also be-cause humanitarian aid became increasingly politicized in the final stages of the war. This research analyses legitimation strategies and the representation of social actors in the articles using the critical discourse analysis methodology of Theo van Leeuwen. The objective of this research is to answer the ques-tion: How does the social media in Sri Lanka represent the relationship hu-manitarianism has engineered with Sri Lankan society and what purpose is achieved for the authors by legitimizing or delegitimizing humanitarian action in Sri Lanka?,"['Humanitarian', 'Sri Lanka', 'LTTE and Tamils']"

Sterk in Rotterdam: De clubcultuur van Feyenoord tussen 1960-2009 verklaard aan de hand van stedelijke beelden van Rotterdam,Hans Koole,2017-02-03,"['H.B. Harmsen', 'P.T. van de Laar']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Samenvatting MA thesis Sterk in Rotterdam. De clubcultuur van Feyenoord tussen 1960-2009 verklaard aan de hand van stedelijke beelden van Rotterdam

In dit historisch onderzoek staan begrippen als beeldvorming en identiteitsontwikkeling centraal. Enerzijds is onderzocht op welke wijze Rotterdam zich na de oorlog heeft ontwikkeld en welke dominante beelden er tussen 1960 en 2009 bestaan van de stad. Anderzijds is onderzocht welke beelden van Feyenoord tussen 1960 en 2009 de clubcultuur bepalen en op welke wijze deze in verband staan met beelden van Rotterdam. Op welke wijze wordt Feyenoord met Rotterdam geassocieerd en hoe valt dit te verklaren? Welke groepen dichten Feyenoord specifieke beelden van Rotterdam toe en waarom doen zij dit? Op welke wijze heeft 'de ander' Ajax invloed op de manier waarop Feyenoord beelden van Rotterdam krijgt toebedeeld? Hoe groot is het belang van sportieve resultaten wanneer beelden van Rotterdam deel uitmaken van de clubcultuur van Feyenoord? Zijn er mogelijke dwarsverbanden aan te stippen hoe de publieke beeldvorming rond Feyenoord en Rotterdam zich ontwikkelt?
	Feyenoord heeft in onze huidige tijd onmiskenbaar een band met Rotterdam. Het momenteel populaire supporterslied 'Komen wij uit Rotterdam? Ken je dat niet horen dan?! dat regelmatig in De Kuip wordt gezongen, onderstreept bij uitstek de band tussen Feyenoord en haar speelstad. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om de relatie tussen Feyenoord en Rotterdam wetenschappelijk uit te diepen en met een historisch onderzoek aan te tonen op welke wijze Rotterdamse beelden deel uitmaken van de clubcultuur van Feyenoord. Daarnaast is dit onderzoek een poging om een dimensie toe te voegen aan de studies naar voetbalculturen door deze te verklaren aan de hand van stedelijke beelden. 
	In dit onderzoek wordt eerst de identiteitsontwikkeling van het naoorlogse Rotterdam geschetst. Welke beelden krijgt de stad in specifieke periodes toebedeeld en voor welke beelden maakt de stad zich sterk? Dit deel van het onderzoek leunt sterk op de theorieën van de sociologen Manuel Castells en Jerome Hodos op het gebied van globalisering en op welke wijze steden een zingevende identiteit kunnen verlenen aan een samenleving. Daarnaast is het gedachtegoed van de historicus Willem Frijhoff van belang met zijn unieke visie op welke manier Rotterdam begrepen kan worden als een stad met een minderwaardigheidsgevoel.
	Het bronnenonderzoek naar de identiteitsontwikkeling van Feyenoord is gebaseerd op een dagbladen- en clubbladenonderzoek. Dit concentreert zich hoofdzakelijk op voor- en nabeschouwingen van Feyenoord-Ajax. Hiervoor is gekozen om het ten eerste het bronnenonderzoek overzichtelijk te houden. Ten tweede geldt Ajax als de ultieme rivaal en de verwachting is dat ook stedelijke sentimenten een rol spelen om de rivaliteit kracht bij te zetten. Alle bronnen zijn onderzocht op basis van vier onderzoeksvariabelen. Deze variabelen zijn de uitkomst van het eerdere gedeelte waar onderzocht werd welke identiteitsontwikkeling Rotterdam tussen 1960 en 2009 heeft ondergaan. De vier onderzoeksvariabelen zijn: Rotterdam als haven- en werkstad, Rotterdam als moderne stad, Rotterdam wederopbouwstad en Rotterdam als stad met een minderwaardigheidsgevoel. 
	Het wordt met de bronnenanalyse duidelijk dat op het gebied van beeldvorming op de wijze waarop Feyenoord en Rotterdam zich ontwikkelen, haast geen dwarsverbanden zijn aan te stippen. Feyenoord wordt tussen 1960 en 2009 voornamelijk in de onderzochte media geassocieerd met een minderwaardigheidsgevoel en Rotterdam als haven- en werkstad. Een paar zaken zijn hierbij opvallend. De associaties zijn vaak het meest dominant wanneer Feyenoord sportief gezien een goede periode doormaakt, de associaties verwijzen naar de speelstijl het geidealiseerde karakter van de club en de jaren negentig zijn cruciaal. tweeledig karakter hebben. In dat decennium lijkt vooral Feyenoord als symbolische uitdrager van de haven- en werkstad een gestolde identiteit in de media te verkrijgen. Het historisch beeld wordt geschapen dat Feyenoord altijd al in alle facetten de arbeidersclub uitstek was.","['Beeldvorming', 'Fancultuur', 'Feyenoord', 'Identiteit', 'Imago', 'Rotterdam', 'Stadsgeschiedenis', 'Stadsontwikkeling', 'Voetbalcultuur']"
Holocaust Herinneren,Phebe ten Cate,2017-01-23,"['A.J.C. van der Hoeven', 'B.C.M. Kester']","Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication","Abstract
Holocaust Herinneren 2.0

Het cultureel geheugen wordt gedragen door tradities en symbolen, zoals literatuur, herdenkingen en monumenten. Deze georganiseerde vormen van herinneren kenmerken het cultureel geheugen, wat uitdrukking krijgt in narratieven, de verhalen die herinneringen dragen. Hierbij is een synthese waar te nemen tussen het individuele en collectieve niveau van het cultureel geheugen. Middels sociaal-culturele achtergronden kunnen individuele leden van een sociale groep betekenis geven aan de narratieven, en dus aan de herinneringen van een collectiviteit, waardoor het cultureel geheugen gevormd wordt.
Een voorbeeld van een dergelijk cultureel geheugen is het herinneren van de Holocaust in Nederland. Op het sociale netwerk Joods Monument kunnen bezoekers door middel van de Web 2.0-karakteristieken van de website gezamenlijk de Nederlandse Holocaustslachtoffers weer een gezicht geven en herdenken op narratieve wijze. 
Aangezien het herinneren van de Holocaust nog altijd veel aan de orde is in Nederland en de rol van de digitalisering steeds groter wordt in zowel het dagelijks leven als het herinneren, kijkt dit onderzoek naar de constructie van het Nederlandse cultureel geheugen van de Holocaust op het sociale netwerk Joods Monument. Middels een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse zijn 95 berichten van bezoekers geanalyseerd. Hiermee is inzicht verkregen in de constructie van de herinneringen op het sociale netwerk van het digitale monument.
Uit deze analyse is gebleken dat drie dominante thema’s terug te zien zijn in de herinneringen op het sociale netwerk. Het leven voor, tijdens en na de oorlog wordt beschreven door de bezoekers van het Joods Monument om zodoende weer een gezicht te kunnen geven aan de Nederlandse Holocaustslachtoffers. Deze drie thema’s krijgen vorm door drie verschillende wijzen van herinneren. Middels het narratief van het levensverhaal van het slachtoffer, het feitelijke narratief en het herinneren buiten de website om worden persoonlijke ervaringen, verhalen en herinneringen toegevoegd aan het Joods Monument.
Door de nadruk te leggen op de persoonlijke, individuele herinneringen, wordt de collectiviteit van deze herinneringen met betrekking tot de Holocaust beleefd. Deze uitingen van individuele herinneringen over het leven voor, tijdens en na de oorlog, vormen de collectiviteit, waardoor het cultureel geheugen van de Holocaust in Nederland vorm krijgt.","['Cultureel geheugen', 'Sociaal network', 'Narratieven van het levensverhaal van slachtoffers', 'Feitelijke narratieven', 'Herinneren buiten website om']"
Coalition-Building Among Legal and Non-Legal Actors in the Anti-Sweatshop Movement: A New Hybrid?,"Sethia, Shikha",2016-12-16,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Since 2006, three legal cases have been filed in Europe to establish corporate accountability of European retailers for labour violations in South Asia, within their value chains. The garment sector value chain has come under intense scrutiny and public attention since three large-scale industrial tragedies took place within months of each other in South Asia – the Baldia factory fire in Pakistan and the Tazreen Fashions fire and Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh. The political structures created by these events opened up opportunities for new coalitions to emerge within the anti-sweatshop movement to hold TNCs accountable for rights violations in their supplier and subcontracted factories. Legal groups took on a major role in some of these campaigns, joining hands with conventional anti-sweatshop actors and local partners in South Asia, in part to strengthen the legal frameworks for corporate accountability that had thus far allowed violations like these to continue unchecked, within the sector. 
 
The paper attempts to understand the dynamics of coalition building between legal actors and anti-sweatshop campaigns. It does this using a detailed study of the inter- and intra-organisational dynamics within the transnational coalition of actors that came together to hold the German discount retailer, Kik Textilien und Non-Food GmbH accountable for the factory fire in Pakistan. The paper attempts to provide a model for how legal actors can successfully form coalitions with existing anti-sweatshop actors, despite divergent objectives and ideologies. The findings from the case suggest that such coalitions are most effective when legal groups share common discourses with the anti-sweatshop movement, are able to locate the legal strategy being pursued within a larger campaign agenda, and share a common constituency with anti-sweatshop actors. When these conditions are not met, the existence of conflicting agendas and strategies may invite the risk of the campaign failing to achieve its short- or long-term objectives and undermine the movement. The successful inclusion of legal actors within the anti-sweatshop movement, on the other hand, could enable mutually reinforcing hybrid strategies to be employed by campaigns, strengthening the movement.","['Anti-sweatshop', 'law and social movements', 'value chains', 'garments and textiles', 'Trans-national corporations', 'TNCs', 'coalitions', 'Pakistan', 'Germany', 'KiK', 'Ali Enterprises', 'Baldia factory fire', 'Clean Clothes Campaign', 'political opportunity structures', 'collective action frames', 'organisational transformation']"
"Domestic workers and social security:
What must they do to get by?","Bolaños Cámbara, Francisco Alexander",2016-12-16,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This research paper focuses in the analysis of the factors affecting the coverage of social security of domestic workers in the branch of old-age benefits in El Salvador. It analyses barriers of provision as well as barriers in accessing of so-cial security. The research relies on author’s calculations with national surveys and primary information from interviews with domestic workers and stake-holders. The investigation concludes that barriers affects domestic workers in different degrees, according to their particular contexts. Besides, the research paper discusses the ambiguous role of the government in provisioning social security. Regarding this, the paper states that a broad social movement might be helpful to improve labor standards for domestic workers. Finally, the re-search paper holds that the lack of coverage of current domestic workers will create greater pressure on intergenerational arrangements in the context of an aging population.","['Domestic workers', 'domestic service', 'domestic work', 'pension system', 'social security', 'coverage', 'El Salvador']"
"Raising Labour Standards under Pressure:
Analysis of the 2013 Rana Plaza Building Collapse International Advocacy Campaign","Calverley, Laurie Ann Ingibjorg",2016-12-16,['Schiphorst Freek'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Whether it be an Industrial or Natural disaster – it’s an event that receives public attention, mobilizes interest groups, influences agenda setting and creates policy change. As was the case for the April 24, 2013, Rana Plaza garment factory collapse in Savar, Bangladesh, when intense pressure was placed on brands/retailers and the national government by policy communities to enact policy change. Neither the government nor brands could deny the visible example of policy failure or refuse to engage in the agenda setting that occurred in the labour policy domain. The combined pressure of the event and from interest groups, resulted in expedited labour law and structural reform, a shift in the dominate topic of International agendas, and most notably, the first internationally formed, union led, five -year legally binding agreement regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) in a particular country.
This paper will take you through the dynamic aftermath of the Rana Plaza Collapse using Birkland’s theoretical lens on ‘focusing events’. A detailed account of interest group mobilization, post event politics, agenda setting and policy change is then followed by an analysis of the effects of consumer and labour power on private market labour governance. In 2014, Donaghey, Reinecke, Niforou and Lawson (hereafter referred to as Donaghey) developed a conceptual framework on the governance regimes achieved by the intersection of consumption relations and employment/industrial relations. It has yet to be tested, and given that, the theoretical framework is applied and examined through the Rana Plaza case study as a means of testing the framework’s viability to the overall study of global labour governance.","['Rana Plaza', 'Focusing event', 'Interest Group mobilization', 'Consumption relations', 'Employment relations', 'Industrial Relations', 'Global Supply Chain', 'Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Global Labour Governance']"

"Disability Mainstreaming or Away-streaming?
The Case of One Family People and the Girl Power
Programme in Sierra Leone","Frobisher, Emma",2016-12-16,['Okwany Auma'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Despite a strong global and national legal framework to protect their rights on
paper, girls with disabilities in Sierra Leone face social exclusion, limited educational
and economic opportunities and extreme levels of discrimination in all
realms of public life, including within their own families and communities. This
study analyses a case study of disability mainstreaming in the advocacy activities
of a grassroots NGO, One Family People, as part of the international Girl
Power Programme, paying particular attention to the role of framing and the
voice of girls with disabilities on the project’s outcomes in relation to disability.
Despite the obstacles, this organisation included girls with disabilities throughout
the programme, bringing many tangible intended and unintended improvements
to the lives of these girls, including reduced risk of sexual violence,
improved social relationships, heightened self-esteem and better educational
opportunities. As a strategy to advance disability rights in Sierra Leone, however,
the project was less successful, as it did not explicitly challenge the cultural
beliefs or address the systemic structures that sustain the marginalisation of
girls with disabilities in society. The paper calls for a continuation of disability
mainstreaming in ways that celebrate the diversity of those taking part and
foregrounds their voices with the intention to achieve more transformative
outcomes for the rights and wellbeing of girls with disabilities in the future.","['Advocacy', 'children', 'disability', 'frame resonance', 'framing', 'gender', 'girls', 'mainstreaming', 'sensitisation', 'Sierra Leone', 'voice', 'youth', 'young people']"

Restaurants Challenging the Global Food System in Bogota-Colombia,"Enciso Zurita, Camilo Andres",2016-12-16,['Pegler Lee'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper discusses and analyses alternative markets of food as spaces for Social Entrepreneurship in which businesses pursuing social goals could be successful and sustainable in the long term. Alternative markets of food is one of the different ways in which public and private sectors are attempting to address the gap between the countryside and the cities. They are born as a local strategy to counter the negative outcomes and values of globalization through direct relations of producers and consumers. Even though there are good results of some samples of local food systems, experience also question the idealistic view of such developments. Notwithstanding this, there has been less said about how the enterprises that manage to be successful in these alternative markets of food deal with the challenges of compete within the market, while they keep faithful to their social goal.
Drawing on data from restaurants in the region of Bogota-Colombia, it was found that alternative markets of food can give a space for action of Social Entrepreneurs, thus generating social impacts and synergies that involve different stakeholders. The individual motivations and practices of cooks (micro-level) and the networks (meso-level) of this alternative market seem to put before the social value over the economic profit. Following theory on Social Entrepreneurship, these cases of restaurants that rely on alternative markets of food in Bogota are an example of successful entrepreneurial practices with social objectives.","['Food', 'Social Entrepreneurship', 'Networks', 'Social Value', 'Economic Sustainability', 'Cooks', 'Small Farmers', 'Peasants']"
"Aspirations of Higher Education:
Young Afro-Colombians’ Narratives","García Córdoba, Ahyda Cristina",2016-12-16,['Okwany Auma'],International Institute of Social Studies,"For decades, studies in Colombia had shown that young people from ethnic minorities and lower
socioeconomic backgrounds have the worst results in the Saber test, due to the quality of education
they receive in their local schools. This reality puts them in disadvantage when accessing high quality
education at the university level. However, despite these inequalities in the education system, some
manage to access higher education in cities as Bogota and Medellin, as a way to achieve their
aspirations for a “better life”. This research analyzed the educational system regarding its exclusionary
structures through the lens of the narratives and stories of five young Afro-Colombians from Chocó
between 18 and 23 years old, who manage to leave Chocó. These students’ aspirations respond to
habituated aspiration constructed collectively at the local level, driven by the awareness build in the
social imaginary of the necessity to find ways to social mobility through education.","['Afro-Colombians', 'Chóco', 'Race', 'Education', 'higher education', 'affirmative action']"
The accidental Trojan horse : Plea bargaining as an anticorruption tool in Brazil,"Ribeiro, Fausto de Assis",2016-12-16,['Tankha Sunil'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper employs the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) as a model to understand the legislative process that led to the implementation of plea bargaining as an anticorruption tool in Brazil. Through the analysis of primary qualitative data, it assesses the political and social forces that formed a coalition and propelled this legislative process forward, thus allowing the posterior emergence of the largest anticorruption judicial action in the history of Brazil. In doing so, it elucidates the reasons that led a systemically corrupt legislative to enact a remarkably effective anticorruption policy, often to the detriment of lawmakers themselves. This paper’s contribution to the literature about the anticorruption framework in Brazil lies in its critical interpretation of the interplay of political forces involved in the early stages of policy formulation. It adds empirical elements to a modern institutional approach to the study of corruption, which derives from classical theories about the formation of Brazilian society. Finally, the paper serves as an illustration of the difficulties inherent to applying the ACF in dysfunctional contexts, such as those marked by systemic corruption.","['plea bargaining', 'corruption', 'Lava Jato', 'Advocacy Coalition Framework']"
Killings of persons with albinism (PWAs) in Tanzania: Deconstructing dominant cause narratives (2007-2015),"Chaki, Florence Honest",2016-12-16,['Hintjens Helen'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study seeks to identify dominant narratives around the causes of
killings of people with albinism (PWAs) in Tanzania. The main causal narratives
found were around witchcraft and cultural prejudices as causes. These
included the more academic ‘Occult Economy’ approach, not to be confused
with ‘religious economy’, explored later in the study. A second set of dominant
narratives, associated with government and NGOs, sees failures to implement
the law as the main problem. Finally a third set of narratives centres on economic
factors, especially poverty, as the main cause behind the killings. These
are associated mainly with academic studies. Besides media, government, NGO
and academic narratives, the study sought an alternative narrative to explain the
phenomenon of killings of PWAs in Tanzania in a more multi-causal way. This
was found to be what is called the religious economy approach, associated with
the demand and supply narrative of religious goods. This theory is reviewed at
the end of this study. Overall the study aims to unpack some dominant and
less dominant public (media and NGO) and academic narratives. In this way,
we go beyond the common understanding that witchcraft and poverty alone
are responsible for killings of PWAs in Tanzania. The study finds that demand
and supply for supernatural support, even among the educated and wealthy,
implies that killings of PWAs have become what Durkheim calls part of social
reality. The study concludes that the problem of killings of PWAs requires addressing
the uncertainties of people through modern day scientific solution to
their problem in order to demystify decades of supernatural beliefs as well as
partnerships between those with different causal narratives, in government,
media, civil society including religious organisations, academia and PWAs
themselves.","['albino', 'PWAS', 'narratives', 'religion', 'killings', 'witchdoctors', 'witchcraft', 'beliefs', 'economy', 'media', 'academic', 'Tanzania']"

An assessment of tax policy reform and revenue growth in Liberia: 2005 – 2015,"Joss, MacDonald Christian",2016-12-16,['Bergh Sylvia I.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The aftermath of the Liberia civil war witnessed massive reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, this includes significant tax policy reforms as an effort to mobilise resource for infrastructure development. In 2013, the government created the Liberia Revenue Authority as an autonomous agency for assessing, enforcing, and collecting the taxes on behalf of the government as well as the
establishment of Ministry of Finance and Development Planning to formulate fiscal and tax policies to enhance revenue growth. Regardless of all these efforts, there remain serious challenges for the smooth operation of the Revenue Authority. It is against this backdrop that this study assesses the effects of the tax reforms instituted by the government and its impact on revenue growth in Liberia in detail. In particular, to understand the challenges that are hindering the smooth operation of the Liberia Revenue Authority
from collecting legitimate revenue for the state. In order to achieve this, a qualitative methodological approach was adopted to collect data through interviews with the key informants, which includes but not limited to stakeholders from Ministry of Finance and development Planning, Ministry of Commerce, Liberia Revenue Authority, Liberia Maritime Authority, Liberia Institute of Geo – Information Services and National Investment Commission of Liberia. The private sector led by the Liberia Chambers of Commerce
amongst others. The findings of the study revealed that the tax policy still has a significant level of weaknesses and compromises. For a successful fiscal policy reform, there should be an interactive forum between the government and the private sector, especially business people as a means of finding common ground on issues of primary concern. Besides, the revenue code needs to be
precise and definite in its definition of what is obtainable and what is not. It was gathered that if the ambiguity in the revenue code is removed, it will assist in generate sustainable revenue for the country.","['tax policy', 'reform', 'revenue', 'Liberia government']"
Impact of technological innovation on regulatory reforms : Case study of Indian telecom sector,"Aggarwal, Pawan Kumar",2016-12-16,['Tankha Sunil'],International Institute of Social Studies,"During last two decades, Indian Telecom Sector has seen a major transformation from government monopoly regime to competitive environment. Subscriber base has grown manifold and India telecom sector become second largest in the world. All this could be
possible because of evolving positive regulatory environment which helped in increasing the competition and reducing the tariff to enable common people to reap the benefit of mobile service.
Since the start of liberalization process, telecom regulatory regime in India has evolved from restrictive service specific to technology neutral unified access licensing regime. Under this regime, all service providers are allowed to provide both basic as well mobile service without putting any restriction on the choice of technology unlike the initial situation of separate license for separate service and that too with the condition to use a particular technology.
This research paper explores the factors responsible behind this evolution of telecom regulatory regime in India.

Experiences and expectations of interpersonal relationships: Women with impairment in Myanmar,Aye Lei Tun,2016-12-16,['Zarkov Dubravka'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study investigated the lives and hopes of Myanmar women with physical disabilities in interpersonal relationship with family, immediate community, friends and intimate partners, in the context of multiple gender stereotypes and stigmatization of people with physical and other impairments and disabilities. In Myanmar, the experiences and expectations of women with impairment in interpersonal relationship are marked by cultural practices and norms of gender, sexuality and the body, as well as poverty, and weak institutional support and rule of law. Therefore, this research aims to contribute to activities of relevant policies makers and
intervening agencies in order to emphasize the need for actions in support of women with physical impairment, their protection from violence, and promotions of their rights. The study explores the voices of 18 respondents with physical impairment and a number of their family members, people who care for them, people involved in their training and education, and includes perspectives of two organizations tasked with improving the rights women with disability, and providing legal aids. The study has found that dominant norms of gender, sexuality and disability are crucially forming women’s hopes, expectations and experiences. Considered a-sexual and ugly by community, women often doubt that they will have satisfactory intimate and sexual
relationships, and still have very clear idea what is for them ‘true love’ and what kind of relationship with men they want. Protected by the family and considered unable to care for themselves, women also see themselves as week and dependent. Still, while dependency on others is part of their lives, many of them hope for independent life, for education, jobs and families of their own.
At the same time, violence, neglect and harassment are regular part of their lives, be it in the family, in the community or wider society. This research found out that even women deal in many different ways with sufferings and differences in their coping strategies can often be linked to their education and class. Those with more education and economic resources are often more able to pursue violators through courts and legal trials. Those from poor, especially rural families, often have nobody to turn to for help and suffer in silence. Most of the women – regardless of their background - simply take various forms of sexual harassment as normal.","['women with physical impairment', 'gender', 'sexuality', 'the body', 'intimate', 'relationships', 'violence', 'Myanmar']"
The politicization of psychology: the role of psychologists in Indonesia’s detention camps during New Order Era,"Kartika, Dyah Ayu",2016-12-16,['Jayasundara-Smits Shyamika'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The study investigates the rationalities and implications of the use of psychol-ogy in Indonesia’s detention camp during New Order Era. The historical event on 30 September 1965 led to mass arrest and killings of people who accused as communists. The tendency in complying capitalistic development agenda in Suharto regime resulted to long-term incarceration for the prison-ers. Psychology was allegedly involved in this process. The study provides the perspectives of the actors; the government, the ex-prisoners, and the psy-chologists in the attempt to understand the complexity of psychologists’ role in the program.
I applied Foucault’s concept of governmentality to look at how ex-perts’ power/knowledge are critical in the implementation of development practices. The data was obtained through three data collection methods; sec-ondary data, oral history, and interviews. The evidence shows that psycholo-gists involved in the design of indoctrination programs and the development of psycho-tests for the political prisoners which later used as screening tests for particular groups in the society. Their involvement was used to control the prisoners and the population’ mentality; gave a scientific legitimation for government’s action internationally and domestically; and proved the politicization of science in executing the practice of government.","['governmentality', 'role of experts', 'politicization of psychology', 'political prisoners', 'New Order Era', 'Indonesia']"

evidence based critical understanding of urban Bangladeshi women's subjectivities and their experience in negotiating services as they navigate the difficulties around having to undertake MR.
This study contributes to the discussion on gender equality in relation to SRHR as being an empowering, not population control discourse. It also stresses on the importance of ensuring that information about MR is made available widely as a legal procedure that would gradually contribute to eliminating social stigma.

Gender in crisis : Syrian refugee women in the Netherlands,"Alqallih, Rajin",2016-12-16,['Shehada Nahda'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Gender in our lives is like the air. It surrounds us, we breathe it, but we do not necessarily think of it or visualize it. We construct and reconstruct gendered identities and views in our everyday social interactions which change as our circumstances change. Gender identities and roles of Syrians have been influenced in different ways by the current war in Syria. The current war, which commenced in 2011, has left a noticeable impact on the Syrian society and the life of every Syrian; whether women or men, children or adults, inside or outside of Syria. This impact has touched all aspects of life from politics to the bread we eat. Syrian women displaced
outside of Syria have experienced in some way or another changes in their gender identities and roles. This paper will shed light on some of these changes through the experiences of Syrian women mainly living in The Netherlands, where the research in preparation for this paper took place. The research took a form of individual interviews, observation and group discussions. Theoretical concepts of gender, public/private, patriarchy, and intersectionality will be used as tools to analyse the experiences of female Syrian women refugees.","['Syria', 'war', 'gender', 'gender identity', 'gender roles', 'women', 'displacement', 'refugees', 'public/private', 'patriarchy']"
Social representations of ‘childless’ women in Bangladesh,"Khanam, Maksuda",2016-12-16,['Shehada Nahda'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The research paper challenges the marginalization process of ‘childless’ women
in Bangladeshi society. Here, Joan W. Scott’s theoretical approach is
used as major guide to examine the gendered social system that a
‘childless’ woman encounters regarding her reproductive status. Methodologically,
I look at society’s lens – scrutinizing various social and
cultural representations that society made to stigmatize ‘childless’
women in the name of ‘represent’ them. Therefore, to challenge this
stigma-normalization process, I put childless word within quotation
mark before using it to refer women throughout my paper. After analysing
data, the study demonstrates the subjugation of ‘childless’ women
is embedded in society’s pronatalist ideology-essentialization of having
children. This pronatalism puts foremost demand on ‘motherhood’
in patriarchal social structure thus biological ‘role’ became as only ‘role’
for all women to be fit in society. Moreover, motherhood together with
other institutions-health seeking sector, religion and masculinity etc.
exacerbates women’s lives where a ‘non-mother’ woman gets discrediting
identity (e.g. childless, barren, infertile etc.) from society compare
to a ‘mother’ one. Furthermore, both interview and representation
analysis indicate that, ‘childless’ women exercise their agency either
subtle or direct way depending their other attributes, surrounded environment
and worldview. Overall, society historically constitutes a never-

revenues for economic development of the country. In this pursuit, the State

Understanding unsafe abortions among young women in Zimbabwe: A socio-legal study on reproductive rights.,"Hwenjere, Vita G.",2016-12-16,['Handmaker Jeff'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This paper focuses on perceptions, experiences, knowledge and attitudes of young women in Zimbabwe regarding their right to access sexual reproductive health rights (SRHRs). In specific terms, the study narrows down to look at such rights within the context of rising incidences of unsafe abortion practises among young women in Harare, Zimbabwe. The study derives from an explorative qualitative research methodology which combined the use of face-to-face interviews, review of grey literature and material from women organisations and from public health organisations, newspaper articles as well as reports from multi-lateral institutions. The study adopted a sample population of young women and men aged between 18 to 35 years so as to make gendered observations. The paper also involved wide ranging content and interpretive analysis of case laws, statutes, human rights norms and principles from the international, regional and domestic level. In terms of theoretical approach, the study employed the legal consciousness and legal translation analytical approach. The paper found that young women in Zimbabwe faced numerous challenges (legal and non-legal) in seeking sexual reproductive rights (right to safe abortion). As a result, many then ended up engaging in acts and practises of unsafe abortion. This trend persisted aside from the existence of repressive abortion laws in Zimbabwe and the associated unsafe abortion stigma.","['abortion', 'reproductive health right', 'socio-legal', 'legal translation', 'Zimbabwe']"
"Voluntourism as a manifestation of the neoliberalisation of development : A case study of a Chinese short-term international orphanage volunteering program in Phuket, Thailand","Li, Xuewei",2016-12-16,['Bergh Sylvia I.'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Despite the various views on voluntourism around the world (mostly in the West) and potential problems (especially considering orphanage voluntourism) raised by many, the heat around it has never been seriously challenged. Chinese short-term international voluntourism has gained its popularity among Chinese volunteers in the last decade, with orphanage volunteering programs as one of its most demanded type of programs. This research is aimed at understanding what are the underlying dynamics that contribute to the constant demand of Chinese short-term international orphanage volunteering programs through the ways it was portrayed by the main actors involved: Chinese sending organizations, Chinese volunteers, and host communities. Ethnography was adopted in a combination with covert participant observation (in a two-week Chinese orphanage volunteering program in Phuket, Thailand) as the main methodology.
With the observation from the fieldwork, Chinese volunteers from Chinese short-term international orphanage volunteering programs were only one type of the many actors who help to reproduce and participate in the commodification of helping the vulnerable children experience at the care centers. Motivated by or trying to evoke the emotional bond generated from humanitarian imaginary vulnerability of the children, the volunteers, the sending organization, the care center director and the donors presented intimacy (care and love) as the main way to contribute as individual. And by consuming or selling the experience, they each benefited in different ways. The various way to for people to engage in helping experiences, including voluntourism, reflects the essence of the neoliberalisation of development where responsibility of social change is placed on each individual; meanwhile, they help to expand the neoliberalisation of development by transforming new areas into the market.","['Chinese short-term international voluntourism', 'orphanage voluntourism', 'vulnerability', 'commodification', 'neoliberalisation of development', 'Chinese volunteer sending organizations', 'host communities', 'Phuket', 'Thailand', 'ethnography', 'covert studies']"
Tracing gender differences in obtaining access to critical information in Kenya’s Kibera slum: an ethnographic approach,"Goswami, Suchismita",2016-12-16,['Wit Joop de'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Participation remains an important checklist to be followed in any mainstream development. In this research I look into differential access information as a determining factor for participation and claiming “right to the city” by low income slum people. I locate my research in the Kibera slum of Nairobi to explore the nature, need and spaces of information in part of the slum and as to how gender relations play a role in determining access to such information. The research concludes that both men and women have little access to “formal” or government provided information and hence are mostly dependent on informal social networks. In the patriarchal slum community men have more control over and access to these informal networks through social legitimization of (in)equal masculinist patronage norms. My paper suggests that much more attention is needed for public, all pervasive information to all as a key
requisite for inclusive urban planning and low income housing policy keeping in mind existing gender norms and relations.
The analysis advocates for recognising gender differences in obtaining critical information in urban planning.","['informal settlement/slum', 'participation', 'access to information', 'agency', 'patronage', 'urban poverty', 'social network', 'gender', 'Vision 2030']"
In the face of upheaval authoritarian resilience in Jordan and Lebanon during the Arab Spring,"Tabba, Sheriff",2016-12-16,['Knio Karim'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The countries of the Middle East and North Africa have experiencing the impact of the Arab Spring in a multitude of ways. The Regimes in Jordan and Lebanon, despite having witnessed anti-regime popular mobilizations and coping with turmoil of neighbouring countries, are apparently still maintaining control of the two countries. Adding to the complexity is the fact that both Jordan and Lebanon suffer from the same, dire socio-economic and political problems that are found in the countries that did experience an uprising such as Syria and Yemen. This Research paper seeks to analyse and explain the continuation of the relative resilience of the Jordanian and Lebanese regimes. The main argument presented here is that there is a link between a Regime’s behaviour and its composition. Understanding this link is crucial to understand a Regime’s ability to withstand challenges. Through a Neo-Gramscian theoretical framework, this paper’s main finding is the Regimes that are found in Jordan and Lebanon emerged from political and socio-economic circumstances which continue to strengthen them politically and ideologically.","['authoritarian resilience', 'Arab Spring', 'Jordan', 'Lebanon', 'regime', 'hybrid regime', 'Neo-Gramscian theory', 'historic bloc', 'manufacture of consent', 'forms']"
Multiple deprivations: schooling experience of Dalit children in Bangladesh,"Hossain, Mohammad Sajjad",2016-12-16,['Chhachhi Amrita'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Although Bangladesh has made much progress in school enrolment rate, retention
rate and gender parity in both primary and high school, children from different
Dalit communities still lag behind in these aspects. This research addresses
the reasons behind Dalit children’s lack of access to education in
Bangladesh. This paper argues that caste-based social exclusion with its effects
on income, social relations and networks, access to labour market, schooling
experience of Dalit children limit Dalit children access to school.
I have followed a qualitative approach and employed case-study method.
Findings reveal that a combination of different economic, social and cultural
deprivations arise out of their caste and descent based stigmatization and
discriminations exclude them from school. Fixed forms of occupation lead to
income poverty which in turn limits parents’ capacity to spent in their children’s
education. Parental low education level and job status, cultural elements,
unfitting home environment, poor access to basic amenities are factors outside
the school gate that affect Dalit children’s access to education adversely. On
the other hand, humiliation and maltreatment by the peers and discrimination
by teachers in the school environment make Dalit children’s schooling experience
traumatic drops them out. Exclusion of Dalit from labour market also
deeply impacts their access to education and their social integration. Due to
labour market exclusion parents don’t want to invest in their children’s education
as it brings no tangible benefits in return. It also makes Dalit students reluctant
to education. Thus the study finds that a complex interaction of different
social, economic, cultural and physical factors limits the access of Dalit
children to education.","['Dalits', 'caste discrimination', 'education', 'social exclusion', 'Bangladesh']"
Silenced subjectivities & missed representations: Unpacking the gaps of the international child marriage discourse.,"Giaquinta, Belén",2016-12-16,['Heumann Silke'],International Institute of Social Studies,"At a time when “the girl child” is the new favourite investment, beneficiary and
symbol of hope for the development machine, child marriage has become one
of the central issues in the girl agenda. However, the much-celebrated global
campaign against child marriage has come in the form of a monolithic representation
of what this practice constitutes, underpinned by contested notions
of gender, race and age, and colonial notions about girls’ agency, sexuality and
vulnerability. Such understandings in turn condition how child marriage is
framed as a site for development intervention, while obfuscating alternative
realities of this practice that do not fit the dominant discourse. Nonetheless, it
is time to question what is the problem represented to be with child marriage
that has permeated all levels of development policy, scholarship and practice.
In this research, I thus aim to explore how dominant representations of
child marriage structure how the international development community understands,
problematizes and tries to address this practice. I will do so, through an
exploration of discourse using techniques in critical discourse analysis, namely
Carol Bacchi’s WPR approach to policy analysis, contextualized within the
Girls Not Brides Global Partnership to End Child Marriage. In particular, I
draw from secondary data and empirical research that speaks to the nuances of
child marriage to construct my argument. This research is informed by the
works of post-colonial feminist writers and scholars from the new sociology of
childhood, as well as post-development theory. I hope that unpacking the limits
to the dominant child marriage discourse invites development practitioners
and academics to engage more wholly with the contextual specificity of this
practice, and generates greater awareness about the material consequences of
dominant representations.","['child marriage', 'girls not brides', 'discourse', 'girl power', 'representations']"

findings are that Korea’s economic strategy is more likely to drive ODA towards

by Korea’s economic and political strategies rather than recipient nations’ needs.","['Official Development Assistance (ODA', 'Korea', 'aid allocation', 'donor', 'recipient', 'Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA)', 'Economic Development', 'Cooperation Fund (EDCF)']"
Job loss and Aging in the Philippines,"Oberos, Mae Abigail C.",2016-12-16,['Rieger Matthias'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Job loss scars an individual’s employment prospects and this is especially serious as one ages. Staying in the working force is the common survival strategy especially in developing countries. In the Philippines where job losses are prevalent, little is known on the effects of job loss to one’s reemployment likelihood. This research paper tries to estimate job loss effects in ones’ employment prospects and see other factors that mediate this effect using a panel data culled from a nationally representative survey – Labor Force Survey (LFS) 2007-2008. Estimation was done by using random and fixed effects regression models with job loss, demographic and socio economic factors, industry and labor market condition as independent variables. Additionally, this research paper investigates if job loss effects magnifies with age and if gender differences exist. Results showed that job loss causes about 52 to 78 percentage points reduction in one’s employment probability and is higher for women. Workers with secondary educational attainment are found to be more negatively affected by job loss than those with primary education. The large reduction effect of the job loss to employment likelihood is largely driven by the job losses from services sector and lastly, job loss effects increases with age.","['Labor force survey', 'job loss', 'random and fixed effects']"

Undocumented Migration in Transit through
Mexico","Baldenebro Alcalde, Diana Donaji",2016-12-16,['Meskoub Mahmoud'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The Mexican government, based on the feeling of insecurity that prevails
in the country, has created a security discourse in which has based the decision
making process and the creation of policies and programs on migration. While
the speech is based on protecting migrants from insecurity and the risks they
face during their transit through Mexico, its policies are based on national and
border security, without taking into account the human security of migrants
and the networks and migration systems that exist in the country and that
clearly can not be removed so easily.
The following text is an attempt to chronicle the genealogy of the discourse
in the management of migration; a mapping of the process gradually
established through police legal provisions and practices that currently criminalize
transit migration of Central Americans in Mexico.
The national security discourse implemented by the Mexican government
is contested through the actions and networks created by civil society organizations
on a local, national and international level. Shelters and Nongovernmental
organizations work together not only to protect migrants during
their transit through the country, but also to showcase the lack of adequate
public policies from the government to protect them, with a particular criticism
on the national security approach that the government policies are based on, as
well as documenting the insecurities and difficulties that migrants encounter

The Yendi Chieftaincy crisis in Northern Ghana: The voice of the woman matters in the conflict resolution process.,"Abukari, Ridwan",2016-12-16,['Zarkov Dubravka'],International Institute of Social Studies,"This study explores the participation of women in conflict and conflict
resolution of a protracted Chieftaincy crisis in a male-dominated cultural
setting of Dagbon in Northern Ghana. In understanding the major challenges
women encounter in the conflict resolution process, it explores first, what
the women have or have not done in the conflict and the resolution of the
crisis to bring to light the conditions under which the women engage in the
peace process. Second, it looks at how the idea of femininity (and
sometimes masculinity) impact on women’s possibilities to engage in the
peace process. The study reveals issues of gender imbalances in the official
peace process as it is limited to only men. The patriarchal notions of
motherhood and domestic femininity hinders women’s participation in
crucial issues including the peace process. However, women struggled to
engage in the peace process by invoking ideas of strength, as well as
vulnerability and victimhood through the images of motherhood to subvert
these patriarchal barriers in the peace processes of the chieftaincy crisis and
create space for their involvement. The study concludes that believing in the
power of motherhood does not mean agreeing with all patriarchal norms that
perpetuate structural violence against women and bar them from
participating in public matters. The women called on men to tone down their
chauvinistic tendencies to make changes in the traditional set-ups. This will
create, they believed, other avenues to be explored and provide for fresh
ideas to be utilized in the on-going peace process of the conflict, and in
Ghana in general, for a sustainable peace and development.","['chieftaincy crises', 'conflict', 'peace process', 'peace negotiation', 'motherhood', 'gender ambivalence', 'femininity/masculinity', 'women and peace hypothesis', 'patriarchy', 'northern Ghana', 'Dagbon', 'Abudu and Andani family', 'emotional labour', 'patriarchy', 'northern Ghana', 'Dagbon', 'Abudu and Andani family', 'emotional', 'gender essentialism']"

Financial strategies for coping with drought in India: a livelihoods perspective,"Correa, Aneesh",2016-12-16,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Global climate change has wreaked havoc on agriculture. It has altered weather patterns and, thereby, changed the intensity of the monsoon in India. In recent years, India has received insufficient rainfall, resulting in droughts in many parts of the country. As a result, farmers are forced to look for alternative
sources of income outside of agriculture. Those remaining on their farms try to supplement their income with the various government schemes. Together, these serve as coping mechanisms. In order to study the phenomenon in depth we visit some of the poorest districts of India ravaged by continuous droughts
in an area called Bundelkhand. We investigated the financial coping strategies of the mainly small- and medium-holding farmers to the crisis. The strategies were divided into private and public. The former consisted of banks and moneylenders on the one hand and migration on the other. The latter, government
policy interventions, comprised mainly of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and a newly-launched crop insurance scheme of the government. We employ the Livelihoods approach to organise our study. Complex
connections between private and public strategies were traced. Despite the homogeneity of the harsh terrain we found a variety of responses across identical members of the agrarian classes. There is use of both formal and informal lending. The extent of migration varies between groups. The evidence on the employment guarantee scheme is mixed. The crop insurance scheme results are equally varied and some farmers are inquisitive about it. Our broad observation is that decent livelihood options for farmers both on and off the farm are many. They can finally break the chains of traditional dependence on exploitative financial institutions.","['livelihoods', 'drought', 'coping', 'Bundelkhand']"

sections, concerning Ukraine’s pension system and gender circumstances, will contextualize the
empirical analysis. The latter will employ data from life history interviews to demonstrate and
analyze heterogeneity of post-pension ageing experiences. Literature already indicates that
gender plays a significant role in determining ageing experiences, through interaction between
personal factors and cumulative disadvantages. Such preliminary evidence prompted firsthand
research with Ukrainian women. Full analysis of life history interviews led to the conclusion that
ageing experiences of Ukrainian women are strongly connected to their capabilities – the latter
were used to adopt and adapt the new circumstances to continue living the same way.",
The Political Economy of Resistance to Compulsory Land Acquisition in India,"Shah, Amod",2016-12-16,"[""Borras Saturnino 'Jun'""]",International Institute of Social Studies,"Recent resistance to compulsory land acquisition in India has been character-ized by a high degree of variation in the strategies and goals of resistance movements. In proposing an analytical framework for understanding this vari-able nature of resistance to compulsory land acquisition for public purpose projects in India, this paper argues for a more contextual understanding of how the process of land acquisition unfolds across different communities and project types. In particular, variations in four factors – the incorporation of affected communities into projects, their existing relationships to capitalist production relations, public perceptions of the legitimacy of state involvement in land acquisition, and the political influence of affected communities – are useful to understand how communities experience land acquisition and the role played by the state in this process.
Differences in the political character of resistance to land acquisition across communities and project types are closely linked to variations in these interrelated factors. The goals, discourses and strategies of movements oppos-ing compulsory land acquisition for projects like large dams and mines are of-ten qualitatively different from those resisting projects like SEZs. Likewise, there are differences in the nature of resistance by indigenous Adivasi commu-nities and that of relatively more affluent and politically influential peasants.","['Compulsory land acquisition', 'land grabbing', 'resistance', 'India', 'political economy']"

Nabdam District of Ghana","Dittoh, Dorothy",2016-12-16,['Berner Erhard'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Cash transfer programmes which began in the 1990’s in Mexico and Brazil,
have become one of the most popular means through which countries seek
to eradicate poverty. Most countries not only in Latin America but Africa have
as well adopted cash transfer programmes. Cash transfer programmes vary
from country to country but all have one similar aim, which is providing the
extremely poor population with grants to support their households hence lessening
their vulnerability. Ghana, a developing country in Africa has as well
adopted this mode of poverty alleviation. With high rates of poverty in the rural
savannah regions of Ghana, there is however the need to work towards
curbing it. Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) a cash transfer
programme in Ghana, therefore seeks to empower the poor financially by
providing them with grants. In so doing improving the living conditions of the
extremely poor. It as well aims at improving human capital of the poor especially
children. With growing interest on cash transfer programmes this paper
seeks to examine LEAP in the Nabdam district (located in the rural savannah
regions). Using the capabilities approach, asset vulnerability framework and
looking at targeting. The paper attempts to understand how LEAP serving as a
means to curb poverty has influenced the extremely poor as well as using both
quantitative and qualitative data to decipher whether the extremely poor have
actually been targeted. In conclusion of this paper, LEAP has influenced lives
of the extremely poor therefore has lessen their vulnerability but in comparison
to non-beneficiaries the impact is very minimal, also LEAP was unable to target
majority of extremely poor persons in the district. LEAP therefore needs to
improve upon its monitoring system, be more conscious of targeting the most
vulnerable and also consider the feasibility of the long term aim of LEAP.","['Cash transfers', 'Vulnerability', 'Poverty', 'Targeting', 'Nabdam']"

Uganda LGBT migrants see-king asylum in The Netherlands to understand their opportunities,
threats, and challenges comparable to their country of origin.
Six (6) weeks was dedicated to field work at the Ter Apel asylum camp and other
ar-ranged places to meet with willing participants. The study had a total of 15 LGBT respondents
consisting of 9 male and 6 female with age range between 25 to 44 years. 9 respondents
had received positive réponses to their immigration application while 6 others are
awaiting results. Primary data was collected through personal interviews aided by a checklist.
Nussbaum (2003) “capabilities” approach theoretical concept was adapted for the
research in order to identify core human capabilities critical to fulfilling functioning within
the Dutch society and assessing the ove-rall quality of life.
Result shows that all the 15 respondents indicated that compared to Uganda, that
the Netherlands is safer for LGBT persons to seek refuge ,6 university-educated respondents
indicated they would prefer to enroll for further studies in order to better their lives, 8
respondents indicated that employment opportunity/working condition for LGBT persons

The Netherlands clearly has a long way towards achieving a true society of equality be-tween the 
LGBT community and hetero- sexual individuals, regardless of the global image of tolerance and the 
pro-gay law is shown to the world. The immigration application, procedure, assessment and 
interviews at the IND should be flexible and more inclusive wi- thout preferences to LGBT persons 
considered as ‘group at risk’ alone. The Dutch govern- ment can work closely with LGBT community 
leaders and other grassroots organizations in order to combat all shades of discrimination to 
achieve equality under the law for homo- sexuals and heterosexuals who have found some atmosphere

The political economy of the conflict between the farmers and Fulani herdsmen in the contemporary era of climate change in Nigeria,"Okwor, David",2016-12-16,['Borras Jun'],International Institute of Social Studies,"The violent clashes between Fulani herdsmen and sedentary farmers in
Nigeria do not constitute an alien phenomenon in Nigeria; it is a phenomenon that has been in existence for decades which have resulted in the extensive loss of lives and property. The constant clashes have threatened the security of the State, reduced its economic productivity, and deepened food crisis. While there have been several clashes between the Fulani herdsmen and the farming communities for more than two decades, the escalation reached another level in 2014 with the Fulani herdsmen killing 1,229 people in comparison with 63 deaths in 2013. With more than 500 death by July 2016, the conflicts have been commonly credited to Fulani herdsmen expanding from the traditional grazing routes into the agricultural land which in turn always results into conflict over access to pasture. The escalation of the crisis has made many Nigerians and international observers including the United States to consider Fulani herdsmen as the second most dangerous group in Nigeria after Boko-Haram group.
Therefore, there is a need for the critical assessment of the underlying factors responsible for the escalation of conflicts between the Fulani herdsmen and farmers to untangle the various important but conflicting narratives that have
been used in explaining the reason behind the recent escalation of the conflict.
To achieve this, the areas that have witnessed the escalation in conflicts are narrowed down to Berom community in Riyom and Bassa Local Government Area in Plateau state in the middle belt region of the country where qualitative methodology of data collection (interviews and focus group discussions) was carried out to examine the perspectives of the Fulani herdsmen, Berom Farmers,
minority Ethnic groups, NGOs and government institution representatives.
With the help of the analytical framework embedded in theory of access, political economy, and political ecology. The findings of the study reveal that the escalation of the conflict is more of political economy, access and criminality of cattle rustling from on the one hand. On the other hand, climate change, urbanization and population surge plays a significant role in escalating
the conflict. The implication of the findings of this study is that the Nigeria government should look beyond adopting a response strategy that focus much on the narratives of climate change as the escalating factor.","['Fulani herdsmen', 'Berom', 'farmers', 'escalation', 'conflict', 'climate change', 'access', 'political economy']"

A case study of Marondera district in Mashonaland East Province","Nyanguwo, Manuel",2016-12-16,['Visser Oane'],International Institute of Social Studies,"Most economies in Africa depend on the trade of primary resources. This makes land to become one of the most important assets in the continent. In countries where the country has once been under colonial rule like Zimbabwe, land reform is usually imminent in a bid to redress land distribution imbalances created by colonial regime. Zimbabwe undertook land reform in phases since its independence in 1980 with the later phase being termed the Fast Track Land Reform phase of 2000. This study is aimed at studying peasant farmer class, social dynamics and their livelihoods in the context of Zimbabwe.
Case study approaches has been used together with the Sustainable Rural Livelihoods Approaches and the Marxists Class Based theories in the collection and analysis of data. The study focused on the middle class peasants and their influence on other peasants, explaining why there are differences amongst peasant farmer classes. It has been ascertained from the research findings that capital accumulation that builds into assets forms the basis of classification of peasants into different categories. Human capital, social capital, entrepreneurship ability to
diversify are all factors that explain differences and why are some peasants better off than others. The research findings have also indicated that it’s important to different classes of peasants with
different welfare and wealth status for a capitalist mode of production to exist. The research concludes that the peasant model that promotes fast scaling up in peasant accumulation is that
which mixes farm and non-farm income hence the government needs to promote entrepreneurship amongst peasants.","['asset accumulation', 'livelihoods', 'class', 'entrepreneur']"
