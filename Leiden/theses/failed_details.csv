Hoe financiële schaarste cognitieve prestaties beïnvloedt,"Rshaart, Aumaj","['Ruigendijk, H', 'Weiden, A. van der']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Whereas financial scarcity has mostly been measured through objective indicators in the past, more recent research provides implications that subjective indicators might be of value in explaining scarcity effects as well. The current study is a replication of previous research on the effects of financial scarcity on cognitive performance, to examine the role of subjective scarcity. Subjective scarcity is measured through the Personal Inventory of Financial Scarcity (PIFS), objective scarcity through effective household income, and cognitive performance through the Hearts & Flowers (HF) task. Our results, however, do not support relationships between subjective scarcity and cognitive performance, nor between objective scarcity and cognitive performance. This could be accounted to ceiling effects and a lack of control on the HF task, as well as to potential shortcomings in the PIFS as predictor of subjective scarcity. Nonetheless, we deem subjective scarcity as a potential valuable predictor of financial stress, and thus recommend further research on the concept.",

"Pupil Mimicry of Humans, Dogs, and Bonobos","Wesseling, Alex","['Kret, M.', 'Jaasma, L.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Mimicry of subtle facial and bodily cues is an important part of social communication, as it allows for emotional contagion and affective empathy to occur. Mimicry of pupil size has been found to occur between humans during eye-contact. In the current study we investigated whether people also mimic pupil size of bonobos (pan paniscus) and dogs (canis familiaris) as well that of humans. We predicted that humans are able to mimic pupil sizes of bonobos because bonobos are closely related to humans and because they have similar facial musculature and expressions. We also predicted that humans would show pupil mimicry towards stimuli of dogs, because these two species have co-evolved to communicate with each other and are therefore sensitive to social cues of the other species. In addition, this study aims to investigate whether humans display greater mimicry towards dogs or bonobos, and whether dog ownership or affinity with dogs enhanced pupil mimicry in the dog condition. Pupil-size data of 50 human participants was extracted while they were presented with 4-second videos of human, dog, or bonobo eyes with either constricting or dilating pupils. We conclude that pupil mimicry was found in all conditions and thus that humans can mimic pupil sizes of other humans as well as dogs and bonobos. Participants showed overall greater pupil size in the human condition compared to the bonobo condition, but no other pupil size differences were found, nor did we observe differences in pupil mimicry between the species conditions. We did not observe an effect of dog ownership or affinity with dogs on pupil mimicry in the dog condition. Human pupil mimicry of dogs and bonobos was likely facilitated by their close interspecies bond and facial similarity, respectively.",

Digitale prentenboeken op het Smartboard,"Verstegen, Eva","['Dijken, Marianne van']",2016,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek wordt onderzocht of kleuters hun woordenschat vergroten wanneer aan kleuters drie weken lang drie maal per week een digitaal prentenboek op het Smartboard wordt getoond. Er namen vier klassen deel aan het onderzoek (N=58), waarbij drie klassen een interventie kregen toegewezen en waarbij de vierde klas de controleklas was. De interventies die zijn toegepast, zijn digitale prentenboeken met tekst, digitale prentenboeken zonder tekst en digitale prentenboeken met print referencing. Kleuters werden voorafgaand en na de interventie individueel getest op de boekgebonden woordenschatontwikkeling, het foneembewustzijn en op de printkennis. Tijdens de interventiefase werden de kleuters individueel getest op de algemene woordenschat en op de executieve functies. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat het fonemisch bewustzijn en de printkennis geen rol spelen in het vergroten van de woordenschat bij kleuters evenals de executieve functies cognitieve flexibiliteit en inhibitie. De executieve functie geheugen blijkt echter wel een voorspeller voor het vergroten van de woordenschat. Wanneer er per interventie wordt onderzocht of de executieve functies een rol spelen in het vergroten van de woordenschat bij kleuters, blijkt alleen cognitieve flexibiliteit bij de print referencing interventie een eenzijdige voorspeller te zijn voor het vergroten van de woordenschat. De andere executieve functies bij de print referencing interventie en de executieve functies bij de twee andere interventies leveren geen bijdrage aan het vergroten van de woordenschat bij kleuters. Tevens toont dit onderzoek aan dat kleuters hun woordenschat vergroten na het zien van een digitaal prentenboek op het Smartboard. Het soort digitale prentenboek speelt geen rol. Deze bevinding bevestigt het belang van het inzetten van interventies om de woordenschat van kleuters te vergroten.","['Digitale', 'prentenboeken', 'smartboard', 'kleuters', 'lezen', 'woordenschat', 'executieve functies', 'printkennis', 'fonemisch bewustzijn']"

De mediërende rol van Executieve Functies van kinderen in de relatie tussen opleidingsniveau van ouders en vloeibare intelligentie van kinderen,"Kratina, Nina","['Brandenburg-Goddard, Marcia']",2015,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze studie is onderzocht of Executieve Functies (EF) van kinderen mogelijk invloed uitoefenen op de relatie tussen het opleidingsniveau van ouders en de vloeibare intelligentie van kinderen. Als eerste werd onderzocht of er een relatie bestaat tussen ouderlijk opleidingsniveau en kinderlijke vloeibare intelligentie. Vloeibare intelligentie heeft te maken met redeneren en problemen oplossen in nieuwe situaties. Ten tweede werd onderzocht of ouderlijk opleidingsniveau en kinderlijke EF gerelateerd zijn. EF zijn een samenstelling van processen die controle uitoefenen op iemands cognitie en gedrag. Tot slot werd er gekeken of de relatie tussen ouderlijk opleidingsniveau en kinderlijke vloeibare intelligentie gemediëerd wordt door EF van kinderen. De steekproef bestond uit 23 scholieren van VMBO-niveau met een leeftijd van 12 tot en met 16 jaar. Vloeibare intelligentie werd gemeten door de Catell Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFT-20 R). EF werden gemeten door de Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - K (BRIEF-K). De ouders dienden hun opleidingsniveau aan te geven middels een demografische vragenlijst. Er werden geen significante verschillen gevonden in de relatie tussen het ouderlijk opleidingsniveau en kinderlijke vloeibare intelligentie noch in de relatie tussen het ouderlijk opleidingsniveau en kinderlijke EF. Ook bleken EF de relatie tussen het ouderlijk opleidingsniveau en kinderlijke vloeibare intelligentie niet te mediëren. Deze bevindingen hebben waarschijnlijk te maken met de beperkingen van de steekproef en instrumentatie. In vervolgonderzoek moet rekening gehouden met een representatieve steekproef met een voldoende omvang. Ook kunnen in vervolgonderzoeken verschillende soorten instrumenten, afkomstig van verschillende bronnen, worden gebruikt om een construct te meten.","['Executieve functies', 'vloeibare intelligentie', 'opleidingsniveau van ouders']"

The Role of the Military in Political Transitions. Egypt: a Case Study,"Meijer, R.T.","['Spirova, M.S.', 'Tromble, R.K.']",2014,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Militaries have played significant roles in the transition from authoritarian regimes to more democratic political systems. Most of these transitions took place during the seventies and eighties in South Europe and Latin America. They often started with cracks within the ruling party, which ultimately led to a gradual transition towards the installation of another regime and in most cases to some form of democratization. Based on those empirical examples a few key indicators predicting the behaviour of a military in transitions can be distinguished. An institutionalised military, which is not directly involved in the administration apparatus and which position has been backed by a legal framework have been found willing to shape the transition period to a more democratic system. During the transition the civilian authorities should guarantee the military certain prerogatives in order to keep it satisfied. An end of the transition period is reached when an effective and strong civilian government is installed which is able to execute civilian oversight over the military. The recent popular uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East were not gradual and caused an abrupt regime change in several Arab countries. Only in Egypt the military took a leading role in the transition. This thesis shows that also in the case of Egypt the nature of the military as an institutionalized military, not directly involved in the day to day governing, made it very resistant to any form of democratization. In the three proposed constitutions since the 25 January revolution the military has demanded and granted itself extensive prerogatives and annulled any form of civilian oversight. This will make it very difficult for any future civilian leader to execute civilian oversight over the Egyptian military.","['Political Transition', 'Political Military', 'Authoritarian Regime', 'Authoritarianism', 'Military', 'Popular Uprising', 'Democratization', 'Civil-Military Relations', 'Arab Spring', 'Egypt', 'the Military in Politics']"

Tegen de voorspellingen van John Mearsheimer in bleef de NAVO bestaan. Daarnaast is de ontwikkeling van een Europees defensiebeleid grotendeels achtergebleven. In dit artikel wordt een antwoord gegeven op de vraag waardoor kleine Europese landen na de Koude Oorlog op defensiegebied meer bleven samenwerken met de Verenigde Staten dan met de Europese Unie. Vanuit vier theorieën, het neorealisme, het neoliberaal institutionalisme, het neo-functionalisme en het transactionalisme, werden hypotheses opgesteld om de voortzetting van de defensiesamenwerking te verklaren. Deze theoretische verklaringen zouden in specifieke observaties moeten worden weerspiegeld. Aan de hand van secundaire data werden de in de hypotheses voorspelde omstandigheden getoetst aan de werkelijkheid, om te kunnen beoordelen welke theorie de beste verklaring biedt voor het aangaan van defensiesamenwerking door kleine landen. Van de vier theorieën bleek de neorealistische voorspelling dat defensiesamenwerking wordt aangegaan met de hegemoon, het meest overeen te komen met de werkelijkheid.","['Defensiesamenwerking', 'Kleine landen', 'Neorealisme', 'Neoliberaal institutionalisme', 'Neo-functionalisme', 'Transactionalisme']"
The Impact of Counter-Terrorism Measures on Muslims,"Datau, D.","['Ragazzi, F.P.S.M.', 'Zwart, F. de']",2014,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis, I will argue that counter-terrorism measures are part of a differentiated and selective focus on migrants of ‘Muslim origin’. The securitization of the Islam in Europe has led to an increasing trend in illiberal practices that destabilizes the importance of humans rights in contemporary liberal regimes under the guise of the ‘War on Terror’. I will begin with a literature review about the impact of counter-terrorism measures on Muslims and the lack of attention in the Netherlands concerning this topic. I will apply a Critical Security Studies approach, based on the theory of International Political Sociology. Thus, I will investigate the impact of bureaucratic routines and practices of security actors on the Muslim population in the Netherlands. Instead of assessing the impact of counter-terrorism measures from a state-security apparatus perspective, I will assess the impact of counter-terrorism measures from a community perspective by interviewing Muslims and gathering insights from the relevant security actors. The conclusion will be that there has not yet been any critical research about the impact of counter-terrorism measures on the Muslim population in the Netherlands. Nonetheless, Muslims experience direct and indirect consequences from the accommodating configurations of context for counter-terrorism measures. Their main concern is the decline of equal treatment in society because they have stigmatized as being part of a group of people that lack ‘moral’ citizenship and are therefore responsibilized through repressive measures. This thesis hopes to spark an academic interest and a careful reconsideration by policymakers of the drawbacks of far reaching preventive security measures and the corresponding configuration of contexts for differentiated and selective counter-terrorism measures on Muslims in the Netherlands","['CRITICAL SECURITY STUDIES', 'COUNTER-TERRORISM', 'SECURITIZATION', 'INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY', 'BUREAUCRATIC ROUTINES', 'ILLIBERAL PRACTICES', 'IMPACT', 'MUSLIMS']"

The thesis will discuss which benefits citizens are getting when they opt to political participation over social network sites, specifically Facebook. In order to answer this question so a survey was conducted, which examined the relationship between political participation on Facebook and three topics factors. The first was resources for political participation that citizens use or need to sacrifice if they want to engage with politics. The second was the sense of internal and external political efficacy, with which citizen estimate their ability to understand and discuss politics, along with the openesss of the political system for new idea. The third and last one was, self presentation of political impressions, how individuals presesnt their political identity to their peers. The survey found that Facebook does not overwhelmingly reduce costs of participation, and that citizens who engage in politics on Facebook would not necessarily assume that their activities would bring change in policy. However, citizens who do carry on political participation on Facebook may expect a high sense of internal political efficacy and would use Facebook not so much for changing government policy, but as a mobilizing tool, and as a stage for one’s display of an idealized political impression.","['Facebook', 'Israel', 'Political Participation', 'Goffman', 'Efficacy']"

When the Global Affects the Local: From the International Community's Implication in the Pan-Amazon Region to the Indigenous People's Recognition in Brazil,"Davila, Lucie","['Fernandez Rodriguez R.', 'Alves E.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Amazon region has become increasingly important at the global level throughout the decades with the growing concern for climate change and environmental protection. This concern adds to the interests that already attracted foreign countries such as the United States and European states for extractivist reasons, to exploit the rich number of resources it provides. The presence of international multinationals, NGOs, and initiatives, can influence in different ways the local communities, especially the marginalized indigenous communities living in the region, as they represent the main inhabitants of the Amazon. This study aims to show how certain environmental international initiatives taking place in the Amazon region of Brazil contribute to being a catalyst to enhance indigenous people’s voices, self-determination, recognition and cultural integration within the country. To do so, many strategies and specific elements are considered, and different case studies or examples can help illustrate them. The analysis of two interviews I conducted with Fernanda Bortolotto and Juan Manuel Crespo, directly related to environmental international initiatives in the Amazon region, as well as the examination of interviews and talks by a scholar in the field and by indigenous member Nixiwaka Yanawana were the main inquiry of my research. By contrasting them with each other and with different additions from academic literature, the research has demonstrated that the presence and the effects of environmental initiatives between the 1990s and 2018 in the Amazon region have evolved to be concrete triggers of autonomy, self-determination and recognition for the indigenous communities. This research helps counteract the vision of exterior actors being exclusively a threat for indigenous communities, by looking at how they can contribute, making sense of the positive influence they can have",['Indigenous struggles - Amazon - Brazil - Environmental issues - International implication - Self-determination']

Dit onderzoek betoogt dat er tussen de idealen van de Maatschappij van Weldadigheid en de oprichter Johannes van den Bosch betreffende de opvoeding van kinderen en de uiteindelijke uitvoering van de plannen in de Drentse koloniën grote verschillen bestonden. Er wordt ingegaan op de ontwikkelingen in de vroege negentiende eeuw rondom de kijk op (de opvoeding van) kinderen en de opkomst van de acting elite. Daarnaast wordt er aandacht besteed aan de ontstaansgeschiedenis en organisatie van de Maatschappij van Weldadigheid. Verder worden de idealen van Johannes van den Bosch en de Maatschappij van Weldadigheid rondom de plaatsing en opvoeding van kinderen in de koloniën bestudeerd en vervolgens tegenover de praktijk in de koloniën geplaatst. Door de positie van kinderen in de Drentse koloniën te behandelen, wordt een poging gedaan om de rol van de Maatschappij van Weldadigheid binnen de acting elite verder te duiden en hiermee een aanzet gegeven tot een verdere bestudering van de Maatschappij en haar koloniën binnen dit kader.

Delinquent Subcultures and the Social Construction of Legitimacy: Why huachicoleo has become the new public priority in Mexico,"Fiedler, Lea","['Rodriguez Idarraga, Nicolas']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Illegal oil theft, also referred to as “huachicoleo”, constitutes one of the major policy issues today in Mexico. Although organized crime shapes the contemporary political landscape of the country, political science academia has largely failed to research crime and its impact on the state. This thesis particularly investigates the phenomenon of huachicoleo in Mexico and why it has become the new public priority. It draws upon academic contributions from cultural studies, criminology, sociology and political science to provide an alternative narrative about the conflict in Mexico. The thesis proposes that huachicoleo erodes the legitimacy of the Mexican state and poses a threat to the government as such. It emphasizes the agency of non-humans, i.e. the cultural power of oil and the symbolic value of the state-owned oil company PEMEX. Moreover, the thesis looks into the huachicolero subculture, which has developed around the activity of illegal oil theft and shares similarities with narcoculture. It demonstrates how “huachicultura” challenges the state’s legitimacy through its cultural artifacts and actively takes part in the on-going process of the social construction of legitimacy in Mexico. These findings suggest for future research to acknowledge the importance of material objects and non-human entities in conflict situations and how those engage with the human entity as a network of agency.","['huachicoleo', 'oil theft', 'PEMEX', 'Mexico', 'legitimacy', 'organized crime', 'subcultures', 'ANT', 'artifacts']"

Towards A Successful High Technology Industry: The Case of Israel,"Taytelbaum, Naftali","['Englert, Sai P.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Israel's High Technology industry makes for an interesting case study as it has become one of the most successful High Technology industries worldwide. Gaining independence in 1948, Israel started out as a developing country under a socialist government with an agriculturally based economy. Currently Israel is a prosperous country with a market-based economy, famous for its export of High Technology products and services. Analysis of factors contributing to the emergence of the successful High Technology industry in Israel reveal that a multitude of factors were of importance to this process, of which several are unique to the Israeli case. Universities, the Israeli military and the migration of scientists and engineers from the former USSR provided entrepreneurs, knowledge, and skilled labor crucial to the development of the High Technology industry. Governmental support programs in the form of R&D grants and the Technology Business Incubator program encouraged the development of New Technology Based Firms through the provision of capital and services. Governmental programs aimed at attracting Venture Capital into Israel successfully established a basis of a Venture Capital industry in Israel, allowing for increased investments in Israeli New Technology Based Firms and professional guidance provided by venture capitalists. Combined, these factors contributed to the emergence of the Israeli High Technology industry.","['High Technology', 'Entrepreneurship', 'R&D support programs', 'Technology Business Incubators', 'Venture Capital', 'New Technology Based Firms']"
High-Proficiency Second Language Actors: A sociophonetic analysis of Michiel Huisman’s L2 American English accent.,"Meer, Djayla van der","['Smakman, Dick']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research in the field of high-proficiency in L2 speakers most commonly focuses on the age of acquisition and the corresponding critical period hypothesis. More current research tends to focus on the high-proficiency L2 speaker’s sentence structure or syntax, and their influence on comprehensibility. In this case study, a high-proficiency L2 speaker was phonetically analyzed to describe his L2 accent choices successfully and find possible deviations in his General American accent, according to listeners. 17 American born listeners were recruited to mark deviations based on an 8-minute long audio-clip containing high-proficiency L2 sentence fragments. This audio file was accompanied by a script (appendix 1), which allowed the listeners to highlight deviations, accentedness, or foreignness. The same materials were also presented to an expert listener who would be able to shed more light on the speaker’s possible deviations. Results suggested that the speaker indeed still exhibited some slight deviations according to the listeners. Elements of foreignness were found in in the /g, /l/, /t/, /ɾ/, /ɹ/, /æ/, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, and /ɑ/ sound, and the word ‘campfire’ was most commonly marked as deviating according to the listeners.","['high-proficiency', 'language proficiency', 'aptitude', 'phonology', 'sociolinguistics', 'native speaker judgment', 'Hollywood speech norms', 'language acquirement', 'accent variables', 'General American pronunciation norms']"

It contributes something new to a history of scientific literature on both the topic and area by examining these morphemes in a comparative typological study. Trends in the way these morphemes are reflected gives insight into the historical developments of CMP languages, genealogical relationships in the area alongside a better understanding of how these morphemes function within each individual language by comparing it with the larger context of the area. This thesis compared ten individual languages alongside wordlist data from the languages of the Babar archipelago to determine the functions of *ma- and *ka- reflexes and discover notable trends. The languages discussed are Rotinese, Uab Meto, Amarasi, Tetun Terik, Tetun Dili, Letinese, Luang, Kisar, Selaru and Dobel. It found three common functions: (1) either morpheme forming predicates or equative clauses, (2) either morpheme deriving adjectives from another word class, and (3) *ma- forming a relativising pronoun maka, prefix mak-, or circumfix ma- -k(a) in combination with a definiteness marker -ka.

"Intergenerational language change in a Basque town: Age, gender, and attitude correlates of variation in Low Vowel Assimilation","Garcia-Palomino, Azler","['Smakman, Dick']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Regional Dialect Levelling is a common development in a number of languages whereby supra-local forms are diffused over regionally marked forms (Auer, 1998; Kerswill, 2002; 2003; Kerswill & Williams, 2002). Basque sociolinguists (Unamuno & Aurrekoetxea, 2013; Zuazo, 1998) have also observed levelling patterns in the language, arguably under the influence of the standard. According to Aurrekoetxea (2006, p. 147), one of the features that seems to be undergoing change towards supra-localisation is the cross-dialectally widespread Low Vowel Assimilation (LVA); however, this phenomenon has received little sociolinguistic attention. Therefore, this study aims to gauge the depth of variation of LVA in the Western Basque town of Lezama in order to determine whether claims of levelling can be substantiated. Through an apparent-time study of two generations of Lezamans, the results reported here do not fully support a levelling interpretation of the feature. Gender-specific patterns of use emerge that corroborate observations that “women deviate less than men from linguistic norms when the deviations are overtly proscribed, but more than men when the deviations are not proscribed” (Labov, 2001, p. 367). Furthermore, consistent with recent studies (Elordieta & Romera, in press; Urtzelai Vicente, 2018), attitudes towards the ingroup are established as a determinant of the language trends in Lezama.","['Basque', 'intergenerational change', 'levelling', 'Low Vowel Assimilation', 'language attitudes.']"
The Significance of Discourse Markers: More Than a Speaker's Attitude?,"Ligtenberg, Kars","['Tenbrink, Thora']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Discourse markers can provide various insights into the thought processes of the speaker producing them. For instance, previous research (see Maschler & Shapiro, 2016; Yeh & Huang, 2016; Othman, 2010 for markers of certainty; see Jucker, 1993; Urizar & Samuel, 2014 for markers of uncertainty) has demonstrated how specific discourse markers can reflect an epistemic stance of (un)certainty to the statement made. At the same time, certainty can be related to expertise, including the ability to provide more details in certain scenarios or, alternatively, provide only the most concise correct answer to a question (Tenbrink, 2020). We address the relation between the presence of markers of (un)certainty and the level of detail (granularity) in the linguistic data by qualitatively analysing eight think-aloud protocols collected while participants arranged place names from memory on a blank sheet functioning as a map. Because certain areas were more familiar to the participants than others, this scenario led to ample and varied use of discourse markers of (un)certainty. The transcripts were segmented and analysed based on CODA (Cognitive Discourse Analysis; Tenbrink, 2020) principles by means of systematic annotation, identifying qualitative patterns of linguistic features on the basis of relative frequencies and analysis of specific instances. Discourse markers were annotated based on previous literature, whilst keeping in mind that certain markers of certainty (e.g. ‘right’) can also fulfil a role as merely a ‘filler-word’. The level of detail (granularity) within utterances was measured by operationalising precision of placement descriptions in the think-aloud task, as well as taking into account relevant contextual data, which reflected, for instance, how well and/or why the participants knew a certain place. This linguistic data was consequently cross-referenced with an accuracy score calculated on the basis of a grid map of the area involved as compared to the spatial placements by the participants. Results indicate that discourse markers of uncertainty tend to be employed far more often, which corresponds to our expectations for a complex task with a potential for evaluation (face saving acts; Brown & Garland, 1971; Mirzaei Jegarlooei & Allami, 2018). However, despite the high number of instances where discourse markers were used, statistical analysis revealed no significant correlation between the use of discourse markers (neither of certainty nor of uncertainty) and the accuracy scores of the location placements. On the other hand, granularity level did have a significant negative correlation with accuracy scores in our data set (so; the higher the level of granularity, the lower the accuracy score would be). This would indicate that experts tend to provide concise but correct answers, opening up various pathways for further investigation. It must be noted that the corpus employed for this exploratory study was relatively small (N=8), so these results should only be taken as an indication for potential further research rather than conclusive evidence.","['Discourse Markers', 'certainty', 'uncertainty', 'granularity', 'accuracy', 'CODA']"

How Has Neoliberalism affected Labour and the Social Reproduction of Labour in Egypt?,"Thuis, Joost","['Henderson, Christian']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the effects of neoliberalism on labour and the social reproduction of labour. The thesis provides a literature review of the extensive literature on neoliberalism in general and in Egypt before providing a historical account of neoliberal reforms and their effect on the corporatist bargain between labour and the state. It then proceeds to discuss the effects of neoliberalism on informality, welfare and repression. The thesis argues that on all these fronts workers have been increasingly marginalised and forced to live in substandard conditions. Neoliberalism has caused a spike in informal employment and informal settlements. This informality results in decreased working conditions, wages and housing conditions. Another effect of the neoliberal reforms was the reduction of state provision of welfare. This vacuum was filled by private actors, often those families and individuals who benefitted from the neoliberal reforms in the first place. Labour is now dependent on private actors to provide services, which used to be a right based on citizenship. Harvey characterises neoliberal reforms as accumulation through dispossession. Lastly, the thesis claims that resistance to this dispossession has been effectively repressed through legal obstacles, Sisi-linked media narratives securitising resistance and an increased security apparatus. Overall, workers have suffered the brunt of neoliberal reform to the benefit of a select group of elites, who now attempt to form a coalition with the security forces to maintain stability, prevent another 2011 and maintain their accumulated wealth.","['Neoliberalism', 'Egypt', 'Arab Spring', 'Labour', 'Informality', 'Microfinance', 'Accumulation through dispossession', 'Social reproduction of labour', 'Independent Unions']"
Reluctance of a super power: the role of the US in the scramble for territory in the South China Sea and the Arctic region,"Frederieke, Dijkhuizen","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Territorial disputes have since long been a source of conflict. Still today, economic, political and security interests lead to rising tensions in areas with disputed territories. To date, two of these hot areas are the South China Sea (SCS) and the waters of the Arctic region. In the SCS, Chinese claims and activities stand out. In the past years, China has not only continued its, by the international society regarded unlawful, claims of waters, islands and reefs in the area, it has also started to build islands on which it engages in military activities. Initially, the United States (US) was not keen on getting involved in the numerous disputes over territory and adopted a policy of refusing to comment on or participate in any of the clashes. Lately however, the US has expressed its disapproval of Chinese activities and it has transferred vessels to the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) states to contain the Chinese threat in the area (Yoon, 2015). Free access to the SCS is of high importance to the US, both economically as well as geopolitically (Bouchat, 2014), and it considers the respect for international law a national interest (Landler, 2010; Lajeunesse & Huebert, 2019). In addition to the SCS, the Arctic region too has been the scene of controversy for the states surrounding it (Birdwell, 2016). Due to the effects of climate change, the Arctic is now an area with ample opportunities and potential for the winning of natural resources (Conley & Kraut, 2011). Clearly, high economic and strategic interests are at stake in the changing polar region. The effects of climate change have made the Arctic Circle into a centre of geopolitics and territorial disputes with direct implications for US security. Despite these high stakes, the US has mostly lagged behind on other states. The position of the US in the disputes in these highly strategic areas is noteworthy. It raises the question why the hegemon of this current, unipolar world, does not take on a more active and assertive role. If it wants to maintain its unique position, why does it seem as is if it has been reluctant to address these possible threats to its position?","['US foreign policy', 'Arctic region', 'South China Sea']"
The Everlasting Crossroad - New Russian Agenda in the Western Balkans,"Grbic, Naum","['Skalamera, Morena']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The thesis will demonstrate how Russia strongly needs a successful foreign policy for the Western Balkan region. As this region has both geopolitical and strategic significance, numerous leading powers are battling for their dominance. Thus, Russia will need to prevail and maintain its position per se. In more depth, Russian foreign policy approaches will be analyzed through the case studies of Serbia and Montenegro. Based on that, the research question for this thesis will be: ""How does Russia make use of its foreign policy as an instrument of maintaining its presence in the WB? (The case of Republic of Serbia and Montenegro)."" Firstly, this thesis will include a specific scholarly approach, which was not much outlined in other corresponding literature. Accordingly, the thesis will demonstrate how both Serbia and Montenegro are reacting to Russian foreign policy influences. Along with that, it will be seen in which foreign policy aspects Russia has an advantage over the EU, which is their principal rival in the region. Hence, this structure will avoid a black and white and simplified analysis of foreign policy influences in the Western Balkans. The results of the analysis will explain how Russia mainly channels political, economic, and security leverages to Serbia and Montenegro. Most of these aspects coincide with a realist perspective, which Russia favors in their Western Balkan foreign policy goals. In the end, the thesis will point out the extent of Russian influence in these two states, which differ between each aspect. It will also prove the importance of Russian presence in the Western Balkans and leave more room for new analysis by upcomingscholars.","['The Western Balkans', 'Russia', 'Serbia', 'Montenegro', 'Foreign Policy']"
Bringing Palestine Home: A Transnational History of Turkey’s Radical Left and Palestine (1967-1972),"Cortellari, Andrea","['Yenen, A. Alp']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The 1960 decade was marked in Turkey by the rise of powerful social movements that led the country to the brink of a civil war. Ultranationalist right and radical left elements were confronting each other in an increasingly violent manner, with the former determined to fight Communism by all means necessary, and the latter striving for changing Turkey through a socialist revolution and increasingly looking with a sympathetic eye towards struggles of decolonization and national liberation. It was in this milieu that the Palestinian guerrillas grew to become a part of the revolutionary dreams of Turkey’s left, which was ready to adopt Palestine and to adapt it to its domestic needs. How did the notion of Palestine become so central for the Turkish left? How was Palestine adopted in the Turkish leftist milieu? Why did the radical leftist youth decide to join the Palestinian camps, and to what consequences? This thesis tackles these questions, mapping the connection between Turkey’s leftist movements and the Palestinian liberation struggle in the 1967-1972 period and proposing a contribution to the literature on Turkey's long 1960s through a global and transnational history approach.","['Palestinian Liberation Struggle', 'Turkish Radical Left', 'Transnational History']"
"'Minority consciousness gone mad?' Exclusion, inclusion and self-organisation of disabled LGBTI people in the Dutch and British LGBT+ and disability movements, in the late twentieth century","Littel, Nina","['Baár, Monika']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis gives a comparative account of the history of organising among LGBTI disabled people in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Taking an intersectional approach, this thesis sheds light on the experiences of those who were multiply-identified, and on the isolating impact that groups organised around one singular identity could have. Moreover, beyond addressing homophobia in disabled spaces and ableism in the lesbian and gay subculture, this thesis focuses on how disabled LGBTI people organised themselves as a response to these exclusions. Thus, based on archival and oral sources, this thesis shows how disabled LGBTI people navigated both LGBTI and disabled spheres, and how and why they created or used disabled LGBTI spheres and content. Additionally, this thesis analyses processes of positive identity formation and the use of emancipatory rhetoric in disabled lesbian and gay groups. These developments are discussed in relation to the national contexts these groups existed in, specifically with regards to the broader lesbian and gay movements, and the disability movements. Finally, this thesis takes into account implicit or explicit processes of inclusion and exclusion, with regards to transgender people, people of colour, and people with intellectual disabilities. The creation of implicit or explicit boundaries to group membership worked to create a normative identity within disabled lesbian and gay groups as well. This illustrates the importance of the intersectional approach taken in this thesis, which allows space for those identifying along other axes beyond disability and lesbian and gay subjectivities.","['LGBTI disabled people', 'LGBTI', 'disability', 'British history', 'Dutch history', 'intersectionality', 'identity politics', 'social movement studies', 'inclusion and exclusion', 'queer history']"
Debating online over less meat and other matters of public concern: A pragma-dialectical characterisation and analysis of online large-scale complex public debates,"Dalmaijer, Evi","['Haaften, T. van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"“Eating meat is wrong”. Discussions about the consumption of animal products appear to be dominated by such all-or-nothing statements. As soon as someone says the words ‘meat’ or ‘vegetarian’, each side is sharpened, ready to defend its position against personal attacks by the opponent. While some argue that eating less meat will improve public health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, others consider the consumption of animal products a matter of personal choice. Whichever way you look at it, the issue of meat consumption gives rise to a great deal of disagreement and ongoing debate. The ‘eat less meat’ debate can be defined as a public debate. Public debates are confrontations of different opinions, accessible to a broad group of people, on issues related to a problem that affects many people. The problem somehow requires action and is characterised by a sequence of practical consequences (Walton 2007:217). Such debates shape public attitudes and social norms based on different values (RMO 2011:13). A public debate is thus an exchange of different opinions and a reflection of what is happening in society. The above highlights that public debate covers a broad range of activities. By analysing the term ‘public debate’, this broad range can be clarified somewhat: it is a debate and it is public. That it is a debate means that it is about advancing arguments, but what does it mean that it is public? On the one hand, it indicates that the discussion is held in public: it must be possible for everyone to have access to the arguments put forward and the arguments must therefore be easily disseminated to the citizens. On the other hand, it points out that the debate is a discussion of the public: in the case of democracies, this means that all citizens, who are the public of their elected representatives, must be able to participate in the debate. In a public debate, therefore, not only must the arguments put forward be accessible to everyone, but the debate must also be accessible to everyone in terms of participation. The above points out that public debates take place in the ‘public sphere’: an imaginary community that exists not necessarily in an ‘identifiable space’ but should rather be understood as a place in social life where people can come together to freely identify and discuss social problems and, through that discussion, influence political action (Habermas 1962/1991:176). Under the influence of technological developments, the contemporary public sphere often takes place online. This ‘online public sphere’ is characterised by the coexistence of many different public actors who freely express their opinions: individual citizens, political parties, trade unions, companies, (government) institutions, the mass media, and so on. With the emergence of new media in the last two decades, the way in which discussions about common interests are conducted has changed radically. The new media have given people the means to play an active role in public debates: to protest against policy or to mobilise others and to put topics on the agenda. These developments have transformed public debates such as the ‘eat less meat’ debate into large-scale, complex political and ideological discussions in which opinions are defended and criticised from many different perspectives. This thesis focuses specifically on these large-scale complex public debates that take place in the online public sphere. Because these online large-scale complex public debates have a clear argumentative function, the analysis and evaluation of the discourse can be based on argumentative theories. From a pragma-dialectical perspective on argumentation, a public debate is a clearly distinguishable argumentative activity type: a conventional argumentative practice in which the possibilities for strategic maneuvers are predetermined (Van Eemeren & Garssen 2010:505). The fact that the way in which people participate in public debates has changed and, in particular, that in the kind of debates central to this thesis many different actors become protagonists of argumentatively-relevant moves, leads to challenges when analysing these online large-scale complex public debates from a pragma-dialectical perspective. This is because in dialectical models of argumentation, such as the model used in pragma-dialectics, argumentation is typically theorised as a dyadic exchange between two parties occupying two basic positions (Lewiński & Aakhus 2013:161). The new media, and other changes in public debates, thus pose a challenge for practice and theory on pragma-dialectical argumentation analysis and the reconstruction of argumentative activity types. This calls for an elucidation of the way in which this type of debate can be characterised and analysed in terms of pragma-dialectics. This research thus aims to find out how online large-scale complex public debates can be characterised and analysed in pragma-dialectical terms.","['Pragma-dialectics', 'Public debate', 'Activity type', 'Online large-scale complex public debates', 'Strategic maneuvering']"
De ontwikkeling van een methode voor de analyse van ethostechnieken. Balanceren tussen ego en imago: Thierry Baudet en Jesse Klaver tijdens de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2017,"Keulen, Roos van","['Jong, Jaap de']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"This research has investigated the classical rhetorical concept of ‘ethos’. While the notion of ethos has been recognised and studied since Classical Antiquity, there has been a lack of methodological means to identify and evaluate specific ethos-techniques. In addition, various terminologies have been used interchangeably to describe ‘ethos’, which has led to confusion. This study has addressed both issues by investigating classical and modern notions of ethos. Conclusively, this research has broken down the concept of ethos into the term ‘invented ethos’ (also called ‘persona’) and ‘reputation’ (also called ‘situated ethos’). Accordingly, a new method was developed to determine one’s reputation, identify ethos-techniques in one’s speeches, and evaluate one’s overall ethos. As a means to test this new model, a case study was conducted of two Dutch, relatively young politicians – Thierry Baudet and Jesse Klaver – who, as new party leaders, despite their young age and relative lack of experience, won a significant number of seats for their parties, in the Dutch House of Representatives in the 2017 elections. The corpus consisted of four speeches: two speeches of each politician. The analysis suggested that Baudet scores high when it comes to his expertise, but lower on sympathy and reliability. This can be explained by the fact that, contrary to the classical and modern advice, Baudet is not very modest and uses complex language. Klaver on the other hand, scores high on sympathy, low on reliability, and average on expertise. Looking at the total scores, the theorised ethos-advices were mostly reflected in Klavers’ speeches, who also had the highest reputation score. The analysis further showed that the two politicians maintain similar ethos-aims. They are both portraying themselves as the underdogs: outsiders who are part of the public and who are fighting the political elite. Still, certain unexplored ethos-techniques were employed by both politicians. Most prominently, both make significant use of ‘namedropping’, yet with a different result. Baudet’s namedropping of inter alia literary authors and classical music, seems to be aimed at underlining his expertise, which is also stressed by his use of flowery and grandiloquent language. Contrarily, Klaver seems to employ namedropping of famous (Dutch) persons, in order to put more emphasis on his popularity and likeability, which is also supported by his more conversational tone and his casual look. Nevertheless, Baudet’s and Klaver’s growing ethos and overall popularity suggests that lack of experience of expertise is not that important. Future research is recommended to further assess the effects of self-praising, self-mockery, and namedropping, on one’s ethos.

De ‘ruimte’ van Edo-Japan. Een verhandeling over hoe mensen in de Edo-periode hun omgeving beleefden aan de hand van meisho zue,"Jansen, Ewout","['Smits, Ivo']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie onderzoekt het genre van de 'meisho zue', een type publicatie dat vooral in de Edo-periode (1603-1868) werd gepubliceerd en waarin afbeeldingen van en commentaren op ""beroemde plaatsen"" ('meisho') staan. De vraag die in deze scriptie centraal staat, is wat 'meisho zue' van Akisato Ritō (data onbekend, actief circa 1772-1830) ons kunnen vertellen over hoe mensen in de Edo-periode hun omgeving beleefden. Deze scriptie doet dit op basis van aan de ene kant een bespreking van het werk van Robert Goree over 'meisho zue' en aan de andere kant de overweging in hoeverre het werk van Michel de Certeau aangaande 'touring' versus 'mapping' toepasbaar is op 'meisho zue' van Ritō. Deze scriptie betuigt dat mensen in de Edo-periode afbeeldingen in 'meisho zue' van Ritō beleefden in termen van 'ruimte'. 'Meisho zue' van Ritō legden derhalve de menselijke beleving van het landschap vast. 'Meisho zue' van Ritō functioneerden daardoor niet als 'kaarten' die 'plaats' representeren. Dit is een wezenlijk verschil van moderne kaarten die juist 'plaats' representeren. De oorzaak voor dit verschil ligt hem in het feit dat er bij 'meisho zue' van Ritō sprake is van een streven naar een vroegmodern realisme dat zich uit in precisie, terwijl er bij moderne kaarten sprake is van een streven naar een modern realisme waarbij nauwkeurigheid centraal staat. Deze conclusie betekent dat wij tot een heroverweging moeten komen over hoe de notie van 'kaart' functioneerde in vroegmodern Japan in verhouding tot die van de Moderne Tijd.","['meibutsu', 'mapping', 'touring', 'Akisato Rito', 'gayū', 'cartografie', 'realisme', 'Edo-periode']"

It aims to give a critical examination of the international counter piracy measures with a specific focus on the EU NAVFOR operation Atlanta. Studies suggest that there should be an agreed-on concept of piracy to effectively deter it. The various regulatory agencies have been advocating it; however, it seems that the member states all have their own ways of viewing and dealing with piracy which benefit their own interests. The failed state discourse by Englebert and Tull, explains that African states are often presumed to be failed and that they therefore, need assistance in the state reconstruction processes. Moreover, there is a flawed assumption that Western states have the capacity and the legitimacy to reconstruct the African states. By further investigating this notion, we find that the currently operating EU operation Atlanta displays a perfect example of the failed state discourse in their humanitarian foreign policy measures.","['Piracy', 'Anti-piracy measures', 'Failed state discourse']"

Israeli elite discourse and geopolitical identity in the emerging US-China polarity,"Laster, Tal","['Mohammadbagher, Forough']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Understandings of Israeli geopolitical identity have traditionally revolved around core themes which have only rarely been deeply questioned. This has left other identitarian dimensions, some which have recently emerged, undeservedly unexplored. Literature on the topic largely focuses on Israel’s historic Jewish and Western identity dimensions in within the frames pertaining to Israeli domestic affairs, such as the Mizrahi-Ashkenazi divide, or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This thesis questions these traditional understandings and attempts to reveal other alternatives, by examining the multidimensionality of Israel’s geopolitical identity in the frame of the emerging US-China polarity. The issue of Israel’s geopolitical identity essentially concerns the question of the way Israel perceives itself and its geopolitical positioning in the global system. As constructed geopolitical ‘realities’, these conceptions are oversimplifications of a much more complex reality. By analyzing Israeli elite discourse in the US-China frame, the following dissertation shows how alternative identitarian dimensions have emerged, whilst some traditional dimensions have endured through elite discourse in Israel. The research aims to broaden the discussion surrounding Israel’s geopolitical identity in the 21st century.","['Dissertation', 'elite discourse', 'geopolitical identity', 'Israel', 'United States-China relations']"
What explains the hesitancy of the US involvement in the Syrian War?,"Bulut, mehdi","['Ennis, Crystal']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis analyzes the motives behind the hesitation of the American military interference in Syria to overthrow President Bashar al Assad. It provides a close focus on the role of global and regional actors in Syria. The research question of this paper is: What explains the hesitancy of the US involvement in the Syrian War? The research is focused on the red-line speech of President Obama to intervene in Syria and the following chemical weapon attack in Damascus. This study provides significant insight into the political relations between the US and Syria as well as the Syrian civil war. Many academic pieces of literature have been examined to combine valuable information about the power dynamics in the Middle East and their impact on the Syrian civil war. As a result, it is concluded that there are multiple causes behind the hesitancy of the US military intervention in Syria. These are listed as, the vetoes of Russia and China in the UN Security Council, the concern of non-ending regional war, the economic, political and humanitarian costs of the war, the emergence of the radical groups and the absence of strong secular opposition, the concern of state of chaos after the intervention, minor factors like difficult geography, population and the advanced air defense of Syria","['Syrian civil war', 'proxy wars', 'military intervention', 'US in the middle east', 'balance of power', 'international relations', 'Arab nationalism', 'Arab Spring', 'Jihadism', 'ISIS', 'Obama', 'Chemical Weapons', 'FSA', 'Bashar al Assad', 'Power transition', 'Israel', 'Sectarian']"

The Role of the Conventional Military Land Force Regarding Unconventional War,"Oever, Tom van den","['Duyvesteyn, I.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Unconventional war is the kind of conflict which conventional military forces have been more frequently fighting after the Second World War. Unconventional war is a war between two actors who differ in military strength, resources, firepower and leadership, and, therefore, use different strategies and tactics. This kind of conflict is not new, it originated centuries ago when Hannibal started fighting against Rome with unconventional tactics. In the past, the French also used unconventional tactics during the reign of Napoleon. Ivan-Arreguin Toft compiled a database which shows that unconventional conflicts are rising in frequency. The rate that weaker actors win these conflicts is increasing. From 1800 to 1849, 88,2% of the unconventional conflicts were won by the stronger actor. From 1900 to 1949 the number dropped to 65,1% of the conflicts which were won by the stronger actor. In the last fifty years, it dropped to 48,8% of the conflicts which were won by the stronger actor. Even though strong states possess better military capabilities, have better leadership, more and diverse firepower, more resources, and, above all this, have a more significant, better equipped and better trained military land force, they are losing more than winning these conflicts. The reason for this discrepancy is currently unclear in the academic world. There are multiple academics who write about unconventional war but there is no consensus how or why this trend occurred. The theories about this discrepancy are discussed in the first chapter of this thesis. In this thesis, the focus will be on the United States of America as an example of one of these stronger states.",['unconventional war']
"Women, elderly and children: the application of medicinal food theory.

I studied the representation of healthy and sick menstruating women, pregnant women, elderly, infants and children in ancient medical texts. This research found that dietetics was applied differently based on the condition of the body. The advices given had similar qualities to the body when the body was healthy and seen as well balanced. In contrast, when a healthy body was assumed to be less well balanced the diets employed the theory of ‘opposites cure opposites’. When someone became ill the dietetic advices always focused on curing the patient using the theory of ‘opposites cure opposites’. Most importantly in all treatments countering the diseased state took precedence over rebalancing inherent bodily imbalances. In conclusion, the ideas on different body types found in ancient medical theories were reflected in the application of dietetics. This reflection was more pronounced in advices given to healthy people than in those given to the sick.","['dietetics', 'gender', 'age', 'elderly', 'ancient medical theories']"

Nevertheless, there has been some issues addressed towards the format regarding the political agenda of China in the post-communist region of Europe. The perception about the Chinese presence in Central and Eastern Europe differs to the extent of the angle under which the 16+1 Cooperation is perceived. Both the 16+1 Cooperation and the Chinese presence in Central and Eastern Europe, are studied under two predominant paradigms. Equally, these models constitute opposing perceptions surrounding China, in which China is either presented as a threat or as an opportunity. The EU is mostly concerned about the Chinese hidden political goal behind the 16+1 Cooperation. Chinese stance is mostly established on the premise of economic opportunity for the infrastructural development of the region. The two opposing stances are supplemented with the third one, in which the region itself is either positioned under the threat paradigm (the stance of the EU) or opportunity paradigm (the stance of China). There is no clear answer whether Chinese presence constitutes threat or opportunity. Yet the multiple perspective approach is inevitable in constructing the complexity of the world, interpreting the perceptions about China.","['European Union', 'China', '16+1']"

El archipiélago de Chiloé, un día una región aislada, marginada y subdesarrollada, con bajos niveles de urbanización y orientada hacia la pesca artesanal y la agricultura campesina, es hoy en día uno de los mayores productores de salmón del mundo y uno de los motores más importantes de la economía chilena. El proceso de incorporación al mundo global contemporáneo se ve fuertemente acelerado a partir de la rápida y violenta expansión de la salmonicultura en un contexto neoliberal desde los años 1980, lo que trajo consigo un proceso de modernización que ha generado importantes cambios medioambientales, socioeconómicos, territoriales y políticos. La salmonicultura no es el primer articulador de modernidad en Chiloé, sin embargo, la escala y la velocidad de su inserción en el archipiélago fueron significativamente diferentes. Ha causado un conflicto entre la cultura chilota tradicional y la modernidad. Chiloé posee una identidad única con manifestaciones materiales y espirituales distintas, debido a su aislamiento y su origen indígena. Por lo tanto, Chiloé constituye un interesante caso para analizar en qué medida la pesca industrial de gran escala ha impactado la identidad local.","['Chile', 'Chiloé', 'Neoliberalismo', 'Identidad', 'Sostenibilidad', 'Salmonicultura']"

Scientometric indicators and their exploitation by journal publishers,"Parsuram, Pranay","['Praal, Fleur']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I described the characteristics of the various bibliometric indicators in use today, Moreover, I discussed how these indicators are used as marketing tools by journals, leading to some journals exploiting their inherent properties for their own interests. Overall, while all the bibliometric indicators have their own advantages, the inherent quantitative nature for citation counts allows journals to exploit them. As a result, although journals and researchers should ideally share a symbiotic process in the entire research process, the power is shifted in the favour of the journal. A major reason for this is the publish or perish culture prevalent in research institutions today; this culture has put researchers and even their institutions on the back-foot, as they need journals with high ratings according to the bibliometric indicators more than the journals need their content. Therefore, creating a more balanced relationship between all stakeholders in academic publishing is the need of the hour and this can only be achieved if all parties are committed to working for the welfare of the society as whole. This will only be possible if all stakeholders strive to collaborate to come up with solution that considers the well-being and interests of all involved.","['Scientometric indicators', 'Impact factor', 'Citation count']"

The Paradox of the Pious Economy in Egypt,"Amalia, Raudya","['Ennis, C.A.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2009, it is estimated that the Muslim population in Egypt reached 78,51 million, or 94.6% of Egyptians is Muslim (Scott & Jafari 2010, 6). Islam influence created a unique case for Egypt as a developing country. From the period of the 1950s until 2000s, there have been multiple attempts to apply different economic reforms in Egypt. However, the reforms also affected the concept of Islamic revival in the context of setting the guidelines to practice business. This thesis focuses on the implication of neoliberalism concept, especially in terms of wealth accumulation from the year 1970s. Arguably, neoliberalism also shaped the Islamic practice into the notion of ‘pious neoliberalism’ in Egypt. The phenomenon of ‘pious neoliberalism’ will be analyzed through the emergence of the Islamic Banking and Finance (IBF) and the halal food industry in Egypt and the practicality of it. The research concludes that there is a new phenomenon of Islamization that is distinct from the predecessors by embracing the idea of neoliberalism and capitalism. The research, thus, explores how this new phenomenon of Islamization, shaped by pious neoliberalism, is distinct from the predecessors by embracing the idea of neoliberalism and capitalism.","['Egypt', 'Islam', 'Neoliberalism', 'Capitalism']"

Death in Sumerian Literary Texts: Establishing the Existence of a Literary Tradition on How to Describe Death in the Ur III and Old Babylonian Periods,"Oudheusden, Lisa van","['Dercksen, Jan Gerrit']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Death is a topic that is rarely discussed in Sumerian texts. Few literary texts deal with this topic while some only touch upon it, even though death was, and still is, unavoidable. The literary texts that concern death originate predominantly from the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods (2100 – 1600 BC). The subjects of these texts, the ones that die, are wide-ranging: humans, both kings and non-royal Mesopotamians had to come to terms with their mortality; gods, who, although immortal, were not invincible; and cities, which could ‘die’ by being destroyed and abandoned. Since there was a great variety in subjects dying, the question arises as to whether they were all treated the same in the texts. This forms the first research question: did the scribes follow a literary tradition when describing death? Furthermore, the preserved copies of these texts all date to the period after the transition from the Ur III dynasty to the first dynasty of Isin, and might reflect some of the ideological developments that are characteristic of this transition, such as in the ideology of divine kingship. The second research question addresses the issue of how the texts are related to royal ideology and whether during this post-Ur III period death was consistently described in similar terms or that other, perhaps political, influences are noticeable.","['Sumerian literary texts', 'Ur III', 'Old Babylonian period', 'Death', 'Royal ideology']"

After years of deep-rooted authoritarianism and autocratic rule, citizens of many states in the region took to the streets in attempting to embark on a process that would democratize their nation. Scholars argue over the exact reasons for the uprisings, however, consensus exists over the fact that it stems from political, economic, and social dissatisfaction. The revolts started in Tunisia and set a chain reaction in motion, eventually reaching the shores of Gulf Cooperation Council, an economic and political union comprising of the Arabian Gulf States of Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. Although the kingdoms of the Arabian Gulf are rather similar in their socio-economic and political build-up, the GCC witnessed both minor and major uprisings kind of revolt and the respective nations responded in different manners to its domestic uprisings. This BA thesis seeks to create a detailed analysis of the distinct nature of the uprisings that took place within the borders of the GCC. Most GCC members experienced some sort of public unrest one way or another with Bahrain and Oman witnessing persistent violent street protests. After doing preliminary readings, it has become clear that the GCC-states can be divided into three different groups based on the intensity of the riots as well as the governments’ responses to the demands of its citizens. The first group consists of those countries that witnessed enduring riots resulting in the deaths among its citizens, like Bahrain, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. The second group of nations consists of those which experienced minor protests that did not result in any deaths among protestors. The only country fitting into this group is Kuwait. Lastly, the governments of both Qatar and the United Arab Emirates did not have to deal with domestic uprisings, however, there was some unrest, especially through online activism. Specifically, my research will attempt to disclose the plausibilities behind the distinct levels of intensity of the civil uprisings which took place in these structurally similar kingdoms. The presence of the rentier state undoubtedly plays a crucial role in the lives of GCC citizens as well as in the preamble of the uprisings in the GCC, however, the question regarding the rationale behind citizens’ discontent as well as the intensity of governments’ counteractions remains. The research for this BA thesis aims at assessing sources through means of qualitative research by examining reports, news articles, nevertheless focussing on engaging with the academic literature on the topic. By analyzing these sources, I will be able to draw analogies and comprehend the discrepancies which took place during the Arab Spring’s civil uprisings in the GCC. Moreover, my thesis will evaluate GCC member states’ different sorts of uprisings and their dissimilar responses to the revolts within their own physical and symbolic space. Additionally, the paper discloses the GCC’s revolts and respective reactions without delving into the main causes of the Arab Spring. The paper is structured as follows. The first section will introduce the GCC’s socio-political climate, the concept of the rentier state, and its usefulness to describe the rationale behind the discrepancies between the civil uprisings in each different country. The central part of the thesis will discuss the GCC’s the dissimilarity in the civil uprisings’ intensities as well as the unalike approach governments took regarding their citizens’ demands. The final section will reveal the research’s findings and draw several conclusions. In addition to this, a prediction will be made for the future based on the reactions and concessions made by governments at the time of the uprisings and whether this will prove beneficial in the long-term.","['Middle East', 'Gulf Studies', 'GCC', 'Arab Spring', 'Kuwait', 'Qatar', 'Oman', 'Rentierism', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Bahrain', 'petropolitics', 'rentier state']"

As opposed to the general academic consensus which puts the blame of declining press freedom almost solely with Prime Minister Abe and his nationalistic tendencies this thesis argues and shows by using gatekeeping theory and identifying the Japanese government as gatekeeper and the Japanese media industry as being gated, that while prime minister Abe is a factor, the underlying problem that allows the decline in press freedom are the several ingrained weaknesses in the Japanese broadcasting system that make it so that officials in power and the government can abuse this to in effect maintain a stronghold over the media regardless of ideology or political position. Such weaknesses include the broadcasting law, ownership of broadcast licensing and the use and abuse of Kisha clubs.","['press freedom', 'japan', 'abe shinzo', 'broadcasting', 'broadcast law', 'NHK', 'censorship', 'nationalism', 'journalism']"

Nietzsches kritische verhouding tot het Ego cogito van Descartes,"Voskamp, Yorick","['Uljée, Rozemund']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie is gedreven door een vertwijfeling over de plaats van de filosoof. Steeds meer is namelijk de filosofie door de wetenschap in het nauw gedreven. Kant stond stil bij het onderscheid tussen filosofie en wetenschap. Overduidelijk meet hij de filosofie reeds aan de wetenschap. Hegel streefde ernaar de filosofie van haar verlangen te ontdoen en haar tot wetenschap te maken. Max Planck stelde vast dat ‘alleen wat meetbaar is werkelijk is’. De wetenschapper verhoudt zich als subject tot de objecten. Maar hoe zit het met de filosoof? Verhoudt deze zich ook als subject tot de objecten? Is hij dan niet ook een wetenschapper? Dit is een fundamentele vraag, die aan ieder filosoferen voorafgaat. Ik spits deze vraag in deze scriptie toe op Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 – 1900), op wat er bij hem gebeurt met het subject – om precies te zijn: met het Ego cogito van Descartes, want hier, zo zal blijken, wortelt het subject. Mijn these is: bij de late Nietzsche kan Umwertung gelezen worden als methodische aanwijzing voor een filosofische toegang tot het Ego cogito.","['Descartes', 'Nietzsche', 'Heidegger', 'Ego cogito', 'Nieuwe Tijd', 'Umwertung']"
"Rover, Messias, Vrijheidsstrijder? De rol van Simon bar Giora in de Joodse Oorlog","Smit, Olaf Vincent","['Zangenberg, Jürgen K.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie bespreekt de rol van de opstandsleider Simon bar Giora in de Joodse Oorlog (66-70), als onderdeel van een breder onderzoek naar de strijdmotieven van de Joodse opstandelingen. Hierbij wordt gekeken naar drie factoren en hun respectievelijke belang voor Simon bar Giora: banditisme, streven naar 'vrijheid', en religie (het Jodendom). Op deze manier vormt deze scriptie zowel een aanvulling als kritiek op het werk van Pieter Rodts, die meent dat de Joodse Oorlog grotendeels een machtsstrijd tussen verschillende ‘bandieten’-leiders betrof. De scriptie gebruikt hiervoor de Bellum Judaicum, geschreven door de Joodse historicus Flavius Josephus. Aangezien Josephus een polemische houding inneemt tegenover opstandelingen als Simon bar Giora en doorgaans weinig expliciet is over hun motieven of doeleinden, gebruikt deze scriptie indirecte aanwijzingen in het taalgebruik van Josephus om de motieven van Simon en andere opstandsleiders te reconstrueren. De verschillen tussen de respectievelijke beschrijvingen van de opstandsleiders worden daarbij als bewijs opgevat voor verschillen tussen de strijdmotieven of de retoriek van deze rebellenleiders. Hoewel de feitelijke motieven van Simon bar Giora en andere opstandelingen onduidelijk blijven, wordt wel duidelijk dat politieke en religieuze idealen een belangrijke rol speelden voor de Joodse opstandelingen. De vondsten zijn in principe verenigbaar met de these van Pieter Rodts.","['Joodse Oorlog', 'Simon bar Giora', 'Latrocinum', 'Leistai', 'Flavius Josephus', 'Bellum Judaicum', 'Reverse polemic']"

"Tegenstrijdige belangen? Nederland, de NAHV en de Koloniale Conferentie van Berlijn","Kooij, Anne Debora van","['Wal-Remy, Anne Marieke van der']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Nederland heeft tijdens de “scramble for Africa” geen pogingen gedaan om gebied in Afrika te bemachtigen. Sinds 1871 had zij geen grondgebied op dit continent. Desalniettemin was er wel degelijk Nederlandse aanwezigheid in de vorm van private handelsbedrijven. Nederland was in 1884-85 één van de deelnemers aan de Koloniale Conferentie van Berlijn waarin een poging gedaan werd om afspraken te maken over het Congo-gebied. Een gebied waar een Nederlands bedrijf, de Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels-Vennootschap, een belangrijke handelspositie had. In dit onderzoek staan de ogenschijnlijk tegenstrijdige belangen van enerzijds de Nederlandse handel in Congo en anderzijds de diplomatieke afwegingen van Nederlandse overheid centraal. Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd op basis van correspondentie tussen de minister van Buitenlandse Zaken, de Nederlandse gezant in Berlijn, NAHV-directeur Hendrik Muller, de NAHV en diplomatieke correspondentie tussen de minister en ambassades evenals de officiële notulen waarvan een kopie is opgenomen in het NAHV-archief in het Nationaal Archief in Den Haag. Hoewel de Nederlandse staat geen interesse in het Congogebied toont, moet het wel een afweging maken tussen de wensen van de NAHV voor vrijhandel, tegen diplomatieke belangen in Nederlands-Indië en in Europa. Uit archiefonderzoek blijkt dat bij afwegingen rond diplomatieke standpunten de NAHV en haar wens voor vrijhandel constant meegewogen werd. Tijdens de Conferentie is op de achtergrond een actieve lobby aanwezig voor de erkenning van de door de Belgische Koning Leopold opgerichte Association Internationale du Congo. Het gebrek aan Nederlandse mogelijkheden om actief vrijhandel en daarmee de belangen van de NAHV te behartigen maakt de Nederlandse vertegenwoordiging gevoelig voor de belofte van de AIC om dit wel te doen. De NAHV en haar directeur deden dan ook actief beroep op de minister op de AIC te erkennen. Iets wat tot grote tevredenheid van de NAHV daadwerkelijk gebeurde. Nederland mag dan zelf geen aanspraak gemaakt hebben op Afrika, in haar steun voor de AIC om het eigen handelsbelang veilig te stellen, gaf ze de AIC en Leopold mede de mogelijkheid daar de Congo-Vrijstaat op te richten.","['NAHV', 'Koloniale Conferentie van Berlijn', 'Scramble for Africa', 'Diplomatie', 'Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels-Vennootschap', 'Congo', 'Association internationale du Congo']"

Depicting Humanitarianism - Ethics in visual media on the case of Yemen,"Rüegger, Andreas Michael","['Regilme, S.S.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis looks at how the pre-famine conditions in the Yemen civil war are being portraied through photography in late 2018, early 2019 and, at its core, discusses the lack of systematic, institutionalised ethic regulations in humanitarian photography and its impact on the future of understanding humanitarian tragedies. It explores three different ways of photographic representation that all aim for charity as main purpose: case oriented, illustrative human rights photography (Doctors Without Borders), dehumanising and objectifying tendencies of mass media photography spectacles (New York Times) and the inbetween, using sequential narratives to generate context (United Nations Crisis Relief/UNOCHA). The following discussion explores the use of photography as visual spectacle rather than portraying human beings in a context that grounds them as human beings. This bases in the recent discourses of visual global politics (Bleiker, Hutchinson, Chouliaraki, Robinson, Pruce et al.). At last, it expands the discussion towards modern means of visual media (sequential photography, video, virtual reality, augmented reality, 4d)and explores the vast possibilities of integrating alternative media formats in humanitarian causes as well as its possible dangers that 'do-good' humanism can cause for humanitarian organisations in the long run.","['visual media', 'ethics', 'humanitarian issues', 'yemen', 'photography', 'social media and humanism', 'famine', 'objectification', 'Bleiker', 'andreas', 'Ruegger']"

Previous studies show that, in Peninsular Spanish varieties, the Present Perfect is the well-established form in hodiernal contexts (occurring on the same day as the moment of speech). Moreover, it is shown that the use of this form gradually increases in prehodiernal contexts (occurring before the day of the moment of speech). This gradual development is referred to as the process of grammaticalization, which is traditionally described by successive stages. More recent studies, however, have revised those stages in order to explain in more detail, the change and variation of the Present Perfect. The goal of this study is to provide new data for the assessment of the revised stages. Furthermore, it includes three generational speaker groups to observe a change over time. The overall low frequency (17.8%) of Present Perfect tokens in the hodiernal context shows the necessity of more detailed perspectives to understand the grammaticalization of the Present Perfect.","['Peninsular Spanish', 'Present Perfect', 'Grammaticalization', 'Simple Past']"
Harde Cijfers,"Kramer, Gabe","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Nieuws kan op verschillende manieren worden ingedeeld. Een veelvoorkomende indeling is het verschil tussen hard en zacht nieuws. Bij harde nieuwsonderwerpen kan men denken aan bijvoorbeeld politiek nieuws, een zacht nieuwsonderwerp gaat bijvoorbeeld over Bekende Nederlanders. Bij een groot deel van het nieuws worden cijfers gebruikt, soms kan een journalist daar ook bijna niet omheen, zoals bij economisch nieuws of bij sportuitslagen. Maar van welke artikelen zijn nieuwsconsumenten eerder geneigd te geloven dat wat er geschreven staat klopt? Om dat te beantwoorden richt het onderzoek in deze masterscriptie zich op twee punten: als eerste het effect van een hard nieuwsonderwerp in een nieuwskop op de perceptie van betrouwbaarheid, en als tweede het effect van het gebruik van cijfers in een nieuwskop op de perceptie van betrouwbaarheid. De onderzoeksvragen luiden dan ook: 1. Komen nieuwskoppen met hard nieuws betrouwbaarder over op nieuwsconsumenten dan nieuwskoppen met zacht nieuws? 2. Komen nieuwskoppen met cijfers betrouwbaarder over op nieuwsconsumenten dan nieuwskoppen zonder cijfers? Zoals gezegd kan nieuws worden verdeeld in hard nieuws en zacht nieuws (Lehman-Wilzig en Seletzky, 2010, 37). In welke categorie een nieuwsgenre valt bestaan verschillende theorieën over. Onderzoekers Lehman-Wilzig en Seletzky (2010, 47-48) maken bijvoorbeeld een andere indeling dan onderzoekers van het Reuters Institute, maar over het algemeen zijn onderzoekers het er over eens dat onder andere politiek en economisch nieuws onder hard nieuws vallen, en dat sportnieuws en celebritynieuws onder zacht nieuws vallen. Ook impact van het nieuws en op welke schaal het nieuws zich afspeelt, is het bijvoorbeeld lokaal of globaal, kan van invloed zijn op het indelen van een nieuwsartikel in een categorie. Uit onderzoek van Newman, Fletcher, Levy en Kleis Nielsen (2016) blijkt dat nieuwsconsumenten een voorkeur hebben voor hard nieuws. Er zijn daarbij verschillen tussen jonge en oude consumenten, welke opleiding zij hebben gevolgd en ook verschillen per land. Oudere, hoger opgeleide consumenten hebben een grotere voorkeur voor hard nieuws dan jongeren en lager opgeleiden. In westerse landen is de voorkeur voor hard nieuws groter dan in landen als Japan en Zuid-Korea. In dit onderzoek zijn de nieuwskoppen die aan respondenten zijn voorgelegd verdeeld in de twee categorieën: tien nieuwskoppen met hard nieuws, tien koppen met zacht nieuws. Op basis daarvan kan worden onderzocht of respondenten een voorkeur hebben voor hard nieuws als hen wordt gevraagd een keuze te maken op basis van wat zij inschatten als betrouwbaar. Zoals eerdere onderzoeken laten zien is het gebruik van cijfers en statistieken bij veel nieuwsonderwerpen bijna onvermijdelijk. Het gebruik van cijfers is minstens zo belangrijk als het gebruik van de juiste woorden om een verhaal goed over te brengen (Maier, 2017, 8). Ook blijkt uit onderzoek (Koetsenruijter, 2011) dat bij het gebruik van meer cijfers in een artikel dat artikel als betrouwbaarder wordt ingeschat dan hetzelfde artikel met minder of geen cijfers. Het onderzoek in deze scriptie heeft in de basis dezelfde opzet als het onderzoek van Koetsenruijter: om het effect van cijfers te onderzoeken zijn de koppen verdeeld in koppen met cijfers en koppen zonder cijfers. Op basis van de literatuur volgen uit de onderzoeksvragen twee hypotheses: H1. Nieuwsconsumenten vinden een nieuwskop met hard nieuws betrouwbaarder dan een nieuwskop met zacht nieuws. H2. Nieuwsconsumenten vinden een nieuwskop met cijfers betrouwbaarder dan een nieuwskop zonder cijfers. Om onderzoek te kunnen doen naar de hypothesen is een experiment ontwikkeld. Hiervoor zijn twee online vragenlijsten gemaakt die zijn voorgelegd aan in totaal 295 respondenten (N versie 1 = 123, N versie 2 = 172). In deze vragenlijsten werd respondenten gevraagd om uit twintig nieuwskoppen, verdeeld in twee groepen van tien, zes nieuwskoppen te kiezen (twee maal drie) die zij betrouwbaar achtten. De nieuwskoppen werden in een willekeurige volgorde aangeboden aan de respondenten. Waar in het verleden een consument een krant kocht heeft er nu een, nog altijd voortdurende, verschuiving plaatsgevonden naar meer digitale nieuwsconsumptie. Daarmee is ook de manier waarop organisaties hun nieuws aanbieden veranderd: het is mogelijk om een los artikel te kopen, in plaats van alle content. Ook is er veel gratis nieuws online te vinden. De manier waarop nieuwsorganisaties nieuws aanbieden is erg divers. De manier waarop de online vragenlijsten in dit onderzoek zijn samengesteld en zijn aangeboden aan respondenten heeft het meest weg van de manier waarop een consument een artikel zoekt en koopt op een website als Blendle. De onderwerpen van de twintig koppen in vragenlijst versie 1 zijn in versie 2 hetzelfde. Er zit echter verschil in het gebruik van cijfers in de koppen: waar in versie 1 een cijfer in de kop staat, heeft de kop in versie 2 deze niet, en omgekeerd. Uit de data kunnen twee conclusies worden getrokken. Hypothese H1 wordt door de data uit de vragenlijsten ondersteund: volgens dit onderzoek is er dan ook een significant verschil tussen het aantal keer dat er door de respondenten gekozen is voor hard nieuws ten opzichte van zacht nieuws. Hypothese H2 wordt ook door de data uit de vragenlijsten ondersteund. Volgens dit onderzoek is er een significant verschil tussen het aantal keer dat er door de respondenten gekozen is voor nieuws met cijfers ten opzichte van nieuws zonder cijfers. Deze conclusie is in lijn met wat er op basis van de literatuur verwacht kon worden. Zo hebben zowel het gebruik van cijfers als het gebruik van harde nieuwsonderwerpen een positief significant effect op de vraag of respondenten een nieuwskop als betrouwbaar inschatten. Een belangrijke kanttekening die in het discussiehoofdstuk naar voren komt is dat de respondenten veelal uit het sociale netwerk van de onderzoeker komen. Daardoor zijn veel respondenten hoger opgeleid dan de gemiddelde Nederlander. Hierdoor kan het zo zijn dat het onderzoek meer zegt over de voorkeur voor hard nieuws en nieuws met cijfers bij hoger opgeleiden.","['cijfers', 'nieuws', 'nieuwskoppen', 'nieuwsonderwerp']"

The fluctuating Japanese video game industry: Performance on the Western market and effects on Japan’s Soft Power,"Gerzon, Dominic Marc Wouter René","['Shibata, Saori']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Japanese video game industry used to be a leading force in the world. During the 90’s and the early 2000’s, Japanese video games dominated the international market. Recently, however, during the end of the last decade and the start of the current decade, Japanese video games experienced a huge dip in their sales. Japan has been attempting to use the ‘Soft Power’, the concept of influence generated by its popular culture overseas, to its advantage. The link between the Japanese video game industry and the concept of Soft Power have not been sufficiently examined as of now, hence why it was the focus of this study. The aim of this study was to come to an understanding of why these fluctuations in the market occurred, as well as look for the potential influence of Japanese video games and their popularity overseas on Japan’s Soft Power. By asking questions, in the form of a survey, to experts from the Dutch video game industry, the objective was to come to new insights on the matter and open up possibilities for further research. Results from the survey showed that previously underrepresented factors contributed to the fall in popularity of Japanese video games in the West. Elements like ease of use, lingual nuances, as well as intrinsic differences in preferences of the Japanese domestic audience and the Western audience, were identified. The link between the performance of Japanese video games overseas and Japan’s Soft Power was also confirmed. Respondents acknowledge the capability of Japanese video games to influence the consumer’s image of Japan, albeit not always in a purely positive way. Arguments were also raised that the Japan portrayed in video games is often not the real Japan. This holds true, but in order to make a target audience think more positively about Japan, the ‘real’ Japan does not need to be represented accurately. Thus, it can be argued that popularity of Japanese video games overseas does indeed correlate to an increase in Japan’s Soft Power.","['Japan', 'Video Game', 'Soft Power', 'Politics', 'Economy', 'Creative Industry', 'Government', 'Influence']"

De komst van de Spanjaarden en hun kolonie in 1626 verstoorde de activiteiten van de Basay enigszins, maar na enkele jaren ontstonden relatief stabiele banden met de nieuwkomers. Veel Basay bekeerden zich tot het Christendom en leerden Spaans. In 1642 veroverde de VOC de Spaanse kolonie, maar was al snel toegewezen op de Basay voor haar voorziening van voedsel. Daarnaast vervulden de Basay een tal van diensten voor de VOC, zoals het innen van belasting, begeleiden van expedities en het vervoeren van compagniepersoneel in de regio. Binnen deze rol als tussenpersoon hadden de Basay een hoge mate van autonomie. Basay, vertegenwoordigd door hun dorpshoofden, hadden een sterke onderhandelingspositie en konden hun eigen doelen bepalen en navolgen, in sommige gevallen zelfs ten koste van de VOC. Aan de andere kant waren de Basay geen homogene groep: dorpshoofden en tolken konden hun dorpsgenoten links laten liggen en zelfverrijking voorop stellen. Van hun kant zagen de dienaren van de VOC de Basay als diverse groep. Het waren mondige Spaanse christenen die slim hun kennis en connecties benuttigden.","['Formosa', 'Basay', 'VOC', 'Taiwan', 'Tussenpersonen', 'Intermediaries', 'Tolken', 'Agency', 'Azië', 'Handel']"

"""By order of the Peaky Bloinders!"": Examining the Representation of the Brummie Accent in Television","Haverman, Daya","['Smakman, Dick']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In film and television, actors are sometimes expected to speak in a particular accent in order to convey their character’s identity as accurately as possible. A term in sociolinguistic research fields that describes this connection between identity and language is indexicality: it “refers to the way an observable linguistic fact can be indexical of social identities in the same way, for instance, that clothing can. Language features can thus be semiotic signs associated with such identities.” (Smakman 2018: 57). Filmmakers make use of this fact when they include a specific dialect in their films: “film uses language variation and accent to draw character quickly, building on established preconceived notions associated with specific loyalties, ethnic, racial or economic alliances” (Lippi-Green 1997: 81). However, as the actors in film may be required to speak in an accent that is different than their own, inaccuracies can occur in their pronunciation, which may lead to linguistic stereotyping, appropriation or even racism. In this thesis, I examined this phenomenon in relation to the Birmingham (or, ‘Brummie’) accent, which is spoken in the series Peaky Blinders. I first established the most prototypical accent features of the Birmingham accent by comparing several sources, after which I analysed the use of these features in the speech of native speakers and actors. I then juxtaposed the differences in frequency and consistency between the pronunciation of the native speakers and actors, and several patterns emerged. These patterns could all be related to four sociophonetic processes detected by Bell and Gibson in a similar study: selectivity, mis-realisation, overshoot and undershoot (2011: 568). It was then found that these sociophonetic processes can account for the inaccuracies that may occur in actors’ accent use, which ultimately pointed out that there is, in fact, a correlation between dialect use in film and linguistic stereotyping.",
Consolidating the Role of the State in Addressing Human Trafficking and Prostitution,"Daskalova, Yoanna Miroslavova","['Regilme, Salvador Santino']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the legal implications of global feminist debates centring radical and liberal feminist stances on Human Trafficking (HT) and prostitution as interrelated phenomena. It explores the 2000 Dutch repeal of the brothels ban and the 1999 Swedish prohibition on the purchase of sex services. It posed the question - What are the discourses underlying the two dominant feminist stances on Human Trafficking and its link to prostitution? Do they reveal a similar or a radically opposed logic in their articulation of female subject positions? If so, how? By employing post-structuralist theory of discourse, notions of bio-power, docile bodies, governmentality and others, this paper argues that despite the fierce opposition between radical and liberal feminist standpoints on the two issues at hand, both positions frame female subjects as bodies to be governed or as the loci for state incursions and governmental control. In the case of abolitionist feminists, women are held to be passive victims who are in need of governmental protection and saving. Conversely, the liberal stance perceives them as a separate economic class that must be placed under state supervision with its activities regulated and controlled. Importantly, this thesis contributes to the research on international political theory by offering a new interpretation of the debate on HT and prostitution. By employing a comparative case study as means to demonstrate its theoretical argument, it aims to create an alternative understanding of the polarised debate which essentially expresses one overarching framework. As such, it is highly relevant to post-modern feminist theory and gender studies since it presents a new perspective on one of the central and most pressing crises in global gender equality. This assertion is of vital importance for international relations and regionalist debates on state power insofar as it addresses important questions concerning the role of the nation-state in managing domestic affairs, such as prostitution, and tackling international issues, such as HT. In that regard, this paper argues against one of the widely-held beliefs, prevalent in liberal political circles, envisioning a decreased role for post-modern states in international relations and national policies. Instead, it posits that the construction of the two feminist discourses, creating easily governable subjects and enhancing state interventions, and their policy impact on HT and prostitution have successfully worked to solidify the role of the nation-state in addressing both HT and prostitution. Lastly, radical and liberal feminist movements in Sweden and The Netherlands have rendered one of the most successful lobbying efforts in the world which manifests the implications of international and regional political debates on national level. Admittedly, this serves a wider agenda in which national Dutch and Swedish feminist movements embody a culminating success of a global endeavour and as such are of broad importance with indisputably reverberating effects.","['Human Trafficking', 'Prostitution', 'Discourse', 'Feminism', 'Sweden', 'The Netherlands']"

Shifts and Reorientations: Syrian thinkers and the changing perception about the role of secularism and political Islam in the context of Syrian and Iranian revolutions,"Bakhash, Mohammad","['Sijpesteijn, P.M.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"تتناول هذه الورقة البحثية العلاقة الإشكالية في الواقع العربي المعاصر بين العلمانية والإسلام السياسي من خلال تتبع الموقف من هذين الموضوعين لدى اثنين من أعمدة الفكر العلماني في سوريا والعالم العربي. المفكر الأول هو الفيلسوف السوري صادق جلال العظم الذي عرف بانتقاده الحاد للفكر الإسلامي بشكل عام ولتيارات الإسلام السياسي بشكل خاص أما المفكر الثاني فهو الشاعر علي أحمد سعيد إسبر المعروف بأدونيس والذي يشترك مع العظم في نهجه الرافض للإسلام السياسي والداعي لتغيير جذري في الواقع العربي للاستجابة لتحديات العصر. يركز البحث على موقف المفكرين المذكورين من حدثين مفصليين في المنطقة العربية هما الثورة الإيرانية (1979) والثورة السورية (2011)، وذلك من خلال تحليل ما صدر عنهما من مواقف متضمنة في المؤلفات أو المقالات أو اللقاءات الصحفية لكل منهما, حيث يلحظ تبايناً واضحاً بين موقفهما من هاتين الثورتين بما يطرح تساؤلاً مهماً حول علاقة خلفياتهما المذهبية بالتحولات التي طرأت على موقف كل منهما تجاه الإسلام السياسي خلال هاتين الثورتين. تم تخصيص قسمين منفصلين لتحليل توجهات كلا المفكرين على امتداد حياتهما الفكرية مع إبراز التمايز الكبير في موقفهما من الثورتين السورية والإيرانية ومن المضامين الإسلامية التي حملتها هاتين الثورتين، حيث يبرز تحليل مواقف كل منهما الاتساق المثير للتساؤل بين الانتماء الطائفي لديهما والانحياز للثورة التي يشكل المكون الطائفي الذي ينتميان إليه أكثرية واضحة فيها. الراحل صادق جلال العظم الذي ينتمي بخلفيته المذهبية إلى الإسلام السني أعرب مبكراً عن انتقاده للتجربة الخمينية المستندة للمرجعية الشيعية في حكم إيران وجاهر برفضه لأي دور للإسلام في الحياة السياسية لكن تحولاً كبيراً طرأ على موقفه هذا خلال العقود التي تلت الثورة الإيرانية إلى أن انتهى به المطاف إلى التأييد الكامل وغير المشروط للثورة السورية التي انطلقت من حواضن الأكثرية السنية في سوريا، وذلك بالرغم من حضور الإسلام السياسي الكثيف في تلك الثورة. أما أدونيس ذو الخلفية المذهبية العلوية الأقرب للتشيع فلم يجد حرجاً في أن يكون من أوائل المشجعين للثورة الإيرانية رغم طابعها الإسلامي الواضح ورغم تناقض هذا الدعم مع مجمل طروحاته السابقة، لكنه بالمقابل أظهر تحفظاً واضحاً في إظهار أي قدر من التأييد للثورة السورية واختار الانحياز للنظام البعثي السوري رغم تهجمه المتكرر في السابق على التجربة البعثية في الحكم. القسم الثالث في البحث يتناول ردود الأفعال في الأوساط الثقافية السورية والعالمية على هذه التحولات التي طرأت على توجهات المفكرين والمحاولات الجادة لتفسير هذه التحولات. يخلص البحث إلى أنه بالرغم من تعذر إثبات جنوح واضح لدى أي من المفكرين لتأسيس مواقفهما الفكرية على قواعد انتماءاتهما الطائفية ومع أن التحولات التي شهدتها مواقفهما تجاه الثورتين الإيرانية والسورية لا يمكن الجزم بكونها نتيجة انحياز واع لانتماء طائفي معين، لكن مع كل ما سبق تظل الخلفية الطائفية وما ينتج عنها من ذاكرة جمعية و تصورات ذهنية مسبقة للآخر ونواياه عوامل لا يمكن إنكارها في تشكيل مواقف كلا المفكرين وتحديد توجهاتهما من القضايا المعاصرة ومقاربتهما للعلمانية والإسلام السياسي.","['Syria', 'Adunis', 'al-Azm', 'Sectarian', 'Secularism', 'Political Islam']"

Okinawan Textiles as Japanese Heritage: A Critical Approach,"Montuori, Francesco","['Müller, Doreen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Ryūkyū archipelago, in Southern Japan, is home to some ancient techniques for crafting (Kijōka-bashōfu) and dyeing (Bingata) textiles which are not found elsewhere in mainland Japan. The Kingdom of Ryūkyū was annexed to the Japanese empire only in recent times (1879), after centuries of relative independence, and the Japanese governments of the first decades of the 20th century has made considerable efforts to reshape and silence the local identity. This process of neutralization of local culture also affected the visibility and the perceived identity of those crafts within the national cultural discourse throughout the whole century. My thesis inspects different issues related to the intercurrent relations between heritage and nation. I will reconstruct what has been done to the Ryūkyū local heritage in the past and what the latest developments have been. I will also highlight the differences existing between the ways the identity of these crafts, Kijōka-bashōfu in particular, are presented in documents aiming at the international, rather than domestic, public. By doing so, I will offer an insight on the cultural policies implemented by the Japanese governments in this respect. Finally, I will operate an audiovisual analysis on a documentary made by entities independent by Japan, representing the everyday life and the activities of local craftspeople involved in the production of these textiles. With that, I will also assess how the local discourse on identity differs from the national discourse.","['kijōka bashōfu', 'culture', 'craftsmanship', 'heritage', 'media', 'nation-work', 'textile']"

A 'lengthy' problem: Towards an explanation of the Proto-Indo-European long vowels,"Paske, Rogier J.M. te","['Pronk, T.C.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The Proto-Indo-European long vowels *ē and *ō occupy a remarkable position within the phonemic system. Although these vowels are phonemic, they are limited to very specific morphological categories. This distribution has been explained by several theories, of which there are three which propose a phonetic origin for these long vowels and that nowadays find supported by various scholars, viz. Wackernagel’s lengthening in monosyllables, Szemerényi’s Law, and Kortlandt’s lengthening before word-final resonant. These three theories have in common that they derive the long vowels from their short counterparts *e and *o, whereas they differ from each other in the phonological environments under which the short vowels would have become long. It is, however, still controversial which theory is the most likely to be correct, since all theories have counterexamples. This thesis examines the question which of the three phonetic theories on the origin of the Proto-Indo-European lengthened grade can be proven correct or incorrect. This question will be addressed by discussing the evidence and counterevidence of the nominal system and comparing the counterexamples to the three theories. By attempting to provide alternative explanations for the counterevidence, as well as discussing the strengths and weaknesses of existing alternative explanations, it is possible to examine which theory or theories can be kept up and which one(s) must be rejected. It will be concluded, that monosyllabic lengthening probably works for the nominal system, that Kortlandt’s lengthening before word-final resonant can only work when it is reformulated(i.e. leaving out the nasals as a conditional factor), and that Szemerényi’s Law is best to be given up.","['Proto-Indo-European', 'lengthened grade', 'monosyllabic lengthening', ""Szemerényi's Law"", 'lengthening before word-final resonant']"

In the Guise of Irony: A closer look at the function and effect of irony embedded in the cinema of Aki Kaurismäki,"Efdé, Remco","['Verstraten, P.W.J.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Connecting Kaurismäki to irony is not surprising, but is surprisingly enough, not so much scholarly researched in the past. Irony appears in different disguises, largely depending on the function of it; what the ironist wants to achieve. Applying it can originate from an urge to complicate a matter of discussion but can also be applied to translate the oppositional stance the ironist wants to reveal. In the case of the enigmatic Kaurismäki his intentions or motivations in his choice of theme and subject are essential to the humour he adapts in telling his stories, but always remains somewhat vague. This thesis provides an image of how irony prevails and functions in his cinema on the base of a series of comparative case studies linked to three of his films: I Hired a Contract Killer (1990), The Man Without a Past (2002) and The Other Side of Hope (2017). It eventually sets out an idea of a filmmaker who, by applying irony, both distances though simultaneously engages himself with his audience in his own wayward fashion.","['Kaurismäki', 'Irony', 'Cinema', 'remarriage', 'humour', 'Léaud', 'Ironic', 'Sarcasm', 'Romantic', 'Material']"
A Return to Neoliberal Economic Policy in Brazil? - An Analysis of Brazil's Presidential Elections of 2018,"Bergenhenegouwen, Arnout van","['Amann, Edmund']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper has primarily attempted to determine whether neoliberal economic policy is making a return to Brazil, and secondarily what the most likely explanation for this could be. The elections of October 2018 provided the context to perform an analysis on this subject: the two candidates competing in the second round of elections, Jair Bolsonaro and Fernando Haddad and their visions on economic policy for Brazil have been analyzed through the method of content analysis. The programas de governo or governing programs of both candidates has served as the main subject of the study. Additionally articles in journals and interviews have been taken into consideration. Neoliberal economic policy in this paper is defined as a specific set of economic policies associated with the Washington Consensus. Although the Washington Consensus contains a total of ten advised economic reforms, the analysis in this paper will focus on specifically three, namely privatization, trade liberalization and austerity. This will be followed by a demonstration of a ‘retreat’ of neoliberal economic policy worldwide at the hand of the trade policies of the Trump administration in the United States and the change of direction made by International Financial Institutions. Thirdly, the political situation of the last years in Brazil will be described in order to provide the reader with the necessary context for the analysis. Fourthly, the turn to neoliberal economic policy under the current Temer administration will be demonstrated to establish that neoliberalism has returned to Brazil, albeit in the form of a government with near to no public support: favorable views of the (neoliberal) reforms among the candidates under study would be a strong indication a continuation of this policy under a new president is likely. This has been researched through the programas de governo, articles and interviews. Lastly, two possible explanations have been considered. The paper will conclude that it is indeed likely that Brazil, now with a candidate enjoying significant public support, will continue on the path of neoliberal economic policy. This return to neoliberal economic policy will be concluded to be due to a form of crisis management in Brazil.","['Brazil', 'Neoliberalism', 'Latin America', 'Haddad', 'Bolsonaro', 'Economic Policy', 'Trade', 'Free Market', 'Liberalism']"

Indigenous Communities in the City: How new Mapuche Generations Experience their Identity in Urban Settings,"Codda, Greta Sophie","['Krakowska Rodrigues, Kamila']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"All over the world many indigenous communities leave their lands and move to the cities in order to conduct a new life. At the same time, these communities find themselves in a very vulnerable position, considering that they often face discrimination and struggle to fully adapt to their new environments. This research focuses on the case study of Chile and of the Mapuche community in particular. For historical and economic reasons, many Mapuche had to migrate to Santiago and other cities and as for 2002, two thirds of the whole Mapuche community lived in the city. Through the analysis of David Añiñir's collection of poems and the website of the political and social organization Meli WIxan Mapu, both residing in Santiago but of Mapuche heritage, this thesis argues that there is still a strong attachment to the indigenous community. The analysis is embedded within the theoretical framework of ethno-symbolism, an approach on identity developed by British sociologist Anthony Smith. The analysis sheds light on how ethno-symbolism contributes to a deeper understanding of how the Mapuche people living in the city relate to their identity.","['Ethno-symbolism', 'Mapuche', 'urban indigenous communities', 'identity', 'Mapurbe', 'Meli Wixan Mapu']"

This research focuses on the influence of wealth, information asymmetry and perceptions on the impoverished people’s participation with regard to the stadium building process in Cape Town and Nelspruit. The factors of wealth, information asymmetry and perceptions are identified through rigorous literature review, which placed the impoverished people’s participation through the perspective of civic political participation and democracy. The wealth factor displayed a layered power balance with FIFA and the national South African government at the top, local government and local affluent in the middle and local impoverished people at the bottom of the pyramid. The information asymmetry factor for the Cape Town and Nelspruit cases negatively affected the impoverished people’s participation, as they lacked key information that could have assisted them in their political participation. The perception factor showed that the impoverished people had little trust in the political system as the result of corruption and false promises made in the past, which negatively affected their political participation. The stylized nature of the research, by exclusively examining these factors, limited the research, as it did not fully consider a myriad of other factors and the influence of these factors on the decision-making process.","['2010 World Cup', 'South Africa', 'impoverished people’s participation', 'citizen participation', 'political participation']"
Wall Street on Chang’an Avenue - The Liberalization of Foreign Ownership in Chinese Financial Institutions,"Mahy-Rousseau, Karel","['Landsberger, Stefan R.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In November 2017, the Chinese Vice Finance Minister announced the government's intention to remove the limits on foreign ownship in commercial banks, asset management firms, securities firms, and fund management firms. A few months later, the Governor of the People's Bank of China offered what can be considered a timeline for implementation. Although subsequent information has been very scarce and no specific rules have been issued, yet, the author's interest was so much piqued that he has written a thesis that speculates about the government's motivations to decide in this manner. With speculation as the driving force, in order to establish what foreign ownership may mean for a national banking sector in general and the Chinese one in particular, the author presents an overview of seminal research into this field as it has been published in the first decade of the century and has not been published since. Comparative studies on countries that show similarities with China also are presented. The Chinese banking sector, much like the political system, is like a black box. Few studies have appeared that describe the state of the financial sector in a non-partisan way. Nonetheless, the author has identified a number of existing problems that might be assuaged by allowing foreign ownership, by testing them against a number of hypotheses that have been distilled from the general literature. Again, speculation is the defining word, but on the basis of rational arguments, a number of very convincing reasons are presented why the Chinese government may decide to open up its financial sector to outside ownership.","['China', 'Finance', 'Liberalization', 'Bank', 'Foreign', 'Ownership', 'Opening', 'PRC']"

Between Community and Society: The Role of Islamic Centers in Mobilizing against Islamophobia,"Muscio Blanco, Tania","['Moody, Simanique']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Within only one year after the terrorist attacks in New York City in 2001, an estimated 100.000 Muslims, predominantly non-white Arabs, had been personally affected by the American government’s “domestic legislative, administrative, and judicial measures”. This institutionalization of Islamophobia against Muslim Americans by government policies has been accentuated by media coverage depicting Muslims as one monolithic and essentialist religious group which has resonated in public perceptions. On top of this, miseducation of the public about Middle Eastern and Islamic history and the reality of Islamic practices in America have magnified the perception of mosques and Islamic centers as enclosed breeding grounds for Islamic radicalism. However, increasingly marginalized in American society, Muslims have turned to their local mosques and Islamic centers for protection, evolving their role as simple worship places into educational, gathering, and social spaces, giving these centers a central role in their lives. Hence, this thesis argues that as 9/11 triggered a spike of Islamophobia accompanied by racially motivated aggression, Islamic centers and organizations took it upon themselves to mobilize their communities against the sources of prejudice faced by Muslim Americans, refocusing their efforts on education, interfaith encounters, and community building while calling for increased integration efforts. Using interviews with the leadership of several Islamic centers, this thesis highlights the change in the approach on how to tackle Islamophobia that came with 9/11, as well as the perceived effectiveness of these initiatives.","['Islamophobia', 'Racialization of Islam', 'Ethnic Mobilization', 'American Political Culture']"

It describes how this ancient Chinese tradition has found its place in the daily life of practitioners of three “Daoist” body practices and how the practitioners experience Daoism. Through analyzing qualitative interviews with teachers and students practicing taijiquan, qigong and Healing Tao, this thesis shows that Daoism in the Netherlands is mostly experienced as a practical guideline and serves as the basis for these body practices. For a significant number of practitioners, Daoism is applicable everywhere and gives meaning to life. It explains the world around the practitioners without requiring a strong “belief” in anything. Some practitioners connect Daoism and their body practice to its Chinese origin, whereas others believe the underlying principles are the most important. Through this analyzation, it becomes clear that Daoism is experienced stronger in the Netherlands than was expected prior to this research.","['Daoism', 'taijiquan', 'taiji', 'qigong', 'Healing Tao', 'China', 'the Netherlands', 'Chinese tradition', 'body practice', 'experience']"

The Challenges of RMB Internationalization,"Lape, Martynas","[""d' Hooghe, Ingrid""]",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The RMB Internationalization has declined since 2015. For this reason, the question arises - What inhibits RMB Internationalization? The main argument is risk. the Chinese government balances currency risk in order to maintain the competitiveness and lower volatility of the exchange rate. If the Chinese government and policy makers refrain from stable RMB exchange rate, foreign investors will become less confident in holding RMB-denominated financial instruments. Furthemore, the thesis employs Chris Brummers' systemic risk method and explores two case studies - Pakistan, and the City of London. These two cases presents different versions of risk. Pakistan represents high levels of risk, and the City of London is a low-risk for RMB Internationalization. While Pakistan is burdened with environment, security and debt risks, the City of London offers an access to one of the largest financial hubs and opportunity to make foreign investors more comfortable in holding RMB-denominated financial assets.","['Foreign Exchange', 'Belt And Road Initiative', 'Renminbi', 'RMB', 'Risk']"
A History of Patriarchy?,"Pierik, Bob","['Chouraqui, Frank']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigated the concept ‘patriarchy’, its historical meanings and its political consequences. The main finding of surveying different uses of ‘patriarchy’ is that the two main uses are (1) to describe a system of fatherly authority in the household and family and (2) to describe a system of structural male domination over women. Confusion and conceptual problems arise when (1) and (2) are used interchangeably. This thesis then proposes the understanding of ‘patriarchal power’ as bound up with the body and as a process of mastering the ‘power over life and death’ that is compatible with Foucault’s notion of ‘bio-power’ and which is more closely connected to (1). More precisely, ‘patriarchal power’ is parasitical to ‘geslacht’, which I suggest is a universal category that can be added to Christophe Bouton’s reading of Reinhart Koselleck’s existential dialectic. By turning to ‘geslacht’, a speculative philosophy of gender history that takes the body-as-situation becomes possible. This can provide the conceptual bedrock for a historical anthropology that takes human reproduction and bodies seriously without falling into essentialism.","['Gender history', 'Patriarchy', 'Philosophy of history']"

Hollywood: Mere Amusement or a Hidden Tool,"Ven, Julia van de","['Regilme, Salvador']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"For this bachelor thesis, I have done research on the subject of the role of Hollywood in US soft power in relation to the fight against Islamic extremist terrorism. The research question I have posed is: ‘Has Hollywood been a tool for North American soft power by contributing to the creation of a Western imagined community against Islamic extremist terrorism since 9/11? If so, how?’. In order to answer this question, I have done qualitative research using a scene from the movie American Sniper and a scene from the movie Lone Survivor which served as case studies. To provide a guiding tool, for each scene I have posed the questions ‘How is the ‘westerner’ portrayed?’, ‘How is the ‘Arab portrayed?’, and ‘Does the scene accord to the biographic book?’. In order to provide answers to these questions, I have used the handbook ‘Film Narratology’ by Peter Verstraten to examine the implicit content of the scenes, the scripts of the movies to support analysis of the explicit content of the scenes, and the biographic books on which the movies were based to check whether the scenes accord to these books. Subsequently, used the concepts of culture and cultural hegemony, soft power, and orientalism to ascribe meaning to the outcomes of the analyses. As a result from these analyses and the application of the concepts, I have found that in both scenes the ‘westerner’ is portrayed as heroic and righteous, while the ‘Arab’ is mostly portrayed as savage, hostile and rogue which is showing that both movies have an Orientalist character. Also, resulting from these analyses I can state that the scenes culturally manipulate and influence the viewers perceptions of the ‘Arab’ and the ‘westerner’, which means that it is contributing to US’ story which is projected to the rest of the world to ‘sell itself’ with the goal to attract other people and states to be on the same page with the US. With these results I have provided with an answer to the research question, which reads that Hollywood has been a tool for US soft power by contributing to the creation of a Western community against Islamic extremist terrorism, albeit unwittingly. This is done by employing Hollywood’s prominent and influential status which makes it possible to manipulate the movies’ watchers into developing a perception of Islamic terrorists as rogue and savage as opposed to heroic and righteous US soldiers. Still, what could be considered as shortcomings of this research are its sensitiveness to time, place and interpretation, and the small amount of analyzed scenes. In order to resolve this in a more extensive research, I firstly recommend to do a comparison with results of analyses on movies within another time frame or from another country. Secondly, I recommend to use diverse means of interpretation. Lastly, I recommend to analyze more scenes or even entire movies to be able to make a more solid argument.","['Hollywood', 'Film', 'Culture', 'cultural hegemony', 'North America', 'orientalism']"

Shaping Seoul: Employing Heritage in the Urban Regeneration Projects Seoullo 7017 and Again Sewoon,"Schmidt, Marieke","['Paskaleva, Elena']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Seoul has continuously been reshaped by nation-building strategies that project the image of the nation through urban space. From the 1970s onwards, this image has drastically changed by rapid industrialization and the creation of a ‘national heritage’ canon under the Park Chung Hee government. Subsequent governments have invested in the 'politics of memory' to strengthen their regimes: complete urban compounds were demolished and replaced by monuments, museums, public plazas, and impressive urban projects that have recently turned Seoul into a 'soft’, playful and global city. However, current Seoul Mayor Park Won Soon has shifted his focus on urban revitalization instead of demolition. His ‘Seoul Future Heritage Program’, in which ‘Industrial Heritage’ plays a crucial role, reflects the approach of ‘heritagization’, the creation of heritage, to revitalize decaying structures in the city. Seoullo 7017, a deteriorating traffic overpass turned into a green walkway, and Again Sewoon, an old arcade ‘revived’ by inviting startups and creative events, were elevated as ‘Industrial Heritage’ and imagined alongside the nation’s ‘traditional’ heritage in a naturalized narrative portraying the nation’s culture and progress. Both projects were designed to attract daily citizen activity and engagement with their heritage value through information signs, public campaigns, and pedestrian accessibility. Altogether, Mayor Park’s policy shows a crucial shift in attention towards experiential heritage, in which industrial architecture is firmly placed within the national heritage narrative.","['heritage', 'South Korea', 'Asian Studies', 'Area Studies', 'Urban Planning', 'politics of memory', 'nation-building', 'nationalism', 'Critical Heritage Studies', 'industrial heritage']"

The election protests relied to a large extent on digital communication and social media platforms to mobilize the opposition to the re-elected president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005-2013). The soft war narrative was the primary justification for the increasing control of the Iranian authorities over their country’s cybersphere which accompanied the regime’s crackdown on the 2009 demonstrations. While the topics of digital repression and the soft war during the terms of president Ahmadinejad have received their share of scholarly attention, a review their status under the current Iranian president of Hassan Rouhani is lacking. This thesis aims to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing how the soft war narrative has been used in Iranian governmental discourse to justify control of Iran’s media environment and in particular, control of Iran’s internet, during the tenure of president Rouhani as compared to during the Ahmadinejad era. Particular attention is paid to the legacy Western imperialism in Iran, factional politics in contemporary Iran and the influence of the country’s political economy on the Iranian state’s restrictions on internet freedom under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hassan Rouhani.","['Soft war', 'media', 'Islamic Republic of Iran', 'Iranian political narratives', 'national identity', 'internet censorship']"

The role of government on Chinese state-owned airlines’ competitiveness,"Lee, Man-ho","['Shidiq, Akhmad Rizal']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The main focus of this paper was to examine the role of the Chinese government in the development of its state-owned airlines. Usually, state-owned enterprises have not been considered competitive in a market due to the lack of efficiency and incentives compared to privately-owned enterprises. However, the recent growth of Chinese state-owned airlines compared to other Asian airlines indicates that these enterprises are able to compete successfully with privately-owned airlines. Therefore, this paper tried to explain why these airlines have been able to do this, by focusing on the strong role played by its owner, the Chinese government. Due to this ownership, the government has significant influence on the market on both the regulatory and the operational sides of the Chinese airline industry. This paper has shown that the Chinese government provided its airlines with favourable policies aimed at reducing competition, especially in the domestic market. Through regulatory and financial support, the airlines have faced few difficulties in competing in the airline industry and therefore could successfully develop to being part of Asia’s largest airlines.","['Airline industry', 'China', 'Protectionism', 'State-owned enterprises']"

"Europe, Arise! The Paneuropean Union and the Union of European Federalists Compared","Wilde, Zoë de","['Erlichman, Camilo']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The lobbying for federalism in Europe has a long history with many associated movements. One of the oldest federalist initiatives is the Paneuropean Union (PEU), formally established in 1924. A later addition to the lobby movements was the Union of European Federalists (UEF), which was established in 1946. So far, no federal Europe has been established, and with recent events such as the Brexit this goal seems farther away than ever. Does this lack of success then mean a failure of the decades of federalist movements and lobbying? The PEU and UEF have been researched on three components, namely: ideology, membership and organization structure, and lastly, envisioned federal structure. Ideology-wise, the PEU and UEF had a very different base; the PEU founding ideology could be described as conservative with strong nationalistic elements, while the UEF had a background in socialism and communism, with a strong opposition towards nationalism. Research on membership also shows a large difference between the PEU and UEF. The PEU gained much attention with attracting many notable individuals in the realm of politicians, industrialists and nobility, such as Benito Mussolini and Otto von Hapsburg. The PEU’s following then was rather small and elitist. Contrary to this, the UEF had a much larger following since its inception. Lastly, on the topic of structure, both organizations remained relatively vague on the exact execution, but both agreed on sole military rights for the European federal government or a proposed economic unity. Concluding, although the direct initiatives of the federalist movements might have failed, the reasons for which they considered federalism necessary have to a large degree been successful. Not to mention, the continued attention for federalism, which has led to these movements’ being discussed decades after the fact","['europe', 'federalism', 'paneuropean union', 'union of european federalists', 'european union']"

Responsabilidad Social Empresarial y desarrollo sostenible. Una mirada al sector rural peruano.,"Menéndez Huamalí, Scarlet Cynthia","['Silva, Patricio']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,es,"La Responsabilidad Social Empresarial (RSE) surge en la segunda mitad del siglo XX, en medio de las demandas por nuevas alternativas al desarrollo que buscaban solucionar el problema de la pobreza y los daños ambientales causados por las empresas en el proceso globalizador. Así, la RSE se define como la responsabilidad que asumen las empresas por sus impactos económicos, sociales y ambientales con respecto a sus grupos de interés. La RSE es un enfoque ético que apela a una actuación consciente y transparente de las empresas, tanto dentro como fuera de ella, que implica someterse a una rendición de cuentas. De este modo, constituye un factor diferenciador que permite beneficiar a la empresa y a la sociedad. La RSE, al estar estrechamente relacionada con el desarrollo sostenible, es un tema importante en el contexto rural ya que las personas dependen directamente de los recursos naturales y la mayoría de empresas que operan en este sector son extractivas, lo cual puede representar una amenaza para la población local. En el caso peruano, la agricultura y la minería son dos actividades importantes: la agricultura porque gran parte de la población rural depende de esta actividad y la minería porque genera importantes ingresos económicos para el país. Con las políticas neoliberales de los años 90, la expansión de las empresas permitió la promoción de la RSE, siendo las empresas mineras las que mayores intervenciones de RSE realizan en el sector rural. Ellas buscan crear oportunidades para mejorar la calidad de la población, como una manera de devolver los beneficios obtenidos es sus áreas de intervención. Sin embargo, las relaciones entre los diferentes actores sociales son complejas debido a los conflictos que se han producido por los impactos socioambientales. En este sentido, el objetivo central de esta investigación es determinar los alcances y potencialidades de las actividades de la RSE que se han ejecutado en el Perú para promover el desarrollo de las comunidades rurales en un marco de sostenibilidad.","['cooperativas', 'desarrollo rural', 'minería', 'neoliberalismo', 'Perú', 'Responsabilidad Social Empresarial', 'sostenibilidad']"
A Century of Chekists: 1917-2017,"Knottnerus, Jelle","['Wilbrink, Hans A.T.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"After the Russian revolution in 1917, one of the first acts of the Bolsheviks was to establish a security service which was meant to protect and serve them, namely the Cheka. Now, after more than a century in which significant changes have taken place, the honorary term amongst Russian intelligence officers remains ‘Chekist’ and even their monthly salary is deposited on the twentieth of the month to commemorate the formation of the Cheka. Moreover, the present-day security service, the FSB, has since 2016 reoccupied the Lubyanka building in which its predecessors from the Cheka until the KGB had all resided. During the century between the Cheka’s foundation and the FSB, considerable circumstantial changes occurred which affected the security services. However, this nonstatic nature seems to coexist with a degree of continuity. Arguably, one of the most significant events during this period, is the collapse of the communist Soviet Union and its pseudo transition into democracy. The most important form of democratic consolidation is political institutionalization. Intelligence services are key components of rational government and thus part of this institutionalization process. The current political structure within the main successor of the former Soviet Union, Russia, manifests itself in the form of being neither democratic nor fully authoritarian. In post-Soviet Russia, the institutional structure is based on the democratic example but operates without democratic agency to enforce it. Authoritarian governance coexists with legally sanctioned, if limited, competition for political office. My research aims to scrutinise the role which Russia’s FSB occupies within this hybrid setting and how this relation came into existence.",['Russia Siloviki Intelligence Chekists KGB FSB']

Mass Surveillance and ""Suzhi"" in the Chinese Social Credit System","Brussee, Vincent","['Landsberger, Stefan']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Chinese Social Credit System (SCS) has often been described by Western observers as an “Orwellian nightmare”. However, within China, so such outrage appears to exist. Therefore, this paper examines the current state of the SCS and analyses to what extent the system really intents to further repress the Chinese people using surveillance and big data. First, a number of common myths are dispelled, namely the confusion between Sesame Credit and SCS and the use of big data. Then, a more comprehensive overview of the SCS is created and the actual real-life implementation in local pilots is examined. The final chapters then turn to an interpretation of the SCS. The key finding is that while the SCS has the potential to turn into this feared Orwellian nightmare, this does not appear to be the intended goal of the system. Instead, the main focus is on improving the population’s “suzhi” (or: quality) in order to improve economic and social regulation and make China a more “trustworthy” place.","['China', 'Social Credit System', 'Suzhi', 'Mass Surveillance', 'Population Quality', 'Chinese Communist Party']"
Chinese fair trade in Africa: the Ethiopian and Nigerian cases,"Aline, Melissa","[""d'Hooghe, I.M.A.""]",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the last decades, China went from an underdeveloped nation to the world’s fastest growing economy. In the meantime, China’s economic relations have massively increased with nation from all economic, political and sociocultural backgrounds. Chinese trade with Africa grew during the post-colonial period and continued to rise as African nations gradually develop. Those partnerships remain distinct from others however, since there seems to be added pressure for economic trade to unequivocally benefit the African side when Chinese trade is involved. Indeed, when assessing trade with Africa, critics often tend to emphasize human rights violations and poor working conditions inflicted by Chinese companies, while generally not holding Western companies to the same standard, or at least, not emphasizing the issue as much, when similar instances also involve Western companies. The Chinese trading model will be compared with fairer trade practices practiced today also known as “fair trade”. This thesis will be an attempt at a discussion to understand the standard of Chinese trade model in Africa while also addressing the issues emerging as a result. The fair trade market, as well as other forms of fair trade practices will be assessed to determine the state of trade practices between the two case studies countries: Ethiopia and Nigeria.","['Fair trade', 'China', 'Ethiopia', 'Nigeria', 'International Trade']"

The EU - Turkey Statement: A design for human rigths violations?,"Vries, Kim de","['Oster, Jan']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"On 18 March 2016, the EU – Turkey Statement was conducted by the heads of states or governments of the EU and Ahmed Davutoğlu, Turkish minister of foreign affairs, with the aim to control irregular migration from the Aegean Sea towards the European Union. Yet, concerns have been raised regarding the compliance of the EU – Turkey Statement with human rights. Human rights have to be respected in the EU member states as well as in Turkey. When Turkey does not respect these rights, it cannot be considered as safe. As long as Turkey cannot be considered as a safe third country, the EU – Turkey Statement will violate the law of the European Union. This would not only have consequences for the current Statement, but also for similar statements conducted in the near future in which the EU – Turkey Statement might serve as a blueprint for human rights violations. To that end, the aim of this thesis is to examine the compatibility of the EU – Turkey Statement with international and European law, based on human dignity, the right to asylum, the principle of non-refoulement and the assumption of Turkey as a safe third country. The legal examination resulted in the main findings that the EU – Turkey Statement shows malfunctions on the upholding of human rights in the European Union and that Turkey cannot be considered as a safe third country. This because Turkey is part of the Geneva Convention with geographical limitation, the absence for non-Europeans to be granted with asylum in Turkey, a history of violations concerning the non-refoulement principle and serious concerns for inhuman or degrading treatment. In other words, the EU – Turkey Statement is not in accordance with European law and does not safeguard human rights.","['EU - Turkey Statement', 'European Union', 'Turkey', 'European law', 'Human rights', 'Right to asylum', 'Non-refoulement', 'Safe third country', 'Migration']"

Indigenous matters, the matters of the majority of the population, began to circulate at the core of national politics and identity, as according to Morales, all national affairs were from then onwards to be indigenous. Internationally, Morales has advocated for indigenous rights and environmental rights, actively pursuing the “language of political indigeneity” as “an explicit critique of neoliberal globalisation”. He has used the international discourse on indigeneity to arguably form a homogenised and unified national indigenous identity, emphasising the states’ commitment to protect nature, effectively enabling him to justify his resource extractivism. Similarly, indigenous communities themselves have claimed the discourse on indigeneity, as their narrative in association to land, territory and ecological conservation is being manifested in order to defend their rights.","['Indigeneity', 'Bolivia', 'Development', 'Identity Politics']"
Cultural Governance under Xi Jinping - An investigation on Chinese traditional culture and cultural heritage management at a local level,"Minafo', Laura","['Teh, Limin']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Presentation of the topic As a consequence of its vertiginous development in the last decades, China has gained a new position as an international superpower. Economic development has led to drastic social changes which had an impact on the official conception of Chinese Identity supported by the government. After the Maoist era and the reforms conducted under Deng, the old communist ideology did not suit Chinese people anymore. The government has had to find new discourses on which to base the national community. Contemporary China’s nationalism engages repeatedly with China’s glorious past and the unique value of Chinese traditional culture. Through such themes, the government aims to build a connection between contemporary Chinese society and Chinese history, in an effort to fill the lack of ideology which followed the Maoist era. Moreover, in contemporary times China’s international image has changed too; it is now one of the most powerful economies in the world, but lacks of international cultural influence. This study will investigate whether Chinese domestic cultural governance is meant to have an impact on an international level, and how such an objective would be achieved. This research will focus on the formulation and implementation of cultural governance under the president Xi Jinping, approaching the subject in a threefold analysis: theories on Chinese identity and nation-building, international network building and cultural investments under Xi Jinping, and exemplifying case studies in the Shandong province (The Confucius Temple and Kong’s Manson in Qufu, and the Shandong Province Museum in Jinan). Research Questions The questions this research seeks to answer are: how is cultural governance formulated and implemented in Contemporary China? What are the theories behind Chinese nation-building strategies that engage which traditional culture? How should the governmental support to Chinese traditional culture be interpreted? Who is the audience for such narrative and what does it aim for? How does this discourse reflect on a local level, such as the Shandong Province?","['China', 'Shandong', 'Cultural Heritage Management']"

Firstly, an elaboration on two-level negotiation theory is offered. Consequently, and in line with the underlying assumptions of the reviewed literature, three factors are assessed in order to provide an answer to the main research question ‘What factors best explain the coming about of the Joint Plan of Action?’ These are historic events that shaped relations, the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed, and the respective political leadership. This question is highly relevant and topical, as where President Obama in both of his election campaigns openly sought diplomatic rapprochement with Iran, President Trump campaigned the promise to withdraw from the JCPoA and re-impose sanctions. The findings of this thesis show that rationality is not a durable approach to international decision-making. Ineffectiveness of the sanctions did not prevent them from being continued or even aggravated. Rather, a determining factor in the case of Iran seems to be the leadership of both countries. These two factors gave the political momentum to realise the start of negotiations","['Iran Deal', 'Obama', 'Rouhani', 'JCPOA', 'JPA']"
British Holocaust Memorialization from the 1980s to Today,"Timans, Lobke","['Boom, Bart van der']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses British Holocaust memorialization from the 1980s to today, through case studies on the Hyde Park Holocaust Memorial, the Holocaust Exhibition at the Imperial War Museum and the Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre. This thesis shows how the concept of the Holocaust evolved from being relatively ignored, to being a key subject in twentieth century British history. The first hypothesis underlying this research is that whereas earlier attempts at British Holocaust memorialization predominantly focused on the historical uniqueness of the genocide, later initiatives place greater emphasis on its universal significance. This hypothesis is confirmed by the three case studies. After the end of the Cold War the universal lessons of the Holocaust are increasingly addressed, visible in the Holocaust exhibition in the IWM and the Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the Holocaust remains important in all three of the case studies. The second hypothesis reads that whereas earlier attempts at British Holocaust memorialization tend to lack critical self-reflection, later initiatives show more willingness to explore Britain’s sense of guilt. The two latest initiatives, both created after 1989, do address the more negative aspects of Britain’s role in the war. Yet, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed for a greater willingness to explore these controversial issues does not seem to be present. Rather, the third initiative seems to prioritize the traditional heroic story of Britain’s relation to the Holocaust. Scholarship on Holocaust memory in Britain has evolved into a field in its own right, with key contributions of Tony Kushner, Andy Pearce, Dan Stone and David Cesarani. The field is intrinsically interdisciplinary, therefore this thesis necessarily draws upon literature from the fields of British History, Cultural Studies and Memory Studies. It builds upon primary material kept by the Imperial War Museum Archive and the London Metropolitan Archive, as well as materials found online and in the libraries of the University of Leiden and the University of Oxford.","['History', 'Memory Studies', 'British History', 'Holocaust Studies']"

Word-for-word translations have no regard at all for the stylistic features of the source text, and these are therefore largely lost. For a text which relies heavily on stylistic features, such as poetry, this means that a word-for-word translation can actually be an impediment to a full appreciation of the text. Philology and its translation methods originated in the nineteenth century, but more recently, starting from around the 60s and 70s of the twentieth century, the field of translation studies has given rise to alternative ways of thinking about translation. Translation theory has concerned itself with such matters as how best to maintain stylistic features and which word choice might be the most appropriate given the text as a whole. Thus, it seems that there is an opportunity here for a productive cooperation between philology and translation studies. This thesis summarises translation theory which is relevant to the translation of Old English poetry, and directly demonstrates the relevance of translation theory to philology by putting it into practice in the translation of the Old English poem, Deor.","['Philology', 'Old English', 'Deor', 'Translation', 'Translation Theory', 'Poetry']"

It first investigates the literary and material angling framework established by such writers as Sergey Timofeevich Aksakov (1791 - 1859), Leonid Pavlovich Sabaneev (1844 - 1898) and some of their pre-revolutionary successors such as Pavel Gavrilovich Cherkasov, Anatoliy Dimitrievich Shemansky and Feopempt Paramonovich Kunilov. The second part investigates the ways in which Soviet officials instrumentalized the activity to raise health standards and influence social behaviors. They did so by incorporating the activity into the Soviet policy of Fizkul'tura (Physical Culture and Sports). As such, it became tied to labour unions, the komsomol and various other institutions and enterprises which highly attributed to the popularisation of the activity. This soon caused the regime some notorious issues, most notably in the areas of environmentalism and industrial output, which are extensively treated in the third and final part of this research.","['Sabaneev', 'Izaak Walton', 'Recreational Fishing', 'Sport-Fishing', 'Aksakov', 'Fizkultura', 'Environmentalism', 'Shemansky', 'Fishing Literature']"

Op basis van een kwalitatieve retorische analyse van 32 Nederlandse en Russische tv-items over Poetin uit 2017 concludeert dit onderzoek dat het ethos van president Poetin over het algemeen bestempeld kan worden als een despoot, een krachtige leider, of een man van het volk. Deze soorten ethos komen volgens dit onderzoek tot stand door de invloed van stijlmiddelen, framing en quotes/toespraken van Poetin zelf, collega-wereldleiders en/of derden. Vanwege het feit dat Poetins ethos voor een groot deel tot stand komt door middel van journalistieke arbeid, geeft dit onderzoek inzicht in de manier waarop journalisten te werk gaan bij het scheppen van het ethos van een wereldleider en de gevolgen die een dergelijke manier van werken heeft voor Poetins ethos.

Even though we are familiar with the replication of art, there is a rising awareness of the existence of replicating famous artworks through 3D printing for it offers something new compared to previous replication methods (e.g. photography and film). With 3D technologies it is possible to replicate both texture and the visual qualities of art at a high resolution including every minor detail at a very fast pace. Moreover, the prints are made of polymer, a material resistant to environmental changes. With the rapid speed at which technology has been developing in the twenty-first century it will only be a matter of time before 3D prints become more accurate, cheaper to manufacture and – because of the internet and social media – accessible to almost everyone. It is inevitable that a large quantity of high quality one–to–one replications of original artworks will be introduced on the art market, in museums and in people’s homes. This thesis tries to investigate what the existence of indistinguishable prints will mean for the perception and authenticity of the original artwork and whether or not 3D printing can be used in the advantage of the original as a tool to conserve the original. Furthermore this thesis touches upon the possibility of the authentication of the replica and what this will mean for the original work of art in the present and future.","['Conservation', 'Restoration', 'Replication', 'Rembrandt', 'Walter Benjamin', '3D printing', '3D', 'Authenticity', 'Forgery']"

Pinochet’s Legitimate Authority: A Weberian Analysis of the Chilean Dictatorship,"Robin, Clément","['Crevels, Mily']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 1989, after 17 years of state terrorism and authoritarianism, Chile transitioned back to democracy. Since then, many scholars have studied and attempted to delegitimize Pinochet’s dictatorship by focusing on its excessive violence. Not only have they furthered the quasi-axiomatic incompatibility between legitimacy and violence, these scholars have also participated in the creation of an immense literature on Pinochet’s violent practices. Yet, in contrast, the literature explaining the longevity of the regime is disproportionately small. In light of this imbalance, this paper examines how violence allowed this authoritarian regime to be one of the longest and latest dictatorships in Latin America. The nature of violence must be reconsidered in an effort to uncover hidden perpetrators who contributed to the dictatorship’s longevity. To do so, Pinochet’s regime is analysed through a Weberian lens. That is, Weber’s three sources of leadership legitimacy: charisma, traditions and legality. This paper exposes the theoretical weaknesses of the conceptualization of legitimacy and of violence. As long as a theoretical shortcoming of these concepts exists, difficulties to evaluate, judge and react appropriately to authoritarianism in practice will persist. This will, in turn, come with additional pernicious effects such as political and social polarization in post-authoritarian societies.","['Authoritarianism', 'Chile', 'Dictatorship', 'Legitimacy', 'Pinochet', 'Violence', 'Legality']"
Together Yet Fragmented: A Comparative Case Study of the Women and Disability Movements’ Collective Identity Formation and Maintenance in Sierra Leone,"Brink, Amelie van den","['Elbers, Willem']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Despite global progress in reducing inequalities for women and persons with disabilities (PWDs) under the Sustainable Development Goals 5 and 10, in Africa progress has been slower for these two groups. Social movements are often successful in redressing these inequalities as they are affianced in activism and try to represent a group’s collective grievances to governments. Collective identity (CI), or individuals’ shared aspirations, values or interests, is known to play a key role in their success. The more individuals identify with a movement, the more it is able to mobilize and achieve its aims on the ground. Yet, there is a paucity of literature on CI processes from African contexts. Building upon Della Porta & Diani’s (2006) concept of CI formation and maintenance, this study compared how two key social movement organizations of the disability and women’s movements in Freetown, Sierra Leone—the Sierra Leone Union on Disability Issues (SLUDI) and the Women’s Forum (WF)—form and maintain their collective identities (CIs) to see if the same processes work in African contexts. The research is based on a six months field work and a range of qualitative methods. Using Grounded Theory and Historical Methodologies approach, the study reveals that both groups formed and have maintained their CIs similar to Della Porta and Diani’s theory. Both groups formed during the brutal eleven-year Civil War (1991-2002) on the basis of their social traits, or physical/biological characteristics, and a common solidarity. They have been maintained post-conflict (2002-present) through (i) face-to-face interactions at the community level and everyday spaces in order to foster relationships and build new networks, and (ii) creating common meaning and experiences over ‘time’ and ‘space’. This suggests that Western CI concepts do work well in African contexts. Yet, different from the authors, I discovered that both CIs are maintained through information sharing via information communication technologies (ICTs) which help engender a ‘online’ CI, organize and spur lobbying and advocacy events. Within this information sharing tool, I discovered that only the WF uses monthly meetings and it helps engender CI by reinforcing the group’s cultural rituals and symbols. Also, I discovered that despite having CIs, fragmentation has been part of both group’s formation and maintenance processes based on (a) intergroup competition; (b) diversity related issues; and (c) ideological differences. The above listed discoveries as well as conflict is a catalyst in bringing social actors to form a CI are my contributions to the literature. The paper calls for identity work, for key organizations to take better stock of their members interests and for future comparative research to devote equal and more time between organizations, focus on current CI formation processes and use research tools that help to verify information.

Sovereignty in the Brexit Debate: Competing Conceptions between Left- and Right-wing Newspapers,"Bode, Yannic Leon","['Camilo, Erlichmann']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"On June 23, 2016, a referendum in the UK made clear that the EU would lose a member for the first time since its birth in 1951. In a highly intense campaign during the months before the referendum, those in favor of Brexit faced off those that fought to maintain the status quo. Among the many issues debated, sovereignty emerged as heavily contested. This thesis attempts to shed some light on the competing concepts of sovereignty that were used by the two camps by analyzing the discourses of left- and right-wing newspapers in the UK. After performing a discourse analysis of 90 articles that these newspapers published during the runup to the referendum, this thesis concludes that right-wing newspapers view sovereignty as an indivisible, high-value concept that should be held by a national, democratically elected government. By contrast, left-wing newspapers view it as having various degrees, which makes them more willing to cede some of it, if this benefits the nation. Academically, the thesis draws on existing literature about sovereignty and the British understanding of it, expanding on this literature especially through the insights on the British left-wing newspapers’ discourse. Moreover, it seeks to stimulate public debate on sovereignty by drawing attention to these newspapers’ less absolute, more cooperative perspective of the concept.","['Sovereignty', 'Brexit', 'Media', 'News', 'Concepts', 'Discourse', 'Framing', 'Newspaper', 'Populism', 'Conceptualization']"
"Identity-rhetoric, unity & the Warren County protests of 1982","Veen, Esther van 't","['Vries, M.L. de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the autumn of 1982, a relatively small and rural county in North Carolina called Warren County started the environmental justice movement. The allocation of a hazardous landfill to the county sparked this start. Residents argued that the landfill was only allocated to Warren County because the county was predominantly African American and poor. Protesters said that the authorities did not expect African American and poor people to have the political clout to significantly rebel against the construction of the landfill. Yet both African American and white residents strikingly did rise up together in a direct-action protest of roughly four weeks. Only a few years prior, both of those races had still lived segregated in North Carolina with their separate environmental struggles. Now, they were protesting together for an environmental concern. How did this unity come about? This study aims to provide a part of an answer to that question by focusing on how identity-rhetoric generated unity among African American and white people in Warren County. It concludes that two core narratives of race and class as well as the identity issues religion, public health, and the relation between governing authorities and citizens generated a sense of unity that incorporated all people of Warren County and even beyond.","['Warren County', 'Environmental Justice']"

Omroep West kijkt vooruit. Hoe Omroep West-redacteuren constructieve journalistiek ervaren,"Feijnenbuik, Milco","['Hout, T. van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Steeds meer mensen zijn nieuws-moe. Om het imago van de journalistiek bij te stellen, veranderen mediabedrijven van strategie en proberen ze de betrokkenheid van het publiek weer te vergroten. De regionale Omroep West probeert dit door constructieve journalistiek toe te passen: een relatief nieuw journalistiek genre met de focus op meer nuance in verhalen, betrokkenheid van het publiek en het beantwoorden van de ‘wat nu?’-vraag. Uiteindelijk staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: Hoe hebben de redacteuren van Omroep West die zich bezighouden met videocontent de introductie en uitrol van constructieve journalistiek binnen de omroep ervaren? Als uitgangspunt dienen verschillende theorieën van Journalism Studies, zoals over constructieve journalistiek (Gyldensted, 2015; Haagerup, 2014; McIntyre, 2015), rolpercepties (Mellado & Van Dalen, 2014), positieve psychologie (Fredrickson, 2011; Gyldensted, 2015; Pals, 2006; Seligman, 2011) en framing (Bednarek & Caple, 2012; Entman, 1993; Gutmann, 2012). Met deze theorieën als uitgangspunt zijn vervolgens een tiental redacteuren van Omroep West bevraagd over hun ervaringen met de introductie en de uitrol van constructieve journalistiek, evenals over de implementatie ervan in hun werkzaamheden en welke visuele mogelijkheden het concept heeft. Dit gebeurde aan de hand van semigestructureerde diepte-interviews met de redacteuren. De interviews zijn vervolgens getranscribeerd en gecodeerd volgens de methode van Rubin & Rubin (2012). Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de redacteuren positief staan tegenover de constructieve journalistiek als nieuwe werkwijze, maar dat ze kritisch zijn over de manier waarop het concept op de redactie is geïntroduceerd en uitgerold. De kritiek komt voort uit het gebrek aan een discussie over het concept voorafgaand aan de invoering, onduidelijke informatievoorziening en niet-constructieve communicatie vanuit de leiding. Anderzijds zien de redacteuren in het concept zelf de mogelijkheden voor het creëren van meer betrokkenheid met het publiek. Ook merken ze dat de werkwijze van constructieve journalistiek van invloed is binnen hun werkzaamheden. Daarbij worden de visuele mogelijkheden van het genre beperkt door het tijdsgebrek van de journalisten en tijdsrestricties die aan videoreportages vastzitten. Uiteindelijk valt de conclusie te trekken dat de constructieve journalistiek in theorie veel potentie heeft, maar dat voor het slagen daarvan goede aansturing en een open houding van de redacteuren noodzakelijk is.","['constructieve journalistiek', 'positieve psychologie', 'framing', 'visuele journalistiek', 'multimediaal', 'journalistiek', 'emotie', 'betrokkenheid', 'rolperceptie', 'ervaringen']"
Vindicating Jane Austen,"Oostenbrink, Kiki","['Fikkers, L.E.M.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that many research papers, books and articles have been written about Jane Austen. Ever since Mary Lascelles put Austen studies firmly on the map with her 1937 publication Jane Austen and Her Art, there have been ongoing debates about Austen, led by academics like Janet Todd, Deirdre Le Faye, and David Selwyn. One of these debates is about whether or not she should be called a (proto)feminist writer, and authors such as Miriam Ascarelli, Margaret Kirkham, and Claudia L. Johnson have contributed a lot to this subject. This thesis aims to show that Austen was a radical author for her time, who displays some very proto-feministic views in her novels. To prove that Austen was a proto-feminist author, this thesis will analyse Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park, Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey, and relate these novels to the views and opinions of one of the first proto-feminists, Mary Wollstonecraft, written down in Vindication of the Rights of Woman.","['Austen', 'Wollstonecraft', 'Feminism']"
Retranslation in Dutch Film Subtitles - An Exploration of Cultural References in 90s Films,"Jong, Elselien de","['Bovelander, A.M.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores retranslation in subtitling by analysing and comparing subtitles used by or created for VHS and Netflix. To establish whether Dutch subtitling conventions have changed towards a more foreignised and source-oriented approach in the course of the last twenty-five years, extralinguistic cultural references (ECRs) in the films Forrest Gump and Dazed and Confused were analysed and labelled according to translation procedure. Examining two different translations of the same film showed how conventions have indeed changed. In more than one third of the cases, the retranslations appear to be more foreignising than the first translations with regard to their treatment of ECRs. What has caused this change has not been explored in this study, but, as other studies suggested, this may be caused by globalisation, technology, and a better knowledge of the English language and its cultures. One explanation for this, verified by the results, is the many omissions in the VHS versions, which left no room for the retention of ECRs. In contrast, retention is the most common translation procedure in the retranslations. More research into retranslation in subtitling needs to be done to establish whether Dutch subtitles have really become more foreignising.","['Retranslation', 'Subtitling', 'Cultural references', 'Domestication', 'Foreignisation', 'Film']"

The effectiveness of NATO's humanitarian intervention in the cases of Kosovo (1999) and Libya (2011),"Cohill, Leah","['Steen, Bart van der']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the effectiveness of humanitarian intervention in the cases of NATO’s air campaign in Kosovo which lasted from March 24, 1999 – June 10, 1999, and NATO’s air campaign in Libya, which started on March 23, 2001 and continued to October 31, 2011. The challenges of each intervention were similar, with the victims of war in each case needing to feel secure in their homes, while at the same time requiring aid in areas suffering from extended periods of conflict. The debate whether humanitarian interventions are effective in resolving conflict and saving lives and are not purely based on national interest of intervening states, triggered the research question of this thesis: Was NATO’s humanitarian military intervention effective in the cases of Kosovo (1999) and Libya (2011) in terms of achieving short and long-term humanitarian benefits? This question will be answered by looking at each scenario through the focus on the short and long-term effectiveness of NATO’s missions. Each case study is analysed with regards to the number of saved lives as a result of intervention as an indicator of short-term effectiveness, and with regards of the elimination of the political cause of violence as the long-term factor. The results of this research aims to determine the effectiveness of NATO’s future missions and to determine whether it is the right approach to undertake in the future.","['Humanitarian Military Intervention', 'NATO', 'Just War', 'Kosovo', 'Libya']"

The objective of the filmmakers is to raise questions about how to understand somebody else’s experiences, what it means to insert oneself as a filmmaker into the lives of others and how to make the spectator aware of these issues. They do so by using formal methods that are usually associated with fiction filmmaking and by foregrounding the film’s construction. Since the filmmakers do not offer a conclusive perspective on the story or an interpretation of the images, the spectator is made to invest his or her own experiences, which are equally valuable as those of the filmmakers and the subjects of the films. Taking Jacques Rancière’s emancipated spectatorship as a guideline, I will investigate which formal methods associated with fiction filmmaking can employed to activate the spectator, how, and to what effect. I have divided my thesis into three chapters that each treats a specific formal method: identification through ambiguous focalisation; the uncertain relation between voice, text, and image; and database logic as an alternative to narrative logic.","['documentary', 'film', 'hybrid', 'focalisation', 'voice', 'database logic']"

Modi’s construction of national identity: how to engage with the Belt & Road Initiative?,"Braam, Berend","['Black, L.O.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"India’s ambivalent engagement with China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is often explained via the same dichotomy as the overall Sino-Indian relationship: either realist scepticism or liberal optimism. Academic literature on the topic demonstrates the inadequacy of these paradigms in explaining India’s ambivalence towards engagement with the BRI. This thesis goes beyond the dichotomy of Realism and Idealism and incorporates the significance of the constructions of discourse and identity. The analysis employs a Post-structuralist discourse analysis based on the work of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, whose framework can be used to analyse both how discourses of national identity are constructed, and how they are connected to foreign policy choices. In this thesis, Laclau and Mouffe’s framework is applied to the discourse surrounding national identity constructed by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and its relation to the Indian engagement with the BRI. Modi’s speeches as Prime Minister will be analysed to evince three discursive channels that together construct India’s identity: ‘Multipolarity’, ‘Great Power Recognition’, and ‘Rule of Law’. Together these three discourses construct an image of India as a state that recently achieved great power status, a state adhering to the existing international norms and rules, a champion of the liberal international order, and a promoter of multilateral connectivity initiatives. Within these discourses, BRI is projected as an initiative that does not follow international rules and norms, has the potential to convert the region into a Chinese unipolar Asia, forms a threat to India’s great power recognition, and is constructed along the exact opposite values that India adheres to. The argument highlights the temporal, ethical, and spatial contradictions in the construction of this identity. Because of these discordant dimensions India employs a conflicting rationale behind its engagement with BRI. Thus far, its engagement has been marked by hesitance and can thus be interpreted by both realists and liberal thinkers as a form of competition or cooperation. The heart of Indian foreign policy is not a realist security nor liberal economic dilemma, but a Post-structural ‘identity dilemma’: who is India, and how does it see the world?","['Belt & Road Initiative', 'Sino-Indian Relationship', 'Discourse Analysis', 'Narendra Modi']"

Economic Interdependence and Security: A Discourse Analysis of WTO Accessions,"Bozicas, Hugo","['Foulon, Michiel']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"States have used different justifications for acceding to the WTO, mostly through economic or security terms (or both). Considering the existing debates on economic interdependence, this thesis seeks to explore to what extent Latvia and Yemen invoked security as a justification for joining the WTO. This question becomes relevant as we assess the existing positions regarding free trade. Proponents of free trade, either in academia or in government, have mostly mentioned and based their case upon economic gains, but many of those proponents have also put forward the importance of trade regarding economic interdependence and security. Indeed, a great part of the current literature in international political economy (IPE), as well as in security and conflict studies, argues that trade between countries is beneficial for security reasons, as it disincentives countries to go to war with a country with whom they benefit from through economic gains. To analyse state justifications, I am using Discourse Analysis (DA), which aims to inquire whether liberal and/or realist claims about the relationship between economic interdependence and security are in fact present in discursive and textual justifications made by states. Through the analysis of the discourse of foreign policy executives of Latvia and Yemen, this thesis has found that, indeed, FPEs and States often frame their discourse in terms of security when joining the GATT/WTO.","['interdependence', 'trade', 'security', 'discourse analysis', 'wto', 'accession', 'yemen', 'latvia']"

Studies show that swear words are culturally specific, based on tabooization or demonization of language and events in certain cultures. In the United States, slavery has been demonized, and certain swear words were used to obtain power over other people, namely slaves. This thesis aims to explore the offensiveness of the swear words used in movies about slavery in the United States and the Netherlands. The offensiveness of these swear words was rated using a survey in English for Americans and a Dutch translation of this survey for people from the Netherlands and Flanders. The results show that adjectives and the use of the singular or plural form can influence the offensiveness of swear words. However, context has the most significant influence. In the translation of swear words in the movies Django Unchained and 12 Years a Slave, the choice has often been made to translate the swear words consistently. The offensiveness rating shows that this might not always be the closest equivalent in terms of connotation.","['Swearing', 'Slavery', 'Translation', 'Subtitling', 'American culture', 'Dutch culture']"

The representation of corruption, both in Follett’s work and in the Medieval English church, however, has not yet been studied to its fullest extent. This thesis aims to explore whether Follett has successfully depicted the Medieval church of the twelfth century by further delving in to the several depictions of corruption that are featured in the novel, and to examine whether these can also be attributed to the Medieval church Follett is aiming to describe. Financial corruption is attested in the world of Follett by the uncertainty as to where the money to build the Kingsbridge comes from. In contrast, it is seen in the Catholic church in the appearance of indulgences. The question whether indulgences can be linked to corruption will be answered by looking at the way Follett has decided to include any form of these contracts. Indulgences were, in fact, an inventive means to have a cathedral built. The erection of the New Saint Peter’s Basilica was supported by financial support of indulgences. Historians, predominantly Protestant, in the nineteenth century have castigated the practice of indulgences. 3 This thesis also aims to present an impression as to in what extent our ideas of corruption in Medieval England has been shaped by these ideas. By including corruption of power and the corruption of faith and looking at it in both Follett’s work and the Medieval English church, this thesis will present a satisfactory answer to the question whether the picture Follett presents is a valid example of a Medieval view of the church.","['medieval', 'pillars of the earth', 'ken follett', 'church', 'medieval corruption']"

The Crimean Annexation in the Media: Framing Analysis of American and Russian News,"Vries, Nora de","['David, Maxine']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"After the end of the Cold War, US – Russia relations have been fluctuating. In recent years, they have been deteriorating, partly because of the annexation of Crimea by Russia in March 2014. The portrayal in the media of the other has become increasingly negative in both states, and public opinion polls show that an increasing number of Americans and Russians saw each other as “unfavourable” in the months after the annexation. The purpose of this thesis is to examine how the annexation was framed in both American and Russian news. It employs a deductive framing analysis, using five pre-defined, issue-specific frames, that were derived from the literature. The dataset consists of two articles each out of two Russian and two American newspapers. The thesis concludes that American and Russian news have framed the annexation differently: American news framed the annexation as an aggressive Russian act, whereas Russian news framed it as a result of the Crimean people freely expressing their will to reunite with Russia. As media has an influence on public opinion, the results of this research partly explain the decline of respective favourability in public opinion.","['framing analysis', 'media', 'news media', 'us - russia relations', 'crimean annexation']"

Especially regional conflicts are highly interconnected with many causes and stakeholders, requiring the right collaborations between local, regional and international institutions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the African Union as a regional actor versus the United Nations as an international actor in addressing these complex challenges. The underlying motive is to research regional competences, difficulties and possibilities in the role as security actor. To do this, the regional and international response to the militant group Boko Haram in Nigeria is used to provide insight in the different dimensions of this conflict. It is argued that on the one hand, the African Union can act faster and is more relevant in cases of a regional conflict, but on the other hand suffers from a lack of neutrality. Besides this, the amount of resources and authority is limited, and financial means and legitimacy have mainly been provided by the United Nations up until now. Although the extent of influence is difficult to measure, the African Union has the potential to be of more significance and to increase its influence in effectively addressing regional conflicts on the African continent.","['African Union', 'United Nations', 'Security', 'African agency', 'Nigeria', 'Boko Haram', 'Regionalism', 'Regional organizations', 'International organizations', 'Conflict management']"

Hoe gebruiken we 'eigenlijk' eigenlijk?

Deze twee elementen kunnen zich zowel manifesteren op een inhoudelijk als op een illocutionair niveau. In dit onderzoek wordt gekeken hoe eigenlijk in vraagzinnen wordt gebruikt. Hiervoor wordt informeel taalgebruik uit het geschreven corpus SoNaR gebruikt. Uit de gegevens komen verschillende observaties naar voren. Zo blijkt dat, in tegenstelling tot in mededelingen, eigenlijk in het grootste deel van de vraagzinnen een illocutionaire functie kent. Daarnaast blijkt dat als eigenlijk enkel een niet-illocutionaire lezing oproept, eigenlijk zich altijd in een bijzin bevindt. Dit betekent niet dat eigenlijk in een hoofdzin niet ook een inhoudelijke functie op kan roepen: er kan sprake zijn van een ambigue functie. Vaak is er dan sprake van pensive gebruik van eigenlijk. Daarnaast is het ook mogelijk dat eigenlijk in de bijzin een illocutionaire lezing krijgt, wellicht omdat eigenlijk hier syntactisch-hiërarchisch in de hoofdzin moet worden geïnterpreteerd. Het type vraagzin lijkt niet uit te maken voor de functie die eigenlijk vervult: de observaties over de relatie tussen de functie van eigenlijk en de positie in hoofd- en bijzin blijven terugkeren. Hoe de positie van eigenlijk in hoofd- en bijzinnen invloed uitoefent op de functie van eigenlijk zal onderzoek met een grotere en representatievere dataset aan moeten tonen: de dataset is nu nog te klein om hier definitieve uitspraken over te doen. Toekomstig onderzoek zou zich ook kunnen richten op de invloed van intonatie en omgevingspartikels op de analyse van eigenlijk.

Our study is a contribution to the ManyBabies 1 project (Bergmann et al., 2018), which is the first large-scale replication project in infant research. We use the head-turn preference procedure and test all the infants at the age of 8-12 months with the stimuli in North American English. We hypothesize that the infants in the present study prefer IDS to ADS because of IDS exaggerated prosodic properties. The linguistic content of the stimuli is not available to the infants because the stimuli are in English, a language they have not been exposed to before. Moreover, we want to find out if there is any difference between younger (8-month-olds) and older infants (11-month-olds). Previous research has demonstrated that younger infants show a more reliable preference for IDS over ADS in comparison with older infants. We statistically analyze the results using a linear-mixed effects model because of its advantages such as taking into consideration random variables and dealing well with non-normal data.","['infant-directed speech', 'preference', 'pitch', 'replication crisis']"
Social inequality and access to higher education in Chile: Exploring the discussion on gratuidad,"Willemse, Julia Katharina","['Silva, P.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the past two decades discussion has emerged about socio-economic inequality in access to higher education in developing countries. This thesis focuses on the case of the 2011 Chilean student movement in which growing discontent with the existing social inequalities in access to higher education has led to the controversial demand for gratuity. Consequently, the main question that motivates this research is how questions of unequal access to higher education are being related to issues of socio-economic inequality in the gratuidad debate. To answer this question, the first part of the thesis explores the globally frequently observed approaches that explain inequality in higher education. The second part examines the historic and political context of access to higher education in Chile during three crucial periods of time. Ultimately, the third part closely identifies and evaluates the key arguments of both the student movement and the institutional perspective on the significance and viability of the gratuity measure. As the main conclusions indicate, there is a general disagreement about the original cause of socio-economic inequality in the first place. While the student movement often blames neoliberal political ideology for generating inequality, institutional actors tend to accuse specific policies that do not tackle matters of inequality efficiently. Though strong and weak points can be found in the arguments of both perspectives, this thesis concludes that not enough attention is being paid to the underlying factors of general classism and social discrimination in Chilean society as the root causes of socio-economic inequality in higher education.","['higher education', 'socio-economic inequality', 'Chilean student movement', 'neo-liberalism', 'gratuidad']"

"English and Spanish Exclamatives, a comparative study of the left periphery","Palacios Roman, Melany","['Lipták, Anikó']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the study of the left periphery, the syntax of exclamatives is often overlooked. Although research on exclamatives exists (You 2014; Villa-García 2015), comparative research, such as that of Ono & Lasnik (2006), is still even more sparse. In this paper, the left periphery of English and Spanish exclamatives will be explored. By comparing and contrasting data from the two languages, this thesis seeks to further expand upon our knowledge of the left periphery of exclamatives. Using the split CP hypothesis, first proposed by Rizzi (1997), as a framework, this paper specifically focuses on how complementizers are distributed within the left periphery of the exclamative. It explores the identification of exclamatives using the clause type’s syntactic and semantic properties as defined in Zanuttini & Portner (2003). In addition, this paper establishes that A-bar movement occurs in both English and Spanish exclamatives, while head movement occurs only in the latter. I construct data consisting of wh-exclamatives with various word orders and use native speaker input to determine whether these examples are grammatical. Based on these results I analyse the distribution of the constituents that undergo movement. The paper concludes that the syntactic structure of Spanish exclamatives can allow for topicalization and focalization, whereas that of English exclamatives cannot, and it proposes that the complementizers of English exclamatives are positioned higher than those of Spanish exclamatives without the emphatic particle que.","['left periphery', 'comparative', 'syntax', 'exclamatives', 'English', 'Spanish', 'que complementizers', 'split CP']"

Through chapters on the USA, Nicaragua and Germany I have elaborated on the question; if and why states have changed their level of political cooperation with states who formerly supplied their energy needs? Washington favoring shale oil has caused it to remain tied to its Saudi Arabian, Venezuelan, and Nigerian suppliers through the global oil market. Washington refrains from going it alone versus its former suppliers and simply retracted from these markets, highlighting the limits of independence through shale. Nicaragua is truly independent because Managua switched to a renewable-dominated energy system thereby making it independent from Venezuelan oil supplies, as well as the global oil market. The German chapter highlights a clear correlation with bilateral Russo-German relations and German energy policy, but the Energiewende has not made Germany independent from Russian energy.","['Energy independence', 'energy transition', 'fossil fuel import', 'united states foreign relations', 'german foreign relations', 'nicaraguan foreign relations']"

In contrast to other studies, we analyse the extractive industry of a critical raw material originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo rather than focussing on the conflict minerals in the east of the country. First, we identify several barriers to utilization of critical raw materials in general. Additionally, we apply these barriers to the national and transnational trade dimensions that have affected the utilization of cobalt in recent years. Using single-case analysis, we find barriers in both the artisanal mining industry and the formal extraction industry. We find evidence of a clear absence of national and transnational regulated due diligence standards. Moreover, we demonstrate that transnational governance initiatives contribute to a solution in the cobalt mining industry in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Finally, we demonstrate that our findings can be applied more general and that transnational resource control is a remedy to the challenges in utilising critical raw materials needed for low-carbon technologies originating in conflict-prone states.","['Cobalt', 'transnational resource control', 'critical raw materials', 'CRMs', 'DRC']"

By applying theory and methodologies of sociolinguistics in new media, more specifically computer game studies, this is a completely original and multidisciplinary study. Its main hypotheses revolve around communities of practice and politeness theory. First: Multiple communities of practice potentially exist in the social in-game online environment of World of Warcraft. These communities are likely based on different in-game activities players engage in, and what players have achieved in the game environment. Second: Tied to communities of practice, politeness theory is likely applicable in online game environments, despite social distance, power of speakers over one another, and the absolute ranking of impositions being based on game-specific concepts rather than socio-demographic factors. The research conducted involves: participant observation of several in-game environments and communities; the logging of face-threatening acts committed and face-saving strategies employed by players in different game environments; and the analysis of collected data in order to test hypotheses.","['sociolinguistics', 'new media', 'mmorpg', 'politeness theory', 'communities of practice', 'online interaction', 'game communities', 'online identity', 'World of Warcraft']"

The up and down nature of the ties continued up until the first protest of the Arab Spring and the breakout of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. During these events, both countries with known revisionist ambitions and anti-US sentiment gained new spaces of convergence upon which a different dynamic was brought into their relationship. Since 2011, Russia and Iran bolstered their ties and cooperation in numerous areas and on the surface, it might seem like a strong partnership has been formed. Only when analysing the situation in- depth, a continuation of troubled relations appears. This thesis uncovers in detail all there is to know about Russian-Iranian relations and their development since the start of the Syrian conflict. The work focuses on both areas thanks to which the ties flourished as well as limitations the relationship has had. Furthermore, using a well-known theoretical framework, the thesis follows the question whether the countries managed to create an alliance between each other.","['Russia-Iran relations', 'Arab Spring', 'Syrian Civil War', 'Middle Eastern geopolitics', 'Revisionist powers']"

Resistance against European Integration: A Qualitative Study on the Influence of Social and Political Actors on the Opinion of Students,"Ankum, Lars","['Shaev, Brian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Treaty of Maastricht halted the relatively straightforward process towards an ever closer European Union. Opinions about integration became more dispersed and resistance to European integration can now be found in all layers of society. This increased resistance, or its opposite support, can influence the opinion of citizens about European integration. One group of citizens is especially vulnerable, youngsters between 18 and 25, who are still in a period of extraordinary psychological and social change. Goal of this research project is to analyse if resistance or support of these groups of actors influences the opinion of youngsters, in this regard students, about European integration. To analyse the relation semi-structured interviews are employed with students from EU member states studying in the Netherlands. Along resistance and support of actors three additional factors were considered, political and economic considerations, identity and the role of the media. Of these factors a conceptualization of several elements of the identity of a respondent, their personal background, was found to be most important. Resistance and support and economic considerations were of secondary importance. The results point to a smaller influence of external factors than expected. As long as students are satisfied with their socio-economic position they are not influenced heavily by external factors. Instead they formulate their opinion about European integration based on their personal background. Based on the results of my research project European policymakers should focus on economic and social benefits if they want to ensure the support of the young generation. Further research should explore this conclusion in more depth by conducting interviews with a more diverse, lower educated, group of students.","['Euroscepticism', 'Youth', 'Social actors', 'Political actors', 'Qualitative research']"
How Did the Interplay of Material and Ideational Factors Shape European Armament Cooperation Post-Cold War?,"Matthaes, Flora","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This Thesis tests Meyer’s and Strickmann’s (2011) International Relations (IR) theoretical framework on the material-ideational nexus in European defence against a case with extraordinary evidence of material change: the European defence sector after the Cold War (1989–1999). The aim is to investigate how the interplay of material and ideational factors shaped European armament cooperation in this period. Furthermore, the author seeks to derive policy recommendations for the ongoing European Union (EU) defence integration process, also said to be driven by material change. The Thesis finds that the stark post-Cold War material challenges did lead to an ideational shift towards closer European armament cooperation. This shift, however, was not as pronounced as it could have been, considering the magnitude of material change and scope for collaboration. Additionally, material pressures exacerbated existing tensions between different actors and interests in the defence domain. For the current EU defence integration process, this implies that the cohesive effects of material change should not be taken for granted. Instead, a more unitary and comprehensive institutional structure is needed, which still accommodates the different capacities and preferences of member states regarding European armament cooperation.","['European Union', 'Europe', 'Armament cooperation', 'Defence integration', 'Post-Cold War', 'Material', 'Ideational']"

As Chinese dams are being developed at a high pace on the Mekong river, a closer analysis is needed to find out who is behind this development. This thesis explores the Chinese state’s interestsin the field of hydropower development on the Mekong river, looking specifically at the key actors involved and how their power is exerted. Drawing on literature that moves away from state-based analyses, James N. Rosenau’s framework of spheres of authority will be used as a foundation to identify key actors and their authority in the application of hydropower plants on the Mekong. The argument that China indeed needs to be seen as a set of multiple actors with their own goals is tested by means of two case studies on dam construction, one in China and one in Laos. It is found that, in accordance with the hypothesis, one should not stare blindly at China as a monolithic state, but observe several actors within hydropower development that have different goals.","['China', 'Hydropower', 'Hegemony', 'Authority', 'Dam']"

This became evident in Putin’s 2013 Valdai speech when the West was accused of “denying moral principles and all traditional identities” while strengthening national identity was emphasized. Therefore, this thesis interrogates the claim that Russia and the West are departing company because of fundamental cultural differences to answer the research question: How has the increasing importance of Russian national cultural identity since Putin came to power influenced the possible divergence between Russian policies and Western liberal standards? This question is answered by a multiple-case study on the Russian HIV/AIDS epidemic and Russian media censorship. The results of both case studies demonstrate that a divergence is present, but do not show a direct connection between the increasing importance of national cultural identity and Western liberal values. Nevertheless, national cultural identity serves as an indirect motivator to implement policies and thereby expand governmental influence.","['Conservatism', 'Russia vs. The West', 'Western liberal standards', 'HIV policies Russia', 'Media Censorship Russia', 'National Cultural Identity']"

Waar ouderwetse propaganda tot doel had de ontvanger tot actie aan te zetten, lijkt desinformatie vooral bedoeld om de ontvanger te verwarren en in een passieve staat te brengen.

Aan de hand van deze kenmerken is de case – de verslaggeving over MH17 door RT en Spoetnik – bestudeerd.

A common E.U energy policy started in 2006 when it became understood that a common energy policy was needed to face the challenges that appeared in the beginning of the 21st century. These were higher prices and lower indigenous production, a growing assertiveness of producing countries and competition for resources with the newly emerging economies of China and India. The internal energy policy was based on the idea that liberal and integrated markets would lead to energy security. The external aspect of the energy policy was to promote its internal market regulations and create a common regulatory space with countries beyond its borders.

The film is not only situated in-between the classical and the art film narrative but furthermore it marks the transitional crossroad at which Spain was at that moment: namely, the end of the Franco regime and the beginning of a democratic Spain. Because of the unique moment of production of Cría Cuervos it is so interesting to investigate the political as well as non-political idea behind the film. Questions such as how the film makes use of both, traits of the classical and modern art film cinema narrative and consequently if the film should be read as a classical or modern art film after all will be addressed. Furthermore, the thesis investigates whether Cría Cuervos can be rather understood as a mode of reading. Therefore, it will be analyzed as an allegory in comparison to the narrative analysis.","['Spanish cinema', 'Carlos Saura', 'Franco era', 'Allegory', 'Childhood', 'Modern art cinema', 'Narrative cinema']"
Borrowed Profanity versus Boundless Purism,"Hofwegen, Rosalie van","['Foster, A.A.', 'Smakman, D.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"While swearing is a type of linguistic behavior we exhibit ourselves and experience with others in daily life on regular basis, it has received fairly little attention in relation to Dutch so far. Though it is noted by various researchers that the influx of English-borrowed swearwords is continuously growing and gaining popularity (Rassin & Muris, 2005; Zenner, Speelman & Geeraerts, 2014; van Sterkenburg, 2008a, 2008b; Hindriks & van Hofwegen, 2014), little to no research has been conducted on its current role and proportion within the current Dutch swearing lexicon. This thesis seeks to provide an insight on the current swearing lexicon in Dutch with special regards to the role of native Dutch swearwords and Englishborrowed swearwords within this lexicon. The data for this research have been obtained through a survey that was filled in by 153 native speakers of Dutch who were born and raised in the Netherlands and raised monolingually. The main findings of this thesis showed that native Dutch swearwords are still preferred to Englishborrowed ones but also that their use is context-bound and situation-bound; in more serious situations, speakers preferred the use of Dutch swearwords, while in less serious situations they were more inclined to use an English-borrowed swearword. Furthermore, sociolinguistic factors such as age and gender influence a speaker’s swearing while regional background, educational background, religiosity and level of English do not. Though this study provides a small-scale insight on the current swearing lexicon and swearing behavior in Dutch, a larger-scaled study on swearing in Dutch with a broad variety of participants would definitely prove useful and interesting.","['Linguistics', 'Swearing', 'Borrowing', 'Sociolinguistics', 'Swearing in Dutch', 'English-borrowed swearwords']"

Het onderzoek lijkt er op te wijzen dat de perceptie van verwelkoming een impact heeft op het land waarmee een migrant zich verbonden voelt. Behulpzaamheid vanuit officiële instanties werd door respondenten gewaardeerd, maar is uiteindelijk maar een beperkt onderdeel van de perceptie van verwelkoming. Naast de officiële opvang speelt namelijk de verwelkoming vanuit de sociale omgeving van de migranten een grote rol: veel respondenten die zich maar ten dele of niet met Nederland verbonden voelen hebben aangegeven in meer of mindere mate last te hebben gehad van stigmatisering, waardoor ze zich niet volledig hebben kunnen ontwikkelen en vestigen in de Nederlandse maatschappij.","['migration', 'Afghanistan', 'perception of welcome', 'integration', 'Afghans in the Netherlands']"

Chinese International Energy Policy and Its Diversification Prospects,"Liubomirova, Polina","['Wang, Jue']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Currently, China is one of the most important actors in the international energy arena. Increasing economic growth requires The People’s Republic of China (the PRC), first, to expand its energy supply providers (diversification), and, second, to make this supply a secure one. Due to the rapidly changing market of energy, it is important to understand what factors place the main stress on the current energy policies and drive it to change. The essay addresses the following question: Why is China altering its current energy policy in the Middle East and pursuing diversification of energy supply in Central Asia and Russia? There are four main triggers pushing the PRC to a change: security, environment, technology and geopolitics. These four are acting as both separate issues and interconnected factors. The essay argues that China's high dependence on the Middle Eastern energy exports does not allow the PRC to switch to other suppliers completely in the nearest future. On the contrary, friendly relations between Persian Gulf countries and China should be used towards the creation of the triad energy framework (China—Central Asia—Russia or the Middle East—Central Asia+Russia—China). Central Asia serves as both the primary secure supplier of energy to China and as the transit point. This transit option connects China with the Middle East through the land which are the safe supplying routes Chinese government is pursuing. Moreover, the growing worldwide environmental concern requires China to reconsider its current energy supply strategies. Thus, the geopolitical switch may stimulate more environmentally friendly consumption and production of energy by the means of gas. Finally, gas and more specifically the Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) has a bigger potential in Central Asian, Russia, and China than in the Middle East allowing China not only to pursue cleaner energy supply but to overcome certain security issues.",['Chinese Energy Policy']
Conflict sites in Spanish-English mixed nominal constructions: Testing alternative predictions,"Korver, Belinda","['Parafita Couto, Maria del Carmen', 'Smakman, Dick']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates mixed nominal constructions, both complex (with an adjective) and simplex. Such constructions create potential conflict sites in Spanish-English code-switching. Spanish and English differ for (1) adjective-noun order: Spanish typically has post-nominal adjectives, whereas English has pre-nominal adjectives, and (2) grammatical gender: Spanish has a binary gender system, while English does not. A multi-task method was conducted in the Spanish-English bilingual community in Puerto Rico. The tasks comprised of an elicitation task (cf. director-matcher task, Gullberg, Indefrey, and Muysken 2008) and an auditory grammaticality judgment task. The predictions from the Matrix Language Framework (MLF, Myers-Scotton 2002) and a minimalist analysis from Cantone and MacSwan (2009) are tested against the collected data. The results from both tasks tend to indicate that the Matrix Language approach provides better predictions than the minimalist approach in every respect except for adjective-noun order constructions in the judgment task. This slight preference, however, is not significant. Toy task results for gender assignment in Spanish determiners indicate that there is a preference for the assignment of default gender, i.e. masculine in Spanish, rather than gender that is analogue to the translation equivalent of the noun. This preference is confirmed by judgment task results that include simple nominal constructions, but not by judgment task results for complex nominal constructions. I assume that adjectival presence in complex nominal constructions may have to do with this. Implications of my results for the theories and the methodologies are discussed.","['code-switching', 'Spanish-English', 'bilingualism', 'Puerto Rico', 'determiner-noun', 'adjective-noun', 'gender']"

Podemos and their Latin American Connection,"Clarke, Nathaniel Jonathan","['Storm, Eric']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The biggest issue for Podemos and its Latin American connection, is their link to Venezuela. Many Spaniards, in particular conservative sympathisers, feel uneasiness towards the Latin American country because they consider it to be a radical dictatorship, in part because it has been presented in this way by the Spanish media. Podemos knows that any link to Venezuela will immensely damage the image the electorate have of it, thus preventing Podemos from appealing to the majority of Spaniards. It is this paper's objective to investigate and assess the extent to which Podemos and its leaders see the leftist populist regimes in Latin America as an inspiring example. To find out what exactly Podemos likes and dislikes about these Latin American countries, their leaders and the policies that have made them so popular. Is Podemos bringing twenty-first-century socialism to Spain? Does it plan on implementing similar policies? Is it copying the discourses used by Correa, Morales, Chávez and Maduro?

"Hutu, Tutsi and the Germans: Racial Cognition in Rwanda Under German Colonial Rule","Scholz, Anton","['Gewald, Jan-Bart', 'Goede, Meike de']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis approaches the complex of ethnicity in Rwanda under German colonial rule (1885-1916) and focuses on how Rwandan social structures were perceived by German colonialists and influenced by their policy. The research question – what was the German approach to ethnicity in the former protectorate of Rwanda, what informed it, and how did it impinge on the society? – already suggests that this period is severely under-researched. Challenging the contemporary discourse that it was the Belgian rule under which Hutu and Tutsi were divided into two premordial entities, the thesis argues that it was earlier, during the German period, that social differences were introduced as racial differences. This argument gets developed on the basis of archive material and with a focus on four key personalities who were implementing German racial ideology in Rwanda by translating it into colonial policy. Without attributing direct responsibility for the 1994 genocide to the German rule, the case shows that the search for root causes of ethnic conflict in Rwanda must consider this timespan as a crucial incision for the further developments that tore society apart along racial lines.","['Colonialism', 'German rule', 'Ethnicity', 'Rwanda']"

Reader Responsibility in Knowledge Organisation,"Ferguson, Lea Maria","['Weel, Adriaan van der']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The possibilities for exerting reader responsibility as an expression of democracy on the Internet are manifold. Reader responsibility may be seen as the process of finding, accessing, making sense of, interpreting, judging, and putting to use the information that can be gained through reading, and thereby turning it into knowledge. However, the 'democratisation discourse' on the Internet is often (mis-)used to promote mere economic aims, even under the guise of ‘digital socialism’. This is not only an obstacle to understanding reader responsibility and the process of reading, but also to gaining access to knowledge and making use of information resources successfully and effectively. It is encouraging to see though that the potential presented by reading and writing is (partly) being implemented. Historically, this occurred through commonplace and reference books, and currently it is happening through Pinterest and Wikipedia - despite some problematic economic and political circumstances. Embracing the responsibilities of the reading process will be conducive to developing the political potential of reading and as such be beneficial for society at large. Despite the connected and implied struggles of this, it is important to realise that readers can only turn information into knowledge and utilise it in their lives by being active and informed.","['Reader responsibility', 'Textual knowledge navigation', 'Commonplace books', 'Reference books', 'Wikipedia', 'Pinterest']"
The Bridget Jones Effect: Translating Culture Specific Concepts in the Dutch and American Versions of the Novel to Preserve the Original Effect,"Bakker, Eva","['Zeven, Katinka']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will examine the question of how to translate culture specific concepts in the Dutch and American translation of the novel Bridget Jones's Diary when the goal is to maintain the original effect of the novel. One of the main decisions a translator will have to make is whether or not to preserve the British character of the novel to make it more authentic or to adapt the novel to other cultures in order to make sure that people in other countries can also identify with Bridget. Whereas Venuti claims that it is a translator’s duty to stay faithful to the source text and thus apply the strategy of foreignization, I will argue in this thesis that a domesticizing translation strategy is preferred when translating Bridget Jones’s Diary; in order to maintain the effect from the original novel, the translators need to translate the British culture specific concepts into American and Dutch culture specific concepts. This thesis will use several translation theories to link culture specific concepts to the struggle of translators to maintain the original effect of the novel.","['Culture Specific Concepts', 'Foreignization', 'Domestication', 'Bridget Jones']"

A religion in progress: How the Africans and their descendants managed to protect Afro-Brazilian Candomblé in 19th century Brazil,"Slingerland, Jessamine","['Williams, Corey']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In Brazil, Afro-Brazilian Candomblé is one of the historically marginalized religions that recently became to attract many new devotees and took up a status as a national religion. The survival of Candomblé is fascinating because, for much of its history, the white authorities in Brazil had done all they could in order to crush every aspect that kept the black people in Brazil connected to their African roots. The notion that Candomblé is nowadays a thriving religion in spite of its historical repression has motivated the main question of this thesis. This question asks how the Africans and their descendants managed to protect the Candomblé religion in a 19th century Brazil that was, on behalf of the authorities, marked by significant efforts to annihilate any other religion different from Catholicism. Based on a theory about social interaction, this thesis will argue that the African slaves were able to protect their Candomblé practices and rituals because they began to stage a single performance as a team, with the purpose of deceiving the white authorities. In addition, while the Africans and their descendants would collectively uphold a facade of conformity as soon as they interacted with their authorities, there was a continuation of Candomblé beliefs, practices, and rituals behind the scenes. This combination of a convincing façade of conformity on the one hand, and a secret continuation of Candomblé beliefs and practices on the other hand is what most clearly led to the protection of the religion in the 19th century.","['Brazil', 'African Slaves', 'Candomblé', 'Religion', 'Performance', 'Facade']"

Zes dagen zonder rustdag: De rol van Joseph Luns in de Arabisch-Israëlische vredesonderhandelingen van 1967-1971,"Schinkelshoek, Rosa Valèry","['Braat, Eleni']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,This article focusses on the role of Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Luns in the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations of 1967-1971. The main question is why Joseph Luns took on a more active role in the Arab-Israeli conflict after the end of Six-Day War. To answer this question this article analyses Luns as a diplomat and politician and his understanding of the world order during the Cold War and the international relations within that order. Joseph Luns attached great importance to the division and balance of the world in East and West and his decisions as minister were based upon this believe. Before the outbreak of the Six-Day War the relationship between the Netherlands and Israel was relatively strong and characterized by Dutch support for Israel during wars and UN votes. The Six-Day War and its aftermath jeopardized the reputation of the Netherland in the Middle East and showed Joseph Luns that the instability of the region could disturb the international balance of that time. To prevent escalation Luns positioned himself in the peace negotiations that followed the war. He believed that by doing so he could not only help find a lasting and acceptable solution for the Arab-Israeli conflict but could also strengthen the relationship between the Netherlands and the Arabic world and protect Dutch interests.,"['Joseph Luns', 'Arabisch-Israëlisch conflict', 'Zesdaagse Oorlog', 'Nederland en Israël', 'Midden-Oosten conflict']"

A Path to Freedom: A methodological study,"Nasiri, Shahin","['Sneller, H.W.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In the western philosophical tradition, the notion of ‘freedom’ has been approached as a ‘concept’. A concept is a philosophical tool to establish a definite representation of the addressed notion. In this sense, the conceptual approach to freedom has, in the modern era, led to the formulation of two dominant concepts of freedom, i.e. positive and negative concept of freedom. The conceptual approach to freedom holds sway over the current legal, political, sociological, and philosophical debates. This methodological study puts the adequacy of this approach into question. As such, the main task of this research is to articulate a complex method, whereby one could rethink the notion of ‘freedom’ from the standpoint of the other. This method of inquiry will be cultivated, through the exploration and examination of Heidegger’s phenomenological method, Wittgenstein’s account of linguistic meaning and Castoriadis’s social-historical approach. The dialogical composition of these three perspectives enables us to give birth to a new complex method, by which one could investigate the notion of ‘freedom’ from the standpoint of the other.","['Freedom', 'Otherness', 'phenomenology', 'the social-historical', 'Imaginary signification', 'ordinary language analysis']"

France is a paradigmatic case of language planning and language policy, and even today many of the measures are still in place as to ensure that the usage of English is kept to a minimum. This thesis investigates the attempts by the French government to limit the use of English in the public domain, and asks the question whether these attempts have an impact on the acquisition of English as a second language in France. By examining not only the historical origins of France’s language management, but also the current dissemination of opinions and attitudes in the media, it can be concluded that many of the negative effects emanating from the government measures, such as relatively low English proficiency, are the result of France’s unchanged linguistic culture predating the French Revolution that continues to fuel France’s language policy today.","['sociolinguistics', 'second language acquisition', 'language policy', 'EFL', 'language attitudes']"

D’abord est expliqué pourquoi Voltaire est allé en Angleterre. Dans ce pays il a découvert la littérature par le théâtre et par le contact qu’il avait avec des auteurs anglais. Ensuite sont démontrés les buts que Voltaire avait avec ces lettres. Tout d’abord, il voulait faire connaître aux Français la littérature anglaise. Voltaire a fait cela en évoquant de grands auteurs et les ouvrages clés de la littérature anglaise. Il a utilisé plusieurs procédés stylistiques pour les mettre en valeur. Dans son livre, il voulait aussi faire passer ses idées, qui sont liées à la société et le domaine des lettres. Il estime que la position sociale des écrivains est meilleure en Angleterre. Pourtant, il aime mieux les institutions en faveur des sciences et des beaux arts de la France. Pour finir, il critique la religion dans ses lettres, surtout dans ses traductions.","['Voltaire', 'Lettres philosophiques', 'Angleterre']"

The Adjective in Dutch-French code switching,"Vanden Wyngaerd, Emma","['Parafita Couto, M. Carmen']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the word order and adjectival agreement patterns in French- Dutch code switched DPs. It examines the predictions made by two theoretical frameworks: the Minimalist Program (MP) (MacSwan 2009) and the Matrix Language Framework (MLF) (Myers-Scotton and Jake 2009) and compares these predictions to data gathered in an elicitation task and a grammaticality judgment task. This thesis is the first study investigating the adjectival agreement in code switched DPs. The results of the experiments show no unambiguous confirmation of the predictions of either framework. However, statistical analysis of the data collected in the grammaticality judgment task showed that the MP is a better predictor for the grammaticality judgments, as sentences predicted to be grammatical by the MP were rated higher than sentence predicted to be ungrammatical by the same model. This difference was statistically significant to the 5% level. There was no significant difference in rating for the predictions of the MLF. This results of the judgment task in combination with the results of previous research highlight the importance of an integration of data from both naturalistic and experimental settings. Furthermore, the lack of unambiguous results from the grammaticality judgment task argues for an integration of other experimental methodologies, such as psycho- and neurolinguistic ones.","['codeswitching', 'Dutch-French', 'Minimalism', 'Matrix Language Framework']"

'Mediterranisation' of Celto-Germanic religion,"Schelfhout, Aaron A.E.","['Naerebout, F.G.']",2012,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis I have examined if and how indigenous religion in north-western Europe (specifically Roman Britain and northern Gaul) changed after the Roman colonization. The basis of my research is the idea that agriculture is a very important factor in shaping culture and religion. Ton Derks (1998) has stated that in northern Gaul, the southern territories were much more accepting of Roman religious customs because the agricultural basis of their society, namely arable farming, was the same as that of the Romans. In the north, were stockbreeding was much more important, people were much less accepting of Roman culture and as a consequence religious habits did not change much after the Roman conquest. In other words, the core of people's beliefs remained the same. I have applied this theory to Roman Britain, as the differences between the highland and lowland zones present us with a very similar agricultural division. This research has shown that, while indigenous religion and world views did become more Roman (especially in the areas were arable farming was more important than stockbreeding), native populations also attempted to preserve, or create new local traditions to retain their own identity. Such changes were not always directly related to local forms of agriculture, but areas were arable farming was dominant were far more susceptible to them than the more conservative pastoral zones.","['Religion', 'Celtic', 'Germanic', 'agriculture', 'matres', 'sculpture', 'Britain', 'Gaul', 'highland zone', 'lowland zone']"
Het informatiesysteem en -netwerk van de Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie,"Vriend, Nico","['Jeurgens, K.J.P.F.M.']",2012,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze thesis wordt nagegaan hoe het informatiesysteem van de VOC werkte. Hoe kwam de compagnie aan haar informatie, hoe werd deze geregistreerd, en door wie werd deze geregistreerd? Welke weg legden de documenten binnen het informatienetwerk van de compagnie af? Door de Amerikaanse antropologe Ann Stoler wordt verondersteld dat een archief een zekere ‘pulse’ heeft, een polsslag waarmee documenten door een organisatie in verschillende snelheden en hoeveelheden werd uitgewisseld. In dit onderzoek wordt gekeken welke onderwerpen in de jaren 1737-1750 in de administratie van de VOC het meest van belang waren, en wordt onderzocht of er onderwerpen zijn waarover met een ‘verhoogde polsslag’ besluiten werden genomen, rapporten werden geproduceerd en correspondentie werd uitgewisseld. Ann Stoler introduceert ook het concept van het ‘archival event,’ gerelateerd aan deze verhoogde polsslag. In dit onderzoek wordt een methode gepresenteerd waarmee archival events mogelijk terug te vinden zijn in de archieven. De vraag of dit een werkbare methode oplevert, is een subvraag van dit onderzoek. De hoofdvraag van deze thesis is of er een ‘pulse’ waarneembaar is in de archieven van de VOC en of – door mogelijke ‘archival events’ op te sporen – het informatiesysteem en –netwerk van de VOC in kaart gebracht kan worden. Twee van de gevonden mogelijke archival events – de Chinezenmoord in Batavia (1740) en een administratieve crisis rond het buitenkantoor in Perzië (1737) – worden daartoe nader uitgediept. De thesis is gebaseerd op onderzoek in de archieven van de Heeren XVII (geborgen in het Nationaal Archief, Den Haag) en de Hoge Regering (Arsip Nasional Republik Indonesia, Jakarta).","['Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)', 'Information system', 'Information network', 'Document flows', 'Archival events', 'Ann Stoler', 'Heeren XVII', 'Hoge Regering', 'Chinese Massacre in Batavia (1740)', 'Persia', 'Batavia']"
