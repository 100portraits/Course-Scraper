Trauma en Hysterie: Studies on Hysteria toegepast op El Saadawi's Firdaws en Zakiyya,"De Jong, Julia","['Bruning, Jelle']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit werkstuk is een analyse van twee vrouwelijke karakters uit twee romans van Nawal El Saadawi, Firdaws uit Woman at Point Zero en Zakiyya uit God Dies by the Nile, vanuit het perspectief van Studies on Hysteria van Josef Breuer en Sigmund Freud. Volgens Breuer en Freud betekent hysterie dat er conversie plaatsvindt van mentale stress naar fysieke symptomen door trauma, en ze laten dit zien in 5 voorbeelden van vrouwen met hysterie. Deze anamneses heb ik gebruikt in mijn analyse van Firdaws en Zakiyya. Firdaws uit Woman at Point Zero heeft trauma’s door haar besnijdenis toen ze jong was en door het seksueel misbruik in haar jeugd. Daarnaast heeft Firdaws een trauma omdat haar trauma omdat haar vertrouwen gebroken wordt door verschillende personen. Er heeft bij Firdaws conversie opgetreden en ze heeft fysieke symptomen zoals angstaanvallen en hallucinaties. Zakiyya uit God Dies by the Nile heeft trauma’s door haar besnijdenis, mishandeling door haar man en uitbuiting door de burgemeester van haar dorp. Dit trauma uit zich in herbelevingen met heftige hallucinaties, wat komt door een splitsing tussen het bewustzijn en het onderbewuste. Firdaws en Zakiyya zijn dus allebei hysterisch volgens de definitie van Breuer en Freud. Dit laat zien dat Nawal El Saadawi misschien geïnspireerd was door Breuer en Freud toen ze de twee romans schreef.","['Trauma', 'Hysteria', 'Nawal El Saadawi', 'Arabic Literature', 'Sigmund Freud']"
Revolutionaire Rijmpjes: Politieke en maatschappijkritische poëzie in het Egyptisch-Arabisch,"Krösschell, Maureen Louise","['Bruning, Jelle']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"هذا البحث عن الشعر السياسي و الاجتماعيّ باللهجة العامّية في مصر لمدة تزيد عن مائة سنة. أقابل الزجل و الشعر طوال فترة الربيع العربي. فالزجل نوعٌ شعريٌ قديم، وهذا النوع الشعري أصبح مشهوراً في مصر في 1880 في بدايات الطباعة و الصحافة. الزجالان المهمّان من فترة البداية هما النديم (1844-1896) و صنوع (1839- 1912). الشعر السياسي و الاجتماعيّ كان مهمّاً أيضاً طوال فترة الربيع العربي في مصر، وخصوصاً طوال مدة المظاهرات في ميدان التحرير في القاهرة. كان هناك كثيرٌ من الناس في الميدان والذين كانوا يحتجّون ضد الحكومة باستخدام أنواع شعريّة مثل الهتاف والقصائد. أسّمي هذا الشعر ""شعر التحرير"". سأستخدم في هذا الورقة البحثيّة عدة نظريّات علمية عن الشعر واستخدام اللغة في هذه المقارنة. هذا النظريّات العلمية ستكون الإطار المرجعي. هذا البحث يظهر أن هناك أوجه من التشابه بين ""شعر التحرير"" و الزجل المصري (1880-1950). ""شعر التحرير"" و الزجل متشابهان بالنسبة لإمكانية تحويل القصائد إلى أغاني. الناس قرأوا القصائد مع بعضعم و غنّوا سوية. و كذلك، ""شعر التحرير"" و الزجل متقاربان في المذهب. القصائد تعتبر اشتراكيّة وفيها وطنيّة وتحاكي الشعب. مع ذلك، يختلف ""شعر تحرير"" عن الزجل في بعض النواحي أيضاً. يكون واحد من الاختلافات اللغة. "" شعر التحرير"" بالعامّية و بالفصحى ولكن الزجل يكون بالعامّية فقط. بالإضافة إلى ذلك يكون ""شعر التحرير"" أكثر تنوعاٍ من الزجل أما عن الشكل، فالبرغم من الاختلاف، فإنّ البحث يظهر أن الشعر السياسي و الاجتماعيّ القديم يثّرفي الشعر السياسي والاجتماعيّ الحديث","['poëzie', 'Arabisch dialect', 'Egypte']"

To Aid or Not to Aid? Motivations For United Arab Emirates Foreign Aid to Egypt Since 2011.,"Abdellatif, Josephine","['Ennis, Crystal']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the past decades the global foreign aid system has witnessed the rise of a new, or rather re- emerging, group of donors (Woods Ngaire 2008; Momani and Ennis 2012; Young 2017). The UAE is one of these aid donors, having established a foreign aid system in its founding year 1971. Due to the lack of transparency in its aid practices and the small size of the country, the UAE’s aid practices have been understudied. However, some moves towards greater transparency have developed and thus renewed investigation into this question is possible (Almezaini 2012). One of the UAE’s major foreign aid beneficiaries is Egypt, particularly since 2013 when the largest share of UAE foreign aid was directed to the country (MICAID 2014). This thesis analyzes the motivations driving UAE aid to Egypt since 2011. In so doing, it outlines theories of aid allocation and proposes an alternative to the theory of constructivism. Moreover, it posits that the motivations driving UAE aid to Egypt are twofold: a desire to influence Egypt’s political landscape and a perceived threat of rising Muslim Brotherhood and political Islam rhetoric in a regionally influential country.","['United Arab Emirates', 'Egypt', 'Foreign Aid', 'Constructivism']"
Rendaku acquisition at Leiden University: A study of rendaku proficiency and improvement based on Lyman’s Law and lexical strata,"Visser, Joram","['Yoshioka, Keiko']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I will be examining rendaku in the context of second language acquisition. Specifically, I will focus on students attending Japanese language classes at Leiden University and examine how they acquire rendaku proficiency. Earlier research has been done on rendaku acquisition in second language speakers of Japanese, but it is limited and mostly restricted to areas that are either in or close to Japan. For instance, the projects that this thesis draws inspiration from have focused on students whose first language was Chinese or Korean. The present study uses questionnaires targeted at participants with a very different first language: Dutch, which has different etymological roots and shares fewer typological features with Japanese. Not only should this add some more data to the relatively sparse existing pool, but it should also provide a different angle to which existing research can be compared. It is my hope that this will help give a clearer picture of rendaku acquisition in second language speakers as a whole.","['Rendaku', 'Second Language Acquisition', 'Japanese', 'Linguistics']"
The Construction of Kurdish Identity in Syria: The Influence of Kurdish Publications and Other Informal Activities (1971-2000),"Huang, Yushan","['Nalbantian, Tsolin']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the relationship between Kurdish publications and other informal cultural activities and Kurdish identity in Syria under the rule of Hafez al-Assad. In order to Arabise the Kurds, Hafez al-Assad’s government decided to restrict the Kurds’ cultural choices by forcing them to accept the Arabic language and culture instead of their own traditions. In response, Syrian Kurds resisted in many ways to defend their rights, such as promoting Kurdish education, publications, and cultural rallies, which influenced the construction of different Kurdish identities in Syria. Mainstream Kurdish political parties were the major leading power in educational activities and cultural gatherings, which intended to build a gentle ethnic identity that combined the Kurdish peculiarity and the Syrian commonality. By contrast, Syrian Kurdish publications produced by the nationalist intellectuals expressed a more radical national identity. In addition, some Kurdish activists, who were dissatisfied with the leadership of the Kurdish parties, also displayed a radical Kurdish identity with a nationalist tendency in Newroz celebrations. Although Kurdish identities influenced by different powers were different, there were still similarities among them. They all chose cultural activities as their way to emphasise Kurdish consciousness. Meanwhile, these activities enabled Kurds with different identities to communicate with each other, which contributed to the trend of the rise of a more collective Kurdish identity in Syria.","['Kurdish identity', 'Syrian Kurds', 'Kurdish publication', 'Newroz', 'Kurdish education']"
"“One day, I will pass over that wall” Singer Insooni and ethnic identity development as a black-Korean individual in South Korean society","Vanhaecke, Lorenzo","['Breuker, Remco']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"There are many artists in the Korean music industry, but black-Korean singers are not often represented thus far. With an increase in multicultural families in South Korea, this group of people is likely to grow as well in the near future. In order to explore the role of black-Korean individuals in a Korean context, this thesis researched singer Insooni and her ethnic identity development. Phinney’s ethnic identity model was used to assess how Insooni’s identity likely developed throughout her career as a singer. Phinney’s research focused on two main factors called “exploration” and commitment”. Depending on a high or low level for both factors, this results in four possible identity stages: diffusion, moratorium, foreclosure and achievement. This thesis concluded that Insooni likely went through a dynamic development process, described as such by Phinney. The singer may have shown more interest in her Korean ethnicity at first, but as time went on, her exploration and commitment levels for both her Korean and African-American identity increased, which likely resulted in a multi-ethnic identity. This paper offered more insight on the topic of black-Korean individuals and their identity in Korean society.","['Korean music industry', 'ethnicity', 'identity development', 'black-Korean people', 'ethnic identity']"

"Manifestaties van Ingressiviteit: Ingressief, inceptief en inchoatief aspect in het Mandarijn en pre-Tang-Chinees","Bogaards, Maarten","['Sybesma, Rint']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"This thesis is about the expression of ingressive aspect: language elements that focus on the beginning of a situation. The aim is to conduct a fine-grained analysis and comparison of the aspectual semantics of three ‘manifestations of ingressivity’: the ingressive suffix -qilai起來 in Mandarin and the ingressive adverbs chū初 and shǐ始 from pre-Tang Chinese. The comparison reveals both similarities and differences. First, the three ingressive markers share a basic conceptual structure consisting of [+BEGIN] and [+focusBEGIN], but -qilai 起來 additionally consists of the optional component [±STAND UP] due to limited semantic bleaching of the source structure’s lexical semantics, i.e. the verb qǐlai 起來 ‘to stand up’. This explains the fact that Stage Level States selecting -qilai起來 may shift optionally to Activities, as metaphorical extensions of ‘standing up’ (i.e. ‘increase’) license dynamic interpretations. This same optionality may be explained for the pre-Tang Chinese adverbs through the causative potential of the predicate, which likewise optionally entails ‘increasing’. Second, combinatory possibilities can be described for shǐ始 without additional restrictions, while those of -qilai起來 and chū初 can be accounted for with one disjunctive rule each: -qilal起來 requires the predicate to be durative, atelic, or both; chū初 requires it to be dynamic-durative, telic, or both. In terms of ingressive subtypes, this means that chū初 is typically inceptive, -qilai起來 is more inceptive than inchoative, and shǐ始 is actually ingressive in that inceptive and inchoative interpretations are equally available.","['aspect', 'viewpoint aspect', 'ingressive', 'inceptive', 'inchoative', 'Mandarin Chinese', 'Classical Chinese', 'pre-Tang Chinese', 'theoretical linguistics', 'semantics']"
The Manufactured Woman: The Position of Women in the Islamic Republic of Iran,"Zwemstra, Mienke","['Seyed Gohrab, Ashgar']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the views of Khomeini, Shariati and Motahhari on several aspects of womanhood such as gender equality and marriage. Furthermore, it examines which of these ideas have been translated into the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. By understanding which religious figures have been influential and which laws dictate the lives of women, I have tried to understand what is expected from women and what their position in society is. The constitution of Iran was an important source to understand the framework in which the position of women is decided. A critical review of the ideas of the three religious figures show that there are several problems with the translation of their ideas and the notion of equality as presented in the constitution into practice. Women in fact do not have the same rights as their male counterparts as the constitution states. Examples of this are the mandatory hijab and unequal divorce rights. Furthermore, there is a lot of intentional vagueness in the constitution in order to limit the rights of women. The thesis concludes that it has been mostly the ideas of Khomeini and Motahhari have been implemented into the constitution. Shariati’s ideas, that can be categorized as more modern and socialist than the other two religious figures, have been implemented to a lesser extent. Khomeini, Motahhari and Shariati all agree men and women have equal rights. However, the implementation of this into practice is problematic.","['Iran', 'Women', 'Islam', 'Revolution']"

Sino-Japanse relaties gedurende de handelsoorlog,"Platell, Louise","[""Hooghe, Ingrid d'""]",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie onderzoekt de invloed van de Sino-Amerikaanse handelsoorlog op de bilaterale handelsrelatie tussen China en Japan. Hierbij wordt de invloed op de Chinese en Japanse economie meegenomen, gezien veranderingen daarvan invloed zouden kunnen hebben op de handelsrelatie. De veranderingen zijn gebaseerd op economische prestatie en vertrouwen, waarvan prestatie wordt weergegeven in de nationale handelsbalans, lang termijn-beurskoers en lange termijn-valutakoers, en vertrouwen in DBI, korte termijn-beurskoers en korte termijnvalutakoers. Op basis van deze indicatoren lijkt de handelsoorlog een significant negatieve invloed te hebben op de Chinese economie, waarbij zowel de economische prestatie als het vertrouwen afnemen. De Japanse economie lijkt geen significante invloed te ondervinden van de handelsoorlog, waarbij sommige sectoren en bedrijven negatief worden beïnvloed en andere positief. De gevonden invloed op de nationale economieën komt overeen met veranderingen in de Sino-Japanse handelsrelatie. De handelsbalans lijkt in het voordeel van Japan te verschuiven. De stijgende trend van Chinese export naar Japan van de voorafgaande jaren neemt namelijk sinds de handelsoorlog sterk af. Hoewel ook de Japanse export naar China afneemt, was deze trend al voor de handelsoorlog zichtbaar. De uitkomsten van dit onderzoek zouden in vervolgonderzoek moeten worden bevestigd met meer indicatoren. Ook zouden casestudies kunnen worden gebruikt om de handelsoorlog te bevestigen als oorzaak van de gevonden veranderingen.","['Sino-Japanse relaties', 'Sino-Amerikaanse handelsoorlog', 'Economische indicatoren']"
A Tale of Acceptance and Resistance: Imposing the Palestine-Lebanon Border in the Mandate Period,"Serra, Mattia","['Sanchez, Karène']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The colonial partition of the Middle East is one of the most recurrent topics of the scholarship on the region. In the last decade, many scholars have shifted their attention from the diplomatic and military history of these borders to their economic and social significance. This thesis aims at completing this shift in regard to the boundary between the British Mandate on Palestine and the French Mandate on Syria and Lebanon. Assuming a borderland perspective, this research looks into the different ways in which local, regional and colonial actors engaged with the border and its administration. It reconstructs the evolution of state border practices on both sides in the years from the British redeployment along the OET line in 1919 until the demise of the Palestine Mandate in 1948. Looking into the agency of a wide range of actors, including peasants, travelers, smugglers and illegal migrants, this thesis argues that the relation the indigenous population had with the border cannot be understood solely through an oppositional frame. Rather, it suggests that this relation was extremely dynamic, and that the subversion of the new territorial order went along with forms of compliance with state regulations and exploitation of the limits of state jurisdictions.","['Middle East Mandates', 'Palestine', 'Lebanon', 'Syria', 'Borderlands', 'Smuggling', 'Transnational history']"
Using emotions for politics: a visual analysis of the video message from the families of Japanese victims abducted by North Korea,"Scholl, Frederik Jozef","['Nakamura, Mari']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The North Korean abduction issue has long been an important factor in Japan’s foreign policy towards the DPRK, the Japanese government has made attempts at raising awareness among people living outside of Japan through various media. This research set out to analyze how the Japanese government used emotion in a video posted on the government-run rachi.go.jp website, in an attempt at gaining the support of English-speaking viewers for its stance on the issue. In this way, the research contributes both to the fields of emotion in IR, as well as to the extant scholarly work on the abduction issue. I have carried out the analysis by using discourse analysis, as proposed by other scholars in the field of emotion in IR. From this analysis, I conclude that the Japanese government attempts to create three primary emotions in the viewer: compassion, hope and outrage. These three emotions are created through various visual, as well as audible symbols, ranging from colors used in the video to the music played while giving general information on the issue. While the intended emotions are successfully created in the viewer, the full potential effectiveness of the video is not reached due to a lack of circulation caused by the obscureness of the website which hosts it.","['Emotion in IR', 'Japanese abduction issue', 'Discourse analysis', 'Visual analysis', 'IR']"

Computer-Mediated Communication and the Formation of Collective Action in China: The Human Flesh Search Engine Phenomenon,"Nefedova, Maria","['Schneider, Florian']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the beginning of the 1990s, China witnessed the arrival of the internet. The internet allowed ordinary citizens to contribute to the production of media content by sharing news and opinions with each other. The computer-mediated communication (CMC) technology provided a new medium of interaction for citizens and allowed them to mobilise more quickly and more efficiently. Since then, the notion of collective action took on new dimensions. New forms and practices of collective action started to appear on the internet in China. One of such practices is the Human Flesh Search Engine (HFSE). It is a public search for people driven by a massive collaboration of internet users. The participants share a common goal of revealing the truth and punishing targets of the search accused or suspected of wrongdoing. This thesis analyses the role of the internet in relation to social activism and collective action in China by answering the following research question: How does the CMC, that the internet facilitates, reflect the formation of collective action in China? To answer this question, I examined the CMC in the context of the HFSE phenomenon. I analysed two notable cases of the HFSE, namely, the South China tiger scandal (2007) and the search for “Liaoning Girl” (2008). Both cases demonstrated similar patterns in terms of formation of collective action and the following search for the target. The collective action in the context of the HFSE had an actual impact on the outcomes of these cases. The CMC provides a new medium of communication, which in turn facilitates the formation of collective action.","['China', 'collective action', 'computer-mediated communication', 'Human Flesh Search Engine']"
Alevitische Organisaties in de Polder. Over het organisatiegedrag van de Nederlands alevitische gemeenschap,"Hill, Robin","['De Bruijn, Petra']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"This thesis includes a comparative case study into the organisational behaviour of the Dutch and German Alevis. The literature has already devoted a great deal of attention to the German Alevi community. However, little was known about the Dutch Alevis. This study showed that there are currently thirty-six Alevi organisations in the Netherlands. These associations are mainly focused on their cultural aspects, and were mainly located in the cities of the central Netherlands. In addition, this study revealed that the landscape of Dutch Alevi organisations is characterised by fragmentation, disputed leadership, a lack of professionalism, and the disappearance of associations. The German landscape of Alevi organisations has a federation with a strong mandate. This federation has obtained religious rights for the German Alevis, allowing the community to provide Alevi education in public schools. Schrover and Vermeulen (2005) define three factors for explaining the organisational structure of immigrant organisations, namely: the migration process, the role of the state in the host country and the specific characteristics of the immigrant population. The Dutch and German Alevis have experienced an almost equal migration process, yet significant differences in the organisational behaviour of both can be seen. Although these differences were largely explained by the other two factors of Schrover and Vermeulen, this research has shown that this model should include a fourth factor, namely “suddenly imposed grievances”. The traumatic attacks on the Alevi community in Sivas (1993) and in Gazi (1994) had a strong effect on the organisational behaviour of both the Alevi community in the Netherlands and in Germany.",

This study aims to look at improvement shown in tonal production by Dutch teenagers aged 13-17 who follow the relatively new Mandarin course in secondary school, to provide deeper insight into SLA of Mandarin by Dutch teenagers, and into the effectiveness of the course. There were two groups of participants: students with four months of experience in Mandarin, and students from the same school with three and a half years of experience. They were asked to produce a selection of both monosyllabic and disyllabic words. Their tones were visualized using Praat, and compared to both the tonal production of native speakers to identify errors. The production of the two different grades was then compared to one another to identify points of improvement. The results showed that female students showed improvement mainly in pitch contour, and to some extent even acquired tonal coarticulation. The male students showed improvement in pitch height, and very little improvement in pitch contour. For both genders the production of tone 3 appeared most difficult, followed by tone 4, then tone 2.

After conducting a literature review I came up with the research question: To what extent has Twitter played a role in the mobilisation processes of the 2009 Iranian Green Movement? Both primary source Twitter data and multidisciplinary secondary sources have been consulted to try answer this question. This research has delved into the obscure world of mass mobilisation within a highly regulated public sphere. It has spent equal time analysing both sides of the debate surrounding the influence of Twitter on the Green Movement. When looking at the events surrounding the tragic death of Neda Agha-Soltan, one must conclude that Twitter has most certainly played a role in the mass-dispersion of information during the Green Movement. However, one also cannot ignore the successful suppression of the Green Movement. In short, not the outside researchers but the people of Iran themselves have the ability and knowledge to explain their efforts behind their fight against oppression.","['Twitter', 'Green Movement', 'Iran', '2009']"

Later it became a more widespread ideal among courtiers, dictating social and cultural comportment. Though many works of miyabi literature, often written by women, are celebrated nowadays, both miyabi and women were severely undermined by Buddhism at the time of their creation. Buddhism deemed women impure and unable to reach enlightenment, due to menstruation and childbirth. Literature, as a wordly attachment, was deemed sinful. This view of literature was combatted at later the miyabi literature was revered as something which could show the way of the Buddha to the people. When the licensed pleasure quarter of Edo, the Yoshiwara, was opened in 1618, miyabi was used to create a sophisticated image that made the trip to the outside the city seem worth the effort. Tales and images of a dream world with beautiful and sophisticated women – the Edo version of a Heian court lady - drove many customers to the quarter. The Yoshiwara, although the only legal place, was not the only place that offered sex. To keep making a profit, the Yoshiwara brothel owners had to use marketing tactics. It became fashionable to be tsū, a man who knew the ways of the Yoshiwara. In collaboration with brothel owners, guidebooks and critiques were published, that showcased and ranked the best of the Yoshiwara. Sophisticated portraits of high-ranking prostitutes looked nearly identical, but only those with the knowledge needed could ‘read’ the images and perceive the details about the women, as well as pick up on the erotic undercurrent.","['miyabi', 'Yoshiwara', 'court culture']"

A major factor behind this development is private railway companies' extensive engagement in the real estate sector, which throughout the 20th century has resulted in the birth of new commercial spaces within the context of the station: the terminal department store (a department store inside of the station managed by a railway company), the ekichika (an underground area of the station), and more recently, the ekinaka (the area within the gates of the station). This thesis explores the relationship between city and railway station through a contextualization of the three spaces mentioned above and the case study of Shinjuku, the busiest station in the world. The analysis shows that by reintegrating urban spaces in the context of the station, private railway companies have created a new urban playground for the passenger, decontextualized from the idea of commuting.","['Japan', 'Railway Stations', 'Shinjuku Station', 'Terminal department store', 'Ekinaka', 'Ekichika', 'Ensen Kaihatsu', 'Urban Space']"

The politics of sisterhood: A feminist approach to agency and youth in processes of social change in urban Uganda,"Rodríguez Hernández, Andrea","['Bruijn, Mirjam E. de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study explores the foundations of young women’s agency in processes of social change in urban Uganda. Through the lens of the concept of ‘sisterhood,’ this research examines the strategies, struggles, and successes of young feminists challenging systemic inequality and advancing women’s rights in the country. It follows the trajectory of the women’s movement in the country and the trends of African feminist theorisation and organising across the continent. This investigation was carried out in Kampala over three months, especially in the headquarters of Akina Mama wa Afrika, a Pan-Africanist, feminist organisation. From the personal to the collective, this quest brings to the forefront the experiences and views of young Ugandan women who are involved in the feminist movement. It is argued that the idea and practice of sisterhood, understood as political solidarity amongst women, enhance their capacity to promote social transformation in Uganda. Addressing the different manifestations of this idea in context, this research analyses the role of social media and the feminist discourse facilitating this endeavour. While navigating through alternative ways of generating change, this journey explores the complexities of agency and structure in urban Africa in the 21st century, and contributes to the study of the contemporary wave of feminism in the continent.","['African feminism', 'sisterhood', 'political agency', 'social media', 'discourse analysis']"

The Semantics of Numeral Classifiers in Palikúr and Rongga: Between Universality and Variation,"Zijl, Lieke van","['Emlen, Nick']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Numeral classifiers are additional grammatical elements within a numeral phrase (NumP) which refer to the salient semantic properties of the counted noun (Gil 2013). Numeral classifier systems are the most recognised type of classifier system in the world’s languages. Numeral classifiers are structured by semantic principles, by which certain subclasses of nouns are assigned to the same classifiers. These semantic principles bear certain similarities across the world’s languages, which are called universals. Besides a universals basis, Lyons (1977a: 248) believes that the semantics of numeral classifier are also determined partly by cultural basis. This thesis is a comparative analysis of numeral classifiers in Palikúr (an Arawakan language of Brazil and French Guiana) and Rongga (an Austronesian language). The thesis has two goals. First, I am interested to explore to what extent the semantic universals regarding numeral classifiers hold for Palikúr and Rongga. In particular for Palikúr, since South American languages were mostly left out in the search for universal patterns in numeral classifier languages. The universal semantic frameworks regarding numeral classifiers that I discuss are Allan (1977), Lyons (1977) and Croft (1994). My second goal for this thesis is to explore the semantic variability between the Palikúr and Rongga numeral classifier systems. This question is of interest because it can help illuminate what kinds of semantic differences can be found within the semantic universal parameters identified by semanticists. The semantic variability of numeral classifier systems that I discuss is based on the study of Grinevald (2015). Together, these two questions shed light onto the interplay between universality and variability in the semantics of numeral classifier systems.","['Numeral classifiers', 'Classifiers', 'Typology', 'Comparative research', 'Universals', 'Austronesian', 'Arawakan']"

Female Genital Cutting on Two Continents: continuity and Change of Sexual Cultures between Ethiopia and Italy,"Eleonora, Minelli","['Wels, Harry', 'Abbink, Jon']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to investigate the cultural templates that underpin the centuries old practice of female genital cutting (FGC) a non-medical procedure that provides for the excision of external part of female genitalia to comply with the practicing community’s socio-cultural system. Although FGC incidence has been declining, high prevalence rates have been reported in several African countries like Ethiopia, whose incidence stands around 65.2%. Following increased global mobility, public and policy concern about FGC among the African communities in Europe has grown. However, hardly any studies attempted to unearth the elements that render FGC 'transportable' to a new cultural context that rejects the legitimacy of this practice. Considering Ethiopia has both a strong FGC culture and a long-standing history of migration, the latter is hereby the object of analysis. In this study, I trace back social, ideological, symbolic and religious dimensions of these interventions from the context they have been produced. I then investigate how cultural patterns are played out among the Ethiopian diaspora settled in Italy. I show that the reason behind female excision is a matrix of socio-cultural-symbolic nexus that are very powerful in a context where the practice is autochthonous but, in the advent of migration, the same go from being allowing to disabling factors for continuation.","['Cultural Dynamics', 'Social Transfers', 'Female Excision', 'Female Genital Cuttting', 'African Diaspora', 'Ethiopia', 'Eritrea']"
Epilepsie als Productieve Pathologie in Cinema,"Gilst, Bob van","['Verstraten, Peter']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Film- en literatuurwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Ik ga epileptische en non-psychogene epileptische insulten als productieve pathologie behandelen aan de hand van twee films, te weten Thelma (Joachim Trier, 2017) en El Aura (Fabián Bielinsky, 2005). Hoewel de twee verhalen ver uiteen liggen, heb ik voor deze films gekozen omdat de productieve pathologie een sterke gemene deler vormt. Bovendien is de visuele beleving van een insult door filmische middelen in beide films van belang voor het narratief. Het close-readen van scenes met aanvallen benadrukt de relatie tussen mise-en-scene en het verhaal. De analyses van de films zullen ertoe dienen om de (narratieve) context van de insulten helder te krijgen, om uiteen te zetten wat de functie van de aanvallen is. Dat beeld en plot elkaar hier versterken, is voor mij een belangrijke reden voor een uitvoerige analyse, omdat het de kracht van cinema als verhalend medium aantoont. Hierbij vang ik aan met de productieve pathologie in El Aura , waar ik zal betogen hoe epilepsie hem een verscherpte zintuiglijke perceptie geeft en hoe zijn aanvallen en het bijhorende controleverlies het verhaal beïnvloeden. Hierna zal ik Thelma bespreken, waarbij ik aandacht besteed aan de relatie tussen haar verlangen en haar psychogene non-epileptische insulten, met een vergelijkende analyse met Day of Wrath (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1943). Het verband tussen haar verlangen en haar aanvallen ontluikt uiteindelijk ook in een productieve pathologie met grote invloed op het narratief.","['Epilepsie', 'Cinema', 'Productieve pathologie', 'Verlangen', 'Verscherpte perceptie', 'Bovennatuurlijk']"

Variation in intensity dynamics: A cross-linguistic study of between-speaker variability among L1 and L2 speakers,"Lins Costa Almeida Castro Machado, C.","['Heeren, W.F.L.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Do measures of intensity dynamics change when an individual speaks in a nonnative language? This study investigates positive and negative intensity dynamics (related to the articulatory mouth opening and closing gestures) in spontaneous speech produced by Dutch speakers in their native language (L1) and in English, a second language (L2). Statistical analyses showed that between-speaker variability was explained by the measures of mean, standard deviation and sequential variability of positive and negative intensity dynamics. Negative dynamics explained a larger quantity of inter-speaker variability, suggesting a lesser prosodic control over the mouth closing movement. When assessing the influence of language on intensity dynamics, there was a significant effect on positive and negative dynamics. These findings suggest that intensity dynamics differ between the L1 and the L2. However, speaker-specific information may be embedded in these time-bound measures despite the language (L1 or L2) in use, suggesting the discriminative power of intensity dynamics across languages. Finally, the results add support to findings positing that that speaker-specificity may not be restricted to the native language.",
American Empire through Foreign Aid: The Case of the Global Gag Rule,"Meinderts, Tom","['London, J']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Mere days after his inauguration, President Donald Trump reinstated the Global Gag Rule (GGR). The GGR – also known as the Mexico City Policy – bans US federal funding for international NGOs providing services for abortions. The GGR, originally implemented under the Reagan administration, was maintained under President George H. W. Bush, before being rescinded by President Bill Clinton, reinstated by President George W. Bush, and rescinded once more by President Barrack Obama. However, the embracement of the gag rule under the Trump administration amounted to more than a reinstatement. In contrast to practices maintained during the Reagan and Bush administrations, Trump’s GGR targets not only specific family planning services, but entire organisations that provide such services. Moreover, it applies not only to Federal agencies providing developmental aid, but all “global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.” As such, Trump’s variant of the GGR is wider in its scope and has broader implications for the administration of foreign aid and, say critics, for global public health and human rights. This thesis shows how the GGR is used to consolidate political power domestically while also diffusing conservative Christian ideology through developmental aid. In this way, the GGR is shown to be an instance of intermestic policy which is used to simultaneously consolidate political power domestically, while exporting conservative Christian ideology through foreign aid as American empire.","['Global Gag Rule', 'American Empire', 'Foreign Aid', 'Intermestic']"
'Internalising’ Development: The impact of the Korean-inspired Saemaul Model Villages (ESMV) project in Uganda on ‘local’ village identities and sense of community belonging,"Moon, Ka Hyoun","['Abbink, G.J.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The Saemaul Undong (translated as the New Village Movement), was first introduced in South Korea in the 1970s. It not only contributed to the country’s rural economic development, but also contributed to an enhanced national consciousness and a stronger collective identity through the internalisation of external support and incentives. The recent implementation of this specific rural development model under the name of the Establishment of Saemaul Model Villages (ESMV) project in seven model villages in Uganda, raises the question on how it may impact the existing collective identities in the country that continues to portray institutionalised ethnicity in modern politics. This research, therefore, aims to study how the Korea-inspired Saemaul Undong Model Villages socially influences the existing ‘local’ village identities in Uganda as well as how it contributes to the national identity. Fieldwork was conducted in three of out of the seven model villages in Uganda between August 2019 and January 2020, to collect data using formal in-depth and informal interviews, as well as participant observation. The triangulated data was used to explore the process of internalisation of the external support from the Korean and Ugandan governments by the grassroots actors, and how this impacted their sense of belonging to the community. Social dynamics were analysed using the actor-oriented approach introduced by Norman Long (2001) and Herbert Kelman’s social influence theory (1958, 1961, 1979, 2006, 2017). In addition, Benedict Anderson’s imagined communities ([1983] 2016) was referred to discuss the concept of national identity and how it was impacted by the intervention program. The ultimate purpose of this research was not to measure peoples’ sense of patriotism nor nationalism, but to rather understand how the ESMV project contributed to the understanding of collective identities in these regions. Thus, it focused on the social changes witnessed in the villages in relation to the reproduction and adaptation of ideas and practices associated with national identity at the local level. It then concludes that the formation of collective identities in these villages by the rural development project was both the means and the ends for the national economic development.","['Saemaul Undong (SMU)', 'ESMV project', 'Internalisation', 'Collective identities', 'National Identity']"
Rehumanising e-health: A case study approach using self-determination theory to understand blended learning and blended care in Central Uganda,"Ionescu, Alma","['Kampen, Sanne van']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"E-health technologies are being used increasingly much worldwide, a trend that is also visible in the Ugandan context. This thesis sought to investigate whether the use of blended forms of e-learning and e-consultations can improve the experiences and outcomes of the use of these technologies. The chosen case study is a social organisation that practices e-health in the Central region of Ugandan. The main methods used are semi-structured interviews and field observations. The analysis, which used self-determination theory as a theoretical framework, found that blended learning provides the ability to improve the experience and outcomes of CHWs because it enhanced the opportunities to fulfil the needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness required for self-determination. Similarly, the research also found that blended care has the potential to improve the experience and outcomes of patients because it offers the ability to increase the needs of autonomy (although findings were rather limited for this), competence and relatedness. As such, this study concludes that there is a need for greater reflection and inclusion of blended methods in e-health.","['Uganda', 'e-health', 'health', 'self-determination', 'technology']"

Zij zijn typische figuren in de mediterrane geschiedenis van de zestiende tot de achttiende eeuw’ en waren over de gehele Noord-Afrikaanse kust te vinden. De renegaten konden, door hun kennis van zowel de christelijke als de islamitische wereld, een belangrijke diplomatieke rol op zich nemen en waren vaak van cruciaal belang bij het vrijkopen van Nederlandse gevangenen en slaven in Noord-Afrika. De bekeerlingen werkten nauw samen met verschillende Nederlandse handelsvertegenwoordigers of diplomatieke agenten en vormden de onmisbare schakel tussen Noord-Afrikaanse sultanaten en de Staten-Generaal. Ondanks deze fundamentele hulp konden de renegaten, zo leert de literatuur ons, wegens hun bekering in hun vaderland nauwelijks op begrip of tolerantie rekenen. Bij terugkeer naar de Republiek stond hen alles behalve en warm welkom te wachten doordat ze werden gezien en behandeld als uitschot en landverraders. Onmisbaar maar tegelijkertijd ook ongewenst: de literatuur schetst een ingewikkeld en paradoxaal beeld van de renegaat op het vroegmoderne toneel. Dit negatieve stereotype valt namelijk niet te rijmen met de functies die renegaten in de realiteit bekleedden. Een verklaring zou kunnen zijn dat de beeldvorming rondom de bekeerlingen onderhevig was aan verandering. Hierdoor zouden renegaten al een belangrijke diplomatieke positie hebben veiliggesteld voordat de Nederlandse kijk op hen verslechterde. De huidige literatuur geeft nog geen antwoord op de vraag of die verandering er inderdaad was, dus dit onderzoek stelt zich ten doel dat te onderzoeken.","['Renegaten', 'Diplomatie', 'Republiek', 'Beeldvorming', 'Bekering', 'Handel', 'Islam', 'Stereotypes', 'Staten-Generaal', 'Noord-Afrikaanse kust']"
MULTINATIONAL COPORATIONS AND THEIR ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,"Smith, Ashley","['Gawthorpe, Andrew']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis will argue that to remain relevant within scholarship, IR scholars should recognize, as Nye and Strange have, that MNCs are powerful actors that influence the states they operate in, the global political economy, and the norms and values the international system is based on. This point is fundamental to the study of IR so long as IR claims to explore power dynamics and the influences behind state-to-state interaction. This thesis does not claim that multinationals ought to be included in the study of IR on the grounds that they supersede the state or that states are no longer important in global governance, rather it argues that MNCs are important to the current structure of the global order. Its central research question seeks to explore how multinational corporations can be incorporated into the IR discipline. It looks at constructivism as the appropriate theoretical tool to do so. Although it seeks to add to the constructivist school of thought, it also critiques previous constructivist literature for not having done so already. These criticisms are two-fold: constructivists have failed to 1) analyze the MNC in terms of identities, interest, and power; and 2) analyzing contemporary international relations from a standpoint that is too theoretical to fully observe the realities of international relations in practice.","['Multinational Corporation', 'IR', 'Constructivism', 'Partnerships']"
Philosophy as Rational Anthropology: a perspective on Kant and Wittgenstein,"Halksworth, Alexander","['Gijsbers, Victor']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"To the minds of many commentators, there appears to exist tantalising similarities embedded in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and Ludwig Wittgenstein, waiting to be clarified. However, continued disagreement as to how these similarities are to be articulated, and consequently quite what they should amount to, has led some to suspect such musings to be a sophistical mirage. Additionally, further complicating their comparison is also the interpretive disagreements that have persisted in relation to the writings of both philosophers, respectively. Nevertheless, both figures are undoubtedly responsible for framing large swathes of modern philosophical thought – perhaps none more so than Kant in the course of his Critique of Pure Reason. As Putnam attests, “almost all the problems of philosophy attain the form in which they are of real interest only with the work of Kant.”1 Despite this accolade however, it can be stated with only the odd contrarian objection that in their respective attempts to establish Transcendental Idealism in the course of the Critique, and Logical Atomism through the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, that both Kant’s and Wittgenstein’s doctrines constitute technical failures. That being said, both figures also sought to change our fundamental understanding of the task of philosophy, and in this sense, their works should remain valuable points of reference in the continuing discourse on meta-philosophy. Hence, it is here considered in what sense this latter perspective of them has been retained in the contemporary reflections upon either philosopher.","['Kant', 'Wittgenstein', 'Critique', 'Tractatus', 'Philosophical Investigations', 'Anthropology']"

The findings of my research show that: international students form different background seemed to hold a positive evaluation of their experience in China; cultural-specific notions like Mianzi play an important role in the trajectory of internationalization of Shandong University; in turn, this last consideration seem to pose a challenge to the mainstream, linear view of the field which considers Internationalization as a global, active force passively employed by Chinese universities to reach specific - and mainly national - goals.","['Higher Education', 'China', 'Face', 'Internationalization', 'Mianzi', 'foreign students', 'Shandong University']"
Tricks of the Trade: Translation Strategies in Legal Subtitling and Assessment of Legal Subtitling,"Alexander, Suliandri","['Foster, Tony']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"With the popularization of courtroom dramas, fictional legal subtitling is in high demand. However, correct legal subtitling might be difficult to achieve due to the nature of legal translation and the constraints of subtitling. This study is a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the legal terms in the Dutch subtitles of the first season of Suits. Pedersen’s (2005/2011) taxonomy of translation strategies to transfer Extralinguistic Cultural References (ECRs) was used to identify which translation strategies were used for the translation of legal terms in the subtitles and Pedersen’s (2017) FAR model for error assessment in subtitles was used to assess the subtitles that contained legal terms according to functional equivalency, acceptability and readability. The results showed that direct translation was the most used translation strategy in the Dutch subtitles of the first season of Suits. Error assessment showed that the subtitles were at least 80% functionally equivalent, acceptable and readable. Applying Pedersen’s (2005/2011) translation strategies in combination with his (2017) FAR model to other courtroom dramas can help generate more data and formulate which translation strategies work best for legal subtitling as a general recommendation for future legal subtitlers.","['legal translation', 'subtitling', 'legal subtitling', 'specialized subtitling', 'Suits', 'FAR model', 'audiovisual translation']"
The influence of the degree of bilingualism on the activation of L2 in an L1 task,"Hinsberg, Myrte van","['Geambasu, Andreea']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Nowadays, more and more people are raised bilingually, often with English as a second language. A widely accepted hypothesis about how bilinguals choose between languages for production, is the language non-selective access account, which states that bilinguals always initially activate both languages, and later (partially) suppress the non-target language based on contextual factors. Based on this account, it is expected that a speaker’s first and second language interfere while executing a language task. The present study replicates a covert phoneme monitoring experiment in Dutch, to see whether English (L2) interferes with Dutch (L1). The study focuses on covert lexical production with a task in which the participants have to accept or reject the presence of certain visually-presented phonemes in a picture name. Previous studies did not come to conclusive results (Geambaşu, 2010; Van Hinsberg, 2019), which may be due to the degree of bilingualism of the participants. To test whether participants would show slower RTs for graphemes occurring in their L2 than for unrelated graphemes, and whether this difference would be bigger for balanced than for unbalanced bilinguals, two groups of Dutch high school students were tested on their ability to monitor graphemes: those that are taught in Dutch(unbalanced bilinguals), and those that are taught in English (balanced bilinguals). The results did not show any significant differences in reaction times between the groups, suggesting that the degree of bilingualism does not affect interference. However, evidence suggests that the age of acquisition of English as L2 plays a role: the earlier one becomes actively bilingual, the more interference from the L2 s/he encounters in the L1. The graphemes that occurred only in the L2 English word, but not in the L1 Dutch, were most difficult to monitor for the early English learners, explicitly showing that L2 English interferes with L1 Dutch. However, interference is found not only in stimuli types where interference of English L2 was expected, but also throughout the whole L1 task: people who learned their L2 earlier in life, made more mistakes on the task than people who started learning their L2 later, indicating that an early bilingual speaker needs to put more effort into an L1 task to constantly suppress the L2.","['Bilingualism', 'Covert phoneme monitoring']"
Japan's pre-modern images of intersexuality,"Splinter, Asa","['Müller, Doreen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research is about the untold history of intersexuality during a time when androgyny in juvenile boys was desirable and men performed female roles on stage. Moreover, it introduces the role of the body in the story about gender ambiguity in pre-modern Japan. Until now, studies on the history of gender and sexuality have focused on the role of culture in sex determination. However, this study proposes that biology was equally important. Through a critical analysis of visual material produced during Japan's pre- modern times, the intersexed character may be revealed as an essential figure for understanding the construction of gender, sex and sexuality in historical and contemporary times. In the Heian-period (794-1185), the intersexed character was presented as an absurd sexual deviant in the Yamai no Shōshi. The Genroku-period (1688- 1704) depicted intersexuality as a female deficiency in the work Kōshoku Kinmō-zui by Yoshida Hanbei, which was also reproduced around one and a half century later in Ryōsuitei Tanekiyo's Kaiin Suikōden Sho-hen. Towards the end of the Edo-perdiod (1800-1868) more graphic works of intersexed bodies appeared. Keisai Eisen's Makura Bunko invoked a gaze of shameless fascination and pity, whereas Utagawa Kunitora's Otsumori Sakazuki put intersexuality into the realm of erotic fantasy. Ultimately, this research asks the question: What do early images of intersexuality reveal about attitudes towards gender, sex and sexuality in pre-modern Japan? The answer to this question reveals how intersexed bodies, in various periods of time, were to be looked at with humour, curiosity, pity and sexual desire.","['Intersexuality', 'pre-modern Japan', 'gender fluidity', 'bodies', 'visual culture', 'onnagata', 'wakashu', 'ukiyo-e']"

Taking this under-explored research area into consideration, it is relevant to investigate the relation between government policies and the survival of entrepreneurial businesses. In the light of start-up economies, South Korea is presented as a forerunner in economic growth and innovation, as well as one of the main hubs for entrepreneurship in Asia (Millard 2014). However, only 39.9% of South Korean start-up companies manages to survive beyond five years (KOSIS 2018). This is in contrast to start-up survival rate in the Singapore where 52.7% of all start-ups manage to pass the crucial five-year mark (Kam, Ping, and Crystal 2017, 27). In order to provide an insight into the failure of the South Korean start-up ecosystem to secure entrepreneurial sustainability, this thesis will address the following research question: To what extent do the government policies promoted in the Creative Economy Action Plan target the conditions for entrepreneurial success, in order to effectively ensure a sustainable start-up economy in the Seoul Capital Area? With the aim of providing a comprehensible insight to this research question, this thesis conducts a three-part analysis on the Creative Economy Action Plan published by the Park administration in 2013, the opinions of 300 South Korean entrepreneurs regarding start-up survival in 2018, and the process of success or failure of three distinct technology start-ups in the Seoul Capital Area. This thesis argues that, although the government policies promoted in the Creative Economy Action Plan explicitly targeted three distinct factors for start-up success, the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the Seoul Capital Area remains problematic regarding the success factors of monetary funding, market accessibility, and conductive entrepreneurial culture.","['Entrepreneurship', 'Start-up Ecosystems', 'Creative Economy Action Plan', 'Start-up sustainability', 'Seoul Capital Area']"

What were the responses made by Serbian political elites before and after Macron’s veto?,"Petrovic, Mateja","['David, Maxine']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"EU enlargement is a complex and lengthy process that grants membership to candidate countries that meet the required criteria. The event of the veto, that rejected North Macedonia and Albania to accession negotiates, temporarily ceased the enlargement process and underlined certain systematic deficiencies. The veto was initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron under the justification that Albania had not satisfied certain requirements to be suitable for accession talks as the state lacked a certain degree of economic stability. Various countries reacted differently to Macron’s decision. The Netherlands and Denmark showed support whereas Serbia, a current candidate country, reacted in a different manner. Serbia’s attitude towards the EU significantly changed as there was an underlying presence of hostility. Before the veto, there was a high level of EU-Serbia cooperation. Serbia was taking certain initiatives to demonstrate commitment by opening new chapters and collaborating with different EU leading politicians to discuss enlargement. Whereas after, there was less support for the EU and an increase in cooperation with actors that are not in favour of the EU, such as with Russia, Turkey and China. This paper examines the Serbia-EU relationship by analyzing the responses Serbia conducted before and after the veto. By using qualitative research methods, it identifies and analyzes the significant events during the time period of interest and applies different theoretical frameworks to further provide an explanation for the established responses. The theories applied were different theoretical frameworks to enlargement and theories relevant to Serbian enlargement politics. This research bases its evidence from various news articles and investigates the political activity conducted by Serbia in the form of public statements and political decision making. The research demonstrates that the responses were a product of Serbia not having effectively internalized the EU fundamental principles, thus preventing Serbia from progressing on its path towards the EU. The event of the veto damaged the EU’s credibility and established that the possibilities of future EU enlargement have significantly decreased. Therefore, for Serbia, an implementation of unfavorable liberal principles within their state is considered as unnecessary since the guarantee of membership is perceived as uncertain.","['Macron', 'Veto', 'Serbia', 'Constructivism']"

In this research, the question is analyzed how Persian memoirs by female authors on the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) have reflected the Iranian cult of martyrdom. Based on the scientific realm of (critical) memory studies, this study analyses the framing of martyrdom by investigating the Persian memoirs of Zahra Hoseyni: One Woman’s War: Da. In these memoirs, Hoseyni narrates how she grew up in the Iranian city of Khorramshahr amid the detrimental events of the Iran-Iraq war and how she participates in the war as a nurse and grave worker. This study suggests that the experiences of martyrdom by Persian women in their memoires are highly determined by their female perspective. In Da, Hoseyni alludes to Zaynab (626-682), the sister of the martyred imam Hoessein (626-68), as being an authority of morality. Though male narratives about the Iran-Iraq war would call upon the martyrdom of imam Hoessein himself, female memoirs imply that they feel more acquainted with the role of Zaynab. Besides, this study suggests that Da proves itself as an emancipatory publication, in which Hoseyni steadfastly objects to the conventional gender roles within the Iranian society. By portraying Hoseyni as an independent woman during the Iran-Iraq war, Da shows that conceptions of martyrdom in female Persian war memoires coincide with challenging views of women’s roles in public society.","['Martyrdom', 'Iran-Iraq War', 'memoirs', 'memory studies', 'emancipation']"

The tensions between Qatar and the other Gulf countries, however, came to a peak during the 2014 and the 2017 Gulf crises. Remarkable, is the central role of Al Jazeera in in these diplomatic crises, while the network is independent and only partly funded by the Qatari government. Therefore, this thesis researches the impact of Al Jazeera on Qatar’s foreign relations. Through within-case analysis and process tracing this thesis illustrates how Al Jazeera, since its establishment, has evolved into a global news network that is considered highly controversial among the other Gulf states. By combining these results with the theories of the CNN-effect and the Al Jazeera effect, this thesis has been able to identify possible reasons why Al Jazeera has been a subject in these diplomatic crises. Lastly, this thesis also proposes an addition to the theory of multilevel analysis that allows for more accurate research into global news networks.","['Al Jazeera', 'Middle East', 'Gulf', 'Diplomatic crisis']"

An exploratory thesis on the relationship between the Heavenly Serbia discourse and the Christchurch Shooting,"Harmens, Hans Z.","['Duyvesteyn, I.G.B.M.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"On the 15th of March 2019, the Linwood Islamic Church centre and the Al-Noor Mosque in Christchurch had been the target of a terrorist attack. The perpetrator of this attack, Brenton Tarrant, had released a manifesto in which he cited NATO`s intervention of Kosovo in 1999 as one of the motives behind his attacks. However, this was not the sole instance in which Tarrant referred to the Yugoslav wars, as he was listening to the song """"Karadžić, Lead your Serbs!"""" (also known as God is a Serb) prior to his arrival to the Al-Noor Mosque. Additionally, the guns used by Tarrant were brandishing the names of several individuals including those of that the Serbian Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović and Miloš Obilić. These references to Prince Lazar and Milos Obilic are significant, as they are part of the Kosovo Myth and by extension the Heavenly Serbia discourse which are linked to violence within the region, especially towards Muslims. In light of this, the purpose of this paper is to assess to what extent the discourse of the Christchurch shooter is inspired and or connected to the Heavenly Serbia discourse. In order to explore this relationship, this paper applies a critical discourse analysis on The Great Replacement written by Tarrant.","['Right-wing extremism', 'nationalism', 'violence', 'discourse', 'Heavenly Serbia', 'eco-fascism', 'Christchurch shooting']"

Verder wordt aan de hand van de theorie van speciësisme geconcludeerd dat zowel speciësistische houdingen, als niet-speciësistische houdingen na de ramp werden versterkt. Groepen met speciësistische handelingen, waaronder de overheid en niet-huisdiereigenaren, achtten in deze crisissituatie de volksgezondheid als de prioriteit. Terwijl de emotionele band tussen mens en dier van huisdiereigenaren en veehouders juist werden versterkt door het meemaken van de ramp.

EEN NIEUWE GEBOORTEGOLF? Een vergelijkende analyse van visuele pro-natalistische propaganda in de Islamitische Republiek Iran,"Majoor, Dieke Mariëlle","['Bruijn, Petra de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) has experienced a remarkable change in its fertility rates during the last four decades. In this timeframe the government shifted the population policies from pro-natalist to anti-natalist in the late 1980’s and back to pro-natalist a decade ago. The fertility rate which was approximately 6.0 in 1976 rose to 7 in 1986 and then declined rapidly to less than 2.0 in 2005. The two periods in which the IRI employed pro-natalist policy and propaganda (1979-1989 and 2012-now), received only limited analysis in the academic literature. This paper examines the visual pro-natalist propaganda of the past decade and compares it with the propaganda of the formative period of IRI, by analysing and comparing the selected case-studies from each period. Using propaganda-analysis by Jowett and O’Donnell and visual semiotics as described in The SAGE handbook of visual research methods, this paper observes to what extent there is continuity and change in the depiction of families and what this reveals about the social, economic and political situation of IRI.","['visual propaganda', 'fertility transition', 'Iran']"
China's anti-piracy effort,"Rovers, Joost","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Maritime security is vital for many states, and it is undermined by many acts, one of which is piracy. This threat is acknowledged by the extensive anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden, in which China partakes. Even though piracy occurs in the South China Sea as well, China does not have a military anti-piracy operation in this area. Nonetheless, this area is vital for the operation of its economy. It is, therefore, important to analyze how the differences in these policies can be explained. By using different theoretical explanations (realism, liberal institutionalism, and constructivism), the objective of this thesis is to analyze which theory carries the most explanatory power, or if a combination of explanations could provide a better explanation to the seemingly contradictory policy. This is done through a method of congruence analysis, combined with process-tracing. After tracing China’s actions and developments in the Western Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, this thesis finds that constructivism provides the best explanation for China’s different approaches, as anti-piracy cooperation merely served as a tool of statecraft.","['Piracy', 'China', 'Realism', 'Liberal institutionalism', 'constructivism', 'congruence analysis', 'process-tracing', 'seablindness', 'gulf of aden', 'Western Indian Ocean', 'South China Sea']"

Ideas of a European military force had been considered a key priority soon after the EU had been established in 1952, then in the form of a so-called ‘European Defence Community’, but were set aside after multiple disagreements in the 1950s. However, since the shift in the international order in the 1990s after the fall of the USSR, the general but slow shift in world powers tilting towards a rising China, the shift in the relationship with the U.S., and other continued military threats throughout the world, the EU has revoked its former stance on defence and security and has taken a variety of steps to develop this field. Yet, despite these threats, shifts and initiatives, an official and entirely European military force has never been achieved. Why has the EU only been able to come to the current level of cooperation and integration of EU defence and not any further? This thesis will argue that three obstacles have been important in this development.","['Europe', 'Defence', 'Obstacles', 'Cooperation', 'ECSC', 'PESCO', 'WEU', 'EU', 'CFSP/CSDP', 'EDA']"

Culpeper (1996) disagrees, stating that people can also intentionally attack someone’s face, and devised “impoliteness superstrategies” (pp. 356-357) that are used for this purpose. However, little research has been done on intentional impoliteness, and even less on gender and intentional impoliteness. Therefore, the research question is: do men and women use different face-threatening acts, and do they respond to these FTAs differently? I aimed to analyse adult men and women’s language, behaviour and paralinguistic features on FTAs and their responses to FTAs, focusing on the differences. This was done through analysis of a total of ten forty-minute episodes from three different reality television series: Can’t Pay? We’ll Take It Away! (n.a., 2014-2018), Supernanny (Frost, 2004-2008) and Jo Frost: Extreme Parental Guidance (Frost, 2010-2012), using a schedule based on the FTAs and impoliteness superstrategies by Brown and Levinson (1978, 1987), Culpeper (1996) and Bousfield (2008), respectively. The responses to FTAs were also recorded. Men and women seemed to use similar FTAs. However, the context in which the FTAs were spoken seemed to affect who was expressing which FTAs. A total of twelve different response types were recorded. These results can be used in different contexts (i.e. language teaching) to predict what kind of FTAs might be present in which contexts. They may also be used to add to both politeness and impoliteness theory.","['face-threatening acts', 'FTAs', 'gender', 'impoliteness', 'responses to FTAs']"

"A comparative, logical realist defence of Indian Nyaya logic against Husserlian charges of it being psychologistic","Zdunczyk, Maciej Waldemar","['Schaar, Maria van der']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the philosophy of logic, Mohanty and Matilal formulate well-nigh identical responses to Husserlian charges that accuse Indian Nyaya logic of being unacceptably psychologistic. Husserl holds that logical psychologism regards logic as a branch of empirical psychology. Thereby, logical psychologism cannot, unacceptably so, accommodate the necessity and objectivity of characteristic contents of logical theories, such as logical laws. Since Nyaya logic is centred around the study of mental processes of inference, it may be prima facie classified as unacceptably psychologistic in Husserl’s spirit. In response, Mohanty and Matilal defend Nyaya logic by pointing to its commitment to the existence of intentional structures, that is, universal and formal structures underlying the content of so-called cognitions. In this thesis, I intend to achieve two aims. The first aim is to comparatively explicate conceptual points of connection between Husserl’s framework, logical psychologism and Nyaya logic in more detail compared to Mohanty’s and Matilal’s commentaries on this matter. The second aim is to critically expand Nyaya logic and its given defence by Mohanty and Matilal, so that the Nyaya logician may better resist Husserlian accusations of Nyaya logic being psychologistic. This expansion is based on my own logical realist proposal. According to this proposal, specific mind-independent features of reality account for the necessity and objectivity of certain characteristic contents of logical theories, such as logical laws or certain rules of inference. In the first section, I introduce logical psychologism as well as highlight the key features of Husserl’s framework relative to it. In the second section, I introduce Nyaya logic as it is situated within the Nyaya framework to then explain Mohanty’s and Matilal’s given defence. The third section draws from the first two sections and comprises my critical expansion of Nyaya logic and this defence using my logical realist proposal.","['Indian philosophy', 'Comparative philosophy', 'Nyaya logic', 'Philosophy of logic', 'Husserl', 'Logical psychologism', 'Logical realism', 'Anti-psychologism', 'Mohanty', 'Matilal']"

While a range of technologies have been analyzed in the context of Afrofuturism, from sonic, to digital, to even aerospace technologies, I argue in this thesis that there is a gap in scholarship on the medical technologies that undergird the alienation experienced by African Americans. To fill this gap, my research focuses on two works of fiction, Ralph Ellison’s classic novel Invisible Man (1952) and Jordan Peele’s recent movie Get Out (2017), that deal with the oppressive power of medicine. I argue that in both narratives medical experiments are used to take control over black bodies and minds, and I position this political violence into a history of medical experimentation and abuse on African Americans as well as Afrofuturism. As much as the medical mistreatment that the protagonists in these texts suffer seems exclusive to the world of science fiction, it has been, and might continue to be, part of the real experience of black Americans.","['Afrofuturism', 'medical experimentation', 'slavery', 'science fiction', 'double consciousness', 'posthumanism']"

"Out of Many, English: The Three-Generation Model of Language Shift in Three Generations of Immigrants to the United States","Planting, Manon",['Dr. J. V. Jeffery'],2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Three-Generation Model (hereafter also the TGM) is the prevailing theory of language assimilation. According to the model it takes three generations for an immigrant family to lose the mother tongue and shift to English. Since the model forms the basis for theory and research, it is important to ascertain the validity of the model. This thesis therefore examined to what extent the Three-Generation Model of language shift can be applied to contemporary immigrant groups in the United States. In order to answer this question, this descriptive research built on U.S. census data from 1980, 2000, and 2018 to reflect the three generations. This data was collected by IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series). The proportions of monolinguals with a non-English mother tongue, multilinguals, and monolinguals who speak English were determined, in order to describe the linguistic assimilation process. Findings appear to be in agreement with the TGM. While roughly two-thirds of the first generation of immigrants spoke a non-English mother tongue (whether alongside English or not), 95.9% of the third generation reported that they spoke only English, which suggests that they lost the mother tongue. Nearly a third of the first generation was already a monolingual speaker of English in the first generation. The difference between the second and the third generation was especially large. Further research could aim to strengthen these findings, or to find out the reasons behind these results.","['Language Shift', 'linguistic assimilation', 'language maintenance', 'language loss', 'Three-Generation Model']"
The Platformization of Queer Solidarity: Re-Defining Space in Post-Protest Lebanon,"Nakhle, Sinine","['Steinbock, Eliza']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Because contemporary network science is predicated on the assumption that similarity breeds connection, it transforms what seems to be an open web into poorly gated communities that propagate already-existing forms of prejudice and discrimination. If the algorithmic fabric of social media platforms pushes people with the same views and interests towards each other, what does this mean for queer individuals in Beirut inhabiting a city whose very urban fabric segregates and limits their interaction in public space? What possibilities can the digital realm provide queer lives in a cyberspace unhinged by the geography of residence and the materiality of the body? I attempt to answer those research questions by relying on Sara Ahmed’s Queer phenomenology (2006) and on Wendy Hui Kyong Chun’s (2016) concept of “homophily”. Those theoretical lenses will guide my use of auto-ethnography and close visual analysis to explore the outputs and social media strategies of two case studies of visual activism in Lebanon: Beirut By Dyke and Kikafilmadina. My personal experience as a member of civil society groups in Beirut and my positionality as the creator of Beirut By Dyke orient me, to borrow Sara Ahmed’s term, towards these pages as cultural objects. The concept of the social media accounts, which revolves around the narrativization of queer inhabitance in space, propels me toward Sara Ahmed’s theory around sexuality as residence. Conversely, the social impact generated by both social media accounts on collective imaginations and social participation in cyber and physical space leads to me to question how “homophily” (Chun 2016) can be used to challenge the neoliberal assumptions it was built on. My aim is to counter existing literature around gender and digital culture whose understandable focus on the capitalistic and behaviorally predictive valence of social platforms is grim and dystopic (Goldberg 2016). Instead, I suggest that the study of platforms like Instagram offers a resource for queer studies insofar as it “emphasizes the importance of lived experience, the intentionality of consciousness, the significance of newness, or the role of repeated habitual action in shaping bodies and the world” (Ahmed 57). It is specifically the power of repeated habitual actions that I want to focus on in exploring digital possibilities. In a context where systemic oppression is difficult to dismantle and social change impossible to imagine, the creation of new paths is, after all, a labor of repetition.","['Queer Phenomenology', 'Queer studies', 'Urban studies', 'New Media', 'Homophily', 'Orientation', 'Lebanon']"

Finding the European Union’s Grand Strategy: Understanding the Commission’s role in formulating grand strategy,"Fagliano, Lucas","['Broad, Matthew']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,,,en,"Complexity is a crucial barrier to our understanding of how actors behave in the international arena. Market power, normative power, regulatory power, global power, civilian power, are all concepts which have been utilised to describe the EU international actorness. However, the interaction between these concepts, and how the EU employs these comprehensively has been less debated. In an effort to contribute to the literature on EU’s strategic behaviour, this thesis engages in a critical discourse analysis throughout numerous strategic documents from the Commission. Through the analysis, a grand strategic framework, established by the Commission, was identified. Such framework appeared divided into two phases; the first being an inward-looking effort to “rebuild Europe”, and the second being an outward-looking approach towards providing security in the neighbourhood. This work manages to move past the theoretical debate on the EU’s engagement with grand strategy, which has characterised European academia and engages in a practical discussion of grand strategy and the EU. While the contributions of this work are essential for different fields in European studies, such as Europeanization, it also contributes to grand strategy academia by putting forward a theory on how international organisations interact with grand strategy.","['Grand Strategy', 'Foreign Policy', 'European Foreign Policy', 'European Union', 'Critical discourse analysis', 'Juncker', 'European Commission', 'International Organization', 'internationalization', 'Orchestration']"

The Abject Body in Abject Art: Analysis of Untitled (1990) by Kiki Smith and What Else Could We Talk About? Cleaning (2009) by Teresa Margolles,"Kreicberga, Diana Anna","['Bertens, Laura M.F.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent years, the concept of the abject body has become an increasingly important tool in contemporary art for commenting on pressing societal issues, such as bodily autonomy, death, and destruction. Artists subvert idealized representations of human bodies in order to expose their audiences to the reality and truth surrounding one’s existence. The notion of the abject body is present in the works of German American artist Kiki Smith (1954) and Mexican artist Teresa Margolles (1963) who both explore the notion of death in their art. In her sculpture series Untitled (1990), Smith visualizes bodily changes occurring prior to death that are normally hidden from the public, while Margolles’ installation piece What Else Could We Talk About? Cleaning (2009) uses bodily fluids collected from various crime scenes. Both artists exemplify the notion of abject bodies in distinct ways, as Smith’s work confronts the viewer with the presence of unspoken human bodily processes, and Margolles’ installation piece directly uses appalling materials to comment on the deaths and killings taking place in the north of Mexico. Due to the fact that abjection can also promote positive sensations, this paper addresses the coexistence of conflicting sensations that are not fully discussed in the field. In order to shed light on this phenomena, the paper provides close readings of Smith’s and Margolles’ controversial artworks, focusing on the issues of human death and decay and the sensations these works evoke, such as fear, anxiety, and curiosity. Thus, this paper aims to explore how the concepts of abjection and the abject body expose the balance of conflicting sensations (appeal/disgust, attraction/repulsion) in Kiki Smith’s Untitled (1990) and Teresa Margolles’ What Else Could We Talk About? Cleaning (2009).","['abjection', 'abject art', 'abject body', 'Kiki Smith', 'Teresa Margolles']"

Migration in International Relations: The Evolution and Implementation of Indonesia's Migration Diplomacy (1979-2019),"Wardhana, Bramantyo Ardi","['Jacobson, Liesbeth Rosen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Migration has always been a significant issue in world politics, with the latest development in the so-called ‘Global Migration Crisis’ in 2015 increasing its salience. In 2016, the formulation of Jordan Compact and the European Union (EU)-Turkey Deal made way for the emergence of a new category of diplomacy, the “Migration Diplomacy”. Even though the term is considered a recent one, international actors (especially states) have practised it from time to time in previous periods. For example, the establishment of Bracero Program that regulated Mexican migrant worker movement to the United States in 1942, or the enactment of “Operation Solomon” in which the Ethiopian Government gave permission to the Israeli Government to evacuate 14,000 Ethiopian Jews from Ethiopian territory, in exchange for arms and financial aid of $36 million from Israel. While there are already several studies done on Migration Diplomacy in America, Europe, and Africa, there are not yet extensive empirical studies regarding Migration Diplomacy in Asia, especially not in the Southeast Asia region. This thesis aims to provide an empirical example of Migration Diplomacy, through the perspective of recent developments in Indonesia since the 1970s. It looked into the change over time regarding the implementation of Migration Diplomacy and the factors that influenced it.","['Migration', 'Diplomacy', 'Indonesia']"

The Relationship between the United States and the Netherlands in the Context of the Tet Offensive,"Aken, Petrus Antonius van","['Schmidli, William Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper seeks to contribute to the literature concerning the relationship between the United States and the Netherlands during the Vietnam War. Specifically, it examines government relations in the context of the Tet Offensive. The offensive had a transformative effect on American domestic politics, as Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to seek another term as President of the United States and because America decided to de-escalate the Vietnam War. As such, this paper explores how a combination of American foreign and domestic policy affects the relationship with the Netherlands. The majority of the existing literature is written in the 1980s and therefore, deserves an update. Moreover, current scholarship is predominantly focused on the domestic consequences for the Netherlands, and thus often falls short of describing the American perspective on the Vietnam War. This thesis sets itself apart by specifically examining the relationship between the United States and the Netherlands. Through an extensive analysis of American, Dutch, and South Vietnamese sources this paper will argue that the direct consequences of the Tet Offensive did not significantly affect American-Dutch relations. However, indirect consequences, such as Johnson’s withdrawal from politics, de-escalation of the Vietnam War, and Vietnamisation of the conflict, substantially influenced the relationship between the United States and the Netherlands. Whilst relations between the two countries undoubtedly remained good, the context of the Tet Offensive serves to characterise changing dynamics with which policymaking took place, as the Netherlands took more initiative in maintaining its relationship with the United States.","['Netherlands', 'United States', 'Foreign Policy', 'Foreign Relations', 'Tet Offensive', 'Vietnam War']"
“But why may not I love a Woman with the same affection I could a Man?”: Female Same-Sex Desire in Early Modern Lyric Poetry and Plays,"Hoogenboom, Geertje","['Dijkhuizen, Jan Frans van']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This MA thesis examines how several early modern English poets and playwrights draw on and modify discourses about female-female desire. It looks at the poems “Sapho to Philaenis” (1633) by John Donne, “The Description of Cookham” (1611) by Aemilia Lanyer, and “To My Excellent Lucasia” (1654) by Katherine Philips. I will also investigate The Convent of Pleasure (1668) by Margaret Cavendish, and William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1595). These poems and plays are read in tandem with early modern discourses of medicine and friendship. Medical texts generally condemn sexual relations between women through the transgressive figure of the tribade, who is characterised by unbridled lust. Discourses of friendship propose a different figure: that of the platonic female friend. Both discourses propose radically different views on female love. Furthermore, writers within each discourse often disagree with one another and do not present a unanimous verdict on the significance, danger, and prevalence of female-female attraction, desire, and love. This leaves room for writers of poetry and plays to experiment with their portrayals of love between women. Poets and playwrights write far more nuanced portrayals of female same-sex desire and love than medical and amicitial discourses may lead us to expect, often making a case for the potency and validity of female-female love.","['early modern', 'queer', 'John Donne', 'William Shakespeare', 'Aemilia Lanyer', 'Katherine Philips', 'Margaret Cavendish', ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", 'Sapho to Philaenis', 'early modern poetry']"
The Reality of the Image in the Post-Truth Era,"Sandvoort, Jurian Willem Mattia","['Shobeiri, Ali']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"ABSTRACT: Contemporary society recently faced the introduction of a new phenomenon: the post-truth era. Terminology often used conjunctively with, amongst others, “alternative fact,” “fake news,” and “misinformation.” The term “post-truth” was coined in 1992 by Steve Tesich, to describe American society’s proneness to accept government lies. However, since its incorporation into the Oxford Dictionary in 2016, post-truth is defined as “circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” This research aims to analyze, in what way, in a regimes of post-truth world, alternative meaning is established, and what role photography plays in this process. An extensive framework of literature is operationalized for the analysis of two case studies, both of photographs in a post-truth context. Subsequently, as the concept of meaning in the post-truth society is fractured, the potential, for the documentary language of images, to suture is explored.","['Post-Truth', 'Photography', 'Documentary', 'Reality', 'Truth']"
Defying the Image of the Black Panther Party: The Nonviolent Power of Female Black Panthers,"Van Lier, Claudia","['Schmidli, William Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The contributions of female members are an important and understudied aspect of the Black Panther Party. Survival Programs, the Panthers’ community service programs which were governed mostly by women, are a good example of nonviolent techniques carried out by the Panthers to reach some of the goals on their Ten-Point Program Since the Black Panther Party consisted of mostly women for most of its existence, this indicates a difference between the common image of the Black Panther Party and the reality of it. Therefore, this thesis will answer the question “In what ways did female members defy the stereotypical image of the Black Panther Party?” In short, it will argue that not only is the significance of the nonviolent Survival Programs undervalued in the party’s popular image; so is the significance and even the existence of (other forms of) female involvement and crucial contributions to the Black Panther Party. Indeed, although the violent, male contributions to the movement are more known, the nonviolent techniques mostly executed by female members, such as the Survival Programs, take up a larger part of what the Party truly was. This thesis will pay attention to these lesser known acts committed by the Black Panthers.","['Black Panthers', 'Black Panther Party', 'Female Black Panthers', 'Black Power', 'Panthers', 'Black beauty']"

Vrouwen zijn in de Tweede Kamer tot nog toe altijd in de minderheid geweest (Sariaslan 2017; Parlement.com z.d.). Uit interviews met vrouwelijke ministers kwam voort dat vrouwen korter en concreter van stof zouden zijn en dat zij meer emoties zouden tonen dan mannen (Leyenaar 2016, 239-41). Dit onderzoek laat zien dat bepaalde visies op een maatschappelijke kwestie geoperationaliseerd kunnen worden, waarmee deze visies middels een corpusonderzoek kwantitatief-taalkundig getoetst kunnen worden. Een analyse van een corpus bestaande uit ruim 10000 beurten uitgesproken door 154 verschillende Tweede Kamerleden in 25 plenaire vergaderingen wees uit dat er in deze data geen bewijsmateriaal te vinden is voor de stelling dat vrouwelijke politici korter van stof zijn dan mannelijke politici. Het gemiddelde aantal woorden per beurt verschilde niet significant tussen de twee gendercategorieën. Het meten van emotie in taalgebruik van Tweede Kamerleden is verricht via een lijst talige kenmerken opgesteld op basis van onder meer de bevindingen van Pennebaker (2011) en Wierzbicka (1992; 1995). In navolging van het werk van Biber (1988) zijn talige kenmerken die dezelfde functie dragen tot een dimensie gerekend. Langs drie opgestelde dimensies en een los talig kenmerk is vervolgens getoetst of vrouwelijke Tweede Kamerleden meer emotie tonen dan mannelijke Tweede Kamerleden. Uit de gemiddelde factorscores die ieder het taalgebruik ten aanzien van de verschillende dimensies karakteriseren is gebleken dat vrouwelijke Tweede Kamerleden over het algemeen meer emotie tonen dan mannelijke Tweede Kamerleden. Genuanceerder blijkt uit de resultaten dat vrouwelijke Tweede Kamerleden frequenter de emotie verdriet tonen, maar minder frequent de emotie boosheid tonen dan mannelijke Tweede Kamerleden. In het tonen van positieve emoties bestaat op basis van de meting in dit onderzoek geen genderonderscheid. De resultaten van de data-analyses in dit onderzoek laten echter ook zien dat de in de literatuur geclaimde overeenkomende functies die gedragen zou worden door een reeks talige kenmerken tegengesproken worden. Implicaties van (onder meer) dit discussiepunt zou uitgewezen moeten worden door vervolgonderzoek.","['kwantitatief', 'stilistiek', 'taal en gender']"

By considering Central Asia a Regional Security Complex, and by viewing Russia’s role within it through the theoretical framework of negotiated hegemony, this thesis compares the role Russia played in the region in the timeframe from the fall of the Soviet Union to 2001 with the role it played following the US invasion of Afghanistan. It is argued that Central Asia started a successful process of reducing Russia’s influence by transforming its RSC from a unipolar one dominated by Russia, to a centered one where the Central Asian Republics (CARs) themselves defined the security sphere. This long-term process was temporarily abandoned by jumping on the short-term opportunity of counterbalancing Russia’s security hegemony with that of the US from 2001 onward. Disappointed by both Russia’s inability to deal with the Afghan conflict, and the US’ disinterest in pursuing a more active role in the particularities of the Central Asian RSC, the CARs re-entered negotiations with Russia over its security hegemony; strengthened this time, however, by their own proven capabilities and sovereignty.","['Afghanistan', 'Russia', 'Central Asia', 'Regional Security Complex', 'Negotiated Hegemony', 'Conflict']"

From the View of Nowhere to Now- Here,"Bauer- Gauss, Fabio","['Van der Schaar, Maria']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This essay is a humble contribution to the great and exciting project of reconciling science with the immediate, sentient experience of life. It offers a critique of the physicalist outlook on mind, from an intercultural- philosophical perspective, arguing that an ontology of the mind- world relationship, as it is present in Husserlian Phenomenology and Buddhist Philosophy describes reality more accurately than the Physicalist- Cognitivist theory of mind. Our discussion is not limited to philosophical discourse, but includes recent research from Biology and cognitive science, notably from Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, Eleanor Rosch and Evan Thompson, which is placed in the context of our philosophico- phenomenological investigation. Firstly, we clarify how the physicalist paradigm developed throughout the history of the natural sciences, from the emergence of the idea of a causally closed, mind- independent world onwards, terminating in the influence it came to have on scientific practise in cognitive science and Psychology. Afterwards we elucidate the core metaphysical assumptions, which underlie a physicalist understanding of mind. This serves as a preparation to disclose the anomalies and errors of the current paradigm in the mainstream branches of the sciences of mind. Showing how a physicalist understanding of mind fails to sufficiently explain the transformative capabilities of the human mind, from a scientific perspective, we move on to a phenomenological critique. We discuss Husserl’s demonstration that all science is fundamentally grounded in phenomenal experience, which implies that a scientific understanding of mind must be grounded in intersubjective experience, not in an idealized model of a mind- independent external world. As an alternative to a physicalist understanding of mind, we look at a phenomenological understanding of mind, inspired by Husserlian and Buddhist philosophy. This alternative paradigm accounts for the problems which a physicalist understanding of mind fails to address and considers the grounded- ness of science in the background of lived, phenomenal experience without losing in scientific rigour.",

Origine en Worteling: Wat we bedoelen met 'lokaal' nieuws,"Kramer, Merijn","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De lokale journalistiek heeft het moeilijk. Teruglopende inkomsten zorgen ervoor dat arbeidsintensieve journalistieke werkzaamheden, zoals onderzoeksjournalistiek, vaak op een lager pitje staan bij lokale media (Koetsenruijter & De Jong, 2017, p. 84). Lokaal nieuws typeert zich op dit moment dan ook steeds vaker als ‘klein nieuws’, er is veel ruimte voor verschillende 112-meldingen en weinig diepgang over bijvoorbeeld lokaal bestuur (Koetsenruijter & De Jong, 2017, p. 3). Men maakt zich daarom zorgen om de kwaliteit van lokale media. Om een kwaliteitsimpuls te geven aan lokale media, worden er steeds meer lokaal-landelijke samenwerkingsverbanden opgezet. Zo krijgen lokale media een landelijk podium en daarnaast ook betere journalistieke feedback van landelijke redacties. Het is vervolgens de vraag wat er overblijft van het lokale in het nieuws, we noemen dat lokaliteit, dat uit zo’n samenwerking voortkomt. Dit onderzoek kijkt specifiek naar het samenwerkingsverband dat is ontstaan tussen Reporter Radio (KRO-NCRV) en verschillende lokale kranten. Zij produceren de rubriek ReportersNL, waarmee zij een plaats op de publieke omroep inruimen voor lokale onderzoeksjournalistiek. Dit onderzoek kijkt in essentie hoe lokaliteit vorm krijgt in een landelijke samenwerking tussen lokale en landelijke redacties. De hoofdvraag is dan ook als volgt: Hoe krijgt lokaliteit vorm wanneer lokale redacties met een landelijke redactie samenwerken voor de invulling van een rubriek als ReportersNL? Dit onderzoek beschrijft exploratief hoe lokaliteit vorm krijgt binnen de uitzendingen van ReportersNL. Om antwoord te geven op de hoofdvraag is er gekozen voor een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse door middel van flexibel coderen. Het corpus voor dit onderzoek is een zelfstandig opgebouwd databestand dat volledig is uitgeschreven om zonder dataverlies thema’s te onttrekken. Het onderzoek gebruikt benaderingen van merkcultuur en authenticiteit om het hoofdonderwerp van dit onderzoek, lokaliteit, te beschrijven. Samengevat uit lokaliteit als concept zich in termen van Origine en Worteling, waarbij de theorieën rond authenticiteit de achtergrond van deze hoofdthema’s verklaren. Eerder werd authenticiteit beschreven als een machtiging die zich uit in bovenstaande termen (Van Leeuwen, 2001, p. 394). Een product is authentiek omdat het geproduceerd wordt binnen een bepaalde regio of een bepaalde gemeenschap (Boyle, 2004, pp. 16- 21 ) (Van Leeuwen, 2001, p. 395). Dat laatste gegeven verklaart ook de nieuwswaarde nabijheid. Doordat het nieuws uit een regio of een bepaalde gemeenschap komt, voelt het nieuws nabij aan voor nieuwsconsumenten uit die bepaalde regio of gemeenschap (Robinson, 2014, p. 115). Origine en Worteling dienen dan ook als hoofdthema’s die een analytisch frame geven aan de kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse die volgt. Bij het thema origine bestaat een voornamelijk geografische insteek. Zo zien we dat bij ReportersNL graag gebruik wordt gemaakt van het benoemen van specifieke locaties in een regio zoals woonplaatsen, straatnamen of andere plaatsaanduidingen om uiting te geven aan lokaliteit. Daarnaast blijkt het noemen van het lokale nieuwsmerk en het noemen van een actueel nieuwsfeit in de week voor de uitzending ook een middel te zijn dat gebruikt wordt. We zien bij het thema worteling ook een tendens ontstaan. Hier is een duidelijke focus op de mensen uit een bepaalde regio. Dit thema geeft voornamelijk een antwoord op vragen als: wat doen mensen uit deze regio? Wat is typerend voor deze regio? Hoe reageren zij op het nieuws uit hun regio? Dat gegeven versterkt lokaliteit die ontstaat wanneer de geografische aanduiding wordt gegeven in de uitzending. Het geeft een extra ‘lokale’ dimensie. 6 Vanuit de resultaten en het theoretisch kader wordt geconcludeerd dat lokaliteit vorm krijgt in drie factoren: het benoemen van plaatsnamen, het expliciet gebruiken van de lokale actualiteit en het expliciet uitlichten van het gebruik van lokale bronnen. Het benoemen van plaatsnamen en het nieuws daarmee lokaal inkaderen is een directe parallel die we vinden in de theorieën rond authenticiteit en lokale media. De origine van het nieuws is duidelijk terug te vinden, waardoor het nieuws als authentiek gepercipieerd kan worden. Daarnaast wordt ook de geografische basis van een lokaal nieuwsmerk benadrukt. Het benoemen van de lokale actualiteit en het gebruik van lokale bronnen benadrukt op zijn beurt weer de worteling van het nieuwsmerk, ze opereren vanuit een duidelijk afgebakende gemeenschap die huist in een bepaalde regio. Het nieuws dat belangrijk is in die regio wordt uitgelicht. Verder zien we dat, naast het gebruik van de eerdergenoemde factoren, deze extra versterkt worden door bijvoorbeeld een gedeeld sentiment uit de regio expliciet te maken. Maar waarom is het belangrijk om lokaliteit te verwerken binnen zo’n lokaal-landelijke samenwerking? Het is wat we in veel marketing-theorieën een unique selling point noemen. Bij de theorieën over authenticiteit werd duidelijk dat mensen altijd een verlangen zullen hebben naar uniciteit in producten die zij kopen. In dit onderzoek hebben we daarnaast duidelijk gezien dat alle media aangesloten bij ReportersNL allemaal lokale elementen toevoegen om het nieuws lokaal aan te laten voelen. Het aanspreken op lokaliteit maakt het nieuws bij landelijke media interessant, en fungeert daarbij ook als een verkoopfactor of marketinginstrument. Wanneer lokale media binnen een lokaal-landelijke samenwerking geen gebruik zouden maken van lokaliteit, zou het moeilijker te onderscheiden zijn van landelijk nieuws. Zoals Franklin zou zeggen: lokale media zouden alleen nog lokaal zijn in de naam (Franklin, 2006, p. 27). Dit onderzoek legt het tegenovergestelde bloot. Lokale media zijn geografisch gegrond, en maken duidelijk gebruik van de gemeenschap vanuit waar zij nieuws maken. Juist dat gegeven zorgt ervoor dat lokaliteit een perfect unique selling point is voor een lokaal-landelijke samenwerking. Samengevat stelt dit onderzoek dat lokaliteit, ondanks de verschillende nuances die bij dit onderzoek geplaatst kunnen worden, op een goede wijze als onderdeel kan fungeren van de nieuwswaarde nabijheid. De fysieke nabijheid, die zich uit in lokaliteit, benadrukt dat nieuws niet slechts lokaal in naam is. Het maakt lokale media uniek, authentiek en benadrukt de belangrijke rol die zij hebben voor lokale gemeenschappen. Ze verbinden lokale actualiteit met lokale standplaatsgebondenheid. En daarmee is het bestaansrecht van lokale media op de lange termijn gerechtvaardigd en gewenst.","['Local news', 'Journalism Studies']"

To this end, the state provides procedural guarantees for continuous rational deliberation and collective opinion formation, aimed at reaching a collective decision. Apart from of these procedural features, a deliberative democracy also heavily relies on the personal rational abilities of its citizens. This requires certain common abilities, like certain standards of argumentation, the freedom of discussion and the possibility of rational deliberation. The structural inequality argument specifically focusses on this ‘difference blind’ approach to individuals’ abilities. This critique argues that deliberative democracy is unable to address underlying unequal societal structures. Consequently, the outcome of rational deliberation is no longer constructed by ‘all those affected’ but only by individuals who are able to make their voice heard in the public deliberation. This thesis focusses on this critique, examines possible solutions, and argues that structural inequality can never be completely eradicated in democratic deliberation. However, by realizing political equality as the equal opportunity for political effectiveness, the practice of democratic deliberation should not be regarded illegitimate.","['Deliberative Democracy', 'Structural inequality', 'Political effectiveness', 'Democracy', 'political equality']"

The migration wave peaked in 2015, with more than a million refugees, including Syrian refugees, seeking asylum. The main reason for Syrian migration was the Syrian revolution, sparked by the demonstrations that started in 2011. Pro-democratic protests called for freedom, aiming to end the oppressive regime under the Assad family that has exhausted the country for around five decades. The unforeseen result of these protests was a brutal war. The Syrian conflict and the Syrian diaspora have been framed in European news and media coverage as the “refugee crisis.” It has been framed as a crisis not only due to the severity of the situation but also based on a tradition of “Othering,” as the refugees generally come from a Muslim majority. While there is a common agreement on the passivity, generalization, and dehumanization at work in media coverage of the refugees, art, and literature often try to provide alternative narratives. Using critical analysis as a research method, this research investigates the representation politics of refugees in two case studies: a book by Wendy Pearlman, and an exhibition by Carlos Motta, focusing on the concept of belonging and its politics. Furthermore, I employ post-coloniality discourse that enables a critical reading of political and cultural power relations, including history, race, and queerness. The analysis of the cultural objects will show that these art-works have provided a personal space for refugees to tell their stories, which symbolizes a positive step away from the mainstream media representation. However, these representations do not automatically also generate a critical examination of the belonging crisis of refugees, especially while the art-works do not establish a dialogue with the “Other.”","['Refugees', 'Belonging', 'Liminality', 'crisis']"
Versoepeling van de Rigvedische anderhalve meter: Lichte zesde lettergrepen in achtsyllabige versvoeten in de eerste mandala,"Spaans, Gerard","['Lubotsky, Alexander']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie doe ik onderzoek naar lichte zesde lettergrepen in verzen van acht lettergrepen (dimeters) in boek 1 van de Rigveda. Van 115 van deze gevallen heb ik uitgezocht of er etymologische verklaringen zijn en of er verzen van elf of twaalf lettergrepen (trimeters) bestaan die zodanig lijken op de dimeters, dat ze een model kunnen vormen om woorden op plaatsen toe te staan waar ze eigenlijk niet in het metrum passen. In meer dan de helft van de gevallen blijkt er zo’n trimeter te bestaan, maar lang niet altijd is het een overtuigend model. Verder blijkt dat de al lang bestaande theorie, dat deze lichte lettergrepen vroeger zwaar waren omdat er bij het opstellen nog een laryngaal achter stond, meer problemen veroorzaakt dan oplost. Er kunnen ook enkele gevallen verklaard worden indien een bepaald gelijkrijmschema belangrijker was dan het slot van het metrum in dimeters. Wat ook opviel is dat minstens 85 gevallen zouden kunnen worden verklaard als het uitmaakt dat er nauwelijks of geen trimeters in de buurt zijn, maar die theorie heeft nog wel flink wat onderbouwing nodig.","['Rigveda', 'Sanskrit', 'metrum']"

This thesis illustrates the existence of a wide array of continuities in three layers of territorial identification – local, regional, and national – inherent in the city’s festive culture and divides this process into three categories: community building, ascribed commonalities, and feelings of belonging. The interaction between layers of identification provided a sustainable foundation for identity, which could overcome major upheavals like the First World War and the fall of the Habsburg Empire. In addition to interpreting these layers as nested identities, this thesis explores the importance of rhythms as a source for continuity in daily life. Preserving traditions and customs in practices often outweighed other considerations, such as displaying political views, in organizing local festivities. The repetition of a set of practices transcended party lines and shows that Social Democrats, Christian Socials, and German Nationalists all valued the use of these practices, albeit using them to create different territorially bounded narratives. Finally, this thesis argues that an overemphasis on capitals and crises in historiography has created a distorted view of this period and, consequently, advocates a new focus on localities, regions and stability.","['Regionalism', 'Territorial identification', 'Festive culture', 'Nested identities', 'Rhythms', 'Continuity', 'Habsburg Empire', 'Austrian Republic']"

How concepts of the native language influence the second language use,"Tumanova, Galina","['Jong, Nivja H. de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines transferability of sociopragmatic knowledge to L2 speech act realization by studying request production in English and Russian. It aims at investigating whether native Russian speakers transfer sociopragmatic knowledge to the requests in English and how they assess their linguistic behaviour in L2 compared to the performance carried out by native English speakers. To study the subject, native Russian speakers and native English speakers were asked to participate in two speech tasks: the Oral Discourse Completion (the ODCT) Test and the stimulated recall interviews (the SRI). The ODCT was aimed at elicitation of requests in eight situations that were constructed with consideration of three social parameters: social distance, power, and imposition. Native Russian speakers were asked to produce requests both in Russian and in English to detect transfer. Native English speakers produced requests in English, and their answers served as a baseline for comparison. Native Russian speakers as well as native English speakers were asked to reflect on their language use during the SRI. Three groups of requests, as well as speakers’ reports, were obtained and compared in relation to social distance, power, and imposition. The qualitative research method showed that even though there is cross-cultural variation in the Russian and English languages, sociopragmatic knowledge that is embedded in Russian culture does not affect the second language use. Russian speakers do tend to use more direct strategies in request production in the native language, as suggested by other related research on the Russian language. However, the findings of this study suggest that Russian speakers more often opted for indirect strategies, which relates their linguistic behaviour to Western tradition.","['transfer', 'requests', 'second language learning', 'Russian', 'English']"

The main objective is to find out whether language creators are influenced by their native languages when creating their own languages. For this purpose, two programming scripts were created in order to quickly compare consonant inventories with each other. Using these programs, 7 constructed languages were each compared to 3,019 natural languages from the online database PHOIBLE. In more than half of the analysed constructed languages, the consonant inventories of the constructed language and the creator’s native language had an overlap of 70% or more, which, when compared to the overlap with other natural languages, is on the higher end of the scale, but rarely the highest end. These results point towards an influence of the native language of the creator on the consonant inventory of their created language.","['constructed language', 'consonants', 'Klingon', 'Dothraki', 'Sindarin', 'PHOIBLE']"
"Borderless Flanders. The impact of tourism on territorial identification processes in Dutch borderland Zeelandic Flanders, 1970-1985","Antonides, Lauren","['Storm, H.J.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In recent decades, historians have become increasingly aware of the role of tourism in regional identity formation in Europe. The influence of tourism on borderland identity is, however, still largely uncharted territory. This thesis investigates the impact of tourism on processes of regional identity formation in Zeelandic Flanders between 1970 and 1985. In this period, the Dutch maritime borderland expanded its reputation as an authentic beach destination with a unique Flemish hinterland. Tourist organizations, such as the VVV, emphasized the region's cross-border Flemish character, both in culture and landscape. The image of a ‘boundlessly Flemish’ borderland was, however, not as unproblematic as promotional material might suggest. In the same period, the border stimulated particular types of tourism that were considered negative and immoral: sex shop tourism in Sluis and nudism on the beach near Cadzand. The local impact of these types of ‘tourism of vice’ was a topic of heated debate within the local community. This thesis demonstrates that the impact of tourism on borderlands cannot be simplified to the construction of a single ‘cross-border identity’. Instead, multiple understandings of regionhood and nationhood were developed in borderland tourism, that overlapped and sometimes even contradicted each other.",
Boven en onder het water: Dordrecht en het platteland in de nasleep van de Sint-Elisabethsvloeden,"O'Donnell, Liam","['Sicking, L.H.J.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The purpose of the thesis is to investigate the role that urban institutions played in the changing relationship between the city of Dordrecht and its surrounding countryside in the aftermath of the St. Elizabeth’s floods of 1421 and 1424. Dordrecht was one of the few cities in Holland that managed to expand its influence over neighbouring rural areas during the fifteenth century, through such means as the acquisition of regional staple rights. This process has generally been characterised by historians as largely coercive in nature and motivated by desperate protectionism in the wake of the devastating floods. The thesis first examines the various methods by which Dordrecht came to dominate the surrounding countryside economically and politically. The thesis then looks at evidence of economic liberalisation, investigating why it was enacted for some sectors while others remained tightly controlled. Finally, the thesis examines the role the urban guilds played in these developments. In conclusion, the thesis argues that the creation of regional staple rights was motivated more by pragmatism than desperation. The coercive power of Dordrecht was limited by a number of factors, and it had to relax restrictions on trade as often as it tightened them. The guilds were often negatively affected by these decisions, and it is clear they were not the driving force behind policy-making.","['Dordrecht', 'institutional', 'staple right', ""St. Elizabeth's flood"", 'guild']"

Om het 'moderne beginsel': M.D. van Limburg Stirum en de Antidienstvervangingsbond 1875-1898,"Hageman, Bas Pieter","['Schoenmaker, Ben']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,nl,"The Antidienstvervangingsbond (ADVB) fought conscription replacement in the Dutch military from 1875 to 1898. Wealthy conscripts had been able to have their conscription fulfilled by a paid substitute, known as a remplaçant. Menno David van Limburg Stirum was the founder and remarkable leader of the ADVB who sought to end this injustice. As a former minister of War who had failed to politically accomplish this, Van Stirum aimed to influence political decision-making by influencing the public opinion. The asssociation, which counted more than 9000 members, was disbanded in 1898, shortly after conscription replacement was abolished by law. This study will analyze whether the ADVB was relatively succesful in achieving its goal by comparing it to other Dutch abolishment movements of the time, called 'Afschaffers', such as the Anti-dagbladzegelverbond or the Maatschappij tot Nut van den Javaan. The comparison between the ADVB and the other 'afschaffers' has been drawn with regards to three different aspects: its methods, its message and the role of the leader. Firstly, the ADVB's methods are very similar to those of the other anti-movements. It is characteristic of the anti-movements that sprouted in the Netherlands from the 1840s and onwards. The message of the ADVB can be divided into three different arguments that they used, categorized as military, moral and social matters. This wide array of problems adressed by the ADVB was somewhat unique, although similarities with other abolishers can certainly be found. However, the aspect that made the ADVB the most unique was its leader. No other Dutch anti-movement had such a profound impression laid upon them as the ADVB had by its founder, Van Limburg Stirum. He was by far the most influential person in the movement, as most of the work, writing and financial support for the ADVB can be attributed to him. Van Stirum also ruled the ADVB with an iron fist. After he died in 1891, the association was only a shadow of its former self. The succes of the ADVB was relatively small, as it did not succeed in quickly reaching its direct goal of abolishment of conscription replacement. Nonetheless, the ADVB was able to effectively spread its message across the Dutch upper class, which was one of its indirect goals. They should therefore be given more credit by historians for the eventual political decision to end conscription replacement.","['Antidienstvervangingsbond', 'Limburg Stirum', 'dienstvervanging', 'ADVB', 'Afschaffers', 'dienstplicht', 'remplaçanten', 'moderne beginsel']"
An ancient Forest in Contemporary Manhattan - 'Time Landscape' and notions of nature,"Bekturova, Azem","['Crucq, A.K.C.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the course of history, the once reverent and humble man, subordinated to natural forces has changed his relationship to his natural environment, leading to our current geological age, in which human activity is the dominant force on climate, earth’s geology and ecosystems. The depiction of man’s relationship to nature has been expressed in countless representations of landscapes within the discipline of the arts, nevertheless, the Land Art movement, which originated around the 1960s in the US took this artistic approach to the theme of the landscape on a whole new level, by incorporating their vision into already existing, physical landscapes. American artist Alan Sonfist was one of the first artists to engage with those human-centred changes in our behaviour with nature, by producing Time Landscape in the city of New York. The project had been proposed to the municipality of New York City already in the year 1965, however, it took almost thirteen years to realise due to difficult negotiations. Time Landscape, a project which still exists in downtown Manhattan today and recently turned fifty years old, is an attempt to recreate a pre-colonial forest that once existed on the same site before man’s interference into the natural landscape. Serving on the one hand as a memorial to extinct species of plants, vanished due to urbanisation, and on the other hand as a visual inspiration for renewing the city’s natural environment, it is an artwork that reflects ecological concerns towards the well-being of the planet, which has been endangered by a changing relationship between man and nature.","['landscape', 'nature', 'environmental art']"
Nietzsche: de transformatie van het pessimisme en het overwinnen van de moraal,"Doornenbal, Jesse","['Siemens, Herman']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,nl,"In deze studie verken ik de ontwikkeling van Friedrich Nietzsches filosofie over pessimisme in relatie tot waarheid, moraliteit en leven. Dit onderzoek is opgezet aan de hand van een woordstudie naar ‘pessimisme’, zodat Nietzsches meervoudige gebruik van dit concept zichtbaar wordt. De verschillende betekenissen die hieruit voortkomen relateer ik aan de verwante filosofische problematiek. In de eerste plaats richt ik mij op het gebruik van ‘pessimisme’ in ‘Die Gebürt der Tragödie’ (1872) en de vroege ‘Nachlass’. In deze teksten spelen de tragische Grieken, Schopenhauer en de kunst een sleutelrol. In de tweede plaats richt ik mij op het gebruik van ‘pessimisme’ in de late ‘Vorredes’ en het vijfde boek van ‘Die fröhliche Wissenschaft’. Nietzsche schreef al deze teksten rond 1886 en voegde ze toe aan zijn eerder gepubliceerde werken. In deze teksten keert Nietzsche terug naar het probleem van pessimisme, maar beschrijft hij tevens zijn eigen ontwikkelingsgeschiedenis en de rol van zijn denken over pessimisme daarin. Door de focus op deze twee momenten in Nietzsches werk kan ik pessimisme gebruiken om licht te schijnen op de ontwikkeling van zijn denken. In deze thesis wordt daarmee zichtbaar op welke wijze Nietzsche door middel van zijn verhandeling over pessimisme herhaaldelijk geconfronteerd wordt met de taak om de relatie tussen moraliteit, waarheid en het leven te heroverwegen, om de waarde van moraliteit en waarheid vanuit een standpunt in het leven in twijfel te trekken.","['Nietzsche', 'Pessimisme', 'Moraliteit', 'Waarheid', 'Levensbeaming', 'Schopenhauer', 'Romantiek']"
A Wife and a Warrior: The Significance of Gender for Maitreyi's and Gargi's Philosophy,"Heil, Cecilia","['Harris, Stephen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanişad two female philosophers participate in debates whose voices are part of the intellectual narrative constructed in the text. This paper will try to understand how these two female scholars, Maitreyi and Gargi, are integrated into this predominantly male narrative. These two women are alone in an intellectual environment of men and this paper will seek to understand how their gender influences their philosophy. This paper is an exploration of female voices, their talents and unique contributions. We will argue that by granting these characters and their distinctive ways of debating a stage, we can highlight their importance within a classic text as the Upanişads, and also within the contemporary academy.  This paper will first explore the character Maitreyi. After a summary and brief analysis of her dialogue with Yājñavalkya, we will explain the significance of Maitreyi’s femininity, which manifests in her role as a wife. In a second chapter, we will focus on Gargi by briefly summarizing and interpreting her dialogues. This will be followed by a study of the relevance of gender for the figure of Gargi who rhetorically reverses her gender and debates in innovative ways. The paper will close with a third chapter aimed at presenting and critiquing past academic readings of the figures and arguing for the importance of giving these characters a voice within a male narrative. This paper will seek to demonstrate the different ways in which gender influences the women’s dialogues: While her femaleness grants Maitreyi access to an intimate discussion with her husband, it allows Gargi to employ innovative debating techniques, setting her apart from her fellow debaters. We will argue, refuting interpretations by Ranade and Madhavananda who present Gargi as superficial and chatty, that Gargi and Maitreyi deserve to be respected and placed in the spotlight due to their innovative perspective, their passion and their special access to the debates that distinguish them and are rooted in their gender. ","['Upanisads', 'Gender', 'Indian Philosophy']"
Consequences of the German 5G discourse for the development of the EU's strategic autonomy,"Vorwald de Vega, Marta Isabel","['Forough, Mohammadbagher']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The concept of European Strategic Autonomy (ESA) was first introduced in the EU’s Global Strategy of 2016 and alludes to a stronger role of the EU in international politics, to consequently achieve more autonomy in its foreign and security policy. For the European Union (EU), 5G is an integral determinant of strategic autonomy, having implications for security and economic policy (a foreign policy tool). The question that this research study has attempted to answer is to what extent has the German discourse on 5G (from 2018 until 2020) shaped the development of the EU’s strategic autonomy. The independent variables identified in the literature review (which explain the security and economic implications of 5G, that can shape the development of ESA), were explored through the German discourse. This discourse is particularly important since Germany is one of the leading countries in the EU and the EU’s foreign and security policy depends strongly on Germany’s decisions. Since ESA depends on the legitimacy of the EU member states and the approach to 5G remains a national decision, analysing the national discourse of a member state made more sense than looking at the EU’s discourse on 5G. The results of the discourse analysis show that the development of ESA has been slightly strengthened.","['EU foreign and security policy', 'German foreign policy', 'European Strategic Autonomy', '5G', 'Digital technology', 'Discursive Institutionalism', 'IT-security', 'EU security', 'EU economy', 'Geopolitics']"

Becoming One with the Way: A Search for a Solution to the Problem of Duality,"Stephenson, Jeremy","['Li, Jingjing']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Philosophy and human thought are replete with mutually exclusive dualism. As a result, our understanding of reality is limited and our use of conceptual language is dangerously misconstrued. In pursuit of a solution to this problem, this thesis asks how it has been apprehended by two very different traditions: that of Jacques Derrida and Buddhism. More specifically, I discuss Derrida’s semiotic theory of deconstruction known as différance, in order to broach the apparent linguistic aspect to the problem of duality. On the other hand, I explicate a variety of Buddhist doctrine in order to discuss the problem as seen through the ideas of Kyoto School Zen scholars, especially Nishida Kitarō. In line with these thinkers, I first highlight their acknowledgement of the problem of duality, before asking to what extent it actually is problematic. These implications will hopefully become clearer after I discuss the contextual scope of both traditions, which precedes an illustration of their respective theoretical approaches. Furthermore, I introduce an additional consideration pertaining to the problem of duality: the risk of re-reification. By discussing this sub-problem through the eyes of Derrida and Buddhists, I explore the idea of a middle way. Finally, I ask what a meaningful and applicable solution to the problem of duality might look like, by entertaining Victor Hori’s notion of non-duality. As such, this project seeks not only to provide a solution to the problem of duality, but also shows how intercultural philosophy allows for constructive dialogues between cultures.","['Derrida', 'Nishida', 'Sunyata', 'Différance', 'Duality', 'Non-duality', 'Language', 'Identity', 'Zen', 'Kyoto']"

The hybrid, multi-layered identities and subjective perceptions of nationality amongst these communities have been covered by academic research. At the same time, Latvia and Estonia have engaged in the political dialogue of ‘Europeanization’ as Member States of the European Union, as part of a top-down process to understand and, at times, promote a common ‘European identity’, which has also been frequent analyzed and discussed in academic literature. While both these aspects of research have been extensive, there has been less contemporary investigation at their crossroads: European identity amongst Russians in Estonia and Latvia. This paper performs a ‘research synthesis’ type of meta-analysis on academic and policy papers to shed light on this potential gap between academic literature and policy research. Its conclusions have implications for researchers and practitioners of both kinds, as well as grounds to consider the gap as a form of ‘methodological Othering’ itself.","['Othering', 'European Identity', 'Baltic Russians']"
"“Industrial Concentration, Economic Growth, and Inequality dynamics throughout the stages of industrialisation: a comparative and transnational analysis”","Calabrese, Matteo","['Touwen, Jeroen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The analysis of the trends for industrial concentration, GDP growth per capita, and income inequality – based on data from IPUMS International, Maddison Project, Clio-Infra, and World Bank Open Data – in the context of the US, Canada and other selected countries from Europe, South America, and East Asia, has led to the following results: a) after a comparison between the Krugman Index values and the GINI coefficients for the historical series of US, UK, and Spain, I argue in the first place, that the 1970-2000 series for the group of East-Asian countries subject to the research is coherent with the presence of “displaced” Kuznets’ waves – where the latter is a theoretical tool (introduced by Milanovic) that revises the original Kuznets’ hypothesis by shifting the focus from the long-run to more limited period of times. Secondly, for the group of South American countries analysed, I confirm the results of Deinenger and Squire on the unidirectionality of the trends for economic growth and income inequality between the 1960s and the 2000s. Namely, that both trends are raising, instead of diverging at a certain point, as it would have been expected, according to the original Kuznets’ hypothesis. Nevertheless, the inversion of the income inequality levels for Brazil, and the extreme oscillatory nature of the trends for Argentina, seem to prospect a potential displacement of a Kuznets’s wave for the two countries in a subsequent period. Limitations in the available datasets for the years after 2000s hindered, though, a consistent verification of this hypothesis. b) I argue on the one hand, that, for the Western countries analysed, the series for industrial concentration and income inequality between 1860 and 1970 are fully compatible with a Kuznets’ wave. On the other, that the series after the 1970s are instead in contrast with Milanovic’s thesis of a second Kuznets’ wave starting during these years. Nevertheless, the value for industrial concentration that I found for the US in 2015 can have some relationship with the rising income inequality levels analysed by Milanovic. Further research should be 75 devoted to the analysis of this issue when the census datasets for the 2020s decade will be made available. c) I argue that a further theoretical insight, derived from my analysis, can be considered as a corollary of Krugman’s theory on industrial specialisation dynamics. Namely, that being equal the transportation costs and the level of technology/productivity, lighter economic shocks trigger increasing levels of industrial concentration, whereas highly disruptive shocks for the industrial tissue, such as wars and structural economic crises, produce instead decreasing levels of industrial concentration. Further research is necessary, though, in order to corroborate this theory.","['industrial', 'concentration', 'economic', 'growth', 'household', 'inequality']"

Through a case study of the canon of East African colonial history it is demonstrated that historicists methodology, which takes written documentation as the prime source of historical evidence, fails to adequately reconstruct a truthful, multifaceted and inclusive picture of East African colonial history as much of East African history is transmitted orally rather than in print. The historicists' erroneous claim to objectivity, scientific predictability and universal truths based on findings in written primary sources, is deconstructed by use of an alternative historiographical methodology: New Historicism. This paper shows how oral sources can be adequately historicised through a New Historicist lens, thus granting more complete narratives of East African colonial history. In short, it will be argued that the existing documentation of East African colonial history fails to adequately historicise the narratives of local subjectivities (the actual people who experienced colonial oppression) due to Eurocentric overemphasis on the appropriation of written sources rather than incorporating and establishing the value of the many ‘local subjective narratives’ preserved in oral traditions.","['Historiography', 'Historicism', 'New Historicism', 'East African Colonial History', 'Oral History']"
Eten en Identiteit: hoe culinaire cultuur hybriditeit vormt in migratieliteratuur,"de Jong, Amber","['Van Alphen, Ernst']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Film- en literatuurwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In een steeds verder globaliserende wereld is het normale koek geworden dat steeds meer culturen elkaar beïnvloeden door vermenging. Met processen zoals kolonisatie en diaspora in onze geschiedenis is migratie en de generaties die hieruit zijn voortgekomen een, vaak controversieel, onderwerp geworden van contemporaire geschiedenis. Immigranten en de generaties die na hen komen, eerste tot vierde generatie en zelfs verder de toekomst in, scheppen nieuwe culturele netwerken en beïnvloeden de maatschappij waarin zij leven. Dit schept het debat over in hoeverre culturen en identiteiten elkaar kunnen beïnvloeden. Hoe worden mensen die van twee culturen eten beïnvloed door culturele praktijken die origineel niet van hen zijn? In dit essay bekijk ik dit debat nader met behulp van de analyse van culinaire praktijken van migranten in literatuur. De bereiding en het eten van voedsel zijn cultureel divers, zodoende dat familie en identiteit zeer sterk verbonden zijn aan culinaire tradities. Immigranten brengen deze culinaire tradities mee uit hun thuisland om zo gedeeltelijk hun eigen cultuur te preserveren op nieuwe plekken. Daarnaast worden nieuwe praktijken overgenomen van de nieuwe thuislocatie, een proces van culturele assimilatie. Bij assimilatie van culturele praktijken, in dit geval culinaire, wat is de invloed op de identiteit van de desbetreffende immigrant? Is culinaire assimilatie essentieel voor culturele hybriditeit en in hoeverre helpt hybriditeit de integratie? Wat voor voorbeelden geeft de literatuur ons hiervan?",

Woordparen als halfvol/halfleeg in combinatie met partikels. De invloed van partikels op attribuut frames,"Marle, Lindsay van","['Barbiers, Sjef']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Wanneer men aan wil geven dat zijn/haar glas voor vijftig procent gevuld is, heeft diegene twee opties, ‘halfvol’ of ‘halfleeg’, die zo op het eerste gezicht hetzelfde betekenen. Toch wordt er onderscheid gemaakt tussen ‘halfvol’ en ‘halfleeg’. Dit heeft te maken met attribuut framing. ‘In this type of framing an object or event is either described in positive terms or in equivalent negative terms’ (Holleman en Pander Maat 2009, p.2205). In eerder onderzoek naar attribuut framing is alleen gebruik gemaakt theoretische voorbeelden, in natuurlijke taal kunnen attribuut frames ook voorkomen met partikels als al, maar en nog. In deze scriptie doe ik onderzoek naar de invloed van de partikels al, maar en nog op de argumentatieve oriëntatie, de gemarkeerdheid en de evaluatie bij attribuut frames. De argumentatieve oriëntatie wil zeggen in welke richting een gekozen woord stuurt. Bij woordparen als ‘halfvol/halfleeg’ wordt er altijd één van de twee meer gebruikt dan de ander, dit noemen Holleman en Pander Maat (2009) gemarkeerdheid. De evaluatie van een grammaticale constructie houdt in dat de context bepaalt hoe de luisteraar de grammaticale constructie moet evalueren (Verhagen, 2000, p.198). Evaluatie heeft ermee te maken of iets wel of niet wenselijk is. Uit het empirisch onderzoek is gebleken, dat al en nog, nauwelijks invloed hebben op de argumentatieve oriëntatie en maar deze argumentatieve oriëntatie omkeert. Alle onderzochte partikels hebben enige invloed op de gemarkeerdheid. Ook hebben de partikels invloed op de evaluatie, waar bijvoorbeeld een negatieve evaluatie bij een bepaalde context eerst wel mogelijk was, bleek na het toevoegen van een partikel dezelfde evaluatie niet altijd meer mogelijk.",['Onderzoek naar attribuutframes in combinatie met partikels']

Een groep die Chinees als moedertaal heeft en die geen gebruik maken van een lidwoordensysteem in hun moedertaal en een groep die Hongaars als moedertaal heeft en wel een lidwoordensysteem kent in hun moedertaal. 15 Chinese NT2-sprekers en 15 Hongaarse NT2-sprekers hebben de lidwoordeninvultest, die 64 vragen bevat, afgelegd. De resultaten laten zien dat de moedertaal van beide groepen wel degelijk invloed heeft op het correct gebruik van Nederlandse lidwoorden.

It argues that critique from the Chinese government towards the MPODs are the result of the Abe administration’s lack of transparency on the development of the ships. Japan’s increased military presence to meet the demands of Japan-US security alliance, in particular during the Trump administration, further heightened China’s concerns towards the MPODs, exacerbating the Sino-Japanese security dilemma. This thesis employs case study methodology to track the changes in the discourse surrounding the de facto carriers, and divides the narrative into the two US administrations that influenced Abe’s security policy choices: the Obama and Trump administration. This is done to demonstrate whether changes in the security policies of the US also influenced China’s perspective towards the ships. The findings of this study are based of sources ranging from Chinese state press to Japanese defense papers, and help understand how key events surrounding the MPODs increased tensions between China and Japan.",

"Holy Ambiguity, Queerness in the St Sebastian Triptych by the Master of the Holy Kinship","Veldman, Christiaan","['Hartog, Elizabeth den']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research project serves as a case study to examine whether queer theory and traditional iconography can be two distinct yet interrelated entry ways through which a fifteenth century artwork can be more cohesively understood. In order to do so it questions how the St Sebastian Triptych (ca. 1493-94) by the Master of the Holy Kinship, at display in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, constitutes meaning as a painting-with-doors in its format and iconography, and how it articulates its own queerness. This research finds that the Triptych should be understood as a ‘panel with doors’. The Triptych contains painted clues on the inner and outer sides of the wings which demarcate the different spaces of the triptych and connect the inner and outer sides. The narration has the form of a ‘representatively hidden narration'. It appears that the St Sebastian Triptych constitutes its meaning through a gendered juxtaposition of the themes ‘martyr’ and ‘healer’ in the outer and inner wings. St Sebastian is both martyr and healer because of Christ, of which he is an image bearer. The outer wings introduce both themes by juxtaposing female martyr saints opposite to male healer saints. This gendered juxtaposition is also present in the inner wings, where it is applied to St Sebastian’s life and death. The tripartite format allowed the Master of the Holy Kinship to thematically oppose the wings, while he used the middle panel as a place of synthesis. The middle panel merges the opposed elements of the inner side wings. The result is a strongly ambiguous middle panel in which the body of St Sebastian forms the axis and apogee. St Sebastian is shown here both as martyr and healer, passive as well as active, feminine yet male. It is this ambiguity which grants this triptych its enchantment and religious and emotional power. This ambiguity is also the reason why the St Sebastian Triptych can be called ‘queer’. The triptych expresses its queerness in the sensuality and ambiguity of St Sebastian’s body in the middle panel, because it transcends the gendered division as presented in the outer wings. By thematizing pain (martyrdom) and redemption (healing), the St Sebastian Triptych ultimately refers back to Christ’s passion and resurrection. The St Sebastian Altarpiece is part of a larger Christian tradition of hagiographies and visual arts in which an overlap between pain and seduction and between fear and desire is frequent.","['Saint Sebastian', 'triptych', 'altarpiece', 'Cologne', 'fifteenth century', 'Wallraf–Richartz Museum', 'queer theory', 'religious art', 'iconography', 'Master of the Holy Kinship']"

How (not) to eliminate injustice: A philosophical critique of the injustices in democratic societies as proposed by Rawls and Young,"Postma, Angus","['Jong, J.E. de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis shall examine two conceptions of justice, proposed by Rawls and Young respectively, and the society that flows from said conceptions, in order to evaluate them and conclude that they are not able to resolve and prevent injustices. These philosophers are the focus of this thesis as they both attempt to measure and resolve injustice, with Rawls focused on equality and distributive issues whilst Young takes an approach based on resolving oppression by respecting group differences. Existing debates in political philosophy can largely be separated into two categories. Arguably the biggest debates are to be found in the category in which Young’s and Rawls’s work can also be found, revolving around the question of what the best possible society would look like. These discussions, however, assume that there is a satisfying answer to debates that fall in the other category, which includes all discussions surrounding the question of whether states are or can be good at all. By evaluating the societies proposed by Rawls and Young this thesis is situated in the first category of discussion, though avoids the assumption that a state is good or justifiable. Instead, this thesis will attempt to bridge the gap between the discussions by noting the injustices caused by these proposed systems of government, opening the door for the inclusion of anarchist philosophy in discussions about the best possible way to order a society.","['John Rawls', 'Iris Marion Young', 'Justice', 'Democracy']"

First, at the outset of the study, the thesis defines the conceptual basis of small states and to choose and apply an appropriate definition. With this step, the reader will know when the chosen state can be considered small, and which actors in a particular region / globally can be included in this category. The second step considers the determinants of the small states’ foreign policy, including geography, the characteristics of the international political and economic system, the conditions of statehood, internal institutions and norms, and the identities and national interests that society and leadership have. This provides a sound basis for the third stage of the analysis, where the chapter aims to compare the practical applicability of theoretical schools and the role of intangible resources through a case study and to draw attention to the importance of flexible use of theoretical frameworks.","['Oman', 'Foreign Policy', 'Constructivism']"

How the notion of ‘the child’ in Nietzsche’s ‘Thus Spoke Zarathustra’ overcomes the nihilism in Nietzsche’s ‘Genealogy of Morality’,"De Vrijer, Pascal","['Chouraqui, Frank']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Nowadays a lot of people have existential crises. They ask themselves: Why am I here? What is the meaning of life? Why must I suffer this existence? Their question reflects an age old question: suffering for what? They fall prey to nihilistic tendencies, a loss of all meaning. A pain, a depression, a pessimism that they do not seem to be able to shake. They lack the strength of Atlas, who carried the world on his shoulders. The burdens of the earth too heavy for them to bear. Taking life serious is a massive mountain weighing upon one’s shoulders. I want to release these darkened souls of humanity from the anchor that keeps them from lifting up to the lightness of the clouds and teach them of the laughter of the child. By reading Nietzsche's 'Genealogy of Morality' through the 'metamorphosis of Zarathustra' I want to show how the metaphor of 'the Child' is able to combat and overcome the nihilism, that Nietzsche speaks of in the Genealogy, through the act of not-taking-serious, or even more so, making-fun-of any form of nihilism. When we understand the steps of the metamorphosis, the reading of the Genealogy of Morality will become clearer. Not only will this provide us with a deeper insight into the Genealogy, but it will also offer us the necessary tools to extend beyond the conclusion of the Genealogy of Morality. This conclusion being: “to conclude by saying what I said at the beginning: man still prefers to will nothingness, than not will at all. . .” It is in this conclusion that we find the importance of this thesis. The genealogy of morality ends up finding ‘the will to nothingness’, or ‘nihilism’, the conclusion that there is no meaning to be found in the universe. Yet, the genealogy offers no real salvation to overcoming this will to nothingness. It is through the metamorphosis that we can find this overcoming of the great danger to mankind, its most sublime temptation and seduction. It is through the metamorphosis that we can combat standstill, mankind looking back wearily, turning its will against life, and the onset of the final sickness becoming gently, sadly manifest. By reading the genealogy of morality through the metamorphosis of Zarathustra I will be able to go beyond Nietzsche’s teachings and show that the not-taking-serious, which I view as the most important aspect of the child, combats nihilism. To do this we first have to understand the three metamorphoses. In the second part, I will explain the genealogy of morality through the metamorphosis. In the last part, I will argue how the child is able to overcome the nihilism in the genealogy of morality.","['Nietzsche', 'Thus spoke Zarathustra', 'Genealogy of Morality', 'nihilism', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'the child']"

The Phoenix as a Symbol of Succession Anxiety in Early Modern Literature,"Breemerkamp, Birgitte","['Fikkers, Lotte']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In royal (self-)representation, one recurring symbol is that of the phoenix. Symbolizing eternal life and hermaphroditism, the phoenix is connected to the theories of the body politic and the body theatrical. The phoenix was used as a symbol by both male monarchs, such as James VI & I (1566-1625), Louis XIII (1601-1643), and Louis XIV (1638-1715), and female monarchs such as Elizabeth I (1533-1603) and Christina of Sweden (1626-1689). Elizabeth I’s use of the phoenix symbol is generally understood to refer to perpetual renewal and eternity,1 whereas Christina of Sweden’s use of the phoenix symbol is interpreted as a reference to hermaphroditism and the dual-gendered body politic. Scholarship on the French kings connects the phoenix symbolism to contemporary (political) anxieties over monarchial succession. To date, no systematic study has been made of the phoenix symbol as an expression of monarchial succession anxiety in early modern English society. This is curious, since the English monarchy has seen quite a number of problematic successions since the death of Henry VIII in 1547 and throughout the seventeenth century. The last decades of the reign of Elizabeth I, who died childless in 1603, is known to have caused succession anxiety. Therefore, this thesis aims to fill this gap in scholarship by performing a quantitative as well as a qualitative analysis of the occurrence of phoenix symbolism in early modern English literature and art, with an emphasis on the symbol’s use as an expression of succession anxiety. For the study of the occurrence of the phoenix symbol in early modern English literature, the Early English Books Online (EEBO) database has been used. A search on EEBO for the keyword ‘phoenix’ yielded 5810 hits in 2768 records/documents. The search results were manually sorted, excluding documents referring to the Elizabethan frigat ‘Phoenix’ and the Phoenix Theatre in Drury Lane, London. Ultimately, 2474 documents containing phoenix symbolism were identified (listed in Appendix A), of which 270 documents directly refer to either a monarch or to royal succession (listed in Appendix B). These results have been visualized in the graphs depicted throughout this thesis in order to clarify my arguments. For the qualitative analysis the most interesting and noteworthy EEBO search results have been selected for analysis. The quantitative and qualitative analyses presented in this thesis reveal that the phoenix symbol can be considered an expression of anxieties over succession. The phoenix symbol is not only used as a universal symbol of the monarchy, but also often served to specifically invoke the memory of the persona ficta and the (posthumously mythologised) reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Instead of being a general symbol of royalty, the phoenix symbol in early modern English society was often used to signify Queen Elizabeth I or her reign, which was hailed as the Golden Age as part of the rhetoric of nostalgia as well as her posthumous memorial cult. This strong connection to Elizabeth I caused the use of the phoenix symbol to soar in the first half of the seventeenth century. Ironically, this strong connection is also the main reason for the symbol’s downfall at the end of the century. Moreover, the Scientific Revolution and the demythologisation of the monarchy caused royal symbolism in general to lose its significance and its meaning by the start of the eighteenth century. The rise and fall of the phoenix symbol, spanning from the mid-sixteenth until the early eighteenth century, mirrors these socio-political developments.","['phoenix', 'succession anxiety', 'Elizabeth I', 'early modern England', 'early modern literature', 'literary symbol', ""king's two bodies""]"

Because constructs of masculinity are inherently hierarchal, we would expect the aged to become a “subclass” against which younger participants validate their own masculinity and increase their standing. Thus, in the introduction of her ground-breaking book Being a Man: Negotiating Ancient Constructs of Masculinity, published in 2017, I would have to agree with I. Zsolany’s statement: “to enact a version of masculinity considered less than a societal ideal cannot only be undesirable, but humiliating.” However, against my own presumptions, Mesopotamian art and literature reveals a gerontocratic society which favoured the aged over the young, one where the dominant social construct was monopolised by a group who were unable to adhere to its values and norms, and thus struggled meet its expectations. In this thesis we will investigate this paradox, using the Standard Babylonian (abbreviated as “SB” throughout the essay) Gilgamesh epic to explore the ways in which older men navigated the obstacles of ageing whilst paying particular attention to how they validated their own masculinity based on that of younger men.","['Gilgamesh', 'Gender', 'Masculinity', 'Ageing']"

De passages met intensiveerders zijn verder opgedeeld in vier categorieën aan de hand van twee parameters: contextafhankelijkheid en semantische rijkheid. De vier categorieën zijn als volgt: ‘contextonafhankelijk & semantisch arm’, ‘contextonafhankelijk & semantisch rijk’, ‘contextafhankelijk & semantisch arm’ en ‘contextafhankelijk & semantisch rijk’. Eerst worden de passages met intensiveerders vergeleken met de passages zonder intensiveerders, vervolgens de verschillende intensiveerderscategorieën onderling. Over het algemeen beïnvloeden taalintensiveerders de overtuigingskracht negatief. Dit effect is echter klein. De passages met intensiveerders uit de categorie ‘contextonafhankelijk & semantisch rijk’ worden het overtuigendst bevonden: alleen intensiveerders uit deze categorie lijken positief op de overtuigingskracht in te werken en respondenten kennen hogere scores toe aan deze passages. Er zijn echter verscheidene alternatieve variabelen die de (significante) resultaten kunnen verklaren. De overtuigingskrachtscores van de passages correleren namelijk sterk met de geloofwaardigheidsscores. Het zou daarom kunnen dat intensiveerders slechts invloed uitoefenen op geloofwaardigheid en niet op overtuigingskracht.","['Taalintensiveerders', 'Overtuigingskracht', 'Fondswervingsteksten', 'Goede doelen', 'Menselijke gezondheid', 'Taalintensiverende middelen']"

Verbale Diminutive (im Niederländischen: Frequentative) deuten in der Regel eine Handlung mit einer geringeren Intensität an, wie beispielsweise das niederländische Wort mompelen oder das deutsche schnüffeln. In der Fachliteratur werden zudem auch die iterative und Bedeutung und eine onomatopoetische Qualität des Suffixes unterschieden. Interessanterweise wurden die verbalen Diminutive trotz ihrer Wichtigkeit in der Sprache fürs Niederländische bis heute kaum zum Forschungsgegenstand gemacht. In der Bachelorarbeit gehe ich die Frage nach, was im Niederländischen die Funktion des -el-Suffixes in verbalen Diminutiven ist. Auch wird anhand des Wortstammes bestimmt, ob das Bildungsmuster des Verbs Einfluss auf die Bedeutung von -el hat. Lepelen (von lepel), huppelen (von huppen) und babbelen (keine Basis) zeigen unterschiedliche Bildungsmuster auf. Es wäre eine interessante Frage, ob -el in den unterschiedlichen Typen von Bildungsmustern andere Rollen übernimmt. Um diese Frage beantworten zu können, habe ich mich für einen synchronen Ansatz entschieden. Als Basis meiner Analyse nehme ich eine umfangreiche Liste, die alle verbalen Diminutive im Niederländischen enthält. Ich werde mir einen Teil dieser Diminutive anschauen und feststellen, welche Rolle das -el¬-Suffix erfüllt. Jurafsky hat sich zu einer universellen Semantik von Diminutiven geäußert und verschiedene semantische und pragmatische Dimensionen aufgedeckt. Anhand dieses Models wird die Rolle von -el identifiziert. Darauf folgt eine (statistische) Analyse, die zeigt, inwiefern die verschiedenen Bildungsmuster ähnliche bzw. unterschiedliche Rollen von -el aufzeigen.",

In the literature, there are mixed findings about the debilitative effect of foreign language anxiety on L2 performance and L2 fluency. Moreover, it is unclear how foreign language anxiety affects L2 speech processing. The following study investigates the effect of foreign language anxiety on L1 Dutch L2 English learners’ fluency. By means of an experiment, the L2 learners performed two speaking tasks in both a high and a low-anxiety condition. Their L2 utterance fluency was explored quantitatively by means of temporal measures, whereas their cognitive fluency was explored qualitatively with stimulated recalls. In the high-anxiety condition, the L2 learners reported that they felt more anxious and judged their performance as lower. However, there was no difference in L2 utterance fluency between the conditions. The stimulated recalls did reveal a difference in the number and quality of processing issues between the anxiety conditions. Therefore, the exact target of foreign language anxiety in L2 learners remains obscure and it is fruitful to further explore its effect in L2 performance and L2 learners and find successful implementations to reduce foreign language anxiety in the classroom.","['foreign language anxiety', 'L2 learner', 'L2 utterance fluency', 'L2 cognitive fluency', 'stimulated recall']"

Of Attributive Moral Responsibility,"Heshusius, Jesper","['Gijsbers, Victor']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this paper, I criticize a common feature found in theories of moral responsibility, namely that moral responsibility (MR) is supposed to be a property of agents. It shall be argued that MR should instead be thought of as a different type of quality. On my account, moral responsibility is an attribute that can be correctly ascribed to agents. I establish firstly four desiderata used to evaluate the adequacy of any theory of moral responsibility. Using these, I argue that neither libertarian nor compatibilist theories of free will provide a sure bulwark of moral responsibility as a property. This, combined with the rationale involving the problematic nature of this property, leads me to a conclusion similar to that of the hard determinist: the property of moral responsibility cannot exist. However, in order to avoid responsibility nihilism that follows from this moral responsibility scepticism, I propose that MR may exist as an attribute that can be correctly ascribed to human and non-human agents by following fair rules. Finally, I opt to explain why such account of attributive moral responsibility (AMR) provides a more adequate response to the desiderata than rival accounts.","['moral responsibility', 'free will', 'determinism', 'attributive moral responsibility', 'moral property', 'alternate possibilities']"

With a recent renewed interest in police militarisation, this research presents a case study of the British and French police organisations and how they have evolved to deal with political demonstrations. By creating a theoretical framework around the role of culture in police organisations, an analysis of the organisational culture of these police organisations and how they respond to political demonstrations was examined. The case study focuses on a constructivist approach to how the traditions and identities were created from the evolution of what are the modern police forces in the UK and France. This approach also analysed how these police organisations dealt with threats such as terrorism and public disorder and what norms and values were created from this. The case study examines two of the major events in the UK and France. The G20 Summit protests in London in 2009 and the 2018 Yellow Vest Movement in France. The police organisation and response to these events was examined through the identities, norms and values that have been created in the British and French police forces. These identities, norms and values continue to shape the police response to political demonstration and the public view the role of the police and the overall debate on police militarisation.","['Political Demonstrations', 'Police Militarisation', 'Military Culture', 'Organisational Culture', 'Constructivism', 'British Police', 'French Police', 'Yellow Vest Movement', 'G20 Protests London']"

My application of trauma theory focuses in particular on the fantastical bodies of the characters that feature in these two novels. I posit that in spite of their many differences, there is common ground to be found between the two novels through their shared exploration of the neglected traumatic wound as embodied by the fantastical body. I argue that both Carson and Okorafor utilise the fantastical body to disrupt dominant narratives that sublimate the traumatic wound and, furthermore, that it is through these fantastical bodies that the traumatic wound may be properly assimilated and thus allow for hopeful change. The structure of the following thesis is thus centred around the idea that these fantastical bodies may be interpreted as embodying both traumatic wound and, a hopeful change, with each chapter containing a section on body as wound and body as change.","['Trauma', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Northern Irish', 'Nigerian American', 'Fantastical Body', 'Body as Wound', 'neglected histories', 'Nnedi Okorafor', 'Jan Carson']"

Carving Agency out of Ice: Regional Agency in Russia's Arctic Development,"Son, Liam van","['Bader, Max']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to analyse the institutional framework guiding Russia’s growing interest in Arctic development. In particular, the research aimed to answer the question: How much agency do the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have in the socio-economic development of the Arctic? The focus of the research is on transport infrastructure, the reason being that Arctic development hinges on the creation of an effective transport system so that other, more lucrative economic interests can be accessed and exploited. The research engaged with the legislative and strategic documents of both the federal authorities and the regions through a doctrinal analysis of policy mechanisms. The thesis contends that regions do have significant agency in the development of transport infrastructure, in so far as said transport infrastructure forms a part of the Support Zone mechanism. In doing so, the thesis shows that the Arctic regions enjoy the independence necessary to identify areas of economic interest in their regions, formulate a cluster of development projects, implement a corresponding program, and monitor the program’s progress. Additionally, the thesis was able to identify the limits of regional agency, which exist depending on the importance of a given socio-economic development project to the federal authorities. We see this determinant in practice in the hierarchical distinction between the Northern Sea Route and the land-based transport systems (including river and air transport). Due to the geopolitical potential of the Northern Sea Route, it occupies a place of supreme importance in Arctic development, and is therefore governed by the Centre. In contrast, land-based transport systems are principally of national, and economic importance, and thus their development is delegated to the regions.","['Russian Arctic Development', 'Transport Infrastructure', 'Federalism']"

Feminist Voices in Modern Mythmaking: On the representation of women in Pat Barker’s The Silence of the Girls and Madeline Miller’s Circe,"Govers, Shanna","['Minnaard, Liesbeth']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the last few decades, there has been an emergence of feminist texts that relate themselves to Homer’s renowned myths, The Iliad and The Odyssey. Inspired by these feminist narratives that revolve around the centring of the female characters within a myth, this thesis poses an analysis of the emergence and importance of mythmaking by women writers. In my research, I have focused on Pat Barker’s The Silence of the Girls Madeline Miller’s Circe, two of the most recent examples of feminist mythmaking. Both Barker and Miller are able to give a voice to women that have often been silenced in ‘classic’ myths: Briseis and Circe. The texts foreground the complexity of their female protagonists by relating their stories to the patriarchal world surrounding them. Building onto this, both texts reflect on mythmaking and storytelling on an overarching level, thereby offering us a subtle critique on the way myths have been written and read in the past. Strikingly, scholars have recently studied these feminist mythmakings as mere ‘rewritings’ or ‘fictionalisations’ of Homer’s ‘classics’. The effect is a limiting analysis in which the true intertextuality of the stories gets lost in a restricting methodology. In this thesis, I propose a new way to analyze these mythmakings in an appropriate and respectful way, by using the concept of ‘mosaic mythmaking’.","['feminism', 'literature', 'circe', 'the silence of the girls', 'pat barker', 'madeline miller', 'mythmaking', 'myth', 'representation', 'woman']"

Ook in de huidige secundaire literatuur vinden we deze opvatting terug. In mijn scriptie heb ik deze opvatting geconcretiseerd en verdiept aan de hand van een case study over het houten paard. Ik heb gekeken hoe de literaire vertelling van Stesichorus zich verhoudt tot Homerus' Odyssee en de Ilias Parva en Iliou Persis uit de Epische Cyclus. Aan de hand van drie invalshoeken, namelijk de maker van het houten paard, de Grieken in het paard en het debat van de Trojanen, heb ik deze vraag beantwoord. Uit deze analyse komt naar voren dat Stesichorus meer nadruk legt op onbelangrijke personages. Daarnaast lijkt het gemeenschapsideaal belangrijker dan het epische heldenideaal. Deze verschillen kunnen op een aantal manieren verklaard worden. Ten eerste past dit in het patroon van Stesichorus' poëzie. Daarnaast wil Homerus Odysseus centraal stellen in zijn verhaal, terwijl Stesichorus het verhaal juist op een andere manier wil vertellen om zijn epische collega's te overtreffen. Ten derde spelen genreverschillen een rol: waarschijnlijk past de focus op het gemeenschapsideaal beter bij het genre van de koorlyriek, omdat dit een sociale functie had in de polis.","['Stesichorus', 'Epische Cyclus', 'Houten paard', 'Val van Troje', ""Homerus' Odyssee"", 'Close reading', 'Koorlyriek']"

North Macedonia is considered to be a pioneer in complying with the EU’s conditionality framework since 2001 and has received the European Commission’s positive recommendations to open the accession negotiations in 2009 and 2019. Although the EU’s incentive-based conditionality strategy is considered to be effective in academia, a scenario whereby a candidate country has adopted the EU conditions and was nevertheless rejected by the European Council has not been analysed yet. Consequently, this thesis is based on qualitative primary and secondary data, in which interviews played the essential sources of information. Rationalist and constructivist theories in EU conditionality studies play the fundamental basis as explanatory behavioural models in this research. The results of this research reveal that North Macedonia has not been discouraged by the French veto and eventually implemented final provisions of the EU integration process. On 24 March 2020, North Macedonia received the green light to the start of the accession talks.","['North Macedonia', 'EU Conditionality', 'European Union', 'European Council', 'Constructivism', 'External Incentives Model']"
"The self-portrait, inside out - The implications of incorporating medical procedures in self-portraiture","Singeling, Eva","['Bertens, Crucq']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Starting around the twentieth century, technological innovations and shifting ideas in self-portraiture resulted in more body-focused self-representations, because access to every aspect of the body has become significantly easier. The relationship between the material self and social self has changed since artists started to incorporate medical procedures in their artistic practices, which allowed them to represent themselves through their internal body. Three self-portrait series that have been produced by incorporating medical procedures in the creating process will be discussed. These concern Body of Work (2019) by Itamar Gilboa, Self (1991-current) by Marc Quinn, and Self-Portraits (2012) by Angela Palmer. These artists have used the representation of their bodies as a starting point to produce sculptural self-portraits. The incorporation of medical procedures comes with its implications. By discussing these series, it will be demonstrated how the use of medical procedures goes hand in hand with a more scientific, transparent and malleable view on the body and the manners in which this challenges the notion of the self in self-portraiture. To get to a deeper understanding of the artworks, an analysis is performed using theoretical sources that reflect upon the intersection between the fields of art history and (medical) science. This analysis will provide a deeper understanding of how contemporary artists make use of procedures that derive from the medical field, how these explore the boundaries of self-portraiture, and how a new domain is opened up within the genre that challenges more traditional modes of representing the self.","['self-portrait', 'art', 'science', 'technology', 'medicine', 'self', 'identity', 'body', 'sculpture']"

Employees of the Sea? Fisher Identity Formation in Mafia Island,"Haan, Mariam de","['Abbink, Jan', 'Bavinck, Maarten']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The Mafia archipelago in Tanzania has been internationally and nationally recognised as an area with an immense amount of biodiversity. The creation of the first marine park in Tanzania, Mafia Island Marine Park, reflects this recognition. However, little has been researched about how the protection of this biodiversity affects the main economic industry in the archipelago, the fishing industry. This thesis adds to our understanding about fishing in Mafia by examining the influence of government policies, WWF programs and marine conservation on the formation of fishermen identity within Mafia. It is based on three arguments. Firstly, identity is formed through the interactions that an individual has with other members of their community. Secondly, this thesis treats fishermen as an identity group and argues that the economic activities of a person provides insight into their identity. Thirdly, due to the importance of the environment and the reiteration of this importance by the majority of interviewees, the ocean, marine animals, wind and moon are treated as one interconnected entity. This entity is referred to as the environment within this thesis, which examines, in an exploratory manner, the communication between the environment and fishermen. In order to create an effective and accurate analysis of fishing in Mafia, this thesis is built upon an interdisciplinary approach. To academia this thesis provides a unique analysis of identity formation as it examines how both human and non-human entities shape identity formation. Furthermore, this thesis includes indigenous knowledge claims and treats the perceptions of the fishermen with high regard. At a societal level, this thesis aims to provide a platform for the voices of the fishermen and people in Mafia who feel marginalised from Tanzania and neglected by the Tanzanian government.","['Identity formation', 'Mafia Island', 'Tanzania', 'Fishermen', 'Marine conservation', 'Fishing']"

As children’s books are often to children it is important that these books and their translation meet a certain level of ‘performativity’ in order to be successfully read aloud. This thesis aims to examine whether Low’s point-scoring schema for the evaluation of rhyme (2008) and ‘pentathlon principle’ can be used as a quality assessment tool for the translation of children’s books into Dutch and if these models can be used to help improve the reading aloud of songs and poems in children’s books. By means of a Thinking Aloud Protocol and the awarding of points via Low’s point schema, the results showed that whilst the schema can definitely help translators when translating children’s song, there are still some key issues – such as repetition – that need to be addressed before Low’s models can be used as a quality assessment tool.","[""Children's books"", 'Translation', 'Song translation', 'Rhyme', 'Reading out loud', 'Performativity', 'Pentathlon principle']"

This analysis was performed through the lenses of both Adaptation Theory (Hutcheon, Joyce, Kline) and Character Studies (Eder, Jannadis & Schneider, Redmond), in order to achieve a complete picture as to how the character of Sherlock Holmes was adapted from Doyle’s stories and further developed for the television series. This study, first critically explores the stories and the character of Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories and how the detective handles the situations in which he finds himself as well as how he interacts with other characters. The second chapter studies the development of the character of Sherlock throughout both seasons of the series, with an emphasis on season three, as well as explore the cases Sherlock gets involved in, since they are starting to bleed into his personal life. The third chapter focuses on season four of BBC Sherlock, in which the character of Sherlock and his relationships completely overshadow the cases, shifting the series towards the genre of melodrama. The series is compared to the content of Doyle's stories throughout all chapter in order to explore how the creators of the television series adapted the Victorian Holmes to a twenty-first century Sherlock.","['Sherlock Holmes', 'Arthur Conan Doyle', 'Steven Moffat', 'Mark Gatiss', 'BBC Sherlock', 'Character Studies', 'Adaptation Theory', 'Character Development']"

Standardisation in Early Modern Norwich: A case-study of the third-person singular indicative present tense markers,"Gordijn, Cynthia","['Gordon, Moragh']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Standardisation is often explained as a linear process in which Standard English is said to have emerged from one ancestor dialect, namely the Chancery Dialect. This concept based on the SAD hypothesis has recently been challenged by various scholars who discovered linguistic features from language varieties outside of London in modern-day Standard English. However, the exact impact that other dialect areas had on shaping the standard is still relatively unclear. As a result, contemporary investigations have adopted a view that examines language change 'from below', as Standard English seems to be the result of a hybrid of features which originate from different locations. In order to shed more light on the rise of supralocal varieties and how their features diffused, the EMST project focuses on urban vernaculars of major regional centres separately in the period between 1400-1700. Nonetheless, in terms of urban vernaculars, Norwich, the urban centre of East Anglia has remained fairly unexplored. Consequently, the current dissertation will conduct a corpus study of sixteenth and seventeenth-century letter-type texts on how linguistic features in Norwich changed during the rise of supralocal varieties focusing on the third-person singular present tense indicative specifically. This specific marker is chosen due to it being one of the most notable linguistic features of the Norwich dialect and consisted of three possible markings during the Middle English period: -th, -s and zero. The findings show that the presence of the zero form, along with the earlier adopted -th suffix, accounted for slower adoption of the standardised -s in the Norwich dialect. Eventually, the -s variant is taken up in the Norwich variety, but the zero form remains in use among lower-class citizens, which is still the case in modern Norwich dialect.","['Standardisation', 'Supralocalisation', ""Language change 'from below'"", 'Third-person singular present tense indicative', 'East Anglia', 'Norwich', 'Linguistic features', 'Social markers']"

‘I am the love that dare not speak its name’: The Queer Gothic of The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Van der Stoep, Mireille","['Newton, Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"‘Gothic has, in a sense, always been ‘queer’’, or so Hughes and Smith argue in their introduction to Queering the Gothic. Other critics have suggested that Gothic is queer in the sense that it has always occupied the liminal spaces and transgressed boundaries in order to interrogate what is “normal” in society . In the Victorian age the sexual aspect of the queer becomes of pivotal importance. When the Labouchere Amendment was passed in 1885, acts of homosexuality became officially criminalised. Research shows how the Gothic then evolved even more strongly into a space for expressing ‘sexual defiance’. Late Victorian authors found ‘a safe location’ in the Gothic genre to ‘explore the landscape of sexual taboos’. The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and The Picture of Dorian Gray are both narratives of the late Victorian period and have been widely researched for expressing homosexuality in their narratives. This thesis examines the two novels explicitly for the similar Gothic tropes they use in order to express their queer narrative. This thesis is a close reading of the two novels, comparing and contrastingthese texts by showing how they employ similar Gothic tropes the two novels use to express their homosexual narrative, namely: contemporary anxiety around degeneration, a repressed hidden identity, and the strategical use of elision and “silence”. Through this I will investigate how The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and The Picture of Dorian Gray mirror one another’s queer narratives and how they use the Gothic to criticise and accuse Late Victorian society and law enforcement for marginalising homosexual men and thus creating the internalised double homosexual ‘monster’.","['Queer', 'Gothic', 'Jekyll and Hyde', 'Dorian Gray', 'Degeneration', 'Silent homosexuality', 'Victorian Gothic', 'Oscar Wilde', 'Robert Louis Stevenson', 'fin de siecle']"
Italian merchants in Tabriz under the Ilkhanid rule: trade and partnership,"Liberati, Riccardo","['Hoppenbrouwers, Peter']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The subject of this work is the development of relations between Italian merchants and the Ilkhanate of Persia during the course of the last decades of the thirteenth and the first half of the fourteenth century. Italian presence in the Ilkhanate is discussed in a multitude of works, but often marginalised as an appendix of Italian Levantine trade relations. The aim of this work is to deal with it as an autonomous and independent subject, trying to demonstrate that the nature of Italian presence in Persia was quite different from that of Latin trade relations with Levantine and North African territories. I will conduct an analysis of Italian commercial penetration in Persia providing a quantitative analysis of trade and focusing on the city of Tabriz and its connections. I will also try to demonstrate how Italians expanded their trade networks into Persia because they played an important role in the supply of certain services and commodities both to western and Mongol aristocracies. Lastly, by analysing the institution of ortagh (partnership), I will try to demonstrate how Italian presence in the Ilkhanate was similarly tied to a specific conduct of life and political project, and how the sudden disappearance of the latter caused the slow decline of Latin trade with Persia.","['Trade', 'Middle Ages', 'Italian City States', 'Ilkhanid Persia', 'Mongols']"
Iconicity in Expressing Emotion in Sign Languages,"Bijkerk, M.M.","['Nyst, V.A.S.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis presents a cross-linguistic analysis of expressing emotions in sign languages. Four claims about iconicity in sign languages are tested, which were merely based on American Sign Language. These claims are tested cross-linguistically for four different sign languages, namely the unrelated sign languages of Guinea-Bissau (LGG), the Netherlands (NGT), Mexico (LSMY) and Hong Kong (HKSL). The data indicates that the torso is preferred as the articulation place for expressing emotion in NGT and HKSL, which also predominantly express the basic emotions at the torso. Most of the signs of LGG are expressed at the head (also the basic emotions) and surprisingly LSMY only expresses emotion at the head. For the second parameter, motion, the data supports the claim that a movement towards the interlocutor indicates the communication of the speaker’s emotional state towards the interlocutor. The third parameter handshape indicates different levels of positivity or negativity in expressing emotion. However, the dictionaries of the four sign languages differ in quality and quantity and more research and data is needed.","['Iconicity', 'Sign Languages', 'Emotion', 'Linguistic typology']"

This thesis, however, is a research from a linguistic perspective. Linguistic features of Rotinese parallelism are described on multiple levels. The structure of the parallels is described by means of analysis of the parallels, and statistical data gained from it. The grammatical, semantic and lexical parallelism is described by means of analysis of the relation between the words in a word pair, or the lines in a parallel. Most features of Rotinese parallelism agree with the parallelism in other Central-Eastern Indonesian languages. In contrary to these languages, Rotinese parallelism shows no strict order in lexical parallel pairs. Some parallel pairs do show a strict order, they seem to be pairs denoting strong cultural constructs. In conclusion, this thesis has been the first linguistic exploration of Rotinese parallelism. First steps are taken into understanding its extensive use and richness of features.","['Parallelism', 'lexical parallelism', 'Rotinese', 'Austronesian languages', 'Linguistics']"

Toch is dit niet het beeld dat fans van haar hebben. Legende, Afro-Amerikaans, godin, de ultieme vrouw, moeder des moeders. Dat is de boodschap die ze uitdraagt. Dit alles doet ze heel nauwkeurig. De kleding die Beyoncé draagt, het beeldmateriaal dat in de videoclips voorbij komt, gesproken teksten en de teksten van haar muziek; alles draagt daar aan bij. Soms zijn het kleine details, maar vaak laat de christelijke zangeres heel duidelijk de religieuze beeldtaal zien. Het meest duidelijke voorbeelden hiervan zijn de foto’s die Knowles-Carter op haar Instagram plaatste om aan te kondigen dat ze zwanger was en dat haar tweeling geboren was. Geknield en gesluierd zit de moeder voor een cartouche met bloemen. Later staat ze met de twee baby’s in haar armen. Een beeld dat vrijwel iedereen herkent als een mariaportret. In dit artikel wordt er onderzoek gedaan naar de tegenstrijdigheid van de uitspraak en de referenties naar religieuze kunst. Dit zal worden gedaan aan de hand van beeldanalyses van de Instagramfoto’s en schilderijenbit de vijftiende, zestiende en zeventiende eeuw. Na deze beeldanalyses zal er een verklaring worden gegeven voor de beeldtaal die wordt gebruikt in Beyoncé’s werk aan de hand van het werk van Judith Butler.

In dominant anthropocentric discourses subjectivity (the active, desire driven perception and experience of reality) and individuality of non-human animals often get erased. However, this doesn't seem to be the case in 'De geluiden van de eerste dag'. In this thesis, I aim to formulate an answer to the question: 'Does the novel 'De geluiden van de eerste dag', by Anton Koolhaas, represent and thematize an anti-anthropocentric human-animal-relationship?' This study shows that the novel attributes agency and subjectivity to non-human animals, while (to a certain extent) respecting their species-specific susceptibilities, modes of communication and behavior. Overall the novel takes an ethical stance against mechanical animal exploitation and promotes an empathic relationship to other animals. I draw specific attention to the way aggression is connected to agency, the constitution of the subject and to the creative act of taking up space (Umwelt). I also emphasize how language and anthropomorphism (in and via literature) contribute to the constitution of subjectivity, agency and individuality of non-human and human animals.","['human-animal studies', 'subjectivity', 'agency', 'aggression', 'language', 'anthropocentrism', 'anthropomorphism', 'representation of non-human animals in Dutch literature', 'empathy', 'affect', 'Anton Koolhaas', 'Umwelt']"

The Influence of Crime TV-shows on Contemporary Art - A Study on the Reflection of the New Understanding of Death in Contemporary Art,"Bosveld, Demi","['Bertens, Laura']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The natural process of death is feared by plenty of people, but death is also popularized. The topic of death has a prominent place in popular culture. Crime TV-shows have been extensively covering this topic for quite some time. The way that crime shows address death is different from humanity’s fundamental understanding of death: to treat the dead with respect and value the persons they once were. In essence, crime TV-shows have created a different understanding of death. Because of its popularity, it can be questioned whether crime TV-shows affect other cultural forms. Art, just as crime shows, has an extensive history within the theme of death. Since death is a recurring topic in both art and crime TV-shows, it is of significance to research if and how these two cultural forms are connected. Consequently, this paper researches to what extent the new understanding of death, created by crime TV-shows, is reflected in contemporary art. Three case studies of contemporary artworks are discussed to illustrate to what extent the new understanding of death is reflected in art. These include The Class (2005) by Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, Cleaning (2009) by Teresa Margolles, and 48 Star Flag (1990-2005) by Andrew Krasnow. The topic of death in these artworks is very literal since human remains are used in the creation of the artwork. Each of the three artworks sheds a light on a different aspect of the dead human body, namely corpses, blood, and skin. The paper discusses to what extent the artworks relate to crime TV-shows, which provides a deeper understanding of how the artworks reflect the new understanding of death.","['crime TV-shows', 'contemporary art', 'human remains', 'understanding of death']"
the autonomous individual vs. the relational self: A reconceptualization of the Kantian rational person through a Confucian lens,"Margau, Corina Madalina","['Berger, Douglas L.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Confucian claim that we are not born as persons but that we must become persons highlights the importance of individual human experiences in relation to a larger global and collective network. The way we perceive and act as persons in a society is shaped by the relationships we develop with others. This implies that the individual can never abstract himself entirely from his socio-historical context. However, the dominant interpretation of personhood seems to draw heavily on Kantian ideas, which are supposed to be in opposition with the Confucian social self. Namely, the Kantian ideal model is a free, autonomous and rational individual for whom self-legislation is the essential human achievement. In my thesis, I attempt to offer a comprehensive analysis and reconceptualization of personhood by borrowing from the Confucian notion of a relational person. Firstly, I will highlight the dominant Kantian conception of what it means to be an individual person within society. In doing so, I will depict certain characteristics of the rational individual and how they are reproduced in the process of grounding universal moral laws. Secondly, I will demonstrate that this view of personhood is to some extent problematic because it advocates an disembodied moral agent by undermining the importance of empirical and socio-historical influences. Thus, I will attempt to reconnect the individual within the social realm through the Confucian perspective on personhood. Namely, the concept of person implies the self in relation to others rather than a radical separation between them. The exemplary person (junzi) cultivates his heart-mind (xin) by developing filial piety (xiao) and benevolence (ren) which are expressed through the practice of rituals(li). These interrelated concepts depict a relational person who occupies certain roles in society based on the multiplicity and diversity of his relationships with other human beings. Finally, the important question is: To what extent is the Confucian relational self relevant in reconceptualizing the Kantian notion of personhood? I will argue that it is necessary to offer an all-encompassing view on personhood by opening up a dialogue between these two traditions. In order to do so, I will reject the presupposed fundamental dichotomy between the Kantian Western perspective and Confucianism. Comparing and connecting their main concepts allows me to expand the meaning of personhood and illustrate its complexities without completely refuting the Kantian individual or adapting the Confucian model in its totality. On one hand, Kant invites us to critically challenge past traditions and social norms by cultivating our abilities to think and reason for ourselves, while this capacity might be limited in Confucian thought. On the other hand, from the Confucian person we can learn how to understand ourselves and our connections with others in a growing social network","['Personhood', 'individual', 'social', 'relationships', 'autonomy', 'Confucianism', 'Enlightenment']"

In this dissertation, two predominate forces are identified as refashioning heritages of the Pilgrims by selectively recording history to meet present-day concerns: independent nonconformist churches, in particular Congregationalists, and modern nation-states. With anxieties of losing tradition, these actors in conjunction have utilised historical narratives of the religious émigrés to reinforce and redefine social identities - creating an overly-simplistic and easy to follow religious past. Through this claims-making, the sense that the Pilgrims were insular and removed during their stay in Leiden has emerged. By pinpointing how these discourses came to be formed in the 19th and 20th centuries, and where from, this work attempts to cast the Pilgrims in a more interconnected light. Returning to the well-known writings of key individuals, as well as archival materials, a reinterpreted open dialogue between the Pilgrims’ leadership and other religious communities in the city will be identified.","['Pilgrims', 'secularism', 'heritage discourse', 'ecumenicism', 'English Reformed Church', 'Dutch Reformed Church']"

(A)Political Involvement of the World Bank in Post-Conflict Countries,"Delannoy, Océane","['Rodriguez Idarraga, Nicolas']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2008, the World Bank developed the State and Peacebuilding Fund (SPF) to deal with post-conflict countries. The financial institution has been involved in post-conflict reconstruction since the late nineties. However, its adoption of the political concepts of state and peacebuilding seems to represent a shift towards a comprehensive position of the World Bank regarding post-conflict situations (World Bank, 1998, p. 4). The emphasis is put on the political aspects of state and peacebuilding as they imply the building of ‘institutional capacity and legitimacy’ and the management of ‘the internal and external stresses that increase vulnerability to conflict’ in ‘fragile and conflict-prone and -affected situations’ (World Bank, 2019a). At the same time, the World Bank has reminded the importance of not interfering in politics and the necessity to stick to its role of economic actor as stated in its Articles of Agreement. The organisation appears torn between a supposedly comprehensive approach concerning state and peacebuilding and its economic mandate. The evolution of the paradoxical discourse of the World Bank on post-conflict reconstruction is therefore considered in this thesis by examining the power-knowledge and the associate regime of truth at stake in the production of its discourse. The method selected is a critical discourse analysis and the SPF is the case-study for this research. This thesis allows to unpack the problematic handling of state and peacebuilding by the World Bank.","['World Bank', 'neoliberalism', 'discourse', 'peace and state building']"

Da Niederländisch und Deutsch ähnliche Sprachen sind, neigen Lerner oft dazu, Wörter oder Sätze wortwörtlich zu übersetzen, wie eine Art ‚Falsche Freunden‘. Es ist darum wichtig, dass Lerner wissen, dass es Unterschiede gibt, und welche, sodass inkorrekte Konstruktionen, oder Konstruktionen, die im Deutschen nur sehr wenig verwendet werden, vermieden werden können. In Meiner Arbeit wird darum die Frage beantwortet, inwiefern es SchülerInnen im Deutschunterricht hier in den Niederlanden klar wird, dass es Unterschiede zwischen dem Gebrauch von lokativen Positionsverben im Deutschen und Niederländischen gibt. Um diese Frage, beantworten zu können, werde ich eine Fragebogen erstellen, um untersuchen zu können, ob die SchülerInnen Sätze mit lokativen Positionsverben richtig übersetzen können, auch werde ich den Dozenten fragen, ob sie über lokativen Positionsverben und ihre Unterschiede in Übersetzung unterrichtet haben . Ich werde die SchülerInnen fragen, einige niederländische Sätze mit lokativen Positionsverben auf Deutsch zu übersetzen, und stelle dabei auch die Frage, in welche Klasse sie sind und welche Methode sie benutzen.","['Positionsverben', 'Unterricht', 'Kollokationen']"

The problem of possible Arab influences on Copernicus’ planetary models in the light of debates on the degree of contingency of science,"Westbroek, Gery van","['McAllister, James']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Over the last few decades, Western scholars discovered similarities between the planetary models of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 - 1543) and the works of medieval Arab predecessors. These similarities raised questions and started a debate whether Copernicus elaborated his models fully independently or borrowed some of his ideas from Arab predecessors. What is notable in this debate is that the participating historians of sciences have not all come to the same conclusion, although they had the same historical facts at their disposal. Apparently, next to the historical facts, some further assumptions or commitments of those historians also influenced their conclusions. In search of possible candidates for such further assumptions or commitments, an issue in philosophy of sciences came to the fore: the contingency/inevitability (C/I) issue. This issue is about the question whether the development of science follows a predetermined (inevitable) narrow path with limited possibilities or an undetermined (contingent) broad path with a multitude of possibilities. This thesis shows the influence of assumptions and commitments concerning the C/I issue on the interpretation of the history of planetary astronomy. None of the participants in the Copernicus debate referred to the C/I issue, although their positions on the C/I issue strongly affected their views in the Copernicus debate. In this way, this example substantiates the claim of this thesis: in some instances, an interpretation of the history of science is strongly influenced by assumptions and commitments of the historians involved, as well as by the historical facts.","['History and Philosophy of the Sciences', 'contingency/inevitability (C/I) issue', 'Nicolaus Copernicus', 'planetary astronomy', 'Arab astronomy', 'Marāgha School', 'Copernicus debate']"

Trapped Women in Shirley Jackson’s The Lottery and “Other” Stories,"De Jager, Annika","['Van Leeuwen, E.J.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis combines a feminist and historical framework to analyze in detail the stories in The Lottery and Other Stories, in order to showcase how Jackson depicts married and unmarried women as repressed and judged by mainstream American society in the immediate post-war era. Specifically, it employs Simone de Beauvoir’s notion of the woman being labelled as the inferior “Other” by virtue of the dominant gender ideology of the 1940s, which is described in detail in her work The Second Sex. According to De Beauvoir, the dominant gender ideology of the 1940s confined and repressed women to the home, leaving them with no other choice than to fulfill the role of the housewife (De Beauvoir). This feminist framework is combined with an in-depth exploration by other feminists, such as Betty Friedan, Eleanor Roosevelt and Clara Fraser, as well as scholars that have researched feminist history, such as Gerda Lerner, Estelle Freedman, Stephen Dillon and Zillah Eisenstein. In combining these views on women and their position in society during the period in which The Lottery and Other Stories was composed, this thesis provides new insight into Jackson’s response to the treatment of women during her day and will shed a light on how her views paralleled the views of feminists such as Friedan, Roosevelt and Fraser, and historians such as Lerner and Eisenstein. This thesis shows that Shirley Jackson is not merely a Gothic fantasist writer but, above all, a social realist because of the way in which she depicts the women in her stories as victims of a patriarchal society. Moreover, her early short stories show in their representation of women marked parallels to actual real-life victimization of women in the 1940s, as depicted in the writings of feminists such as Simone De Beauvoir.","['shirley jackson', 'the lottery', 'feminism', 'feminist writers', 'simone de beauvoir', 'the second sex', 'eleanor roosevelt', 'betty friedan', 'post-war united states', 'patriarchy']"

A Weak Thing: Iqbal Masih and the History of Child Labour in Pakistan,"Bukhari, Muhammad","['Stolte, Carolien']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The story of Iqbal Masih is intricately linked to the history of child labour and enslavement in Pakistan. Any history of the exploitation of children for labour in Pakistan is incomplete without studying the short life of Iqbal Masih, a person who has become the face of political activism against the practice of child labour in the country. Iqbal Masih was born into a Christian family in 1983 in Muridke, a city close to Lahore. Given the poverty of his family, he was put to work at the age of four to pay off mounting debts. He was sold to a local carpet weaver in return for $12 where he worked every day from dawn to dark in the hopes of paying off the debt. Like other children there, he was tied to a carpet loom with chains to prevent his escape. At the age of ten, he managed to escape the factory where he was held. With the help of the Bonded Labour Liberation Front (BLLF), a local NGO working to free children from bonded labour, who took him in and sheltered him, he enrolled in school to pursue his studies despite the physical and mental breakdown he had suffered during the years of abuse. Whilst studying, he helped in the release of about 3,000 other children from bonded labour, and travelled the world raising awareness about the problem. He hoped to become a human rights lawyer in order to better be able to fight bonded labour in Pakistan. But his life was tragically cut short on Easter day, 16 April 1995 by a gunman whilst he was visiting relatives in Muridke. His legacy remains and he has been a source of inspiration for many fighting against child and bonded labour in Pakistan and the rest of the developing world. During the 1990s there was a worldwide movement for the eradication of the worst forms of child labour with countries moving from complete denial of the problem and abject lethargy in trying to curb it towards legislation and positive action.","['Iqbal Masih', 'child labour', 'slavery', 'Pakistan', 'peshgi', 'bondage', 'forced labour', 'BLLF']"

Towards Environmental Virtue Ethics,"Valente, Bianca Carmela","['Kalf, Wouter F.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"It is undeniable that the current ecological crisis could significantly deepen global political and social inequalities, bringing tangible effects on the size of the world population, food abundance, and the occurrence of extreme natural events. To avoid such catastrophic scenarios, our singular individual actions (such as our consumption choices) are seen as too negligible and inconsequential to address the problem at a global level. In this way, the moral gap between our scattered actions and the resulting environmental harm they produce remains intact. Deontological and consequentialist approaches, although dominant throughout the history of western moral philosophy, are not sufficient to tackle the significance of the environmental crisis, especially in its collective-action problems form. In my thesis, I am going to argue for the viability of a third approach to environmental ethical questions, i.e. virtue ethics. In particular, I will explore how a virtue-ethical approach relates to collective action environmental problems such as climate change.","['virtue ethics', 'environmental virtue ethics', 'climate change']"
Historical Reality Through Dystopian Lenses: Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,"Crosetti, Eugenia","['Kardux, Johanna']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis puts in dialogue two texts – Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale (1985) and Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861) – comparing them through the analytical perspective of dystopian literature. The thesis demonstrates that dystopian fiction extrapolates from history to build nightmarish societies, but also that certain historical experiences can be revitalized and actualized through a dystopian conceptualization. In fact, Atwood’s dystopian novel can be used as a “dystopian lens” to understand Jacobs’s testimony of women’s lives under chattel slavery as a “concrete dystopia”, that is a historical experience characterized by dystopian features. In order to do so, Atwood’s text is at first situated within existing scholarship and theory on dystopian literature and thoroughly analysed by highlighting how the text encourages reflection on women’s sexual and reproductive exploitation. Successively, I shift the focus to the context of American chattel slavery by reading Jacobs’s Incidents as dystopian in terms of setting and narrative devices and trajectories. By doing so, Jacobs’s testimony is liberated from its historical contingency and can be actualized. Atwood’s dystopian novel as analytical lens illuminates the ways in which coercive power, psycho-physical alienation, body commodification and systemic destruction of identity characterise women’s experience of slavery in Incidents. Moreover, it invites us to reflect on the ways sexual violence and appropriation of motherhood shape the slave woman’s construction of the subject as site of production and reproduction of oppression. However, the analytical comparison of the two texts sheds also light on the ways hope is performed by the narrative’s protagonists through storytelling. After being addressed by their testimonies, we, the witnessing readers, should be able to recognize the dystopian and utopian potential in our own reality as regards women’s sexual and reproductive self-determination and freedom, which seem to be continuously under threat.","['dystopian fiction', 'reproductive slavery', ""women's rights"", 'chattel slavery']"

BETWEEN THE THEORY AND THE PRACTICE OF HUMANITARIAN ACCOUNTABILITY,"Bernhoeft, Zita","[""O'Malley, Alanna""]",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis situates the concept of humanitarian accountability within “a historical and concrete reality” (Brauman and Neuman 2014, 1). A preliminary investigation of the academic literature establishes humanitarian accountability as a matter of moral as well as practical concern for humanitarian organisations. Despite this it is also found that the concept of humanitarian accountability has been poorly defined, and research as to its practice is severely lacking. Through the investigation of two distinct humanitarian organisations this research therefore explores the degree to which theoretical standards for humanitarian accountability translate into practice under the multiple constraints faced within the humanitarian sector. The evidence drawn from a qualitative examination of the practice of humanitarian accountability at the World Food Programme and at Médecins Sans Frontières is discussed in a comparative analysis, which reveals that lacunae in the understanding of basic concepts engenders deficiencies in the practice of humanitarian accountability at both organisations. This demonstrates the need for continued academic research in the field of humanitarian aid in order for organisations to pursue an informed course of action and maintain the ability to place the vulnerable individuals in need of assistance at the heart of their endeavours.","['Accountability', 'Humanitarian', 'Ethics']"

Grammaticaal populistisch? Onderzoek naar complementatie en de syntactische positie van het volk in relatie tot links- en rechts-populisme,"Tramper, Leander","['Jungslager, Francisca']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie gaat het over grammatica in een populistische communicatiestijl. In eerdere onderzoeken naar populistische communicatie zijn verschillende grammaticale elementen aangewezen waarbij een verschil in gebruik zichtbaar was tussen populistische en nietpopulistische politici. Deze onderzoeken concentreerden zich vooral op de rechterflank van het politieke spectrum. Het doel van het onderzoek in deze scriptie is om te verkennen of deze grammaticale kenmerken ook gelden voor links-populistische politici. Specifiek is onderzoek gedaan naar de syntactische positie van het volk en de aanwezigheid van complementatie. Deze kenmerken zijn geanalyseerd in bijdragen aan de Algemene Politieke Beschouwingen van 2018 en 2019. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd op speeches van de rechts-populistische Baudet en de als links-populistisch geoormerkte Marijnissen. Daarnaast werden deze politici vergeleken met de niet-populistische Asscher, die in dit onderzoek functioneert als neutrale ‘controle-groep’. Uit de analyse van de syntactische posities komt een patroon naar voren dat bij de drie politici hetzelfde van aard is. Elke politicus verwijst het meest naar het volk in de centrale subjectspositie. De analyse van complementatie laat echter wel een duidelijk contrast zien tussen de niet-populistische Asscher aan de ene kant en de populistische Baudet en Marijnissen aan de andere kant. De resultaten van beide onderzoeken vormen een indicatie voor een positief antwoord op de centrale vraag van het onderzoek, namelijk dat de rechtspopulistische Baudet en de links-populistische Marijnissen overeenkomen in het gebruik van de geselecteerde grammaticale elementen.","['Grammatica', 'Populisme', 'Complementatie', 'Syntactische positie']"

Fashioning Japanese masculinities: Broadening the realm of sartorial male gender performances,"Borgh, Roel van der","['Winkel, Margarita']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The years following the Meiji Restoration saw the rise of modernisation, the emergence of an imperial state, and the introduction and dissemination of Western dress. Both the rapid onset of the economic boom in post-war Japan and the burst of the bubble were instrumental in the reorganisation of society, but in different ways. The sudden economic power accelerated the growth of the consumer market and created fertile grounds for the expansion of media infrastructures. The hegemonic salaryman masculinity became a symbol for the country’s prosperity and is strongly linked to the construction of the Japanese male adult identity and the idea of men as the central pillar of the family. The economic bubble burst of the 1990s, this thesis argues, can be seen as the watershed moment that set the scene for a reconsideration of the hegemonic ideal and allowed other masculinities to rise up. Popular media, such as men’s fashion and lifestyle magazines, played into the decrease in popularity of the salaryman among women and were instrumental in conversing alternative gender ideologies. Younger generations of Japanese men have been socialised to view fashion as more of an integral part of their lives than older generations and are resisting the hegemonic gender narrative through the consumption and reproduction of alternative sartorial masculinities provided by the media.","[""Japanese men's fashion"", 'Gender performativity', 'Visual language of fashion', 'Masculinities', ""Men's fashion magazines""]"
The MPCC - A historical analysis of its creation,"Jong, Thijs de","['Shaev, Brian']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) which is the European Union’s military operational headquarter (OHQ). Authors of articles on the MPCC explain its creation by pointing at recent events and developments, such as the annexation of Crimea and the election of Trump. However, the creation of the MPCC is the culmination of decades worth of European defence cooperation. Its creation can therefore only be fully understood when taking the historical context in mind. This thesis therefore uses an historical approach to solve the gap in knowledge on the creation of the MPCC. It analyses the creation of six predecessors, all established European organisations that are similar to the MPCC as an OHQ, and compares them to each other. In this manner, this thesis argues that European defence cooperation since World War II is the result of the perceived interdependence between European states. Interdependence concerning national defence has led to the creation of the Western Union and the Western European Union. During the 90s, the perceived interdependence changed to focus on the ability for the states to play a significant and sovereign role on the world stage. This led to the creation of the EU Operations Centre, the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability and the option to use national OHQs and OHQs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Around 2016 the perceived interdependence shifted for a second time, now combining the focus on national defence with the focus on playing a significant and sovereign role on the world stage. This led to agreement among EU member states to develop the EU’s military capabilities. The Brexit referendum result provided the window of opportunity to start with these developments and thus to begin creating the MPCC, which was completed in 2017.","['Military Planning', 'Conduct Capability']"

Although it doesn’t seem like a very logical topic for a history thesis, it does show how this ‘Southern’ sport has connections to conservative values which are typical for the United States. This thesis aims to provide an answer to this question: To which extent has NASCAR changed its conservative views from the 1990s until the 2016 presidential election? This question gets answered through three chapters. The first chapter discusses the state of the academic field on American conservatism and sports history and how these have changed throughout the years. The second chapter delves into NASCAR and why it’s been referred to as a ‘Southern’ sport and how this connects to the conservative values. In the third and final chapter, topics related to conservatism, such as racism, patriotism and voting for Republicans, will be discussed with the use primary sources such as newspapers, news articles and opinion articles. This thesis will make clear that NASCAR, which once was definitely a very conservative sport, has transitioned majorly throughout the years.

Towards a practical phonology of Korean,"Oechies, Lorenzo","['Wiedenhof, Jeroen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Existing didactic and academic materials on Korean phonology often (partly) reason from written to spoken language or are difficult for second-language learners to understand. This thesis attempts to serve as a bridge between existing linguistic and didactic works by producing a linguistically responsible yet didactically adequate overview of Korean phonology, solely based on spoken language. I do this by taking the phoneme features described in Shin, Kiaer, and Cha's (2012) The sounds of Korean as a starting point. These features are tested in line with the methodology described in Ebeling’s (1960) Linguistic units by shifting the value of one feature at a time, and asking native speakers of Korean about the meanings of these realisations, if any. In order to make sure my work be accessible without the need for prior knowledge on linguistics, it selects only those linguistic terms that are necessary, all of which are explained. Next to exemplifying Ebeling’s methodology with an accessible exploration of contemporary Korean phonology, I have provided methodological considerations for didactic purposes. This work explores means of valorisation, making expert knowledge on the Korean language available for wider societal use. It ensures maximal applicability for a book that teaches second-language learners Korean pronunciation, and maximal adaptability to an introduction to Korean orthography.","['Korean', 'phonology', 'phonetics', 'second-language acquisition', 'didactics', 'valorisation']"

De tijdloze memoires van een slaapwandelaar: Het politieke effect van de toneelbewerking van Het Hout van Jeroen Brouwers door Toneelgroep Amsterdam,"Sobel, Feico","['Dijk, Yra van']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie staat de kwestie centraal of de bewerker(s) van een roman voor het theater erin slagen om de prangende (politiek-maatschappelijke) kwesties, die in romans gethematiseerd worden, overtuigend voor het voetlicht te brengen in een bewerking voor toneel? Blijft de complexiteit van de roman ook bewaard in die bewerking, of wordt de roman gereduceerd tot zijn actuele thema? Wat is, kortom,het politieke effect van de toneeladaptatie van romans in het Nederlands theater? Voor het beantwoorden van deze vraag wordt de roman Het Hout van Jeroen Brouwers vergeleken met de gelijknamige bewerking en theateropvoering ervan in de regie van Michiel van Erp geproduceerd door International Theatre Amsterdam/ Toneelgroep Amsterdam. Aan de hand van deze casestudy wordt blootgelegd welke ingrepen in de bewerking van Het hout gedaan zijn en wat de consequenties daarvan zijn voor de betekenis van het, op het toneel gebrachte, kunstwerk, vergeleken met de brontekst. De hypothese van deze scriptie is dat de politieke betekenis van de roman Het Hout in de toneeladaptatie gereduceerd is. De enscenering blijkt ongevoelig voor ambiguïteit en werkt eerder taboebehoudend dan taboedoorbrekend.","['adaptation', 'theatre', 'literature', 'Bakhtin', 'Babbage', 'Hutcheon', 'Brouwers', 'ITA']"

The Effects of Diversity on Local Social Cohesion: Experiences of change in the Schilderswijk of The Hague,"Van Zanten, Michelle","['Glynn, I.A.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Schilderswijk used to be a working-class neighbourhood, with predominantly white native Dutch residents, who have mostly left the area over the last three decades. This study seeks to answer this question: how did the established Schilderswijk residents experience such a dramatic change in the ethnic makeup of their neighbourhood, and what effect did this have on their perceptions of local social cohesion? These experiences of change are explored through interviews with white native residents of the area. The first chapter of the analyses will provide the historical context to the stories of these residents. The second chapter paints a picture of the manner in which the residents remember the past, and the third chapter shows how these residents experienced change. Telling the story of these residents is important because this gives more insight into why diversity might have a negative effect on the perception of social cohesion in an area. This will fill a hiatus in scientific debates on the subject, but can also give policy makers insight to mechanisms underlying the policy problem of social cohesion in a diverse neighbourhood. Additionally, telling the story of people that experience loss and change can have a social value. This research gives a voice to those that might not feel like they are being heard.","['social cohesion', 'social inequality', 'cities', 'volksbuurt', 'schilderswijk', 'migration', 'gezelligheid', 'social capital', 'social safety', 'identity']"

Computational Propaganda Threatening Democracy in the EU - A Mixed-method Analysis of european Right-wing News Outlets on Instagram in 2019,"Kaiser, Kevin","['David, Maxine']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"My analysis provides little support for the claim that Instagram’s algorithm is exploited in an attempt to increase the exposure to RNQs’ content/narratives or instill users with a fake sense of organic support, by employing bots to amplify their messages and enlarge their following. Although at first glance, it appears like bots make up a substantial amount of their followers, compared to other established media, their number is not significant, but rather a representation of the overall inauthentic bot population on the SMP. Among the inspected outlets, only the Italian outlet “ilGiornale” exhibited abnormal metrics throughout all steps of the analysis and is therefore considered to benefit from CP methods. Since this RNQ has not uploaded any content to Instagram since May 2019 and only has 16 posts in total, an increased exposure to their content is considered to be no threat to democratic deliberation. Rather, even without CP, it is an emerging right-wing media ecosystem that poses an increasing challenge to EU democracy. These findings, however, should be taken cautiously, as in the course of the empirical chapter, it becomes obvious that qualitative bot-detection models were designed for Twitter or Facebook and do not adequately take the platform-specifics of Instagram into account. Hence, the number of bots and subsequently the number of RNQ accounts that benefit from CP might actually be higher than this analysis suggests.","['computational propaganda', 'disinformation', 'populism', 'democracy', 'social media manipulation', 'bots', 'interference', 'EU']"
