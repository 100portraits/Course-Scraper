"The downside of raising awareness in sexism: The impact of confirmation of sexism on social exclusion, feelings, needs, motivation and expectations","Premcharan, Rowin","['Doolaard, F.', 'Noordewier, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While fewer people endorse blatant sexism, sexism is still an ongoing problem. Several measures have been taken to create awareness, but the question arises whether the confirming messages, for example, from the media or studies might give cues to women that they are being excluded. This research hypothesizes that if women pick up cues from confirming messages, it leads to more feelings of social exclusion compared to a context in which sexism is denied or is not mentioned. This research examines the effects of the confirmation of sexism on social exclusion, need-threats, feelings, motivation to apply, and expectations of their chances on the labor market. In this between-subjects study (confirmation of sexism vs. modern sexism vs. control condition), 157 female students from Leiden University completed a questionnaire. This study showed that women in the confirmation of sexism condition reported more feelings of social exclusion, more need-threats, more negative feelings, lower motivation to apply for a job, and lower expectations of their chances on the labor market compared to the other conditions. These results support the hypothesis that confirming sexism is more harmful than a context of modern sexism or not mentioning sexism, but more research is needed to provide general support for this hypothesis.",

De rol van de leerkracht-leerling relatie in de academische prestatie en intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen: Een onderzoek bij leerlingen in de bovenbouw van het basisonderwijs,"Wille, Shannon","['Broekhof, E.', 'Vogelaar, B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek benadrukt het belang van de intrinsieke motivatie en academische prestatie van leerlingen in de bovenbouw van het basisonderwijs. Het onderzoek tracht de gevolgen van de huidige veranderingen binnen het onderwijs, als gevolg van het leerkrachtentekort, in kaart te brengen. Het hoofddoel van de huidige studie is om in kaart te brengen hoe de leerkrachtleerling relatie, het geslacht van de leerkracht en de intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen gerelateerd zijn aan de academische prestaties van leerlingen. Een subdoel was om in kaart te brengen hoe de leerkracht-leerling relatie en de mate van ongerichtheid van de leerkracht gerelateerd is aan de intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen. Er namen 733 leerlingen van 9-12 jaar oud (M = 11,2; SD = ,65) en 67 leerkrachten deel aan de studie. Leerling hebben vragenlijsten ingevuld over hun intrinsieke motivatie en over de leerkracht-leerling relatie. De leerkrachten hebben een vragen beantwoord over de mate ongerichtheid binnen hun onderwijsstijl. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de leerkracht-leerling relatie, de intrinsieke motivatie van de leerling en het geslacht van de leerkracht niet gerelateerd zijn aan de academische prestatie. Wel is de leerkracht-leerling relatie gerelateerd aan de intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen. De mate van ongerichtheid is hier niet aan gerelateerd. Dit betekent dat er gepleit kan worden voor het investeren in betere leerkracht-leerling relaties omdat deze gerelateerd is aan de intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen.",
Hoe de mate van verwondering gestimuleerd kan worden door activiteiten van de leerkracht binnen het basisonderwijs. Een onderzoek naar het stimuleren van verwondering van kinderen binnen het traditionele onderwijs en daltononderwijs.,"Zweerus, Angenieta","['Broekhof, E.', 'Vogelaar, B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze studie richt zich op verschillen in traditioneel- en daltononderwijs en de mate waarin leerlingen zich verwonderen. Er wordt gekeken in welke mate leerkrachten de gelegenheid ervaren om verwondering te stimuleren en in hoeverre zij activiteiten ondernemen die verwondering stimuleren. Tot slot wordt onderzocht hoe de mate van verwondering van de leerling samenhangt met de gelegenheid die de leerkrachten ervaren om verwondering te stimuleren door activiteiten die zij ondernemen. De hypothesen zijn getoetst middels independent samples t-tests en een multipele regressieanalyse. Aan het huidige onderzoek namen 568 leerlingen deel van 9 – 12 jaar oud (M = 11.2; SD = .65) uit de bovenbouw van het primair onderwijs, samen met hun leerkracht (n = 91). 490 leerlingen volgen traditioneel onderwijs met een gemiddelde leeftijd van 11.14 jaar (SD = .63) en 78 leerlingen volgen daltononderwijs met een gemiddelde leeftijd van 11.39 jaar (SD = .68). Uit de resultaten blijkt dat er geen verschil bestaat in mate van verwondering tussen leerlingen in het traditionele- en daltononderwijs. In het daltononderwijs wordt meer gelegenheid ervaren door leerkrachten om verwondering te stimuleren, tevens worden er meer activiteiten ondernomen die verwondering stimuleren. Uiteindelijk is er geen relatie gevonden tussen de mate van verwondering en de gelegenheid voor de leerkracht om verwondering te stimuleren en om activiteiten te ondernemen die verwondering stimuleren. Er wordt bediscussieerd in hoeverre verwondering gestimuleerd kan worden of dat verwondering een vaste karaktereigenschap is.",

Absenteeism in Primary Schools in Northern Tanzania,"Harmsen, Jente","['Naafs, S.', 'Postma, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Achieving universal primary education is both promoted as a global development goal and as a priority for the Tanzanian government. To reach this goal, the government is committed to making primary education accessible for as many children as possible by making it both compulsory and free of charge. Nevertheless, there is still a problem with absenteeism in Tanzania. This ethnographic research explores the range of factors and reasons, besides tuition fees, that influence children's absenteeism through a case study of three primary schools in rural northern Tanzania. It analysesthe collaboration between these three schools and the Dutch-Tanzanian NGO Kamitei Foundation in addressing this issue. Based on interviews with teachers, parents, and pupils themselves, the main argument of this thesis is that the different roles that children have within rural households have consequences for their level of attendance. These household activities differ according to gender, and to the extent of how indispensable the children are within their household. Moreover, I found that differences in classroom pedagogy and in schools' policies of dealing with absenteeism also influenced the rate of absenteeism among pupils. Based on my findings, I argue that punishment or ignorance by the teachers as a response to not being present at school is one of the main factors that makes absence recurring, which makes it hard to reduce it. The Kamitei Foundation and the schools try to reach a consensus on this issue by working together to offer good quality education, even though it can be hard to reach the same level of understanding.","['(primary) education', 'absenteeism', 'NGO', 'development', 'Tanzania', 'punishment.']"
The Effect of Parents’ Verbal Threat Expressions on Child Fear Beliefs: The Role of Parental Social Anxiety,"Niessen, Florianne","['Aktar, E.', 'Overgaauw, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a form of anxiety distinguished by fear and avoidance of social situations. SAD can be transferred from parent to child. In addition to genetic inheritance of anxious traits, this transmission of anxiety can occur environmentally when parents verbally communicate threat or anxiety in social situations towards the child. Methods: This study tested whether parents’ verbal threat (versus safety) expressions give rise to more anxious fear beliefs in the child and explored whether this relation is moderated by parents’ trait social anxiety. Sixty-five children (mean age = 4,74, SD = 0,78) participated in this study with their parents. Both parents were asked to fill out the short version of the Social Phobia Avoidance Inventory (SPAI-short). In a lab parents were privately instructed to transfer information regarding two judges to their child. This information consisted of one judge being nice (safe judge) and one being unkind (threat judge). Thereafter, children were asked to sing a song in front of these judges. Afterwards child fear beliefs for each of the judges was measured via the Fear Beliefs Questionnaire (FBQ). Results: Significantly higher (anxious) fear beliefs for the threat judge were found compared to the safe judge, no moderating effects were found for parental social anxiety. Conclusion: Exposure to verbal expression of anxiety from the parent is related to children’s fear beliefs, however parents’ trait social anxiety has no moderating effect on that relationship. Replication of this study is desired with a between-subject design and diverse sampling.","['social anxiety', 'fear beliefs', 'verbal fear expression', 'stranger anxiety', 'threat information.']"

"Verwondering en intrinsieke motivatie in het openbare- en Daltononderwijs: Hoe leerkrachten, onderwijsvorm en intrinsieke motivatie samenhangen met het ervaren van verwondering","Rooks, Amarens","['Broekhof, E.', 'Vogelaar, B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Verwondering is van belang in het onderwijs omdat het leren stimuleert. In dit onderzoek is onderzocht of de mate waarin verwondering gestimuleerd wordt door de leerkracht gerelateerd is aan de mate van verwondering bij de leerlingen. Tevens is er onderzocht of het stimuleren van verwondering en de mogelijkheid tot het stimuleren van verwondering gerelateerd is aan het onderwijstype, openbaar of Dalton. Daarnaast is onderzocht of het onderwijstype gerelateerd is aan de mate van verwondering bij kinderen. Tot slot is of intrinsieke motivatie gerelateerd is aan het schooltype en of er een verband is tussen intrinsieke motivatie en verwondering. Aan dit onderzoek deden zeven openbare- en vijf Daltonscholen mee. Er hebben 181 kinderen (M = 11,20, SD = 0,69), en twintig leerkrachten deelgenomen. Om verwondering in kaart te brengen is kinderen gevraagd om te reageren op statements naar aanleiding van verhaaltjes en filmpjes. Intrinsieke motivatie wordt gemeten aan de hand van een korte zelf-rapportage vragenlijst. Leerkrachten hebben vragenlijsten ingevuld over verwondering stimulerende aspecten en de ruimte om verwondering te stimuleren. Uit de resultaten van deze studie blijkt dat de mate van verwondering stimuleren door leerkrachten niet gerelateerd is aan de mate van verwondering bij het kind. Leerkrachten op het Daltononderwijs besteden wel meer aandacht aan het stimuleren van verwondering en ervaren meer ruimte om stimulerend gedrag te vertonen dan leerkrachten in het openbare onderwijs. Er is geen verschil in de mate van verwondering en intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen van openbare- en Daltononderwijs. De mate van intrinsieke motivatie is positief gerelateerd aan de mate van verwondering. Daltononderwijs lijkt leerkrachten meer ruimte te bieden om stimulerende aspecten te verwerken in het lesprogramma, toekomstig onderzoek zal moeten uitwijzen wat voor positieve effecten dit meebrengt.",
"Is een verminderd mentaal welzijn gerelateerd aan minder verwondering en nieuwsgierigheid in kinderen? De relatie tussen mentaal welzijn, verwondering en nieuwsgierigheid in kinderen","Bekkum, Sanne van","['Broekhof, E.', 'Vogelaar, B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Nieuwsgierigheid en verwondering worden gezien als belangrijke aspecten in de ontwikkeling van het kind. Vanwege gelimiteerd onderzoek naar nieuwsgierigheid en verwondering in relatie tot mentaal en spiritueel welzijn, wordt er in deze studie onderzocht in hoeverre nieuwsgierigheid en verwondering een rol spelen in het mentaal en spiritueel welzijn van kinderen, en in hoeverre het ervaren van negatieve emoties samengaat met de mate van verwondering. In dit onderzoek participeerden 733 kinderen tussen de negen en twaalf jaar met een gemiddelde leeftijd van elf. Deze kinderen kwamen van 43 verschillende scholen. De kinderen hebben een aantal zelfrapportages ingevuld en vragen beantwoord over verhaaltjes en filmpjes die ze hebben gezien en gelezen. Daarnaast hebben 536 ouders een oudervragenlijst afgenomen. Uit de resultaten bleek dat kinderen meer verwondering rapporteerden bij negatieve verhaaltjes en filmpjes dan bij positieve verhaaltjes en filmpjes. Daarnaast bleek er maar een kleine, positieve overlap te zijn tussen nieuwsgierigheid en verwondering. Als laatst bleek dat een hogere mate van verwondering gerelateerd was aan een lagere mate van mentaal welzijn en een hogere mate van spiritueel welzijn. Terwijl nieuwsgierigheid niet gerelateerd bleek te zijn aan mentaal welzijn en spiritueel welzijn. Het was verrassend dat met name verwondering gerelateerd was aan negatieve emoties en een verminderd mentaal welzijn. In de discussie worden de consequenties en de bevindingen besproken. Ook worden ideeën voor vervolgonderzoeken besproken.",
Verwondering en moraliteit: De link tussen verwondering en het vertonen van moreel gedrag bij kinderen in de bovenbouw van het primair onderwijs,"Woggelum, Joëlle van","['Broekhof, E.', 'Vogelaar, B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Er bestaat theoretisch onderzoek naar het definiëren en het belang van verwondering, maar er is nog geen empirisch onderzoek naar verwondering. De theoretische literatuur stelt dat verwondering van belang is voor moreel gedrag. Het huidige onderzoek had als doel om deze relatie tussen verwondering en moreel gedrag in kaart te brengen en daarbij sekseverschillen in acht te nemen. In totaal namen er 733 kinderen van 10-12 jaar oud (M = 11.19, SD = .65) uit de bovenbouw van het primair onderwijs deel, waarvan 406 meisjes en 327 jongens. De kinderen vulden zelf-rapportage vragenlijsten in om verwondering en empathie in kaart te brengen. De vragenlijsten hebben betrekking op vijf verwonderingthema’s waar kinderen zich over kunnen verwonderen: kunst, technologie, kwaadaardig gedrag, natuur en speciale prestaties. Daarnaast vulden de ouders van de kinderen vragenlijsten in over hun kind die altruïsme (N = 536) en integriteit (N = 533) meten. Er komt naar voren dat verwondering gerelateerd is aan het vertonen van meer moreel gedrag. Vooral empathie zorgt voor meer verwondering. Meisjes verwonderen zich meer dan jongens. Daarnaast vertonen meisjes meer empathie en altruïsme. Meisjes vertonen daarentegen niet meer integriteit dan jongens. Wanneer een kind zich verwondert over kwaadaardig gedrag en/of kunst, wordt er meer moreel gedrag vertoond dan wanneer het kind zich verwondert over een ander verwonderingsthema. Meer verwondering gaat dus samen met meer inlevingsvermogen, meer perspectiefname en meer welwillendheid. Dit verband is voor het eerst onderzocht dus meer onderzoek kan worden verricht. Men moet zich altijd blijven verwonderen.","['verwondering', 'moreel gedrag', 'empathie', 'altruïsme', 'integriteit']"

Effect of Maternal Prenatal Cortisol on Maternal Prenatal Anxiety and Infant Temperament,"Hintzen, Louisa","['Tollenaar, M.S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"BACKGROUND: Previous research found that anxious characteristic traits might have its origin in the prenatal phase due to the infant's exposure to maternal stress hormones. Maternal prenatal stress symptoms as well as high cortisol levels have been found to predict negative affectivity in infant temperament. The current paper examined whether maternal prenatal cortisol decline during the day in late pregnancy mediates the relationship between maternal prenatal anxiety and negative affectivity in infant temperament at age 1. METHOD: This longitudinal correlational study included 114 mother-child pairs. Anxiety was assessed once in the last trimester of pregnancy and three months after giving birth. Salivary samples were taken five times a day for two days in the third trimester to determine cortisol concentrations. Infant temperament was assessed by a questionnaire answered by the mothers at infant's age 1. Maternal postnatal anxiety, birth weight and infant's gender were examined as possible covariates. RESULTS: Results revealed that there is a significant correlation between maternal prenatal anxiety and negative affectivity in infants (p < .05). No mediation effect of cortisol decline on the relationship between high scores in maternal prenatal anxiety and higher negative affectivity in infants was found. DISCUSSION: It was not clear whether adverse behavioural developments were dependent on maternal prenatal patterns and thus, whether infants could be prone to anxiety issues in later life. The study provided a framework for future studies to assess pathology's aetiology in a transgenerational way. Alternative explanations, limitations and future directions were discussed.","['maternal prenatal anxiety', 'maternal prenatal cortisol', 'infant temperament', 'negative affectivity']"
The Role of Self-Regulatory Skills in the Relation Between Household Chaos and Harsh Caregiving Behaviours,"Vermeulen, Samantha","['Alink, L.R.A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Developmental Psychopathology in Education and Child Studies (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"The use of harsh caregiving behaviour is related to a range of negative outcomes on the development of children. Therefore, it is important to get a more thorough understanding of the determinants of such caregiving behaviours. Researchers have consistently found an association between high levels of environmental chaos in the household and negative parenting behaviours. However, this relation has never been investigated in an experimental setting before so no causal inferences could be made. Therefore, the present study used an experimental within-subjects design to investigate whether (observed) harsh caregiving behaviour is predicted by an (experimentally manipulated) chaotic home environment. In addition, self-regulatory skills, measured with a delay discounting task and a Go/Nogo task, were examined as a potential moderator in this relation. A total of 96 women aged between 18 and 25 years participated in the two lab-visits. The laboratory (furnished like a living room) was calm and organized in the neutral condition, and chaotic and unorganized in the chaos condition. Contrary to what was hypothesized, results of the multilevel analysis showed no causal relation between chaos and harsh caregiving in the present study. Also, no moderating effect of self-regulatory skills on the relation between environmental chaos and harsh caregiving behaviours was found. Possible explanations for not finding the expected results and directions for future research are addressed in the discussion.","['harsh caregiving behaviour', 'self-regulatory skills', 'experiment', 'chaos']"

Social Psychology in p values,"Karppinen, Vilma","[""Veer, A. van 't"", 'Rooij, M. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Objective: In this study I investigated the p-curves of 250 social psychology papers to see if they showed evidence of p-hacking. I also divided the papers into categories based on types of justifications for exclusions (strongly justified, grey area, poorly justified) to describe how pcurves of these categories differ from each other. Methods: From a larger sample of 1000 random social psychology papers, 250 were randomly selected and coded by a larger group of coders. The papers were coded for main finding, main result, statistics sentence and the number and justification of exclusions. The statistics sentences were then pasted into a software that graphed the p-curves and analysed them for skewness and the presence of evidential value. Results: Two studies were mistakenly added in the data file but were kept for further steps. About 118 studies were excluded for missing or inadequate statistics sentences and 16 reported non-significant results. A total of 15 papers were left un-coded. The data analyses were done with the 104 remaining papers. The p-curve for the total sample was right-skewed and had adequate evidential value. The p-curve for the grey area justifications for exclusions was almost identical to the p-curve of the total sample. The p-curve of strongly justified exclusions followed similar pattern but also had a small peak around p = .05. The p-curve for poorly justified exclusions had two large peaks at .01 and .04. Conclusion: The sample of social psychology papers shows no evidence of p-hacking and has adequate evidential value. There seems to be some differences in the p-curves for different categories of justifications for exclusions. However, difficulties in coding the papers show that there is a need for more meta research into the standardization of reporting findings and exclusions in social psychology papers.","['P-hacking', 'P-curve', 'p values', 'social psychology papers', 'justifications for exclusions.']"
Het brengen van individuele offers om gezamenlijk een collectieve ramp af te wenden.

Tegen de verwachting in lijkt men bij een zekere publieke vraag geen eerlijkheidsregels toe te passen. Prosocialen bleken coöperatiever dan prozelven als er geen publieke vraag was en ze waren even coöperatief als prozelven als er een zekere publieke vraag was. In tegenstelling tot de hypothese waren prosocialen niet coöperatiever dan prozelven bij een onzekere publieke vraag.

Sociale dilemma’s hebben als kenmerk dat het individuele belang in conflict raakt met het collectief belang. Dit artikel introduceert de term Publieke Vraag. Deze term geeft de vraag naar persoonlijke offers om een graduele overgang van negatieve naar positieve gevolgen te behalen weer. De publieke vraag en omgevingsonzekerheid die aanwezig zijn bij collectieve rampen worden onderzocht aan de hand van de eveneens in dit onderzoek geïntroduceerde public account games. Hierin worden de coöperatie beslissingen geanalyseerd die mogelijk gemaakt worden tijdens een collectieve ramp. Daarnaast kijkt dit artikel naar de verwachting van andermans bijdrage en het gebruik van focal points voor coördinatie. De publieke vraag en onzekerheid lijken geen impact te hebben op de coöperatiebeslissingen en verwachting van andermans bijdrage.

"Kan de mens een collectieve ramp afwenden? De invloed van een publieke vraag naar persoonlijke offers bij de dreiging van een collectieve ramp, op de coöperatiebeslissingen van individuen met verschillende sociale waardeoriëntaties","Oudendijk, Fanny","['Molenmaker, W.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Vele sociale dilemma’s worden gekenmerkt door een vraag naar persoonlijke offers. In dit onderzoek wordt onderzocht of deze publieke vraag naar persoonlijke offers invloed heeft op de coöperatiebeslissingen van mensen met verschillende sociale waardeoriëntaties. Voor dit onderzoek hebben 85 participanten meegedaan aan 3 verschillende Public Goods Games zonder, met zekere en met onzekere publieke vraag. Daarnaast hebben de participanten een vragenlijst ingevuld om te testen wat hun sociale waardeoriëntatie is. Er werd verwacht dat de coöperatiebeslissingen van participanten afhankelijk zouden zijn van hun sociale waardeoriëntatie bij de afwezigheid van een publieke vraag, terwijl dit niet het bij een zekere publieke vraag niet het geval zou zijn (hypothese 1). Het verwachte interactie-effect werd inderdaad aangetroffen in de resultaten. Daarnaast werd er verwacht dat de coöperatiebeslissingen van participanten bij een onzekere publieke vraag weer afhankelijk zouden zijn van de sociale waardeoriëntatie (hypothese 2). Uit de resultaten blijkt dat er geen significant verschil is tussen de situatie met zekere en onzekere publieke vraag. Dit betekent dat het toevoegen van onzekerheid in het huidige onderzoek geen effect heeft gehad op de hoogte van de contributies. De wijze waarop de vraag naar persoonlijke offers in dit onderzoek is geoperationaliseerd geeft mogelijkheid tot nieuwe inzichten vergeleken met de bekende Public Goods Games.",

Narcissism and Social Media: A Study on the Relation of Grandiose and Vulnerable Narcissism with Facebook and LinkedIn,"Aikaterini-Taxiarchoula, Kavakou","['Edelaar-Peeters, Y.', 'Blom, J.D.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The trait of narcissism had consistently been linked with social platforms’ perceived ubiquity and raising popularity. Narcissism is divided into the grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. Accumulating research has investigated the association between grandiose narcissism with social media usage while vulnerable narcissism remains relatively understudied. Facebook and LinkedIn are two of the most widespread social platforms. Individuals engage into these platforms to create and maintain a personal and professional network and to promote their personal and professional achievements. The present study sought to investigate the association among grandiose and vulnerable narcissism with the emotional connection and social integration into Facebook and LinkedIn. A total sample of 117 Dutch-speaking participants (69.2% females, 30.7% males) with a mean age of 27.21 (SD=13.08) years were assessed online with the Grandiose Narcissistic Scale, the Hypersensitive Narcissistic Scale and the Social Media Use Integration Scale. Multiple regressions revealed that both narcissistic constructs significantly predict the emotional connection on Facebook, F (1, 108) =15.40, p<.001 and LinkedIn, F (1, 70) =10.86, p=.002. Higher grandiose scores were significantly associated with social integration into Facebook, F (1, 108) =9.89, p=.002, while vulnerable narcissism was a non-significant predictor. Social integration into LinkedIn was not significantly associated with narcissistic traits. The current findings suggest that both types of narcissists might feel emotionally connected to Facebook and LinkedIn to gain admiration and attention. Although only individuals with higher grandiose traits integrated Facebook into their social routines. Social integration into LinkedIn might be driven mainly by career purposes and not narcissistic motives.","['Grandiose Narcissism', 'Vulnerable Narcissism', 'Facebook', 'LinkedIn', 'Emotional Connection', 'Social Integration']"
De effectiviteit van interventies op voeding en gedrag ter bevordering van een gezond voedingspatroon en een gezond gewicht van het jonge kind.,"Broekhuizen, Marenthe","['Oudega, M.', 'Veek, S. van der']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Overweight in young Dutch children is a persistent problem. It is important to reduce overweight in children because it is related to diseases later in life. In addition, overweight in childhood appears to be related to overweight in adulthood making prevention at an early age important. To decrease the risk of developing overweight, it is important to promote vegetable intake and the self-regulation of energy-intake in toddlers. There are several factors during childhood that play a protective role and reduce the risk of developing overweight and an unhealthy diet consisting of little vegetable intake. This study investigates whether an intervention focusing on repeated exposure to a variation of vegetables (vegetable intervention) and an intervention focusing on sensitive and responsive feeding (VIPP-FI), individually and combined, may act as protective factors for developing a too high Body Mass Index (BMI) and low vegetable intake when children are 18 and 24 months old. A total of 243 first-time mothers and their babies (128 girls, 115 boys) successfully started the intervention-phase. Mean age of the children at the start of the intervention-phase was 4.68 months (sd = .42), mean age of the mothers was 30.4 years (sd = 4.7) and 41.6% only completed a lower education. Infants body weight and height is measured and converted to an SDS-BMI score and the vegetable intake is measured by their mothers and researchers. In the current study, no effect of the vegetable intervention, VIPP-FI and combination intervention on vegetable intake and/or SDS-BMI at 18 and 24 months was found. In conclusion the interventions aimed at the repeated offering of vegetables and sensitive and responsive feeding prove unsuccessful in promoting vegetable intake and a healthy weight. This may be the result of the diet still developing and the unstable SDS-BMI at a young age.",

It is important to address this issue, because mood is an essential factor regarding someone’s quality of life. However, it is not clear how this works for children. Another issue that comes forward is that it is unclear how gender moderates this relationship. We investigated the moderating effect of gender on the relationship between sleep quality and mood in 82 normally developing children (Age M= 7.44; SD=.61; age range 7-9; 43% boys). Sleep quality was defined as sleep efficiency and was measured with actigraph watches the children wore at night. Parents filled in diary questions about their children’s affective mood states: valence, energetic arousal and calmness. We looked at the influence of one night of sleep on mood the next day. We did not find a relationship between sleep efficiency and mood. This shows that mood in normal developing children is not affected by sleep efficiency. We also researched if gender moderates the relationship between sleep efficiency and mood. The effect of sleep efficiency and mood was the same for boys and girls. This finding strengthens the idea that gender differences only become apparent after the onset of puberty. Therefore it does not matter if you are a boy or a girl: one bad night of sleep will not affect your mood the next day.","['mood', 'sleep quality', 'gender differences']"

The study also examines the influence of the uncertainty of public demand and the social value orientation of an individual on these cooperative decisions. The public demand in the current study simulates the threat of a potential collective disaster. In this study, a Public Goods Game and two variants of this game are used, the certain and uncertain Public Account Games. It was expected that there would be more cooperation in a situation with public demand and certain public demand, compared to no and uncertain public demand. Contrary to the expectations, the results indicated that adding public demand, both certain and uncertain, to the games does not affect cooperative decisions much. Also, in the certain public demand condition, tacit coordination through fairness rules was expected. However, the results show that there is no link between public demand as a focal point and the use of fairness rules. This finding implies that in situations with a public demand, the social value orientation of an individual is not relied upon, nor are cooperative decisions coordinated by applying fairness rules. In situations without public demand, the social value orientation of an individual turns out to be leading. The discussion outlines the implications for these findings and provides suggestions for future research.","['public demand', 'cooperation', 'tacit coordination', 'social dilemma', 'social value orientation', 'fairness rules']"

In this study it will be investigated if the public demand can drive people to coordinate their cooperation decisions and how this will be influenced by the environment uncertainty and social value orientation. This will be tested in one experiment with three different conditions: a public goods game without a public demand, a public account game with a certain public demand and a public account game with an uncertain public demand. In those three conditions the participants have to decide how much they will contribute to the collective account. Although we expected the public demand to be a coordination point for cooperation decisions, where people would use a rule of equity, this is not in line with what was found in the results. In situations with a public demand people do not act in line with their social value orientation, but which principle participants did use to coordinate the cooperation decisions hasn’t been found in this study. Environmental uncertainty also seems to be irrelevant in the process of making cooperation decisions, which was against our expectations as well. The social value orientation does seem to have an influence. Pro-socials cooperate more than pro-selfs do, especially in situations with a certain public demand. In situations with an uncertain public demand the gap in cooperation between pro-socials and pro-selfs narrowed.","['public goods game', 'public account game', 'public demand', 'cooperation decisions', 'social value orientation', 'environmental uncertainty']"

Insomnia symptoms have been established as a risk factor for suicidal ideation and feelings of thwarted belongingness have been proposed to explain the link between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation, with thwarted belongingness mediating the relationship, in a sample of Dutch university students. The study assessed participants crosssectionally (n = 218) and after six months (n = 83). Participants completed the Insomnia Severity Index, Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Logistic regression and mediation analyses were conducted. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were controlled for. Crosssectionally, insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. When adjusting for symptoms of depression and anxiety, the association became nonsignificant and only symptoms of depression emerged as an independent predictor. Thwarted belongingness mediated the relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation cross-sectionally. When depressive symptoms were controlled for, the mediation model became nonsignificant. Longitudinally, results suggested no predictive effect of insomnia symptoms on suicidal ideation and no mediation effect of thwarted belongingness on the relationship. The results did not support insomnia symptoms as an independent risk factor for suicidal ideation in university students, which underscores the need for more rigorous research to clarify this relationship for the future.","['Suicidal Ideation', 'Insomnia', 'Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide', 'Thwarted Belongingness', 'University Students']"

The concept ‘new speaker’ is being used in European minority language communities to study the linguistic niches that these migrants are creating through the use of these languages they learn, questioning traditional concepts such as “native speaker” and “non-native speaker”. In this thesis I explore the challenges that New Speakers of Papiamentu experience learning this creole language on the island of Bonaire (Caribbean Netherlands), and the strategies they develop to make pragmatic use of this cultural capital they acquire. This thesis proposes a methodology that draws from Linguistic Ethnography and Visual Anthropology that results in a multimodal thesis which comprises an ethnographic documentary and this article. The documentary portrays how several individuals from different nationalities who are learning Papiamentu navigate Bonaire’s multilingual environment using this language. The results of this research suggest that new Papiamentu speakers are actors of social change in Bonaire, as they are creating and expanding a ‘contact zone’ between Papiamentu first language speakers and new Papiamentu speakers, stimulating new forms of identification, belonging and intercultural communication in the context of a creole language community","['Visual-Linguistic Ethnography', 'multimodality', 'New speakers', 'Papiamentu', 'contact zone']"

The aim of this research is to fill the gap in the literature about potential interference of cognitive biases in social anxiety with a probabilistic learning paradigm in a social evaluative environment. The current study sampled participants along the social anxiety spectrum and used the SELF-Profile paradigm to make participants believe that they were evaluated on characteristics about themselves that they endorsed at an earlier point. Data of 19 healthy female undergraduates across the social anxiety spectrum was used (Mage (in years) = 19.90, SE = 1.57). Before every trial of the experiment participants needed to indicate their expectation of being accepted by one of four participant-chosen peers based on a personal statement. Participants received immediate acceptance or rejection feedback from the peer which, unknowing to the participant, had a predetermined probability of giving acceptance feedback on 15%, 30%, 70% or 85% of the trials. Scoring lower on the self-report social anxiety measure (LSAS) was significantly associated with more positive predictions for the positive peer but not significantly correlated with negative predictions for the negative peer. Neither reaction times with the respective peers (positive or negative) nor the overall pre-task expectation of receiving acceptance feedback were significantly associated with the self-reported social anxiety score in our sample. Furthermore, we could not identify a significant effect of self-reported social anxiety scores on the amount of recalled acceptance feedback from the negative and positive peer, respectively. Future studies should investigate gender-effects and include psychophysiological measurements to circumvent social desirability and other self-report biases.","['probabilistic learning', 'reaction time', 'SELF-Profile', 'social anxiety (disorder)', 'social feedback learning']"

To develop a healthy eating behavior and, in the long term, a healthy weight, children depend on the parents feeding style. Therefore, the current study investigated whether the Video-Feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting – Feeding Infants (VIPP-FI) is an effective intervention to reduce pressuring during mealtimes and to stimulate healthy weight of children. Furthermore, it is examined whether there is a (mediated) relation between pressuring, the satiety responsiveness, and the child’s weight. Method: 109 mother-child pairs were included, 54 (49.5%) mother-child pairs participated in the VIPP-FI group, and 55 (50.5%) mother-child pairs participated in the control group. Pressuring to eat was measured with the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire (IFSQ), the satiety responsiveness with the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ-T), and the weight-for-length SDS with TNO’s growth calculator. All three were measured before the intervention (4-6 months) and after the intervention (18 months). Results: Before and after the intervention, the results showed that there was no difference in pressuring, both for mothers who participated in the VIPP-FI group and for mothers who participated in the control group. Moreover, for both groups, there was no difference in the weight of children over time. Finally, no direct and mediated relation has been found between pressuring and the weight of children. However, a negative relation has been found between the satiety responsiveness and the weight of children. Conclusion: Contrary to the expectations, no effect of the VIPP-FI on the weight of children has been found. Future studies should include a more objective method to measure several components of the feeding style to obtain the entire effectiveness of the VIPP-FI. Secondly, the use of multiple measurement moments (up to 36 months) is important, so this way it can be investigated whether the relations are predictive.","['VIPP-FI', 'pressuring', 'satiety responsiveness', 'weight-for-length SDS']"

Meeting invitations were enhanced with behavioral insights from the Self-determination theory and nudging research. A between-subjects field experiment with 139 participants was conducted at LEF Future Center from Rijkswaterstaat. It was expected that an enhanced invitation (experimental condition) would lead to a lower no-show rate and higher intrinsic motivation to participate during a one-day LEF session as compared to a standard invitation (control condition). At the start of the session, participants filled in a shortened version of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) which measured motivation, tension, autonomy, competence and relatedness. The results showed that the enhanced invitation led to higher overall motivation and a higher feeling of relatedness as measured with the IMI. No significant results were found for the no-show rate and the subscales intrinsic motivation, tension, autonomy and competence. Future research could investigate the working principles behind the invitation in more detail. The current research showed that it is important to give enough attention to the invitation in the preparation of a meeting because it can increase motivation.","['intrinsic motivation', 'Self-determination theory', 'invitation', 'meeting attendance']"

"‘Tell me how to use it!’: The relation between cultural style and waste management: An ethnographic research in Tongo, Upper-East Region, Ghana","Vries, Robin de","['Jansen, J.', 'Luning, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Ghana experiences difficulties with the current accumulation and circulation of waste. The most prevalent forms of waste are considered to be e-waste and solid household waste, specifically plastic. Closing the Loop (CtL) is a Dutch non profit oriented company which collects mobile phones in Ghana to subsequently be shipped to Antwerp for efficient recycling of precious metals. Globally, the resources of the precious metals are in a state of decline. CtL current operations in Ghana are proving to be ineffective; because of this they want to attain more knowledge through ethnographic research in order to improve their strategy of collecting old mobile phones. With this research I hope to expand their knowledge. In this research, the concepts of sustainable waste management and cultural style will be discussed. By doing this I will aim at explaining the relationship between cultural styles and waste management practices. The concept of collective action will also be taken into account. Relating this to cultural style I hope to offer CtL insight in how they might inspire collective action with their strategy by focussing on improving asset-ownership. I will compare a formal waste management system with an informal waste management system on the local-level, with a focus on plastic waste. I will argue that rural and cosmopolitan cultural styles play an important part in how waste management is practiced (Ferguson, 1999). With this I will show that not considering the performative competence and enactment of cultural stylistic expression can result in waste management policies not being adopted. The data that is gathered with this research is based on a multi-sited ethnography in the village of Tongo and the provincial capital Bolgatanga, in the Upper-East region of Ghana. Main interest for conducting research were the operations of the formal waste management system of Zoomlion and the difference in stylistic expression between management and workers; and, the informal waste management system of The Saanema Movement and how they try to inspire community wide engagement.","['waste management', 'cultural style', 'collective action', 'asset-ownership']"

Exploring the Association Between Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and Cognitive Functioning: A Network Analysis,"Günak, Mia Maria","['Fried, E.', 'Putman, P.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with impairments across cognitive abilities. While some prior work suggests that the PTSD symptom domain of intrusion may be most strongly related to cognitive impairment, little is known about the relation of cognitive functioning with individual PTSD symptoms or other symptom domains, and the temporal stability of such relations. The current study addresses these questions. Methods: Data were analysed from 1,484 trauma-exposed U.S. military veterans (Mdn=65 years) who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS). We estimated four regularised partial correlation networks of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms at baseline (past month or lifetime) and cognitive functioning at baseline and three-year follow-up, respectively. Network comparison tests examined temporal stability, and sensitivity analyses the robustness of the associations. Results: Across network models, difficulty concentrating and trouble experiencing positive feelings consistently showed unique negative relations to cognitive functioning. Contrary to expectations, the symptom domains of alterations in arousal and reactivity, as well as cognition and mood were more strongly linked to cognitive functioning than the other two domains. Network structures and overall strength did not significantly differ between cross-sectional and longitudinal networks. Conclusion: Overall, we highlight the importance of links between PTSD symptoms and symptom domains on the one hand, and cognitive functioning on the other—relations obfuscated by modelling only PTSD diagnosis or sum score. Given that longitudinal processes between the two constructs appear to be present, we recommend monitoring of cognitive functioning and integrating it into clinical care of PTSD.","['post-traumatic stress disorder', 'cognitive functioning', 'network analysis']"

Especially now we can see that in postmodern times, where identities have become increasingly fluid and fractured, populations are looking for a place where they can find community and belonging. And it seems that in a post-Apartheid Cape Town where segregation was such a big part of life, being able to have a space to come together away from the structure of racial categorisation is important. Cape Town has a large following of the psytrance outdoor festival scene, however, not much has been written about the psychedelic trance scene in Cape Town. This study examines the psytrance scene in Cape Town, South Africa. Two months of research attending and observing at psytrance outdoor festivals in the Cape Town area, using audio visual recordings, and semi-structured interviews. The thesis comprises of a text and ethnographic film. The text touches upon the outdoor psytrance festival culture in Cape Town, looking at the need that people have to attend these multiple day outdoor festivals. Escape, reconnecting with nature and the active meditation that comes with dancing to repetitive and psychedelic music. My key research finding is that the outdoor psytrance festivals give Capetonians a space where they can escape their daily lives, work through problems that they might have, and create a sense of community and identity.","['Escape', 'Cape Town', 'communitas', 'Khoisan', 'liminality', 'psytrance']"

Binnen het veld van de geestelijke gezondheidszorg is er weinig sociaal onderzoek. Omdat het veelal gestructureerd wordt door kwantitatieve onderzoeken, is er de roep, vanuit zowel de geestelijke gezondheidszorg als de academische wereld, naar meer kwalitatief onderzoek. Dit onderzoek is een etnografie bestaande uit een geschreven scriptie en een etnografische film. Dit kwalitatieve onderzoek geeft een stem aan degene waarvoor de geestelijke gezondheidszorg bedoeld is en onderzoekt de sociale processen van groepstherapie. Het onderzoek gaat in op het groepsdynamische proces binnen een werktherapie in groepsvorm. Het Landschap Onderhoud Project is een project dat arbeidsmatige training geeft voor klinisch herstel van mensen die kampen met psychische problematiek. Methodologisch is de kern van het onderzoek het gebruik van visuele methoden. Door verschillende gesprekken, interviews, observaties en participaties vormde ik mij een beeld in een twee en halve maand durende onderzoeksperiode. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat samenwerken, samen leren, vriendschappen en botsingen allen bijdragen aan het groepsdynamische proces binnen het LOP. Dit, in combinatie met externen factoren zoals opdrachtgevers, het weer en het soort werk dat gedaan wordt, maakt dat de groepsdynamiek fluctuerend is. De begeleiding van het LOP en het werken in de natuur zijn vitale componenten voor de positieve werking op de geestelijke gesteldheid.",

Exploring Attributional Style as a Potential Moderator of Social Feedback-Induced Changes in Self-Esteem based on Simulated Data.,"Pezeshgi, Niuscha","['Will, G.J.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Self-esteem rises and falls in response to approval and disapproval from other people. However, the extent to which self-esteem responds to social feedback may differ from person to person. This study investigated whether inter-individual differences in attributional style may explain the extent to which self-esteem is shaped by social feedback. Attributional style refers to the way that individuals assign causes to life events and is in this study measured by Externalizing and Personalizing biases. While holding an Externalizing Bias refers to a person reporting a strong self-serving bias, holding a Personalizing bias indicates that a person tends to use personal rather than situational external attributions for negative events. This was examined through combining two independent datasets (one containing data on self-esteem fluctuations in response to social feedback obtained using an experimental social evaluation paradigm, and one dataset containing self-reports of attributional style) by matching participants from 2 datasets based on trait self-esteem scores. Findings showed that Personalizing and Externalizing Biases correlate with trait self-esteem but do not correlate with state self-esteem. Furthermore, the results suggest that approval increases self-esteem whilst disapproval decreases it, however, such dynamics are not moderated by attributional style. This study sheds light on the importance of the distinction between state and trait self-esteem in order to investigate the effect of other factors on it. Furthermore, it reveals that attributional style affects trait self-esteem and in turn influences mental health.",

"Simulated Data suggests that Experienced Parenting Style impacts on Trait Self-Esteem in Young Adulthood, but not on Self-Esteem Fluctuations in Response to Social Evaluation","Limmer, Sophie","['Will, G.J.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"elf-esteem is shaped by social evaluations across childhood and adolescence. While intraindividual differences in experienced parenting style can cause variations is self-esteem level, it is unknown how authoritarian and authoritative parenting style impacts self-esteem instability later on. Therefore, this study examined associations between experienced parenting style, self-esteem level and instability in the face of social feedback in young adulthood. Seventy-eight college students (Mage = 22.42) reported how authoritative and authoritarian their parents were and stated their trait self-esteem. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible to collect self-esteem dynamics data. Therefore, the participants were linked to other seventy-eight participants based on their identical Rosenberg scores, who took part in a social evaluation task. Prior to this task participants had to create an online profile on which they would receive social feedback from unfamiliar peers. After every few feedback rounds, they reported on their self-esteem. Results demonstrated that self-esteem was negatively related to authoritarian and positively related to authoritative parenting (for mothers). Self-esteem was highest after approval feedback followed by no and disapproval feedback. This pattern was not modulated by experienced parenting style. Together these findings show that although parenting style modulates self-esteem level in young adulthood, it does not modulate the extent to which state self-esteem rises and falls in response to social feedback. A possible reason for this outcome might be that while the direct influence of parents deteriorates, the impact of peers increases in adulthood. Since peer support might buffer the impact of experienced parenting style on self-esteem instability, future research should look into this.",

Exploring Associations Between Childhood Emotional Maltreatment and Self-Esteem in Adulthood Using Simulated Data,"Andrae, Rosalie","['Will, G.J.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"ow self-esteem lies at the core of various psychiatric disorders. Emotional maltreatment during childhood is associated with low self-esteem and elevated sensitivity to social rejection later in life. However, it is unclear how childhood emotional maltreatment impacts on the extent to which moment-to-moment self-esteem is shaped by social evaluation. This study examined associations between retrospectively reported emotional maltreatment and self-esteem reactivity in response to social evaluation. Young adult participants (n = 78; 55 female) reported on childhood emotional abuse and neglect and current trait self-esteem. Since behavioural data collection was not possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I created a simulated dataset by matching participants’ self-report data to self-esteem responsivity data from other participants with identical trait self-esteem scores who performed a social evaluation task. Results showed that childhood abuse and neglect were negatively related to trait self-esteem. Task data revealed that approval increased self-esteem and disapproval decreased it. Simulated data showed no evidence of emotional abuse and neglect moderating self-esteem responsivity to social evaluation. These findings suggest that, while childhood maltreatment is linked to low trait self-esteem later in life, lower self-esteem is likely not caused by greater self-esteem reactivity to social evaluation. These findings highlight the need to research alternative pathways by which a history of emotional maltreatment may contribute to the maintenance of low self-esteem.","['social evaluation', 'social feedback', 'self-esteem', 'emotional maltreatment', 'emotional abuse', 'emotional neglect']"

These measures were focused on media-based campaigns, which included several social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and an educational website launched by the government: stop-dijhadisme.gouv.fr. This thesis focuses on one particular anti-jihadist media campaign called: #Toujourslechoix. The campaign was launched in November 2016 and although it is no longer being showcased across French educational institutions, till today the visual campaign is still used as a means to spread awareness and can easily be found on the government’s counter-radicalization website. Although the campaign received praise for reaching a large audience, the effectiveness of the campaign as an actual measure to combat radicalization remains contested. The debate surrounding counter-radicalization measures revolves around whether they are deemed effective, Islamophobic or simply ineffective, however scholars fail to address the reason as to why these measures, particularly these visual campaigns, are still being implemented. This thesis proposes to analyze the case study from the perspective of visual framing theory to answer the research question. This theory can successfully explain how social actors use visual frames to communicate certain messages. As such, this thesis argues that by using secondary frames the French government in fact always targets two audiences through two objectives: the first objective being that these visual campaigns should prevent a certain audience to radicalize and the second objective consists of the government also aiming to reassure the French population that the government is taking political action to combat Jihadism in France through these programs. The frames that the French government utilized serve the purpose of achieving these two aforementioned objectives. By using visual methods to analyze the two interactive governmental videos, this thesis will seek to reveal the first and second frames the government uses and will primarily highlight the secondary audience. This thesis concludes that although the primary target audience is the French Muslim community, visual indicators point towards the secondary audience being the non-Muslims of France, who have criticized the government for not implementing harsher counter-radicalization measures.","['counter-radicalization measures', 'French government', '#Toujourslechoix', 'anti-jihadist media campaign', 'visual framing', 'secondary audiences', 'secondary frame']"

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, behavioural data using a lab-based social evaluation paradigm could not be collected. Therefore, I used previously collected task data and linked these to newly collected data on inter-individual differences in need for approval to create a simulated data set for educational purposes. These two independent data sets were matched based on Rosenberg self-esteem according to known links between trait self-esteem and both self-esteem fluctuations and need for approval. Results showed that self-esteem increases in response to approving feedback and decreases in response to disapproving feedback. Furthermore, these fluctuations (in self-esteem) were amplified in participants reporting higher need for approval compared to those who report a lower need for approval. Acknowledging the importance of need for approval in people’s perception of others might be helpful in the clinical field when developing strategies that decrease the likelihood of negative mental health outcomes based on individual need for approval.",

However, its impact on offspring self-esteem reactivity following social evaluation remains unclear. This study examined how self-esteem fluctuations in response to social evaluation during young adulthood, may differ as a function of experienced parental divorce during childhood. Two independent sets of participants took part in the study, whose data were matched, based on Rosenberg Self-Esteem scores, in order to create a single simulated dataset (n = 78). One set of participants completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and answered questions regarding parental divorce, and the other set was confronted with approval or disapproval on a social evaluation task, after which they reported their state self-esteem. Results indicated that self-esteem rises and falls in response to approval and disapproval feedback, respectively. This pattern did not differ between individuals with vs. without the experience of parental divorce. A follow-up analysis testing for the developmental timing of parental divorce showed that young adults whose parents divorced during adolescence exhibited amplified selfesteem fluctuations in response to both approval and disapproval, compared to young adults whose parents divorced during childhood. These findings provide preliminary evidence that it is not parental divorce that affects self-esteem reactivity, but rather the developmental timing of the divorce, and encourages more aspects of the family dynamics to be investigated, particularly among various age groups.",

In the cross-sectional study, Polish mothers and their 4 months old infants (N-163) were tested in two different meetings. The mothers filled out EPDS, RLCQ, IBQ-R and a survey concerning their breastfeeding pattern. Furthermore, breast milk samples were collected to assess oxytocin, cortisol and energy levels in milk. The findings does not support the prediction that maternal stress influences infants’ temperamental traits. The results of the study indicated that oxytocin in mother’s milk was significantly associated with negative affectivity. However, no significant association was found between temperamental traits and cortisol. Moreover, nursing frequency was also significantly related to higher negative affectivity, however, the relationship is in the opposite direction of what is expected.","['infant temperament', 'breastfeeding', 'maternal stress', 'oxytocin', 'cortisol']"
Updating self-esteem: How inter-individual differences in trait self-esteem shape state self-esteem fluctuations in response to social feedback,"Sabino da Costa, Ines","['Will, G.J.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"How people generally evaluate their self-worth (i.e., their trait self-esteem) determines the extent to which they use social feedback to update their momentary self-esteem. However, it remains unclear if the lack of positive expectations, typical of those with low trait self-esteem, renders them more prone to momentary changes of self-esteem. This study investigated how inter-individual differences in trait self-esteem and expectedness of social feedback moderated the impact of social approval and disapproval (i.e., valence of feedback) on self-esteem updates. Participants (N = 78) performed a social evaluation task, where they repeatedly predicted whether they expected to be approved of or not, and subsequently reported on their level of selfesteem after receiving the social feedback. Results showed that self-esteem updated depending on the valence of feedback, but expectations were only relevant if the person was exposed to social disapproval. To be precise, in both high and low trait self-esteem participants, self-esteem decreased the most when they expected to receive approval but were given disapproval instead. Low trait self-esteem was associated with lower state self-esteem throughout the task, and compared to high, low self-esteem participants had a more unstable self-esteem when faced with repeated social evaluations. However, the extent to which state self-esteem increased following approval and decreased with disapproval was no different from people with high trait selfesteem. These findings suggest that despite their vulnerabilities to social feedback, low selfesteem individuals benefit from social approval and realistic expectations as much as people with higher trait self-esteem. Knowledge of these effects can aid in the creation of interventions to promote a healthy development of self-esteem.","['social evaluation', 'self-esteem', 'social feedback', 'social approval', 'sociometer']"

The current study aims to explore the neural underpinnings of this hypothesized effect by investigating the role of three brain networks using fMRI: the Default Mode Network (DMN; involved in self-referential thought and rumination), the Central Executive Network (CEN; involved in executive cognition and WM), and the Salience Network (SN; involved in detection of novel or relevant stimuli and subsequent prioritizing of functional neural networks). After rumination-induction in thirty-three healthy female participants, functional connectivity within the three networks was measured during a 2-back WM task, which alternated between active and resting blocks. As expected, the DMN showed increased connectivity during the resting blocks, the CEN showed increased connectivity during the active blocks, and the SN showed higher connectivity in the beginning of the active blocks than during the remaining time of the active blocks. As hypothesized, self-reported rumination was correlated with lower SN functional connectivity in the beginning of the active blocks and a slower disengagement of the DMN. CEN functional connectivity showed no significant association with rumination. These results might reflect rumination-related difficulties in re-directing cognitive resources from self-referential thoughts to external stimuli, which may arise due to the weak mapping of external stimuli. The current findings expand understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying the effects of rumination on executive function and indicate that future research should further explore the interactions between these three networks.",

Negative Affect are negative emotions such as sadness and fear. This study examined whether a higher NA as a baby has a negative effect on the early language development around 12-30 months. In addition, this study examined whether receptive and expressive language development have a different outcome on the possible effect of NA on the early language development. The sample is based on the data conducted in the longitudinal study ‘A good start’. Mothers reported twice on NA using The Infant Behaviour Questionnaire – Revised at 6 months (N=253) and 12 months (N=215). In addition, mothers reported on the early language development of their children using the Dutch version of Communicative Development Inventories at 12 months (N=215) and 30 months (N=195). Multiple regression analyses were used to analyse the data. No significant results were found. A higher NA doesn’t have a negative effect on the early language development and no differences between receptive and expressive language development were found. There are different explanations to why no results were found. This research looked at the early language development at 12 and 30 months, nevertheless, other factors of age could have played an important role. A second theory concludes that a possible relation between NA and early language development is influenced by parent-child interactions. A third theory looks into Positive Affect and different subscales of NA. Finally, it is discussed why no results were found for a difference between receptive and expressive language development.",

While the practise of nature based recreation has positive effects on the environmental attitudes of practitioners, the ecological irony of winter sports tourism is stretched. By employing the techniques of audiovisual research and infrastructural inversion as analytical strategies, the hidden workings of regional infrastructures are explored. By analysing infrastructural changes within and outside the skiing resort Kitzsteinhorn (AT) a correlation between infrastructural arrangements and environmental attitudes was examined. This is a multimodal thesis submitted in the course of the Master Specialisation in Visual Ethnography at the faculty of Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology of Leiden University. Its results are presented in the form of this written thesis and an ethnographic short-film Surfing Frozen Oceans (26 min.)","['nature', 'tourism', 'eco-politics', 'infrastructure', 'ontology', 'hybrid spaces']"
The acknowledgement of sexism: Feelings of exclusion a nd low motivation in women,"Vught, Lieke van","['Noordewier, M.', 'Doolaard, F.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In modern society, there is an increased attention for the acknowledgement of sexism. This comes almost as a counter movement against modern sexism, a form in which sexism is denied. The goal of this study was to investigate potential negative effects of exposure to acknowledgement of sexism, such as feelings of exclusion and low motivation to apply for a job. 161 female participants from a Dutch university, divided over three conditions, filled in a survey in order to measure exclusion and motivation to apply. The three conditions were the acknowledgement of sexism, modern sexism and a control condition. We found significant results for our hypotheses. The acknowledgement of sexism leads to feelings of exclusion, low need fulfilment, negative feelings, low expectancy to get a job and low motivation to apply for one. This shows that exposure to the acknowledgement sexism in, for example, the media can have negative effects. This thesis also provides several suggestions on how messages concerning the acknowledgment of sexism can be communicated, including future research suggestions.",

How the Belief that Anger Reinforces Ideology Affects One’s Motivation to Feel Angry,"Adiprasito, Ira","['Pliskin, R.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Humans sometimes pursue instrumental motives when regulating our emotions, meaning that we might prefer to experience an unpleasant emotion if we can expect later reinforcement. Furthermore, previous research drew a link between believing an emotion to be useful and engaging in behaviour that induces that emotion. Support for such a connection was specifically established for the emotions of fear and hope in political leftists and rightists. Between leftists and hope a positive relationship was found which was mediated by the belief of it being useful in reinforcing their ideology. Similar findings exist for rightists and fear. In the study at hand we attempted to extend this hypothesis to the emotion of anger fir both ideological polarities. We examined, among 235 British political leftists and rightists, whether the belief that anger reinforces one’s ideology increases the motivation to feel angry. By using fabricated articles stating that anger reinforces either the own or the other political affiliation, we aimed at inducing this belief. We tested whether those who read the article that associates anger with benefit for the own ideology, would later choose to read articles with anger inducing topics. However, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant interaction of the conditions and ideologies on their preference for anger inducing articles. Since we did not find support for our hypothesis, we conclude that there is no evidence for an association of assuming anger to be useful in reinforcing one’s beliefs and being motivated to read anger-inducing articles.",

Leftists and Rights ideologies have different attributions to emotions. Previous findings indicated that believing that an emotion reinforces one’s ideology motivates one to experience the emotion. Based on this assumption, a research was drawn to examine if the same results were replicable to the emotion anger: Does the belief that anger reinforces one’s ideology, reinforces one to feel angry? To closer examine this question, participants were given articles informing that anger reinforces their ideology. Subsequently, they were requested to rank eight different fictitious headlines according to their reading preference. These headlines were associated with either anger, hope, fear or neutral (two for each emotion), previously verified in a pre-test. The measure was done via a two-way analysis of variance (ANCOVA). The same analyzed whether the belief that anger reinforces one’s ideology had an increase in the participants motivation to experience anger. However, the results were not significant.

Using Emotions to Reinforce One’s Ideology: A Study on the Motivated Regulation of Anger,"Nußbaum, Sebastian Albert","['Pliskin, R.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Previous research has shown that people are motivated to up-regulate certain emotions if they believe that it reinforces their ideological convictions. More specifically, Pliskin and colleagues reported that leftists were more likely to experience hope, and rightists were more likely to experience fear if they believed that the respective emotions reinforce their ideology in regard to the acceptance or rejection of social change. The present research expands on these findings by investigating whether people would be motivated to up-regulate their level of anger if they believe it reinforces their ideology, and whether such motivational effort differs between ideological groups (left vs right). To this end, we sampled 206 British participants (114 female, 90 male, 2 other, Mage = 33.18, SD = 11.96) of which 115 (40 male, 73 female, 2 self-identified; Mage = 29.15, SD = 9.9) reported a leftist ideology and 91 (41 female, Mage = 38.29, SD = 12.43) a rightist ideology. Both groups were presented with one of three bogus scientific articles claiming that anger reinforces a leftist ideology, anger reinforces a rightist ideology or a neutral control article. Subsequently, the participants were asked to rank order eight headlines that hinted at emotion-inducing articles (anger, fear, hope, neutral). The results of the ANCOVA revealed a non-significant interaction effect, disconfirming our formulated hypothesis. Such null findings may support the context-dependence of anger and point at the necessity of adopting a multi-dimensional, context sensitive approach to the study of ideological differences in the motivated regulation of emotions.","['Emotion', 'Emotion Regulation', 'Emotional Goals', 'Anger', 'Hope', 'Fear', 'Ideology', 'Motivated Reasoning']"

"In Anger We Trust: Does the Belief that Anger Reinforces One’s Ideology, Motivate One to Experience Anger?","Nilsen, Jens","['Pliskin, R.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Researchers have tried to link the motivation to experience certain emotions to specific ideologies. Recently there has been more support for taking context into account when studying the influence of ideology on the motivation to experience an emotion. One of these contextual factors is the belief that an emotion can reinforce one’s ideology. Therefore, this study investigated whether the belief that anger reinforces one’s ideology motivates one to experience anger. Additionally, we tested whether leftists are more motivated to experience hope than rightists and whether rightists are more motivated to experience fear than leftists. The belief that anger reinforces one’s ideology was induced by reading a scientific article about anger and ideology. To test if participants were then more motivated to experience an emotion, participants created a ranking of their preference for reading anger, hope, fear and no emotion inducing articles. We found that reading an article that states that anger reinforces one’s ideology does not motivate one more to experience anger. There was also no evidence that leftists are more motivated to experience hope than rightists or that rightists are more motivated to experience fear than leftists. These results show the difficulty of convincing one that anger reinforces one’s ideology and that one can be hesitant to want to experience anger. The results that hope was not tied to leftists and fear not tied to rightists can be explained by the influence of a state of fear in the participants due to the use of Coronavirus-related stimuli. These findings indicate that future research should also take other contextual factors into account, like one’s current emotional state, when studying the influence of beliefs about emotions on motivated emotion regulation.","['motivated emotion regulation', 'anger', 'hope', 'fear', 'ideology', 'beliefs about anger']"
Interventions for parentally bereaved adolescents: What is their effectiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Trujillo Hoher, Lina","['Tona, K.', 'Ziomkiewicz, A.B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Any death can be devastating, but parental death is considered one of the most distressing events an adolescent can endure, potentially resulting in multiple emotional, behavioral, and functional impairments. Many interventions have been developed to support parentally bereaved youth, but their effectiveness remains in question. Additionally, reviews conducted so far have grouped children and adolescents in the same categories, even though these are two distinct developmental stages. The aim of this thesis was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate what interventions have been recently developed to support parentally bereaved adolescents and determine their effectiveness on grief-related outcomes. Having the current findings as an evidence base, a set of suggestions was provided to support adolescents facing parental death. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of nine electronic databases was conducted, and retrieved articles were selected by two independent raters according to predefined inclusion criteria. After full-text examination, ten studies were eligible for the systematic review and eight for the metaanalysis. A random-effects model was used to pool intervention effects, and separate analyses were conducted for each grief-related outcome. It was found that selected interventions had a moderate and significant effect of 0.50 on grief-related outcomes, and they substantially contributed to the reduction of traumatic symptoms (effect size of 0.85) and maladaptive grief (effect size of 0.62). Interventions based on support groups and exposure components seem to be the best approach when working with parentally bereaved adolescents. The current results highlight the need to implement screening procedures to detect patients who might gain the most benefit from treatment.",

Reinforcing Ideology: Can the Belief that Anger Reinforces One’s Ideology Motivate People to Feel Anger?,"Heinz, Elena","['Pliskin, R.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of this study was to find out whether the belief that anger reinforces your ideology can motivate you to feel anger. To investigate this, we conducted an online study where participants read an article on how anger can strengthen the ideological convictions of leftists or rightists and were then asked to rank eight headlines in the order that they would want to read the corresponding articles. Six of these headlines were designed to indicate that their corresponding articles would induce either anger, fear or hope, while two of them were neutral in content. The participants’ preference for the headlines was intended to measure their motivation to experience the emotion that the headline was correlated with. The main hypothesis was that participants reading about how anger reinforces their ideology would want to engage with anger-inducing content more than participants in the other conditions. Unfortunately, the results were non-significant and the hypothesis was rejected. The participants were not more motivated to choose anger-inducing headlines after reading about how anger reinforces their ideology. Descriptively, the fear-related headlines were the most preferred out of all headlines. This can be due to a multitude of factors, the most important being the coronavirus pandemic, which could have influenced the preference for fear.","['anger', 'emotion', 'motivation', 'reinforcement of ideology']"

Seeking anger to feel right (or left) Using Emotions to Reinforce One's Ideology,"Fierro Leon, Armando","['Pliskin, R.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recent research has shown that even in non-political contexts, leftists and rightists are motivated to experience hope and fear respectively, because of their belief that these emotions justify their ideological convictions. This raises the question of whether the desire to reinforce one’s ideology could also influence the motivation to experience other emotions. In order to fill this gap in the research literature, the present study investigates whether believing that anger reinforces rightist (or leftist) ideology, would motivate people holding on to this ideology to feel more anger in response to politically neutral major current events. To test this, we conducted an online study with 235 adult participants from the United Kingdom, presenting them with (fabricated) scientific information stating that anger can promote and justify the principles of rightist (or leftist) ideology. Next, we assessed if this manipulation influenced participants motivation to experience anger, by measuring the order in which participants prioritized reading anger inducing news, as opposed to hope and fear inducing news, during the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that manipulating the belief that anger reinforces one’s (or the opposite) ideology did not influence participants’ motivation to experience anger in this context. Also, contrary to the findings of previous research, leftists and rightists did not differ in their motivation to experience hope and fear. This thesis discusses the implications of these findings, and puts them into context with the world pandemic. Moreover, it proposes future directions for the study of ideological motivated emotion regulation.","['Ideology', 'Motivated Reasoning', 'Emotion Regulation', 'Anger', 'Hope', 'Fear']"
Living in between two cultures: The development of a sense of belonging to Dutch society among Japanese immigrants and the maintenance of Japanese identity,"Banno, Akane","['Longo, M.', 'Ragazzi, F.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on how Japanese immigrants living in the Netherlands develop a sense of belonging to Dutch society and maintain Japanese identity through interaction with Japanese communities. This study employs a mixed method of 19 online surveys and eight semi-structured interviews. By asking in the ordinary language, two categories of belonging in society are found. These are: human interaction to create emotional safety and having the right to participate in a social system. The survey result shows that 10 out of 19 respondents have a sense of belonging to Dutch society. Overall, these people tend to have lived in the Netherlands longer than those who do not, such as students. Many of these long stayers are in a relationship or married to a Dutch person and live in the Netherlands with work experience. During the stay in the Netherlands, Japanese immigrants go through identity transformation from the intensification of Japaneseness to identity shifting between Japanese and Dutch cultures. The main role of the Japanese community is to provide emotional and informational support that contributes to maintaining Japanese identity. The opportunity of bridging with locals by Japanese ethnic networks is limited.",
From Pakatan Harapan to Perikatan Nasional: Examining Populism in Malaysia,"Chang, Jack","['Longo, M.', 'Ragazzi, F.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In 2020 the monoethnic Perikatan Nasional coalition seized power from the multi-ethnic Pakatan Harapan coalition, resulting in a reversal of societal progress towards a more multicultural Malaysia. This development mimics the rise of populism within Europe, and thus warranted investigation to see if current understandings of European populism could explain this phenomenon in Malaysia. This study utilised discourse analysis to examine the coalition manifestos and member-party political rhetoric of the key Malaysian political coalitions from 2015 to 2020, establishing that Pakatan Harapan is the sole populist coalition consisting of non-populist parties. Pakatan Harapan was formed as a response to the widespread corruption of the previous ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, thus once they had gained power the divisions between its member-parties proved too great for the coalition to survive, resulting in the creation of Perikatan Nasional. This study refutes previous research that claimed populism was not feasible within Southeast Asia, providing evidence that such movements are not only possible but exist within the region.",

Nonetheless, it also showed the limitations of political socialization on a homeland tour. The agency of the participants and other, stronger forms of political socialization are preventing Birthright from establishing a strong connection and support for Israel. On top of that, the in-depth interviews shed light on the complex realm of identity formation, feelings of belonging and attachment, that has been absent from previous survey-based research on the influence of Birthright. It tried to fill the gap left in the literature that has primarily been focused on Jewish-American relations with Israel by examining young Dutch Jews. This research led to more questions and it presents that much more research on Jewish-Dutch relations with Israel is necessary.",

By using a conceptual approach and a qualitative case study of various texts, the study investigates the harm resulting from complex relations between different political actors in Yemen and aid/humanitarian organisations working to improve human lives. The study asks what is the harm posed by aid provision in Yemen? How does this harm manifest in Yemen and, what are the outcomes of this harm? In Yemen, the main harm of aid provision, amidst what I describe as the crisis of sovereignty, is the augmentation of the crisis of sovereignty due to the involvement of aid organisations. The study argues that harm, in the case of Yemen, is an unintended consequence of various institutional and organisational disparities while the outcomes affect the economic and humanitarian situation of the local population. This unintended harm of the augmented crisis of sovereignty in Yemen, I argue, stands in contrast with the morally perceived harm of injustice portrayed in the literature. The result of this study is the conceptual rendering of harm both as an inevitable consequence and non-moral harm.",

Why the Transnistrian authorities use multiple legitimisation strategies,"Renting, Casper","['Mos, M.', 'Verdun, A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to explain why the de facto authorities of the non-recognised state of Transnistria use multiple strategies in their desire to achieve internal and external legitimacy by engaging in nation-building and state-building. These strategies consist of one or more policies with a specific aim, and an argumentation of why the state, and by extension its regime, ought to be recognised. These arguments are remedial secession, historical statehood and earned sovereignty. Using Qualitative Content Analysis to analyse scholarly articles, government statements and local news outlets published between 1989 and 2019, I inductively build up a typology that distinguishes between four distinct strategies: strategies that aim to strengthen external legitimacy by appealing to the wishes of the international community, those that aim to strengthen internal legitimacy by appealing to the needs of the population, and those that aim to do both or neither. The typology also accounts for the prevalence of certain policies in one of the four distinguished periods of the de facto state’s existence. I provide three interconnecting explanations of why certain strategies prevail over others in different time periods. Firstly, strengthening internal and external legitimacy are different goals and therefore require a different strategy. Constrained by limited resources, the nation-builders have to prioritise these strategies. Secondly, ever-changing domestic and international geopolitical and socio-economic developments determine which policies and arguments will be effective. Lastly, strategies do not exist in isolation to each other, but are built upon by more refined arguments and renewed policies.",

For that purpose, in-depth conversational interviews were conducted with 22 first- and second-generation Turkish immigrants in the Netherlands. It contributes to the literature by revealing the process of formation through individual experiences of immigrants narrated by them. Thereby, rather than correlating their behaviours with assigned categories that often fall short of explaining the variation, we have access to the process first-hand. Since gender-attitudes are central to explain immigrant behaviour, understanding the formation is essential for both literature, and policymakers. The study demonstrates that traditional attitudes can be reformed through close contact with the Dutch whilst intergroup conflict hinders the formation. The recurred themes among the sample have been: i) Rapprochement with the Dutch, and ii) Divergence from Turkish community, as reinforcing egalitarianattitudes; i) Resentment and Segregation, and ii) Peer Pressure and Channeling, as causing maintenance of traditional-attitudes.",

Manifestos of the leading candidate parties published prior to the 2017 elections and media articles published in the aftermath of the attacks have been analyzed through the discourse analysis method. This study finds that the migration-terrorism nexus was accorded increased saliency by the far-right party. However, both leading candidates attempted to securitize the issues surrounding migration and presented the migration-terrorism nexus as a threat that merits urgent action. Finally, this study explains how the media conveyed the frames surrounding the migration-terrorism nexus to the public against the background of the existing security discourse. A study of this design has contributed towards a better understanding of the portrayal that informs France’s stance on issues such as terrorism and migration.",

Political Salience of European Identifications: A case study of the Dutch chapter of the pan-European movement Volt Europa,"Janssen, Katinka","['Tsagkroni, V.', 'Longo, M.B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The possibility of the emergence of a European demos sharing a ‘European identity’ is long debated in the social sciences. Now national identities have played a dominant role during recent European crises, the emergence of and the entrance of the pan-European political movement Volt Europa into the European Parliament seemed unexpected. This study aims to answer the question of what makes a European identity, as expressed by the pan-European movement Volt, salient today in a way that it was not before, through the lens of a case study of Volt Nederland. Based on 17 semi-structured in depth interviews and attending online Volt events, I argue that this European identity has become salient through ‘facilitative’ and ‘triggering’ factors. The two facilitative factors ‘increasing cross-border interactions’ and the ‘institutionalization of universal norms and values’ having set the conditions for the triggering factors ‘increasing salience of transnational challenges’; ‘shifting geopolitical dynamics’; and ‘increasing visibility of exclusive European and national identities through the migration crisis and Brexit’ to activate Volters to give shape to their strategically and unconsciously developed European identities. My findings add to political science literature exposing reasons for European identity salience, a topic that remains underexplored and continuously developing.",

Why NATO Persists: A Case Study of the Netherlands,"Steenkamer, Robertus","['R. Hagen, MA']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores collective action problems in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the post-Soviet era. Collective action theory does not have plain explanations for the fact that NATO is still operating. As long as member states invest in the alliance in terms of financial contributions and by participating in operations, NATO is likely to persist. By focusing on the case of the Netherlands, the study addresses a state’s incentives for contributing to NATO-led out-of-area operations. More specifically, this thesis has selected Kosovo Force, Resolute Support, and NATO Mission Iraq to analyze why the Netherlands has participated in NATO missions. Through a content analysis of letters in which the government justifies its decision for participating in these missions, the study can collect, categorize, and interpret the arguments of the Dutch government. Following the theories of institutionalism and constructivism, this research argues that the Netherlands has contributed to NATO-led out-of-area operations because it strived to sustain the institutional assets of NATO and to promote liberal-democratic values.","['Collective action', 'NATO', 'institutionalism', 'constructivism']"

"People's Climate Plan: show up, speak up, make climate action work for us: The influence of personal interests on a municipality’s decision to act collectively in order to take climate action: the case of the Finnish town of Ii","Jallah, Seh",['MA Rutger Hagen'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The United Nations in 2015 adopted the Paris agreement. This agreement called on actors (i.e. national governments, international organisations, regional organisations, businesses, and local governments or municipalities (cities, towns and villages)) to take collective action in the fight against climate change. However, collective action at the national, international, and regional levels has proven difficult. Because countries leaders cannot come to an agreement on how to go about solving the climate issue. In contrast, local governments or municipalities have proven to be valuable actor in the fight against climate change through collective action within their own territories and between municipalities. The Finnish town of Ii has proven to be very valuable in the fight against climate change. The town has reduced its CO2 emissions by 80%. Using the personal-interest theory and latent content analysis, I explored the personal interests factors that contributed to Ii’s decision to act collectively in order to take climate action. The findings showed that economic incentives, social incentives, and proenvironmental concerns were the driving personal interests that contributed to Ii collectively taking climate action.",
Incentivising states to share the burden: Why Western European states continue to participate in UN Peacekeeping Operations.,"McKnight, Callum",['R. Hagen MA'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Since the 1990’s, non-traditional middle powers participation in peacekeeping has increase; however, it is notable that whilst Western European states have withdrawn significantly, they continue to provide for this public good. This paper asks why these state continue to participate in peacekeeping by investigating the behaviour of two Western European states, France and Switzerland, participating in a United Nations Peacekeeping Operation (UNPKO) in Mali. It applies a most-different comparative study theoretical framework provided by Bellamy and Williams with 3 rationales of state behaviour and examines this behaviour through the lens of public goods theory. These hypotheses are based on political/economic and security rationales and are used to examine three concepts: firstly, whether Western European states’ ability to achieve foreign policy goals is affected by participating in UNPKOs; secondly, the role of economic incentives in attracting Western European states to UNPKOs and, thirdly, whether enhancing global and national security and regional stability are motivations for Western-European states. A content analysis of the government’s position was undertaken using legislative reports and minutes; commission reports; and reports from the ministries of foreign affairs, economic affairs and defence. This analysis shows that both hypotheses are correct, with the security rationale being the more dominant of the two hypotheses. By comparing the motivations of two Western European states of different political, economic and security standing this thesis aims to advance the literature beyond that of non-traditional cases by establishing causal-mechanisms that could be used in future comparisons.",
"‘If they will play fair, I will play fair’: A comparison of two phases of Mercosur-EU trade negotiations (2000-2004) and (2010-2019) through the lens of fairness and justice.","Hurst, Alice",['MA Rutger Hagen'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The study of the successful negotiation of Global Public Goods (GPGs) can enlighten scholars across political economy, political science, public administration as well as international relations. The 20 yearlong Mercosur-EU trade negotiations which culminated in an agreement between the South American and European trade blocs in 2019 provides an example of a successful GPG negotiation against the unique backdrop of an agreement between two transnational organisations. Whilst there is no set view on what the factor that makes GPG negotiations successful, a focus on the fairness and justice consideration is increasingly recognised. The thesis takes this fairness and justice consideration as its guiding framework in assessing the success of the Mercosur-EU GPG negotiations. Given the two stages of the negotiation, the first from 2000-2004 which ended unsuccessfully, and the second 2010-2019 which ended successfully, this thesis compares both stages through a process tracing exploring whether fairness and justice play a larger role in the second stage and evaluating its contribution to the successful signing of the agreement. Developing its own framework based around four key concepts: Fair Treatment, Fair Play, Extending the Notion of Reciprocity and Going Beyond Narrow Self-Interest, the two stages are compared and evaluated. Whilst the main focus centres on fairness and justice, other confounding factors such as the leadership shown from certain states in driving forward the negotiations is also acknowledged.",
Climate change in Australia: Is conservatism preventing lasting policy?,"Evans, Riley","['R. Hagen, MA']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Australia has struggled for the past 20 years to maintain a single climate policy. This thesis seeks to identify the ways the Australian Liberal party has been successful in preventing progressive climate policy. More broadly, this thesis asks how does conservative party ideology play a role in the development of climate policy? Previous literature has provided examples of the Liberal party successfully preventing climate policy; however, there is little literature that conducts a longitudinal case study focusing on party ideology. This thesis attempts to fill that void by comparing the Abbott (September 2013 - September 2015) and Morrison (August 2018 – Current) governments to find evidence that party ideology transcends a single administration and that the Australian Liberal party has been successful though various administrations in preventing strong climate policy. By applying the theory of anti-reflexivity, this thesis will observe the ways conservative governments have created doubt and uncertainty regarding the science of climate change. This will be done by utilizing a discourse analysis to explore primary sources such as party manifestos and legislative documents.","['mate policy', 'conservatism', 'political ideology', 'anti-reflexivity']"

The problem statement therefore focuses on the appropriate governance approach for international financial support to ultimately achieve sustainable economic development. To assess the problem statement the case of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the Tunisian context will be analysed. The lens that will be used to perform the analysis will mainly compose of literature on Global Public Goods and Commons. The case study will be established through policy papers, academic literature, opinion papers and primary data retrieved from a questionnaire on the Tunisian public opinion concerning the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. On this basis, the hypothesis stating that a bottom-up approach leads to more sustainable economic development will be tested. The analysis shows that the current Global Public Goods approach to International Financial Institutions does not result in sustainable economic development. A Commons approach would probably have better results, but it is difficult to establish such a bottom-up approach in practice. However, theoretically it can be concluded that a bottom-up approach will lead to more sustainable economic development.","['International Financial Institutions', 'economic development', 'Global Public Goods', 'Commons', 'International Monetary Fund', 'World Bank', 'Tunisia']"
Comparing the Two-Sample Welch and Bootstrap t-Test Using Simulated Data,"Dalsum, Bas van","['Karch, J.', 'De Heus, P.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The two-sample independent variables t-test for unequal variances or Welch’s t-test is known to lose accuracy when sample sizes are small or when there is a high level of skewness in the sample. This study compares the bootstrap t-test to the Welch’s t-test in a multifactor simulation study. Bootstrapping is a different approach to the t-test, where the test makes use of resampling. The data was generated for different sample size ratios, levels of skew, variance, and multiple effect sizes. In the literature which the bootstrap method was often found to have higher power for small sample sizes and high skewness levels (Hayes & Cai, 2007; Tsagris et al., 2020). However, the findings of this study were only partially in line with this. For the Type I error the bootstrap t-test was found to perform similarly to the Welch’s t-test with ranges staying within or just outside the specified alpha level of 5%. On the Power comparison, the bootstrap t-test underperformed. With the Welch’s t-test having equal or higher power in most cases, especially as skewness was introduced in the dataset. In total, there were 13 out of 192 conditions where the bootstrap had a significantly higher power. All of these were conditions with very small sample sizes, usually combined large sample size ratios. Which was expected according to literature (de Winter, 2013), but this was not enough to confirm my hypothesis. Based on these findings I suggest that further research is needed into the potential use cases of the bootstrap t-test.",

Microcredits as an investment in renewable energy: a case-study on sustainable possibilities,"Elabed, Hayet",['Rutger Hagen MA'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"There is a necessity to decrease climate change, and to reduce Greenhouse Gases. This thesis will contribute to the gap between the necessity to decrease climate change in a world where countries are industrialising their markets, and the lack of a feasible solution for such countries to create sustainable development. Also, sustainable development is empirically relevant for society, to increase the chance of creating a sustainable and economically stable society. In the contemporary world, especially developing countries need incentives to create renewable energies in order to develop their industries. Microcredits could function as a development tool in order to create renewable energies. Normally, expenditures of creating renewable energies are too high for developing countries. This thesis therefore focuses on a case-study in Sri Lanka where microcredits were provided by the World Bank, in cooperation with Shell Solar, in order to create Solar Home Systems. In addition, this thesis argues that microcredits should be seen as a Common-Pool Resource and, in order to ensure successful implementation, need to be implemented following the principles by Ostrom (1990).",
The never-ending politics of evidence: Exploring the impact of the use of big data on European burdensharing in migration governance: A game theoretical perspective,"Back, Niels",['Rutger Hagen'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to assess the impact of big data on burden-sharing in the European Union in the field of migration governance. Migration governance in the European Union is widely perceived as a collective action problem, as no effective burden-sharing has been established since the migration crisis of 2015. The current field of force is interpreted as a suasion game, where the strategy of non-affected states forces affected states to cooperate in burden-sharing, resulting in a de jure status quo. Having conducted interviews with European decision-makers as well as migration and big data experts, this thesis finds that big data can provide decision-makers with situational awareness, resulting in better organisational preparedness as well as enhanced matching and integration policies. However, political will is found to be an essential trigger for changing the suasion game, as big data on itself invokes no incentives for this political will. Consequently, decision-makers use big data so that it fits their strategy. When issue-linkage is established the suasion game can be changed. Big data however is then used instrumentally, potentially allowing for more voluntary reception of migrants. Nevertheless, the overall impact of big data is limited on the suasion game and Member States will not change their strategies. This thesis contributes to the recent academic debate on the use of big data in migration governance as well as to the academic debate on evidence-based decision-making.",

Two independent datasets were combined through matching participants based on their Rosenberg scores. One data set contained data of self-esteem fluctuations in response to feedback, which was gathered from an experimental social evaluation paradigm, the other data set contained self-reports of parental bonding (two dimensions care and overprotection). Results revealed that self-esteem increased in response to approving feedback and decreased in response to disapproving feedback. I found no evidence of an impact of parent-child bonding on self-esteem fluctuations in response to social feedback. Despite, this study revealed important effects of parental care and overprotection on trait self-esteem and provides a foundation for future research on this matter",

Eurosceptic Populism in Hungary: Are Multidimensional EU Attitudes Enabling Democratic Backsliding?,"Papra, Maileen","['Yordanova, N.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the last decade, several Eastern members of the European Union (EU) have regressed in their democratic quality. This ‘democratic backsliding’ has most notably occurred in Hungary where the populist government led by Viktor Orbán continues to infringe upon the liberal democratic values championed by the EU. As the Hungarian populist government employs a Eurosceptic narrative, its continued success in combination with the rather pro-EU population is puzzling. Applying a multidimensional framework of EU attitudes, this study conducts a quantitative analysis of public opinion to explain the aforementioned puzzle and gauge the impact Euroscepticism has on the continued success of populism. It is argued that the government uses the underlying dimensions of EU attitudes to varying extent to mobilise public support. The binary regression’s results show that popular EU attitudes are not a definitive predictor for populist support. Nonetheless, the findings illustrate that the continued success of the Hungarian government is attributable to nationalist sentiments in the unique post-communist context.","['Democratic Backsliding', 'Euroscepticism', 'European Union', 'EU Attitudes', 'Hungary', 'Illiberalism', 'Nationalism', 'Populism', 'Public Opinion', 'Trust in Government']"
Parliament as steppingstone? An analysis of post-parliamentary careers,"Vlist, Denny van der","['Kopecky, P.', 'Nagtzaam, M.A.M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Not much is known about MP’s after they leave parliament. This study analyses the development of patterns in post-parliamentary employment in The Netherlands between 1967 and 2017. With 999 MP’s coded, this is the most extensive study into post-parliamentary careers up to date and a first inquiry into a development over time. The study argues – and finds – that the function of parliament is increasingly used as a steppingstone for a further career as MP’s are increasingly making a move towards more attractive careers, either within or outside the political domain. Besides such dynamic changes, this study shows that MP’s from traditionally stronger and governing parties have a distinctive advantage for gaining a more attractive post parliamentary career while MP’s from anti-establishment parties have a distinctive disadvantage. Even when there is controlled for the background career of a MP. Finally, this study has tried to establish a link between the patterns of post-parliamentary employment and parliamentary behaviour for the first time. However, the results indicate that such a connection, if it is even present, is relatively weak.",

Democratic dissatisfaction and Populist Voting in East-Central Europe,"Stojkovíc, Stefan","['Nagtzaam, M.A.M.', 'Kopecky, P.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While it has been well established that political dissatisfaction is related to voting for populist parties, we know less about what specifically this dissatisfaction has to do with the functioning of democracy. This question of the relationship between how democracy is perceived to function and party preferences has attracted certain attention in established democracies, but almost none in post-communist East-Central European countries. To fill this gap, I ask (1) what aspects of dissatisfaction with democracy are related to voting for populist parties in this region and (2) to what extent dissatisfaction drives support for populist parties. The study employs European Social Survey 2012 and includes 6 East-Central European countries. I run a comparative quantitative study on the demand side and compare populist parties’ voters to non-populist voters and abstainers. Results suggest that support for democratic protest voting model is very country-specific, and that overall patterns with regards to the suggested model are hardly identified in post-communist democracies.",
Political Insiders Outside The Party – An analysis of Irish ex-party independents and their transfer relationships with their former parties: 1982 – 2020.,"Fischer-Kerrane, Nils","['Nagtzaam, M.A.M.', 'Biezen, L.C. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Over recent decades, independent (non-party) candidates have become the largest political grouping in Irish politics. Within this grouping, one subsection that seems to dominate are the independents who have previously been party candidates, a.k.a. ex-party independents. The electoral system in Ireland has a big role to play in this. While in most electoral systems, leaving a political party (and not joining another) usually signals the end of one’s career, this is not necessarily the case in PR-STV systems, where ex-party independents can survive and sometimes even thrive outside of the party system. In the elections following their departure, these candidates can win large amounts of votes and transfers, with a significant number of those coming from their ex-party. This paper examines the relationships between ex-party independents and their former parties, focusing on the transfers that these candidate receives from that party. Furthermore, it aims to add to the study of ex-party independent candidates in Ireland, focusing on issues like electability, career longevity, origin parties, etc. and compares the performance of ex-party independents with those of other independent candidates.",

Explaining Macron’s ‘Non’: Testing the Fit of Liberal Intergovernmentalism to French EU Enlargement Politics,"Lierop, Juliette van",['Dr. Tom Theuns'],2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This research thesis seeks to explain the French veto on the opening of enlargement negotiations with North Albania and Macedonia using a process-tracing methodology testing liberal intergovernmentalist (LI) theory. Four hypotheses operationalised from existing literature, expected negative enlargement attitudes of French national actors to influence an aggregated national preference in the process of international bargaining, in which the veto was used as a hard-bargaining strategy. While support for H1, H3 and H4a was found, and partial support for H2, this thesis failed to conclude LI as suitable in this case. This because the proposed French national preference of accession procedure reformation made the enlargement more costly opposed to the status quo. This goes against LI’s principle that states act to maximise especially their economic self-interest. Furthermore, the thesis agreed with previous critiques of LI’s lack of explanatory power due to its failure to specify conditions in which it should be rejected. Yet, the case demonstrated the importance of states in the European integration process. Further research, including more applications of LI to cases of member states enlargement politics and comparative cases, are proposed to further solidify this conclusion.",

Covariates as a measure for corroboration: A study cataloguing different types of covariates and using p-curve analysis to test their influence on replicability,"Eleveld, David","[""van 't Veer, A.""]",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Objective: The current paper analysed the different ways in which covariates are reported within the field of social psychological science. An attempt is made to find a link between the way covariates are reported, and the corresponding study’s corroboration—a measure for the certainty of a study’s results. It was expected that studies that report the results only with covariates, have lower corroboration than studies that report results both with and without covariates. Method: A randomly generated sample of 1000 studies within the field of social psychological science was manually coded for information about the number of participants used in the studies. A subsample of 250 studies was manually coded for the p-value of the main finding, its test statistic, the degrees of freedom, and importantly, information about the manner in which covariates were reported. The papers were then sorted into groups according to this information about covariates. P-curve analysis was used to assess the corroboration of these different groups of studies. Results: The usage of covariates has increased since the year 2000. Most (80%) studies that use covariates reported results only with covariates. P-curve analysis suggested that all groups had high corroboration. Methodological issues concerning these outcomes are discussed",

Democracies and compellence. Why democracies are less successful at compelling other states.,"Terpstra, Djairo","['Haer, R. van der', 'Pellikaan, H.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"More than twenty years ago, Fearon (1994; 1997) has argued that democracies are more likely to successfully compel a target state than nondemocracies. However, empirical evidence suggests that this is not the case (Snyder & Borghard, 2011; Trachtenberg, 2012; Downes & Sechser, 2012; Sechser, 2018, 335). Consequently, a new understanding of the relationship between regime type and compellence outcomes is needed (Gartzke & Lupu, 2012). I argue that democratic leaders have more incentives to keep the costs of conflict low. Consequently, they will want to prevent disputes from escalating. Hence, they are more likely to not mobilise their troops or to mobilise air troops during a conflict. These options have a lower risk of escalating the conflict than the mobilisation of land or naval troops (Pfundstein Chamberlain, 2016; Post, 2019a). By choosing the careful option, democratic leaders will not be perceived as resolved by the target state (Fearon, 1994; Fearon, 1997; Pfundstein Chamberlain, 2016; Post, 2019a). As a result, compellent threats issued by democracies will have a lower chance to be successful in comparison to threats issued by nondemocracies. I have tested this hypothesis by the Militarised Compellent Threat (MCT) database (Sechser, 2011b).",

With this research, I try to contribute to the earlier research of Hultman (2012) were she argues that one-sided violence is a strong predictor for United Nations interventions. I analyze the cases of Libya and Syria with a comparative case study design. Libya and Syria have a lot of similarities in the start and outcome of the conflicts. The only thing different is the response of the international community. In Libya the United Nations did intervene, in Syria they did not. I found that in the case of Libya one-sided violence was indeed the reason of intervention. However, in the case of Syria, it was not. I found that all (draft) resolutions on Syria and Libya were related to one-sided violence. However, in the case of Syria, one-sided violence did not result in an United Nations intervention. I argue that although one-sided violence is a great concern to all member states of the United Nations Security Council, it is for several members of the Security Council not always important enough to start an intervention.",

The goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of the way of thinking of professionals regarding out-of-home placements, so that future out-of-home placement decision making will be less subjective and each case will be judged in a similar manner. In this study, 25 children’s judges and 34 child-welfare professionals were asked to judge a child protection case in which they had to decide whether a child should be placed out of home, by reading a short description and answering questionnaires. Four different types of factors were used by which professionals are guided in making an out-of-home placement decision, namely child factors, family factors, parental factors, and care factors. It was found that child factors were the most important factors for professionals in decisions on out-of-home placements, while family factors exerted the least influence on professionals. The study also found that profession and experience did not influence the way that professionals were guided by the different factors. Although the current study creates more insight into the way of thinking of professionals when making out-of-home placement decisions, more research should be conducted into other factors that could explain the differences between professionals in making out-of-home placement decisions",
De relatie tussen egoïstisch en prosociaal leergedrag en depressieve symptomen,"Kelder, Lois op de","['Bruijn, E.R.A. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Depressie is een veel voorkomende psychische aandoening en heeft gevolgen voor vele gebieden zoals het sociaal functioneren. Een belangrijke voorwaarde om adequaat sociaal te functioneren is het vertonen van prosociale gedragingen. Prosociaal gedrag ontstaat vrijwillig in het voordeel van andere mensen of de samenleving zonder voordelen voor jezelf. In het huidige onderzoek werd de hypothese ‘individuen leren beter voor zichzelf dan voor anderen’ getoetst. De tweede hypothese luidde ‘mensen die hoog scoren op depressieve symptomen presteren relatief beter voor zichzelf dan voor bekenden en onbekenden in vergelijking met mensen die laag scoren op depressieve symptomen’. Middels de BDI-II vragenlijst werden depressieve symptomen gemeten. Er is in dit onderzoek gekeken naar egoïstisch en prosociaal leergedrag in een onderzoeksgroep van 85 gezonde vrijwilligers met sub-klinische symptomen. Het leergedrag is gemeten middels een probabilistische leertaak met drie condities, jezelf, een bekende en een onbekende. De leertaak bestond uit het leren voor een beloning. Het huidige onderzoek leverde bewijs voor de hypothese dat mensen beter voor zichzelf dan voor anderen leerden. Echter maakte het niet uit of de andere persoon een bekende of een onbekende was. De hypothese dat mensen die hoog scoorden op depressieve symptomen relatief beter voor zichzelf dan voor bekenden en onbekenden presteerden in vergelijking met mensen die laag scoorden kon niet geverifieerd worden. Een limitatie van het huidige onderzoek was het kleine aantal hoog scorers in de onderzoeksgroep. Vervolgonderzoek met klinisch depressieve patiënten is nodig om duidelijkheid te krijgen over de relatie tussen egoïstisch- en prosociaal leergedrag en depressieve symptomen.",

Daarnaast speelden zij een probabilistische leertaak waarin zij voor zichzelf, een vriend en een onbekende deelnemers leerden en een prijs konden winnen. Verwacht werd dat deelnemers over het algemeen beter zouden presteren voor zichzelf. De participanten die hoog scoorden op empathie zouden relatief beter presteerden voor een vriend en een onbekende ander dan de participanten die laag scoorden. Daarnaast werd verondersteld dat de eerder gevonden positieve correlatie tussen empathie en de cognitieve empathie subschaal van de QCAE: Online Simulation, gerepliceerd zou worden en dat dat affectieve empathie positief zou correleren met anoniem prosociaal gedrag. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de deelnemers inderdaad beter presteren voor zichzelf dan een vriend of een onbekende ander. Er is geen significante correlatie gevonden met de Online Simulation subschaal en de leerprestaties voor een vriend en onbekende ander. Echter, er is een positieve correlatie gevonden tussen de cognitieve empathie subschaal van IRI: Perspective Taking, en de leerprestatie voor een onbekende ander. Tevens is een eenzijdig significante positieve correlatie gevonden tussen de totaalscore op de QCAE en de leerprestatie voor een onbekende ander. Hier wordt voorzichtig mee omgegaan. De resultaten van de huidige studie bevestigen dat men beter leert voor zichzelf en suggereren dat cognitieve empathie een rol speelt in anoniem prosociaal gedrag.",
"Bestaat er samenhang tussen sociale angstkenmerken en verschillende typen prosociaal gedrag onder gezonde vrijwilligers? Een onderzoek naar persoonlijkheidsverschillen in individueel en prosociaal leren, gemeten met een probabilistische leertaak.","Megen, Joyce van","['Bruijn, E.R.A. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Binnen psychische aandoeningen bestaat er een verstoring in het functioneren van fundamentele sociale processen, zoals prosociaal gedrag. Prosociaal gedrag kenmerkt zich als vrijwillig uitgevoerd gedrag, wat een voordeel oplevert voor een ander individu, groep of uit maatschappelijk belang. In het huidige onderzoek wordt het verschil onderzocht in openbaar en anoniem prosociaal gedrag. Openbaar gedrag wordt gekenmerkt uit de motivatie om anderen te helpen om zo respect, goedkeuring of de eigenwaarde te verhogen, anoniem gedrag wordt uitgevoerd zonder de wetenschap wie er geholpen wordt. Om karakteristieken in prosociaal gedrag bij psychisch disfunctioneren te begrijpen, is onderzoek naar individuele verschillen in persoonlijkheidskenmerken van belang. Het huidige onderzoek richt zijn aandacht op de sociale angststoornis, welke één van de meest voorkomende stoornissen onder volwassenen is bevonden. Sociale angst staat bekend om zijn tegenstrijdige cognities en gecompliceerde problematiek. De studie onderzocht de rol van sociale angst in verschillen in prosociaal gedrag. Er werd gebruik gemaakt van een objectief leerparadigma om prosociaal gedrag te meten. Deelnemers leerden om beloningen te verkrijgen onder drie condities; ‘voor een vriend’ (openbaar), ‘voor een onbekende’ (anoniem), en ‘leren voor zichzelf’. Uit de resultaten kwam naar voren dat individuen gemiddeld het best presteerden individueel in vergelijking tot prosociaal gedrag. Er werden positieve relaties verwacht bij het uitvoeren van openbaar prosociaal gedrag, maar negatieve relaties bij anoniem prosociaal gedrag. De resultaten lieten geen relatie zien bij openbaar gedrag, wel werden er negatieve relaties gevonden tussen sociale angst en anoniem prosociaal gedrag. Het onderzoek toonde hiermee verschillen in prosociaal gedrag aan in relatie tot sociale angstkenmerken. De bevindingen van dit onderzoek impliceren aanwijzingen voor verschillende invloeden van de ‘zelf-gefocuste’ aandacht, een hoofdelement bij sociale angst.",

Het flexibel aanpassen van adaptief gedrag in sociale context kan verstoord zijn bij mensen met obsessief-compulsieve gedragskenmerken. Gezonde vrijwilligers die hoog scoren op OC-symptomen voelen zich namelijk extreem verantwoordelijk voor hun gedrag en voor anderen en zijn bang om fouten te maken. Mensen met obsessief-compulsieve gedragskenmerken werden verwacht op een andere te manier leren dan mensen zonder deze gedragskenmerken. In dit onderzoek werd door middel van een probabilistische leertaak onderzocht wat de verschillen zijn in individueel versus prosociaal leren bij participanten met obsessief-compulsieve gedragskenmerken en participanten die deze gedragskenmerken niet bezitten. Deelnemers (N=85) leerden in drie verschillende condities (voor henzelf, vriend of ander) via trial and error beloningen te verkrijgen. Na de taak werd geïnventariseerd wat de motivatie was, hoe verantwoordelijk de deelnemers zich voelden en hoe erg zij het vonden om fouten te maken. Obsessiefcompulsieve symptomen werden gemeten met behulp van de revised Obsessive- Compulsive Inventory. Er werd onderscheid gemaakt tussen laag (N=19) en hoog (N=21) scorers op de OCI-R. De resultaten lieten zien dat deelnemers leerden tijdens taakuitvoer en dat ze over het algemeen beter leerden voor zichzelf dan voor iemand anders. Er was geen significant verschil per conditie voor participanten die hoog scoren op de OCI-R. Gezonde vrijwilligers die hoog scoren op OC-symptomen leren dus net zoals gezonde vrijwilligers die hier niet hoog scoren. Voor vervolgonderzoek wordt aangeraden uitgebreider te onderzoeken wat de rol is van motivatie in (prosociaal) leren.",

Forced Fighters and Bush Wives. Forced Marriages within Armed Groups in Sierra Leone.,"Ruijter, Cindy de","['Haer, R. van der', 'Jentzsch, C.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Forced marriage of girls under the age of eighteen is regarded as a fundamental violation of the rights of the child. Despite this fact, armed groups are known to use it as a strategic tactic. They abduct large groups of girls with the intention to marry them off to members of their rebel group. Yet this is not the case in all armed groups, as there are armed groups who do not show a single case of forced marriages. In this thesis, I will research why this variation occurs. I will argue that the use of forced recruitment by an armed group will influence the use of forced marriages. Groups that use forced recruitment often struggle with group cohesion. Forced marriages can be used to solve this problem through social bonding, the establishment of a family unit and making connections to the local population. This theory will be tested though process tracing using a comparative case analysis of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the Civil Defence Force (CDF) in Sierra Leone during the civil war from 1991 to 2001.",

"Political Instability, Uncertainty and Foreign Direct Investment in sub-Sahara Africa: The Reaction of Heineken N.V. to the Rwandan Civil War and Genocide","Offerman, Gavin","['Haer, R. van der', 'Jentzsch, C.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the literature it is argued that economic and political uncertainty induced by political instability has adverse effects on investments of corporations. Political instability in the form of civil wars, political violence and political unrest has long been a factor for companies in deciding whether to continue or discontinue their investments. Although scholars are divided whether uncertainty leads to higher or lower levels of private investment, the majority concur that the latter is more likely in sub-Sahara Africa. However, the case of Heineken N.V. and its subsidiary Bralirwa in Rwanda forms an anomaly in the literature on investment under uncertainty. Despite the outbreak of the Rwandan civil war followed by the Rwandan genocide, Heineken remained active when the mass slaughter was going on. In this thesis, I will analyze the Heineken case by using a neo-classical model based on the option pricing theory where there is an option to shut down operations during uncertainty. I argue that although it is an anomaly for the investment literature, this case can be elucidated with Dunning’s Ownership Location Internalization framework. The results indicate that Heineken remained operational in Rwanda due to ownership and internalization advantages. Furthermore, the case presents evidence against the notion of political instability lowering private investment in sub-Sahara Africa.",
Investigating the Differences in Decision-Making Behaviour between Healthy Males and Psychopathic Males in the Evaluation of Complex Social Situations,"Wijnberg, Laura","['Overgaauw, S.', 'Antypa, N.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Psychopaths are known for their lack of empathy and immoral behaviours, and have shown to be unable to distinguish moral from conventional violations. Research demonstrated that morality can be influenced by empathy, as well as developmental changes. The current study therefore aimed to investigate differences in moral decision-making behaviours between healthy males and psychopathic males in the evaluation of complex social situations. A total of 39 participants took part in this study, with 20 healthy male controls and 19 psychopathic males. The participants observed and evaluated pictures depicting various social situations. These included offenders of intentional pain (IP), offenders of accidental pain (AP), victims of IP, and victims of AP. Participants were then instructed to distribute coins between themselves and a random target from the social situation. The results showed that the controls could differentiate between more conditions than the psychopaths. More specifically, the controls and psychopaths both showed most prosocial behaviour towards victims of IP, followed by victims of AP, and showed most punishing behaviour towards offenders of IP, followed by offenders of AP. However, the psychopaths showed less prosocial behaviour than the controls towards victims of IP and AP. No significant differences were found in punishing behaviour between the controls and psychopaths towards offenders of AP. Finally, no significant correlation was found between age and prosocial behaviour in both the controls and psychopaths towards victims. Taken together, these findings further support the notion that psychopaths’ lack of prosocial behaviour stems from an empathy deficiency, rather than an impairment in moral judgement.","['psychopaths', 'empathy', 'social interaction', 'prosocial behaviour', 'dictator game', 'moral judgement']"

Zuma claims that the problems arose because of Dutch colonialism and the subsequent introduction of slavery. In this thesis, I try to investigate how the Dutch Consulate General in Cape Town executes its economic mandate by considering the dark shared heritage between South Africa and the Netherlands. I had the opportunity of doing an internship as the Communications and Public Diplomacy intern and therefore, have six months of accumulated ethnographic data. I found that the Dutch CG in Cape Town executes its economic mandate through their initiative called #cocreate which operates through projects. In addition, the Dutch CG claims to put the emphasis on South Africans which does not necessarily translate when looking at these projects. I found that although their intentions may be good, the Dutch CG often ends up overpowering any positive results by controlling the final say so closely. Also, I found that there is a strong reluctance to tackle particular problems surrounding their shared heritage. Such fears ultimately result in the neglect of communities that truly need their help and would have benefited from initiatives such as these.","['identity', 'infrastructure', 'shared heritage', 'competing narratives']"
An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study on the Relationship Between Procrastination and Mental Health,"Wickenkamp, Anna","['Fried, E.', 'Houtum, L. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background. Student populations show higher prevalence rates of procrastination and symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression compared to the general population. Previous research found evidence for an association between mental health and procrastination. The current study investigated the association of procrastination with mental health problems using the network perspective and dealt with the question whether procrastination is a state or a trait. Methods. We used Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to collect data from 79 undergraduate students from Dutch universities. Our participants answered questions concerning procrastination and symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression four times a day over a time course of two weeks. We estimated contemporaneous and temporal networks to gain insight in the dynamic connections between these constructs. Moreover, we assessed procrastination with a questionnaire before and after two weeks and compared both assessments in order to investigate if procrastination categorizes as a state or a trait. Results. We found significant contemporaneous associations of procrastination with symptoms of anxiety and depression and a temporal association between procrastination and anxiety. Pre- and posttest on procrastination did not differ significantly. Conclusions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression co-occur at the same point in time and procrastination is a predictor for anxiety symptoms. The pre- and posttest results indicated no change of procrastination over time. However, the dynamic network analysis indicated fluctuations of procrastination over time and situation. We concluded that procrastination exists at trait and state level. It is important to mention that data collection took place during the Covid-19 outbreak.",

This study aimed to answer whether the interference observed during a Stroop-like task is caused by individual differences, which could be done by measuring the stability of the reaction times and interference effect within one session of a Stroop-like task (by dividing the session in two halves). It was hypothesized that both reaction times and interference effect would be stable within one session, with the exception of children under 7 years old, whose ability to control interference is not fully developed yet. The data of previously administered four Stroop-like tasks (color-object; position-object; number-object; and picture-word) in children, adolescents, and young adults, was used and analyzed to address these questions. The results of this study confirmed only the hypothesis for reaction times, while there was an inconsistency in the results of interference effect. The same pattern was observed for the younger children of this study, as they showed a difference from the remaining age groups in reaction times but inconsistency in interference effect. Further exploration is needed in order to understand why interference effect did not show stability within a session of a Stroop-like task.",

Although constructs such as stress, anxiety and depression have been indeed found to be related to appetite, results are often contradictory and point to different causal directions. The present study investigates such associations in a student population of 84 individuals, by means of an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) method. Participants’ perceived levels of stress, anxiety, depression and hunger were recorded four times per day, during a two-weeks period. In addition, before accessing the study, students had to fill in a baseline assessment, which allowed for a further investigation of the relationship between trait and state hunger. A network approach was utilized for the first statistical analysis, allowing for the depiction of contemporaneous, temporal and between-subjects network, whilst a linear regression analysis was used to compare hunger data at baseline and during EMA. Results failed to replicate previous findings concerning appetite and mental health, as for all networks, hunger was not associated with any other variable of interest. However, we were able to identify a linear relationship between trait and state hunger, with the former being a significant positive predictor of the latter.","['Hunger', 'mental health', 'stress', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'ecological momentary assessment', 'network approach']"
