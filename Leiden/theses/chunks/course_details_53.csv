De ontwikkeling van executieve functies en de relatie met het sociaal functioneren van basisschoolkinderen.,"Verwest, Jasmijn","['Sonneville, L.M.J. de']",2011,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"De ontwikkeling en kwaliteit van executieve functies (EF) worden regelmatig in verband gebracht met het sociaal (dis)functioneren van kinderen. Dit onderzoek focust zich op de ontwikkeling van de EF componenten ‘inhibitie’ en ‘mentale flexibiliteit’ bij 137 kinderen in de leeftijd van 6 tot en met 12 jaar binnen het regulier basisonderwijs. Gekeken is of meisjes en jongens van elkaar verschillen en of er een relatie is tussen EF en sociaal functioneren. EF is gemeten met de SSV-taak van de Amsterdamse Neuropsychologische Taken (ANT) en de BRIEF-Executieve Functies Gedragsvragenlijst (BRIEF). Voor het sociaal functioneren is de Strenghts and Difficulties Questionnaire’ (SDQ) gebruikt. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat oudere kinderen (10t/m12 jaar) beter in staat zijn prepotente responsen te onderdrukken (inhibitie), minder vertragen en flexibeler zijn in hun denken en handelen (mentale flexibiliteit) dan jongere kinderen (6t/m9 jaar) (ANOVA). De uitkomsten op de BRIEF ondersteunen deze bevindingen niet. Er zijn nagenoeg geen verschillen gevonden tussen meisjes en jongens (MANOVA). Tussen EF en sociaal functioneren is in huidig onderzoek geen relatie aangetoond. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat de snelheid en nauwkeurigheid van inhibitie- en mentale flexibiliteitsprocessen toenemen met de leeftijd.","['Executieve functies', 'inhibitie', 'mentale flexibiliteit', 'sociaal functioneren']"

De relatie tussen het spelniveau en de cognitieve ontwikkeling bij kinderen met een autismespectrumstoornis,"Hoff, Rianne van 't","['Maljaars, Jarymke']",2011,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In deze studie zijn de cognitieve ontwikkeling en het spelniveau van laagfunctionerende kinderen met een ASS onderzocht. Daarnaast is er onderzocht of er een verband is tussen de cognitieve ontwikkeling en het spelniveau. De onderzoeksgroep bestaat uit 30 kinderen met een klinische diagnose ASS, 7 meisjes en 23 jongens, in de leeftijd van 2,5 tot 10 jaar afkomstig van verschillende KDC’s en MKD’s in de regio Noord- en Zuid Holland. Het spelniveau is gemeten met de voormeting van een speltraining opgesteld door de Universiteit van Leiden. Het cognitieve ontwikkelingsniveau is gemeten met de PEP-R. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat alle kinderen uit de onderzoeksgroep een lagere ontwikkelingsleeftijd hebben dan hun kalenderleeftijd. De ontwikkelingsleeftijden varieerden van 0 tot 4,8 jaar, terwijl de kalenderleeftijden tussen de 2,5 en 10 jaar liggen. Op het spelgebied werden de meeste spelhandelingen gescoord onder het niveau ‘simpel manipuleren’. Voor de meeste kinderen was het niveau ‘functioneel spel’ het hoogst haalbare. Het verband tussen spelniveau en ontwikkelingsniveau is getoetst met een variantie-analyse, hierbij is een positief verband gevonden; kinderen met een hoger ontwikkelingsniveau, komen ook tot een hoger spelniveau.",['autisme en spel']

Angstig-depressieve jeugdigen en adaptieve vaardigheden. Een onderzoek naar de beheersing van algemene adaptieve vaardigheden door jeugdigen met angstig-depressief gedrag.,"Ris, Laura","['Scholte, E.M.']",2011,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Om de ontwikkeling van kinderen en jongeren met angstig-depressief gedrag gericht te kunnen begeleiden dient bekend te zijn welke algemene adaptieve vaardigheden deze jeugdigen precies ontberen. Dit onderzoek beoogt op dit gebied een bijdrage te leveren. Middels de experimentele vragenlijst ‘Algemene Vaardigheden Jeugdigen’ (AVJ) en de angstdimensies van de ‘Sociaal Emotionele Vragenlijst’ (SEV) is onderzocht in hoeverre er sprake is van tekorten in de algemene adaptieve vaardigheden van jeugdigen die angstig-depressief gedrag vertonen. Hierbij verwijst de term ‘algemene adaptieve vaardigheden’ naar de competenties om leeftijdsgebonden dagelijkse ontwikkelingstaken thuis, op school en in de vrije tijd adequaat te kunnen vervullen. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat angstig-depressieve jeugdigen ten opzichte van jeugdigen zonder ontwikkelingsproblemen tekorten hebben op alle vaardigheidsgebieden. Daarnaast blijken alle adaptieve vaardigheden significante voorspellers voor de mate van angstig-depressief gedrag. Hierbij zijn ‘omgang met leeftijdgenoten’ en ‘autonomie en zelfsturing’ de belangrijkste voorspellers. Adolescenten met angstig-depressief gedrag beheersen de vaardigheden ‘omgang met leeftijdgenoten’ en ‘positieve invulling van vrije tijd’ significant minder goed dan kinderen met dit gedrag. De gemiddelde mate waarin jongens in de kindertijd met angstig-depressief gedrag positief gericht zijn op school, werk en toekomst is significant hoger dan bij jongens in de adolescentiefase. Jonge meisjes (4-12 jaar) beheersen deze vaardigheid het minst goed. Meisjes in de adolescentiefase beheersen deze vaardigheid het beste in vergelijking tot jongens in de leeftijd van 4-18 jaar en meisjes in de kindertijd. Met betrekking tot de andere adaptieve vaardigheden blijken ‘geslacht’ en ‘leeftijd’ geen verschil te maken. Vervolgonderzoek is nodig om angstig-depressief gedrag van kinderen en adolescenten en de factoren die daarop van invloed kunnen zijn zo compleet mogelijk in kaart te brengen, zodat preventie en hulpverlening zo effectief mogelijk kan worden ingezet.","['angst', 'depressie', 'adaptieve vaardigheden', 'gedrag', 'kinderen', 'adolescenten', 'angstig-depressief gedrag']"
Taalvaardigheden in relatie tot spelniveau bij 2 tot 9-jarige laagfunctionerende kinderen met een autismespectrumstoornis.,"Hoogerbrug, Elleke","['Maljaars, Jarymke', 'Korlaar, Margot van']",2010,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Volgens de DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) doen de problemen bij kinderen met een autismespectrumstoornis zich onder andere voor op het gebied van communicatie, waaronder ook het fantasiespel en sociaal imitatiespel vallen. Er is al veel onderzoek gedaan naar de relatie tussen de taalvaardigheden en spelontwikkeling van kinderen met een autismespectrumstoornis. Dit onderzoek is belangrijk omdat hierdoor de hulpverlening aan deze kinderen steeds beter aangescherpt kan worden. Het huidige onderzoek richt zich niet alleen op de relatie tussen taalvaardigheden en het fantasiespel (ofwel symbolisch spel), maar onderzoekt ook of er een relatie is tussen lagere spelvormen (simpel manipuleren, combinatiespel en functioneel spel) en taalvaardigheden van kinderen met een autismespectrumstoornis. De onderzoeksgroep bestaat uit 30 kinderen in de leeftijd van 42 tot en met 120 maanden (M=74.6, Sd=21.7) met een autismespectrumstoornis. De gemiddelde ontwikkelingsleeftijd ligt tussen 1 en 58 maanden (M=21.70, Sd=11.20). Binnen deze groep zijn er 8 meisjes en 22 jongens. Alle kinderen uit de onderzoeksgroep laten spelhandelingen zien. Het meeste spel wordt gezien in de lage spelvormen (simpel manipuleren en combinatiespel). Veel kinderen uit de onderzoeksgroep (n=22) komen niet tot symbolisch spel. De taalvaardigheden van de kinderen uit de onderzoeksgroep zijn zwak tot gemiddeld ontwikkeld ten opzichte van zich normaal ontwikkelende kinderen. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat er een relatie bestaat tussen productieve taalvaardigheden en het functioneel en symbolisch spel van deze kinderen. Er zijn geen significante correlaties gevonden tussen receptieve taalvaardigheden en de spelontwikkeling en tussen productieve taalvaardigheden en de spelvormen simpel manipuleren en combinatiespel van de kinderen uit de onderzoeksgroep. Ook is er geen verschil gevonden in de taalvaardigheden tussen kinderen met een laag spelniveau (simpel manipuleren en combinatiespel) en kinderen met een hoog spelniveau (functioneel spel en symbolisch spel).","['play', 'language', 'autism']"

Method: We used the Finger Tapping Task (FTT) to assess maturation of the brain as measured by fine motor speed, and lateralization of the brain as measured by the difference in speed between both hands. Both maturation and lateralization are used as a measure of specialization of the brain. The participants were children in the age of 5 to 18 years old and were assigned to five distinct diagnostic groups: Mood problems (n=178), Behavior problems (n=82), Autism spectrum Disorders (n=106), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (n=190) and Learning problems (n=44). The diagnostic groups differ with regard to age and gender. Results: We found that children with an autism spectrum disorder show delayed fine motor lateralization. We were also able to determine that the differences in fine motor speed between the different diagnostic groups get larger with age indicating that delayed maturation gets more evident while children get older. Looking at the academic measures, we found that a more matured brain, as measured with fine motor speed, is associated with better academic performance, even when controlled for age. Conclusion: Autism spectrum disorders can be differentiated from other disorders when looking at lateralization of the brain. A more matured brain is associated with a significant higher level of academic performance for math, reading and Writing.","['Specialization of the brain', 'Maturation', 'Lateralization', 'Fine motor skills', 'Developmental disorders', 'Academic performance', 'Finger tapping task']"

De invloed van financiële stress en hedonistische capaciteit op genot,"Zuckerman, Maja",['Dr. Michael Vliek'],,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Mensen geven geld uit aan hedonistische activiteiten om een goed gevoel te krijgen en te genieten, wat goed is voor het subjectieve welzijn. Personen verschillen in de mate waarin ze van hedonistische activiteiten kunnen genieten, dit kan gezien worden als iemands hedonistische capaciteit. Heeft een lage hedonistische capaciteit en het gebrek aan geld invloed op hoe goed van een (goedkope en/of dure) hedonistische activiteit genoten wordt? In dit onderzoek werd gekeken naar het effect van financiële stress en hedonistische capaciteit op genot bij hedonistische activiteiten. Verwacht werd dat financiële stress middels indringende gedachten zorgt voor een lagere genotservaring. Plus dat een hoge hedonistische capaciteit het genieten van de activiteiten, en het sparen ervoor, juist bevordert. In dit onderzoek vulden 137 Nederlandse volwassen een online vragenlijst in, waarin financiële stress, hedonistische capaciteit, de neiging om geld opzij te zetten en genot bij acht (goedkope en dure) hedonistische ervaringen gemeten werd. Resultaten toonden dat veel financiële stress inderdaad gerelateerd is aan een lagere genotservaring van hedonistische activiteiten, met in het bijzonder een sterker effect bij activiteiten met een ‘dure’ prijs. Bovendien bleek uit de data dat mensen met een hoge hedonistische capaciteit een hoger bedrag opzij zetten voor hedonistische activiteiten. Verder onderzoek is voorgesteld om deze kwesties nauwkeuriger te onderzoeken en beter te begrijpen.","['financiële stress, hedonistische capaciteit, hedonistische activiteiten, subjectief welzijn, indringende gedachten, genot, geld opzij zetten']"

Het vrijwilligersdilemma: samenwerken of is het ieder voor zich? Een onderzoek naar de invloed van gelijkenissen en de Sociale Waarde Oriëntatie op samenwerking en coöperatief gedrag in het vrijwilligersdilemma,"Smit, Milou","['E.W, de Kwaadsteniet']",,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op de invloed van gelijkenissen tussen mensen op de keuzes om zich vrijwillig op te stellen. Dit is onderzocht in een vrwilligersdilemma: een sociaal dilemma waarbij slechts één persoon zich vrijwillig hoeft op te stellen om een voordelige uitkomst voor de groep te creëren. Bovendien is er gekeken hoe de Sociale Waarde Oriëntatie van invloed is op het verband tussen gelijkenissen en het vrijwillige gedrag van individuen in een vrijwilligersdilemma. In totaal namen 60 participanten deel aan dit onderzoek. Deze participanten vulden voorafgaand aan het eerste vrijwilligersdilemma, de baseline meting, een vragenlijst in waarin zij hun voorkeuren aangaven betreffende muziek, sport, kleur en eten. Daarnaast werden vragen gesteld om hun Sociale Waarde Oriëntatie te meten. Op basis van deze eerdere ingevulde vragenlijst over hun voorkeuren, werden participanten ingedeeld in de twee verschillende condities: gelijkenissen en geen gelijkenissen. In de gelijkenissen conditie zaten participanten die op basis van deze vragenlijst gelijkenissen deelden en in de andere conditie deelden de participanten geen gelijkenissen met elkaar. Vervolgens voerden zij in deze groepen het tweede vrijwilligersdilemma uit. Participanten in de groep met gelijkenissen stelden zich niet vaker vrijwillig op dan participanten in de groep zonder gelijkenissen. Dit was niet in lijn met de eerste hypothese. Bovendien was het interactie-effect van gelijkenissen en Sociale Waarde Oriëntatie niet significant op het vrijwilligersdillema. Ook de tweede hypothese kan om deze resultaten worden verworpen. Mogelijk is dit te wijten aan het beperkte aantal deelnemers en een zwakke manipulatie van onafhankelijke variabelen.",['Vrijwilligers dilemma']

Moreover, the topic will be placed in a broader context: a literature review on successful European models will be conducted to identify best practices that can be incorporated in San Francisco’s bicycling strategy to further encourage cycling. Possible obstacles that may hinder the application of European models will also be discussed briefly. Currently, San Francisco is mainly focusing on the provision of cycling infrastructure, but neglects the importance of a multi-faceted approach including measures that reduce the attractiveness of car usage, as implemented in successful European models.","['Cycling policy', 'San Francisco', 'Sustainable transport', 'Urban mobility', 'Cycling promotion']"

The research question is therefore: what is the role of religion in the stories of King Arthur and the Arabian Nights? The thesis consists of three parts. First a comparison of the origins of both stories, to see if they are actually similar. The second chapter is a deep-dive into the religious elements in the story of King Arthur and their role they play. This will be done by examining different authors, who added different christian elements depending on their historical context. The final chapter is about the islamic elements in the Arabian Nights and how these elements reflect the society of the time the stories were told. The conclusion is that both stories were created in completely different contexts and also that the role of the religious elements are not as similar as Mann suggested.","['Koning Arthur, Duizend-en-één-Nacht, Christendom, Islam']"

By exploring the factors that have influenced their policy development, such as public opinion, social movements, electoral shifts, major nuclear incidents, and energy security, the thesis seeks to answer the research question: “How did the differences in nuclear energy policy between France and Germany come to be and develop?”. The historical background and path dependencies in both countries are analysed to understand their distinct approaches to nuclear energy. The thesis finds that Germany’s strong anti-nuclear sentiment, influenced by the aftermath of nuclear accidents and its historical legacy, contrasts with France’s lack of politicization and a strong dependence on the nuclear industry. The thesis further highlights the role of public opinion and social movements in shaping policy decisions, as seen in Germany’s policy reversal following the Fukushima disaster. The research concludes that factors such as energy security, public opinion, social movements, electoral shifts, and major nuclear events significantly impact the development of nuclear energy policy. This study provides a basis for future research and offers an addition to the literature in this field which can be used to analyse nuclear energy policies in other countries.",

Andalusian Music: A Story: Traditions and Narratives Throughout a Diaspora,"Faltas, Sophia","['Theunissen, H.P.A.']",2024,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Andalusian music is performed today all over the Mediterranean and beyond. Why? There is not one kind of music that we can characterize as being from al-Andalus. Jewish and Christian peoples had musical traditions before the arrival of the Muslims, who brought along musicians from the East. There was reciprocal influence between traditions, but likely there remained separate identities to a certain extent. From the 15th century, great numbers of Jews, Muslims, or converted people were forced in different installments to leave the Iberian Peninsula. These people brought along elements of their home culture to their new destinations. This forms the basis for most contemporary traditions of Andalusian music. These traditions and their different claims on the identity and purpose of the music, provide telling insights into the narratives on Andalusian music of today. For this reason, I discuss a handful of primary sources, discussing either performances of Andalusian music or ensembles of Andalusian music. Three main narratives emerge, the first being the Islamic Golden Age narrative. It looks back on Al-Andalus as the highpoint of Islamic civilization and culture, and Andalusian music then is instrumentalized as a nostalgic tool and symbol of the ‘ideal’ al-Andalus. The second narrative is that of local heritage. This narrative focusses on the locally cultivated traditions of Andalusian music, that have both a stark regional identity and its own claim to al-Andalus and a certain authenticity. The last main narrative observed is that centered on the European Convivencia ideal, full of nostalgia for a time of peaceful tolerance and collaboration between ‘the three religions’.","['Al-Andalus', 'Andalusian Music', 'Cultural Diaspora', 'Performance Narratives']"

The Legalisation of Cannabis in Thailand,"Lekahena, Isabelle",['I. Hadiprayitno'],2024,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"During the last decades, the legalisation of cannabis has become a hot topic of debate. In countries like the Netherlands, Mexico and Canada, lots of research has been conducted to understand the effects of, and reasoning behind legalisation. Limited research however exists on the legalisation of cannabis in Asia. Recently, Thailand became the first Asian country to delist cannabis from its Narcotics Act and legalise the drug nationwide. The motives behind this decision however had not been clearly examined or understood. Therefore, the objective of this thesis has been to gain a comprehensive understanding as to why the Thai government decided to legalise cannabis in June 2022 by delisting it from the Narcotics Act, despite its historical ‘war on drugs’ and strict penalties for drug users. By making use of a qualitative research approach, secondary sources have been examined to determine which factors were particularly influential in this decision. Based on the conducted research, it can be concluded that the cultural-historical, political and economic environments of Thailand had just been right for the legalisation of cannabis. To clarify, the political gains that candidate Anutin Charnvirakul could achieve by legalising cannabis in Thailand was of high importance. By campaigning for the legalisation, Charnvirakul aimed to gain support from two important societal groups, as it helps to promote his political party for the upcoming elections in May 2023. Additionally, the decision has been driven by economic motives, because the legalisation of cannabis offers Thailand huge economic opportunities, such as attracting lots of tourists, and becoming a strong competitor in the international cannabis market.","['cannabis', 'drug policy', 'Narcotics Act']"

Arab Spring or Islamist Bloom? Islamist Parties and their Popularity after the Arab Uprisings,"Dubben, Lindy","['Warnaar, M.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The first elections after the anti-establishment Arab Spring protests resulted in a victory for Islamist political parties in a number of MENA countries. This came as a surprise to the West, which points of view are known to contradict Islam with the democracy and civil liberties that the Arab Spring protests called for. It comes as no surprise then that Islamist political success is often contributed to the inclusion of these parties in a pluralist and democratic playfield. Allegedly, this forces them to bargain and negotiate with other actors, resulting in the disappearance of Islamist ideological elements and making them viable options for the electorate. This prominent way of thinking - which has been called the moderation through inclusion theory - is much critiqued for being too shortsighted in its view of political Islamism. That is why this thesis argues in favor of an alternative approach that shifts the focus from the outcome of a period of political transition and whether or not this is moderate, to one that emphasizes the processes and internal and external factors that shape the ideological transformations of these parties. By looking at the most prominent Islamist parties of three countries (Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt) and tracing their historical developments and contexts based on these internal and external factors, this thesis then offers an alternative explanation to the popularity of political Islamism in the first elections after the Arab Spring uprisings.","['Islamism', 'Arab Spring', 'Islamist Politics']"

These intricate artworks not only serve as repositories of medical knowledge but also reflect the cultural, religious, and political values of their time. Central to these paintings is the representation of indigenous Tibetan perspectives on spirit-caused illnesses, which focus on the existence of elemental spirits deeply rooted in local beliefs and landscapes. The research aims to investigate the indigenous Tibetan beliefs surrounding spirit causation and illness as depicted in the Blue Beryl paintings, offering a deeper understanding of these often misconstrued spiritual entities. By closely analyzing the iconography within these artworks, the study seeks to unveil the presence and significance of non-Buddhist beliefs and practices within Tibetan psychiatry, shedding light on a less-explored aspect of Tibetan medicine and spirituality.","['Tibet, Tibetan medicine, Ayurveda, Tibetan Art, Religious Art Asia, Tibetan Culture']"

The author looks at this issue from a pronunciation accuracy perspective, by having linguistics students and professionals at Leiden University read out phrases in the three transcription systems and quantifying their struggles in pronouncing the different romanizations. Additionally, a survey has been conducted, which asked participants from 3 Dutch universities to choose a preferred transcription system after listening to a Korean word. Both methods found that McCune-Reischauer was pronounced the most accurately and was most preferred by linguistic students. Yale Romanization was the least accurate and least preferred. The author thus argues that while Yale Romanization certainly has its distinct benefits, it is critically lacking in pronounceability and legibility, and is therefore not suitable for all parts of linguistics in its current state.","['Yale Romanization of Korean', 'linguistics', 'transcription', 'pronunciation', 'Korean language']"

Self-expression in K-Pop choreography: a comparative analysis of the generations,"Rotteveel, Melany","['Choi, W.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores to what extent and how self-expression is portrayed in K-Pop choreography. The theoretical framework takes into account K-Pop idols' professionalism, the influence of modern dance education, and the sociological dynamic combination of “collectivism” and “individualism” as represented in relation to the concepts of “holism” and ilmu. Additionally, an analysis of K-Pop choreography through four generations was performed to reveal a development in the incorporation of self-expressive aspects. The first generation exhibits subtle signs of semiotic use and point choreography. A more defined framework for K-Pop choreography is established in the second generation, which also includes individualistic concepts like the ""domino effect."" The third generation features choreography that utilises sign language and different dance genres, while the fourth generation shows an increase in the showcasing of individuality when taking into account changes made to official choreography. The research therefore shows that the scene of K-Pop choreography is developing in terms of showing self-expression, allowing idols to express their uniqueness while retaining collective harmony.","['K-Pop choreography', 'self-expression', 'semiotics', 'k’algunmu', ""p'oint'ŭ anmu""]"

Zijn er landelijk en regionaal andere normen voor beladen taal? Hoe landelijke en regionale krantenredacties omgaan met stijladviezen voor beladen taal die betrekking hebben op afkomst en huidskleur,"Prent, Rikke",['Jaap de Jong'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In de Nederlandse samenleving komen steeds meer woorden naar voren die tegenwoordig als beladen of pijnlijk worden ervaren, terwijl ze vroeger zonder problemen werden gebruikt. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn de termen 'blank', 'slaaf' en 'allochtoon'. Deze ontwikkeling speelt al geruime tijd en niet iedereen gaat hier op dezelfde manier mee om. In de culturele sector houden bijvoorbeeld steeds meer musea rekening met beladen termen (Tropenmuseum 2020). Maar hoe regionale en landelijke krantenredacties reageren op deze ontwikkeling, is niet eenduidig. Daarom wordt in deze scriptie onderzocht hoe regionale krantenredacties omgaan met stijladviezen voor beladen taal die betrekking hebben op afkomst en huidskleur, in vergelijking met landelijke krantenredacties. Allereerst is er een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse uitgevoerd, waarbij de stijladviezen die de acht kranten van dit onderzoek hanteren voor de woorden ‘blank’, ‘slaaf’ en ‘allochtoon’ zijn geanalyseerd. Daarna zijn er acht semigestructureerde diepte-interviews afgenomen met redacteuren van vier regionale en vier landelijke kranten. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de regionale kranten van dit onderzoek meer stijladviezen hebben voor het gebruik van de woorden 'blank', 'slaaf' en 'allochtoon' dan de landelijke kranten. Bovendien maken de redacties van de regionale kranten meer gebruik van hun stijlgidsen, waarin in twee gevallen ook advies voor inclusieve taal wordt gegeven, in vergelijking met de redacties van de landelijke kranten. Eén landelijke krant gebruikt op dit moment geen stijlgids en twee andere landelijke kranten blijken geen stijladvies op woordniveau te geven. Daarnaast geven alle respondenten van de landelijke kranten aan dat hun krant volgend is als het gaat om het implementeren van beladen taal, terwijl twee respondenten van de regionale kranten aangeven dat hun krant vooruitstrevend is op dit gebied. De meerderheid van de respondenten erkent dat de betekenis van woorden kan veranderen en dat het bewustzijn over dit onderwerp is toegenomen in de samenleving. Echter, het onderwerp 'beladen taal' wordt door veel respondenten als complex ervaren, omdat de ontwikkelingen rondom woorden snel gaan en men het gevoel heeft dat alles onder een vergrootglas ligt. Op basis van deze argumenten kan daarom worden geconcludeerd dat de redacties van regionale kranten in dit onderzoek zich meer bezighouden met stijladviezen voor beladen taal die betrekking hebben op afkomst en huidskleur dan de redacties van landelijke kranten.","['Inclusieve taal, beladen taal, stijladviezen']"

Etnisch inclusief taalgebruik in de modejournalistiek,"Bijman, Isabelle","['de Jong, J.C.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De mode-industrie slaagt er volgens het onderzoek van Atik et al. (2022) niet in om de cultureel diverse wereld van vandaag te omarmen (Atik et al., 2022, 1141). Nederlandse modetijdschriften zijn echter wel verantwoordelijk voor de rol van taal en de invloed ervan op etnische inclusiviteit in de modejournalistiek. Deze scriptie analyseert daarom het taalgebruik in vooraanstaande Nederlandse modetijdschriften Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar en Marie Claire, met specifieke aandacht voor de septembernummers van 2022. Door middel van een contentanalyse en semigestructureerde diepte-interviews richt het onderzoek zich op hoe Nederlandse modejournalisten zeggen om te gaan met etnische inclusiviteit in de beschrijving van modemerken, modeontwerpers en individuen en hoe dit wordt gepresenteerd door middel van taalgebruik in de modetijdschriften. De bevindingen van de contentanalyse tonen aan dat niet iedereen een afkomstaanduiding krijgt in de Nederlandse modetijdschriften. Opvallend is dat in de modetijdschriften een duidelijk patroon zichtbaar is, waarin de nadruk voornamelijk ligt op de afkomstaanduidingen van de niet-westerse modemerken, modeontwerpers en individuen. Dit verschil suggereert dat de modejournalistiek het Westen als norm beschouwt en andere etnische identiteiten als de 'ander' (Hall & Gieben 1992, 93). Ook kan volgens Verkuyten (1999) het toekennen van een bepaalde positie op basis van afkomstaanduidingen leiden tot uitsluiting (Verkuyten 1999, 25). Deze bevindingen worden bevestigd door de vier modejournalisten die in deze scriptie zijn geïnterviewd. Zij stellen dat de modejournalistiek vooral westers georiënteerd is door de grote modemerken en modeontwerpers. Ook komt naar voren dat wanneer bekende mensen worden opgenomen in modetijdschriften dit voornamelijk Nederlanders zijn. De conclusie van het onderzoek luidt dat Nederlandse modejournalisten aangeven zich bewust te zijn van het belang van etnische inclusiviteit bij het beschrijven van modemerken, modeontwerpers en individuen. Desondanks creëert het gebruik van afkomstaanduidingen binnen de modejournalistiek een contrast tussen het Westen en de ‘ander’, wat de etnische inclusiviteit binnen de modejournalistiek belemmert. Dit suggereert dat de modejournalistiek het Westen als norm beschouwt en andere etnische identiteiten als de ‘ander’. Het onderzoek wijst erop dat de etnische inclusiviteit in de modejournalistiek hierdoor niet altijd wordt gewaarborgd en dat de norm in de modejournalistiek westers georiënteerd is.","['Modejournalistiek', 'etnisch inclusief taalgebruik']"

Defending Weimar: Violence and the SPDs and KPDs Reaction to the 1920 Ruhr Uprising,"Machias, Konstantinos",['Patrick Dassen'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The current paper examines the use of political violence during the Ruhr Uprising of 1920. Its main focus is the reaction of the SPD and the KPD to the uprising and its bloody suppression by the Reichswehr and Freikorps. It also contextualises the Uprising and violence that followed by connecting local events in the Ruhr with national developments, such as the Kapp Putsch and international trends of post-war instability and brutality. The paper through its examination of Vorwärts and Die Rote Fahne argues that both the SPD and KPD changed their understanding of the role of violence in preserving or overthrowing the Weimar Republic, respectively. On the one hand, the KPD, weakened by the failures of 1919 did not push for the spread of revolutionary violence. On the other hand, the SPD shifted ideologically from its 1919 of understanding state-sponsored violence as necessary for preserving the integrity of the State. It now understood violence as a tool for protecting the well-being of Germany’s citizenry. A tool to be used sparingly and with restraint, because it needed popular support to be legitimate. This new understanding of state-sponsored violence was not shared by the men tasked with suppressing the Uprising. The result was another bloody chapter in the life of the young Republic","['Weimar', 'Ruhr Uprising', 'Political Violence', 'Freikorps', 'SPD', 'KPD', 'Revolution', 'Germany', 'Bauer', 'Severing', 'interwar', '1920', '1919']"

"Soil, Seeds and Sumud: Art Initiatives and Environmental Colonialism in Palestine","Algera, Oda","['Naeff, J.A.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The occupation of Palestine by Israel is rarely studied from an environmental colonial perspective. Environmental issues, especially with the growing concerns over climate change, are instead discussed in the dualist framework of nature versus society, in which human civilization is separated from the environment. Consequently, the environmental landscape is frequently perceived as ‘natural,’ and therefore: apolitical. In addition, the blame for the effects of climate problems in ex-colonies in the MENA is often put on the mismanagement of local people. In this way, the wider socio-political, cultural, and economic structures embedded in the environment, are overlooked. This thesis argues that in the last decennia art projects in Palestine highlight these often-ignored connections. They counter Israeli environmental colonialism in the West Bank, and show that the deterioration of the Palestinian environment is not an unfortunate byproduct of settler colonialism, but a factor that influences the entire ecology and various aspects of Palestinian life. Through the revival of ecology, (agri)cultural traditions, and communities, the art projects expose Israeli colonial practices that destruct Palestinian ecology. Within a human and ‘more-than-human’ ecology, they revive cultural and communal ties that are constantly threatened by settler colonial erasure. The artists resist these Israeli environmental colonial practices through sumud (‘steadfastness’), shifting away from the earlier symbolic display of landscape in Palestine, toward artistic interventions in the local ecology.","['Sumud, Art, Environmental Colonialism, Ecology, Palestine']"

However, while the struggles of the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force (JGSDF) have been extensively documented in papers and interviews by academics, retired JGSDF and United States Marine Corps (USMC) officers, research on its Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) counterpart has lagged behind. The JMSDF’s amphibious warfare unit, counterintuitively or perhaps fittingly called the Mine Warfare Force (MWF), is only mentioned contextually, and portrayed as an inadequate JMSDF counterpart to the JGSDF’s marines. Yet, the archipelago nation, standing as the greatest obstacle to China's seaward expansion, cannot afford to possess ineffective amphibious forces. Whether it is from the perspective of containing, deterring, or fighting the People's Liberation Army (PLA), for Japan, the ability to quickly deploy and sustain forces on its islands is essential. Why was arguably the most professional Navy in Asia unable to develop an effective amphibious counterpart for Japan's naval infantry? By conducting a comprehensive analysis of Japanese naval literature from official and quasi-official sources, this thesis aims to demonstrate that, contrary to common wisdom, neither Japan's pacifist nature nor a preconceived lack of JMSDF interest in amphibious capabilities shaped this result. Instead, the deeper reasons for this failure must be sought in intra- and inter-organizational politics within the JSDF. To prove this point, the thesis will analyze the MWF's evolution from its inception to the present day, focusing on three transformational moments that occurred in the periods of 2011 to 2013, 2014 to 2017, and 2018 to 2023.","['Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force, Mine Warfare Force, Amphibious Warfare, Inter-service rivalry, Intra-service rivalry, organizational politics']"

This was done by trying to address access to sanitary products and facilities, as well as a non-material threat – the menstrual stigma. Kenya is no exception to this, and in fact, it has been considered at the forefront of menstrual awareness campaigns in the Global South with its ‘free pads for schoolgirls’ policy and menstrual health management agenda. Yet in the context of all that, 2019 was shaken by a girl committing suicide after feeling the shame of leaking in school, and 2023 began with a “scandal” of a Kenyan senator who was sent home for wearing blood-stained pants. These medialized events and many others happening in the private lives of ordinary people highlight that the menstrual stigma is still very present and powerful. For this reason, this research attempted to find out how women in Kenya talk about menstruation in a private, family context in ways that influence the cultural knowledge and understanding of young women, and how these young women engage with this information to reinforce or change perceptions. It was found that there is still considerable silence and stigma surrounding the transmission of period-related knowledge, which reproduces menstrual stigma among young women. Nonetheless, the younger generation is influenced by their own experience, current campaigns, and social media to become more open and approachable parents in the future.","['menstrual stigma, Kenya, mothers and grandmothers, silence, shame, family']"
The Virtuous Massacre: A Practice Account of Atrocities Under the Assad Regime,"Rifai, Ahmad",['Dr. Noa Schonmann'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This study seeks to account for the atrocious violence perpetrated by the Assad regime in response to the Syrian uprising that erupted in 2011. Academic scholarship, media reports, and public opinion tend to understand the state’s violence against its civilians as a resort to exceptional means under exceptional circumstances. This study, in contrast, contends that atrocious violence constitutes a well-established practice, core to this regime’s modus operandi. The study’s objective is to substantiate, illustrate, and critically assess the proposition that atrocious violence perpetrated by the Assad regime is best understood not as a series of incidental exceptional ‘events’ but as a core practice, consisting of a set of sub-practices. The thesis analyzes a selection of primary and secondary sources in answering the research question ‘How to account for the Assad regime’s atrociously violent response to the popular uprising in 2011?’. Primary sources include leaked government documents, legal testimonies, speeches, and memoirs, operationalized with the help of the praxeology research method and a single case-study design. The massacre in Houla in 2012 serves as a primary case study, a narrative anchor from which to assess the strength of the proposition that the regime’s response to the 2011 popular uprising is best understood as the manifestation of a long-standing practice of atrocious state violence sustained by a set of subpractices that effectively make it virtuous across time and space. Specifically, the study identifies the sub-practices of legalizing atrocious violence, narrativizing reality, and consolidating the perpetrator elite.","['Violence, Syria, Practice, Genocide, Assad, Arab Spring']"

By contrast, Colombia’s internal displacement crisis has been handled much more comprehensively through numerous IDP support projects. The present thesis investigates whether these Colombian IDP support projects could also be implemented in Honduras to alleviate the crisis there. Specifically, two such projects were used as case studies, with their applicability to the Honduran context being assessed using Williams and Dzhekova’s (2014) Framework for evaluating transferability and applicability of policy initiatives. The analysis found that while many elements of Colombian IDP support projects are transferable to Honduras, the country faces certain challenges to a larger extent than Colombia, affecting project transferability negatively. These challenges include the comparatively weak institutionalization of indigenous administrations, higher corruption and potential for instability in political institutions, lower levels of education and community strength among IDPs, and fewer skilled staff in local state institutions. This thesis thus recommends adaptation of the project elements affected by these challenges to increase the chances of success for IDP support projects in Honduras.","['Policy transfer', 'forced displacement', 'internally displaced persons', 'Colombia', 'Honduras']"

Automated Influence and Social Agency: The Limitations of Regulatory State Power in Addressing Concerns Beyond Privacy,"Zewen, Claire","['Mokrosinska, D.M.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, Automated Influence, understood as “the use of artificial intelligence to collect, integrate and analyse people’s data, and to deliver targeted interventions based on this analysis, intended to shape their behaviour” (familiarly referred to as ‘algorithms’) has stirred up many debates among the public, as well as within academia (Benn & Lazar 2022, 127). While much of the discussion has focused primarily on issues of privacy in the light of Big Data, this thesis seeks to analyze how Automated Influence impacts the deliberative, discursive, and fundamentally social space on which society depends on, in particular for collective decision-making/politics. I argue that Automated Influence deployed on social media platforms violates people’s fundamental interest in social agency, which is defined as the ability of a person to act and reflect on her own motives all the while taking part in the fundamentally social process of forming, defending, and adapting the reasons according to which she acts. Moreover, it undermines people’s autonomy and social trust, which both serve as preconditions for their exercise social agency. After reviewing contemporary EU regulation seeking to address some of the problematic aspects related to Automated Influence, I explain why there cannot be a purely top-down approach to mitigating the harms emanating from Automated Influence, which results in my conclusion that only through educating people about its potential harms could mitigate the problem in the long run.","['Automated Influence', 'algorithms', 'social media', 'social agency', 'autonomy', 'EU regulation']"

Fact or Fable? A Computational Study on Early Modern Dutch Chronicles and Newspapers,"Wijngaarden, Daphne van","['Verhaar, P.A.F.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis delves into the early modern Dutch and Flemish chroniclers' perceptions and the trust or distrust of newspapers, particularly focusing on the emergence of newspapers in 1618 and their evolving role in chronicles over time. This study uses computational methods, in which a macro-level analysis of a corpus of 275 early modern Dutch chronicles and a micro-level case study are combined. The research aims to explore how these chroniclers incorporated newspapers into their accounts, shedding light on their trust or distrust in this new medium. The study shows that chroniclers used newspapers as sources in their works, indicating a level of faith in the newspaper's content. The analysis of the full corpus supports previous findings on prevalent themes, source utilization, and the integration of newspapers into society. It appears that newspaper integration began in the second part of the seventeenth century and peaked in the eighteenth century. This corresponds to the increasing popularity of newspapers at the time. Notably, the chroniclers' mentions of newspapers remained consistent in frequency, indicating that newspapers held a similar level of importance despite changes in their content. The research emphasises the importance of chronicles as historical sources for understanding early modern news consumption and views. Given the obstacles faced by historic languages and imperfect transcriptions, it also emphasises the importance of close reading alongside computational tools. In conclusion, this research contributes to the understanding of early modern newspaper reception, emphasizing the trust chroniclers placed in newspapers while acknowledging occasional expressions of doubt. It also provides insights into the limitations and possibilities of computational methods in historical research, emphasizing the remaining importance of close reading.",

Aan de hand van semigestructureerde diepte-interviews met tien Nederlandse onderzoeksjournalisten is onderzocht hoe zij de dreiging van overheidssurveillance ervaren en op welke manier dit de omgang met vertrouwelijke bronnen beïnvloedt. Waar in theorie bij journalisten en bronnen een chilling effect kan optreden, is daar in dit onderzoek geen bewijs voor gevonden. Wel blijkt uit de gesprekken dat bewustzijn over de mogelijke gevaren, invloed heeft op de manier van communiceren en het gebruik van informatiebeveiligingstechnologie. De conclusies uit dit onderzoek zijn toepasbaar op onderzoeksjournalisten die ervaring hebben met thema’s als nationale veiligheid, politie, justitie, inlichtingendiensten en (georganiseerde) criminaliteit. In hoeverre de bevindingen ook opgaan voor de Nederlandse journalistiek in het algemeen, zal toekomstig onderzoek moeten uitwijzen.","['Onderzoeksjournalistiek', 'Overheidssurveillance', 'Vertrouwelijke bronnen']"
‘Er knapte iets’: Een onderzoek naar de framing van femicide in het Leidsch dagblad tijdens de periode 1990-2022,"Mars, Chiara",['Dr. J. P. Burger'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Femicide staat volop in de mediabelangstelling. Steeds meer kranten besteden aandacht aan de problematiek rondom vrouwenmoord. Toch is het aankaarten van femicide als probleem pas een zeer recente ontwikkeling. Voordien werden zaken waarin een vrouwelijk slachtoffer door haar (ex-)partner werd vermoord zelden binnen dit frame geplaatst. Om te kijken of dit ook opgaat voor de berichtgeving in het Leidsch Dagblad, is er middels deze scriptie onderzocht welke frames in het Leidsch Dagblad voorkomen tijdens een periode van dertig jaar (1990-2022). Deze periodisering maakte het daarnaast mogelijk de veranderingen in de berichtgeving over het onderwerp in kaart te brengen. Op basis van een kwalitatieve framinganalayse van 64 artikelen uit het Leidsch Dagblad werden er drie overheersende frames gevonden: het blaming-the-victim-frame, het geëxcuseerde-dader-frame en het ‘moord is een relationeel drama’-frame. Aan de hand van de framinganalyse van Van Gorp, zijn deze frames vervolgens onderverdeeld in reasoning devices en framing devices. Hierdoor konden enerzijds de oorzaken van de frames achterhaald worden, als ook de tekstuele elementen in kaart worden gebracht. Hoewel vooral het blaming-the-victim-frame in de tweede helft van de onderzochte jaren minder hardnekkig bleek dan verwacht, was er geen kritisch frame die deze leegte opvulde. Mogelijke verklaringen voor dit gegeven zijn het brongebruik van journalisten en de nieuwswaarde van deze specifieke categorie van misdaadnieuws. Omdat er nauwelijks onderzoek gedaan is naar het onderwerp binnen de Nederlandse context, loont vervolgonderzoek naar femicide. Dit onderzoek kan vervolgens uitwijzen of de conclusies ook opgaan voor andere titels in het Hollandse medialandschap.","['Femicide, Media, Framing']"

From the early fifties onwards, the neighborhood now known as the Gay Village has been the home of many establishments wherein community was built. The contribution to the liberation of rights for the LGBTQIA+ Britain’s by Manchester’s LGBTQIA+ community have been immense. After many years of great success, the number of gayborhood establishments in Manchester are now declining. This trend can be identified in gayborhoods in and around the Global North. Gentrification and the hybridization of physical space can be held responsible for this disappearance of gayborhoods and LGBTQIA+ safe spaces. The shift in demand for the type of safe space can be attributed to digitalization and technological advancements paired with the growing need for intersectional discourse.","['Gay Village', 'Manchester', 'Safe Space', 'Gentrification', 'Hybrid Space']"

Fairly recently, intelligence-led crime mitigation strategies have gained popularity, however this was not without heavy critique. This thesis tries to add to the debate on proactive intelligence-led policing by first analyzing the come about of this strategy, thereafter the practice itself will be investigated accompanied by the concerns that are related to the subject. Subsequently, the framework proposed by Jacobs will be explained and utilized to assess the effectiveness of proactive intelligence-led policing in three different European cities (Amsterdam, London & Athens). The thesis will conclude with some final remarks on proactive policing and brief (tailored) policy advice to improve the effectiveness of proactive intelligence-led policing within these cities.","['Predictive policing', 'Intelligence-led policing']"

This thesis endeavoured to research a number of pioneering technological implementations in three different cities - all pioneers in certain technological implementations. Developments are evolving quickly and everyone is now familiar with smart technologies, for example: Smart lighting, advanced waste management or decongestion of traffic junctions. The focus of this thesis is to investigate the process of these pioneering technical implementations. The question this thesis answered was: how were certain decisions made? Why were they made and what were their consequences? In order for this to be done in a structural way, the Social Construction Of Technology (SCOT) theory was used.. This is a theory that advocates a broad interpretation of technology and focuses primarily on cultural and sociological aspects. The implementations of technologies on CCTV in London, predictive policing software in Milan and the application of smart lighting in Eindhoven were all separately examined in this thesis. This involved examining the key drivers for the implementation of these technologies and their impact on visitors and residents of these three different cities. The results of this thesis display the idea that technologies are mainly implemented due to availability and political factors. However, the addition of safety-promoting technologies are not always beneficial to the visitors and residents of the respective cities, as the technologies are not always able to meet ethical standards when it comes to privacy and equality.","['Safe City', 'Technological Implementation', 'London', 'Milan', 'Eindhoven', 'Smart City']"

It aims to answer the question of what the sexual assault landscapes in three of the safest cities of the Western world look like, and what policies or approaches from these cities there are that can be used to improve the situations in other cities. The three cities used for the case studies of this thesis are Stockholm, Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Through analyzing existing data and literature an image of the sexual assault landscapes will be sketched. These sexual assault landscapes will be analyzed to provide advice of potential policies or approaches that might help reduce the problem of sexual assault elsewhere in the world. The aspects of opportunity, accessibility and anonymity will be evaluated throughout all three chapters and the conclusion. The analysis of this thesis concluded that the combined sexual assault areas of Stockholm, Amsterdam and Copenhagen are, in brief, poorly lit or dark areas that are situated outside of the public eye and are very often affected by alcohol distribution points. Night life and public transport areas are therefore some of the main risk areas for sexual assault. This risk can be decreased by implementing better street lights and creating more visible and open spaces which promotes natural surveillance. Some more specific policies based on the three case studies have also been discovered.","['Outdoor sexual assault', 'Stockholm', 'Amsterdam', 'Copenhagen: sexual assault landscapes', 'safe cities']"

The study was conducted using a qualitative and observational research design and data was collected through a questionnaire composed of multiple-choice and open questions. The research suggested that environments that include sensory design interventions, such as the TU Delft campus library, the botanical garden and Pulse, positively impacted the students’ mental health and well-being. Furthermore, several themes were discovered that played a big role in the sensory experience of the participants. These themes were availability, comfort, aesthetics, noise levels and light. The results provide insights for urban planners to implement sensory urbanism on other campuses and decrease mental health problems among students in Dutch cities. The study highlights the importance of considering sensory urban design interventions in urban planning to improve the mental health and well-being of city residents.","['Sensory Urbanism', 'Mental Health', 'Well-being']"

The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to reshape the tourism industry in a more sustainable manner, but visitor numbers are gradually returning to pre-pandemic levels, which surpasses Amsterdam’s carrying capacity. The city applies different strategies to improve quality of life in the city, but the role of smart city has been poorly explored in relation to sustainable tourism. Meanwhile, technology-based solutions in combination with active stakeholder participation are argued by the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO 2018, 5) to be the most effective approach to tackling overtourism. It is known that Amsterdam suffers from overtourism significantly, because excess negative impacts from tourism causes issues for the city, causing nuisance and decreases the quality of life of local residents. Moreover, no theoretical framework on smart city has been applied to specifically target overtourism within the city of Amsterdam, which makes it a goal of this thesis to analyse the current policies in the city and apply the alternative smart city lens as well as to structure the guiding framework specifically to deal with overtourism, which can further be used by policy-makers and scholars.","['Smart City', 'Overtourism', 'Critical Discourse Analysis.']"
The Hague's Mobility Transition: A Mobility Justice Perspective on Urban Policy,"Müller, Pauline","['Caredda, A.M.C.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether the sustainable mobility transition in The Hague, The Netherlands is fair by analyzing the transition from a mobility justice perspective. Sustainable mobility systems are being implemented in cities all over the world, and it is essential to ensure that these transitions are just, amending existing injustices and preventing future ones. Utilizing deductive content analysis, five key policy documents from The Hague’s municipality were examined on mobility justice considerations. The theoretical framework combined five nested approaches constituting mobility justice (distributive justice, justice as recognition, procedural justice, restorative justice, and epistemic justice). The analysis revealed a high prevalence of distributive justice in the documents, alongside the generalization of residents by the municipality hindering the realization of justice as recognition and a knowledge production focused on technological advancements limiting epistemic justice considerations. Furthermore, the results allowed for further insights into the interlinkage between the five-justice dimensions, highlighting their inherent reliance on one another to realize mobility justice, with justice as recognition playing a central role and epistemic justice constituting the scope of the mobility transition discourse.","['mobility transition', 'mobility justice', 'sustainable mobility', 'urban policy', 'content analysis']"
The Effect of Tree Cover on Perceived Safety in Neighbourhoods of The Hague,"Ruijter, Matthew de",['Si Yali'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Many cities are opting to implement urban nature into their cities with the ambition of becoming more sustainable. The implementation of urban nature into urban design comes with many benefits, such as improving air quality, improve water quality, and reducing the urban heat island effect. However, it is unclear whether the implementation of urban nature affects the sense of safety for individuals in the city. Some studies argue that increased urban nature reduces the sense of safety, while other studies argue that it increases the sense of safety. Urban planners must understand how urban nature may influence the perceived safety of their city. This study is based on a previous study done in Oslo that investigated how urban tree cover affects the perceived safety of individuals in Oslo. The same study suggested that future studies should focus on other European cities. Following this previous research, the paper aims to investigate whether the presence of tree cover affects the perceived safety of neighbourhoods in The Hague. The paper uses secondary data collected by governmental agencies to determine whether there is a correlation between tree cover and perceived safety in The Hague. The results show that there is a moderate correlation between tree cover and perceived safety, also after controlling for confounding variables such as social cohesion and neighbourhood deprivation index.","['Tree Cover', 'Perceived Safety', 'Sense of Safety', 'Dense vegetation', 'Eyes on the street']"

The aim of this research was to answer the following question: “Is housing-related stress associated with more severe mental illness symptoms among higher-education students in the Netherlands?” The concept of housing-related stress included both housing insecurity and housing deprivation. The research question was answered through quantitative research among the population of interest. The findings of this research do not suggest a relationship housing-related stress and severity of mental illness symptoms. However, as discussed in this paper, this could be due to a number of contextual factors. The factors that could potentially play a role in the relationship between the variables range from cultural to more organisational aspects.

Reflecting on the urban planning practices, it becomes evident that Rotterdammers’ grew their appreciation and awareness of historical value. Findings show, that historical city identity has the potential to foster a sense of belonging, connectedness, familiarity, and continuity and through that alter Rotterdammers’ sense of place.

"Moving Memories Set in Stone: The Construction, Contestation, and Transformation of the Columbus Circle Monument in New York as a Dynamic Site of Memory.","Warnar, Evelien",['Alistair Kefford'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Although their immobility in spatial and temporal context, monuments are far from being passive observers. Monuments play an active role in shaping the narrative of their surroundings through their visual presence and symbolic significance. They contribute to an understanding of the world, evoke emotions and ignite discussions about history, identity, and values. In some cases, monuments themselves become subjects of debate and controversy. This thesis explores the symbolism and meaning of the Columbus Circle monument in New York as a 'site of memory’, across the lifespan of the monument. In recent years, the Columbus Circle monument in New York City has become a focal point of intense scrutiny and discussion. As the perception of the famous Christopher Columbus has shifted over time, certain groups find that the monument should be removed, recontextualized or replaced. The case serves as a reminder that monuments are not static containers of the past as they are influenced by ongoing processes that shape them as sites of memory. This thesis will examine the meaning and symbolism of the monument over its lifetime thorough a careful analysis of archival material on the monument, which provides valuable insights into the way people engage with the monument, and into opinions and meanings that shaped its significance. Utilizing the theoretical frameworks of collective memory and sites of memory, this study seeks to uncover meaningful connections, patterns, and interpretations that address the research question. This thesis will conclude that the Columbus Circle monument in New York has undergone a complex evolution in its symbolism and meaning, explained into three discernible phases: the process of construction, the dynamics of contestation, and the transformative nature of its meaning and symbolism. Finally this thesis will contemplate about monumentality and its implications, as societies change and statues no longer represent a current consensus.","['Monuments, Memory, Sites of Memory, Collective Memory, Cultural Identity.']"

Bihać, a small city in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, has since 2018 become an important node on the so-called “Balkan Route.” The route is traversed by many people from the Global South seeking to migrate to Western Europe. Importantly, Bihać lies some mere 5 km from the Croatian border, making the city an ideal place for PoM to plan their way forward on the route, or rest after an illegal pushback at the border. Often, people in transit irregularly reside in abandoned buildings. Many of such occupied buildings, also known as squats, have been evicted by local Migration Managers repeatedly over the past five years. Yet, despite the evictions, PoM would often come back from the camps where they had been deported, and re-occupy the squats in Bihać. These cycles of evictions and (re)occupations are framed in this thesis as contestations of urban space. Such space contestations, recounted using relational ethnography, are then given further theoretical grounding through the bi-focal lens of biopolitics and resistance. In light of these theoretical elaborations, camps in the area of Bihać are speculatively characterized as biopolitical technologies of control, dispersal, and governance of migrant lives and mobility. In contrast, squats are understood as cases of resistance against the border regime, by virtue of their role as Infrastructures of border crossing.","['Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'contested urban space', 'People-on-the-Move', 'biopolitics', 'resistance', 'relational ethnography']"

Limitations on violence: Private Military & Security Companies in the vanguard of a Pelagian Just War Tradition,"Beek, Pieter van","['Gerrits, A.W.M.', 'Milevski, L.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Abstract For the majority of its history, the Just War Tradition (JWT) has attempted to limit the occurrence of violence in the violent world it found itself. Today, out of noble causes, the same tradition is becoming more interventionist by incentivizing the market for force in which Private Military and Security Companies have carved out a role for themselves. In this thesis the origin of the normalization of private violence in JWT will be accounted for and how it allows for more violence, rather than limiting it. These so-called PMSCs will be analyzed in two ways. The theological origin of arguments permitting their usage will be accounted for before analyzing the risks that comes with this. The latter part will be the main focus and is done by following the principles laid out by Aquino: 1) legitimate authority, 2) just cause, and 3) right intention. By looking at the state of the art of PMSC ethics, the debates in contemporary JWT will be accused of being disagreements in details, and not concerned with the theological foundations of their convictions. Namely, by accounting for the privatized turn JWT took, I will show how a cosmopolitan politics is causing this relaxing of norms and is at risk of being permissible to increases of violence. This originated in Pelagian theology who argued for the possibility of human perfection through social and moral progress. Kantian liberalism, the modern equivalent of this belief, has prioritized just cause over other principles and moves the JWT away from one of its core functions; namely, limiting the destructiveness of war. The other core function is to limit injustices, which has devolved into the attempt to eradicate all injustices and overturns ethical positions on private violence.",

Inequity in Dutch cities: Perceived green space accessibility and its alternatives,"Volleberg, Eline",['Pam ten Broeke'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study examines the accessibility to urban green space in Dutch cities, with a specific focus on the differences between socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Additionally, it identifies a knowledge gap on alternatives to urban green space and therefore explores potential alternatives to traditional urban green spaces for cities facing limitations in expanding their green spaces. The research was conducted through a questionnaire survey among residents of Utrecht, The Hague, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam. The main research question addressed in this study is: ""What facilities could Dutch cities offer in place of urban green spaces, and who should these cater to?"". The findings of the study indicate a positive relationship between SES and perceived accessibility to urban green space. Higher SES groups reported higher levels of perceived accessibility to green spaces, while lower SES groups faced greater challenges in accessing these areas. Regarding potential alternatives to urban green spaces, the study identifies various facilities that can be considered by Dutch cities facing spatial limitations. These alternatives should aim to provide similar benefits and experiences to traditional green spaces. This study underscores two key implications. Firstly, it highlights the need to address socioeconomic disparities in urban green space. Secondly, it emphasizes the importance of exploring and implementing alternative facilities in cities facing limitations in expanding traditional green spaces.","['Green space, inequity, perceived accessibility']"

BLACK FEMINIST PRACTICES OF COMMUNITY BUILDING AS A RECLAMATION OF THE RIGHT TO NEW ORLEANS POST-KATRINA,"Blumenbach, Elena",['Georgios Tsagdis'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to examine how women in African American communities in the United States form alternative networks of care and use practices of homemaking when that kind of care and protection is not offered by the state in the aftermath of disaster. Practices of homemaking have been used by African American women as spaces of recuperation and political resistance from slavery to the civil rights movement to post-Katrina New Orleans. Furthermore, I ask how this community building creates urban belonging and a right to the city, revolutionizing Lefebvre’s right to the city. The question is how community building functions as a reclamation of New Orleans, a city drowned and transformed, and how the right to return and the right to neighborhood and community plays into that. I thus aim to deepen the understanding of how existing kinship structures in post-disaster communities impact the process of returning to New Orleans, recovering from the storm and rebuilding in its aftermath, when institutional frameworks are lacking.","['Feminist cities, Community Building, Right to the City, United States,Disaster Research']"

Renewable Energy Development: African State Agency and Chinese Investment: African states at the crossroads of strategy and foreign influence,"Zand, Sjoerd van 't","['Links, S.', 'Tan, Y.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research is concerned with determining the extent of state agency of sub-Saharan African states, in the matter of Chinese non-/quasi-state investment in Africa’s renewable energy development. The possibilities in Africa for renewable energy development are numerous and undoubtedly crucial for sustainable economic development in the years to come. Taking state agency as a dependent variable in this research, several independent variables emanate from existing literature on this topic. These include the types of engagement between Chinese and African actors, the organization and structures of funding for projects and development, national frameworks, and paradiplomacy. Scholarship on this topic provides that on China’s behalf, most types of engagement such as direct private investment and transnational organizations are usually shaped to benefit China, which might undermine mutual advantages. Yet, China, with a technological advantage compared to sub-Saharan Africa and with its role as the main creditor, it is not deemed conspicuous in that regard for China to have a slight upper hand and leave less agency for sub-Saharan countries. The issue of orchestration also strains state agency as bottom-up movements are supported and mostly operate independently. When examining the types of engagement, it appears that sub-Saharan states still hold many autonomous decision-making capabilities, because most cooperation is deliberate or a result of thorough consideration and negotiation. In the case of orchestration, state agency is largely dependent on the groups international organizations target and to which end. These could include, for example, slow pace of energy transitions or lack of governmental attention. In the case of funding, most flows through development banks, which remain focused on advisory roles and asset management. These tend to distance themselves from project development and management. Cases vary across the region, however, as in Uganda state agency is shaped strategically. This results in sustainable regulation, swift development, and less need for strict state control of assets.",

The Birth of “the Forgotten” Society: The Emergence of Indigenous Organisation in Formal Politics following the 2015 “La Linea” Corruption Scandal in Guatemala,"Gool, Rosalie van","['Sheppard, R.C.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In April of 2015 Guatemala was hit by a severe political crisis. The discovery of a network of illicit payments made to government officials in exchange for reduced customs duties on imported goods led to massive social uprising in the country. The event has been referred to as the“La Línea scandal” (The Line), the name of the custom fraud ring. This scandal became the final straw in a country that has always struggled with social unrest and corruption. Citizens began to rise up. Protests, marches and strikes broke out on the streets of Guatemala City and several other provincial capitals. Universities, schools, shops and companies joined the protests.1 The social uprising following the scandal can be described as the largest social movement since the civil war.2 Some authors view the social uprising as “the emergence of civil society”, since protestors largely belonged to the country’s professionals and among those who influence public opinion.3 Four years later, in 2019, indigenous activist Thelma Cabrera of the newly established party “Movimiento para la Liberación de los Pueblos” (MLP) became the most successful indigenous presidential candidate in Guatemalan history. Attaining 10% of the votes, Cabrera tripled the amount of second most successful indigenous candidate. In a country where roughly half its citizens identify as indigenous, indigenous representation within formal politics has been minimal. This thesis explores the relationship between the 2015 La Línea scandal and sudden rise of indigenous politics in Guatemala, as proven by the success of the MLP in 2019. The question that this thesis seeks to answer is: What explains the relative success of indigenous politics in Guatemala after the 2015 la línea corruption scandal? In Chapter 1, I will provide a literature review that examines the two schools of thought in indigenous politics that explain the success of indigenous party formation: the institutionalist approach and the ethno-populist approach. The work of multiple academics will be discussed and compared, to contextualise the diverging ideas that are present in pre-existing literature surrounding the topics in this thesis. I argue that neither of these two schools are applicable in the Guatemalan case. Contrastingly, I provide literature on the theory of “triggering” events, which I will prove to be relevant in indigenous politics in Guatemala. Chapter 2 provides a framework of the historical context that led up to the La Línea scandal in 2015. It starts with a description of the 36-year civil war that lasted between 1960-1996, and the period of democratic return and the peace process. Then, it examines expansion of indigenous rights that were implemented as part of the peace agreements. Contrastingly, I argue that the formal implementation of these documents did not lead to substantial change for indigenous peoples in Guatemala, by demonstrating that violence and corruption scandals result in the continued marginalisation of indigenous groups. Furthermore, I examine the two previously established indigenous political parties URNG and Winaq and their failure of becoming an integrated part of the political landscape. In Chapter 3, I highlight the continuous corruption scandals and impunity of the Guatemalan state and state officials. Furthermore, I focus on the establishment of the CICIG and its involvement in the uncovering of the 2015 La Línea corruption scandal. It continues with a broad summary of the 2015 La Línea corruption scandal, after which I will elaborate on the CODECA, MLP and Thelma Cabrera. Then, the chapter looks at the 2019 elections. In conclusion, I argue that the 2015 La Línea corruption scandal and the sequential success of indigenous political party formation in Guatemala can be explained through a lens of “triggering events” theory.","['Guatemala', 'indigenous peoples', 'La linea', 'Thelma Cabrera']"

While Agroecology began as an international movement countering industrial agriculture, the term is increasingly being used by diverse actors. This thesis critically examines the increased popularity of agroecology in Senegal, which has been proclaimed the leader of agroecological transition in West Africa since 2015 by the FAO. This research found that while the NGOs stay true to the ‘transformative’ interpretation of agroecology, they tend to create indispensable positions for themselves by becoming the ‘middlemen’ between international donors and farmers. The NGOs’ upward accountability and focus on small projects can unintendedly limit the autonomy of the farmer and the potential of agroecology as a countermovement. In addition, the government has co-opted agroecology by publicly claiming to support agroecology, while its actual policies are focused on monocultures, large agribusinesses and productivity.","['Agroecology', 'Senegal', 'NGO interventionism', 'food sovereignty', 'sustainable farming']"
Freedom to Change or Not to Change: Anti-Conversion Laws in India and Their Interaction with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"Lobenstein, Job van","['Blezer, H.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper explores the interaction of anti-conversion laws in Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Haryana, and Karnataka in India with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. NGOs like Open Doors are concerned about possible violations of human rights by these anti-conversion laws. By utilising primary sources such as the written anti-conversion laws and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and examining them through different perspectives provided by secondary sources, this study demonstrates that anti-conversion laws in India both directly and indirectly comply with and violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, depending on the perspective taken. As this paper has established, adopting Western perspectives on human rights reveals the majority of violations against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, alternative viewpoints can also unveil instances where anti-conversion laws align with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.","['Religion', 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', 'Anti-conversion laws', 'India', 'Freedom of Religion', 'Hindutva']"

Unveiling Perspectives on Urban Vineyard Ecosystem Services in Vienna: A Q-Methodology Approach,"Swaving, Erland","['Remme, R.P.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research explores the divergent perspectives of winemakers and residents regarding the ecosystem services provided by vineyards in Vienna, employing the Q-methodology to encapsulate the full scope of these subjective viewpoints. The study illuminates how these stakeholder groups value the vineyards' contribution to provisioning, regulating, and cultural services, as categorized under the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES). Winemakers predominantly perceive vineyards as an integral part of their livelihood, with emphasis on provisioning services, while acknowledging their cultural importance and acknowledging their role in supporting local biodiversity. In contrast, residents recognize the cultural and regulating services of the vineyards, appreciating their aesthetic contribution to Vienna's landscape, their role in climate regulation, and their value for recreational activities, with less emphasis on provisioning services. By revealing the divergences and intersections in these perspectives, the study provides valuable insights for policy formulation and sustainable management of urban agroecosystems.","['Q-methodology', 'Ecosystem Services', 'Vineyards', 'Landscape Perspectives', 'Agroecosystems']"

The case study in Minahasa, Indonesia, where the local belief mapulus has been institutionalized into mapulus kamtibmas in order to maintain security and order, is studied in this thesis to help provide an answer. The purpose of mapulus kamtibmas is to provide a forum for communication amongst different social groups with the intention of resolving conflict via conversation. The findings demonstrate that because mapulus is only deeply embedded in the lives of Minahasan people, the mapulus kamtibmas model cannot be copied and pasted to resolve interreligious conflict outside of Minahasa. As a result, if it is founded on a shared interest that is deeply embedded in the lives of all parties involved in the conflict, a similar model can be developed in other settings. From an everyday peace perspective, this thesis emphasizes the necessity to investigate the lives of the locals in order to create religious co-existence.","['Local beliefs', 'Embeddedness', 'Mapulus', 'Mapulus kamtibmas', 'Minahasa', 'Indonesia', 'Interreligious conflict', 'Everyday peace', 'Conflict resolution']"

Crisis as Opportunity? An Analysis of the Degrowth Discourse in American News Media before and during COVID-19,"Darge, Lars Jonas","['Baarssen, G.H.J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The world changed rapidly when the Covid-19 virus spread around the globe in early 2020. This led many proponents of degrowth, a post-capitalist ideology that wants to prioritize human and planetary wellbeing over economic growth, to believe that the pandemic had opened a window of opportunity to fundamentally transform economies and societies to align with planetary boundaries. In 2023, it is conspicuous that the eco-socialist revolution has not (yet) arrived. This does, however, not mean that the pandemic did not have any effect on attitudes towards degrowth. This thesis examines the prevalence of degrowth as well as the tone and attitudes towards degrowth in the public discourse in the US, based on online articles published between 2017 and 2023 in American news media and finds an increase in coverage, particularly after mid-2022, in which the pandemic likely played a role. After the outbreak, prestigious outlets started writing about degrowth, but overall coverage remained limited. Outlets on the political left were found to be more receptive to the idea. The coverage of the US version of The Guardian stood out due to its high volume of positive articles about degrowth, particularly after the outbreak. The few outlets on the political right that wrote about the topic took a negative tone towards the idea and described it as dangerous.","['Degrowth', 'Crisis', 'Covid-19', 'Media Studies', 'United States']"
Negotiating Arms Control: The Role of US Intelligence in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks,"Allami, Ammar","['Shaev, B.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Many aspects surrounding the history of US intelligence agencies during the Cold War have been explored such as the espionage and counter-espionage operations against the Soviet Union as well as the secret operations that were conducted to influence the political environments of various countries around the world. However, not enough attention has been paid to the successful attempts at nuclear arms control such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), which is an essential part of Cold War history. Therefore, this thesis examines the role of US intelligence in the SALT I negotiations using a case study analysis. It explores the function, effectiveness and impact of US intelligence during the negotiation process as well as the way in which early technological developments in imagery intelligence expanded US intelligence agencies, making them central to future nuclear arms control efforts. This thesis utilizes primary sources published by the US Government, the digital archives from its intelligence agencies as well as academic secondary sources to present a detailed analysis of the role of US intelligence in the SALT I negotiations. In doing so, this thesis argues that US intelligence had a significant role in the negotiations of SALT I, impacting both the negotiation process as well as its outcome. This rests on the following findings. First, technological developments in the 19th and 20th century led to vastly improved imagery intelligence which allowed for nuclear arms control to become a realistic option due to new ways of monitoring agreements. Second, US intelligence had an important function in providing intelligence estimates of Soviet nuclear capabilities during the time of the negotiations. Third, US intelligence overcame several political and technical challenges and was effective in performing its task. Finally, this effectiveness led to the SALT I agreements relying on intelligence agencies to monitor and verify compliance.","['Cold War, intelligence, nuclear arms control, SALT, United States, Soviet Union']"

Adaptation and Resilience: Organized Crime in Mexico During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Haugen, Kamilla","['Cardozo de Souza, A. P.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Organized crime has remained an incredibly persistent problem in Mexico in the last decades consequently causing severe levels of violence, insecurity, and corruption in the country. Historically, Mexican organized crime groups have demonstrated strong resilience and overcome various challenges posed by the Mexican and American governments. However, it is not clear how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted organized crime in Mexico. This thesis wishes to explore this by studying the changes in organized crime activity in Mexico before and during the pandemic. Based on the crime rates, it was observed that some organized crime-related activities decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, while others remained stable. These results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent regulations have had a slight, but insignificant impact on organized crime in Mexico. This strongly indicate that Mexican organized crime groups’ have the ability to show great resilience in the face of major disruptions to the social environment. This finding highlights the need for more detailed research on what mechanisms enable organized crime to remain afloat. An understanding of these mechanisms is of great significance to policymakers attempting to limit the harm of organized crime.","['Organized Crime', 'Mexico', 'COVID-19', 'Pandemic', 'Criminal Activity', 'Crime Trends']"

A 2021 report published by the International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC) investigated the national drug policies of 30 countries and ranked Brazil in last place in relation to the compatibility of its drug policies with UN recommendations. Drawing upon the arguments of scholars involved within the academic debate surrounding the “War on Drugs,” this thesis addresses the ideological motivations behind Bolsonaro’s drug policy through an analysis of semi-structured interviews carried out with four Brazilian drug policy experts. Ultimately, the conclusions of this research are that the hard line drug policies of the Jair Bolsonaro government were motivated by a desire to maintain a system of control and domination over racial minorities. Additionally, the adoption of policies to legally and economically strengthen the drug rehabilitation institutions run by Bolsonaro’s evangelical allies can be understood as a political ploy to increase the societal influence and power of his supporters.","['Bolsonaro', 'Drug Policy', 'Ideology', 'Therapeutic Communities', 'Racism']"

Episodic Framing of Indigenous Protest: An Analysis of the Othering of the Minga’s Involvement in Colombia’s Paro Nacional of 2021,"Tamara Lozano, Maria","['Donner, N.R.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Indigenous Peoples have been historically Othered in society but also through the use of the media. This phenomenon is based on historic asymmetries of power that are still present in the modern day. One contemporary example of this is that of the participation of Indigenous Peoples in Colombia, in particular the Minga, during the protests in 2021 known as the Paro Nacional. Though this period had a wide participation of vast groups of society protesting (students, feminist groups, workers unions, and other marginalised groups), the way the Minga was covered in the media was distinct in highlighting the danger they posed compared to these other groups. Thus, this research focuses on answering why were the Indigenous grouping (the Minga) portrayed as dangerous when they protested in the Paro Nacional of 2021? The central argument proposed is that this is due to the media’s power alongside the government in wanting to maintain the colonial subjectivities of Indigenous people that were posing a threat to social order during these unusually disruptive protests. To do so the research uses a multidisciplinary methodology of historical primary source analysis and frame analysis, from the cultural studies discipline, to shed light on the Othering narratives present in the chosen sources in the Colombian media during the Paro Nacional of 2021. This research not only proves important for the local Colombian context but is also relevant globally as the Othering of minorities through the media can limit the effectiveness of social justice anywhere.","['Minga', 'Othering', 'Framing', 'Paro Nacional', 'Indigenous Peoples', 'Colombia']"

How Language Policies Shape the Transitional Justice Debate: The Case of Mapudungun,"Berger, Anna-Lena",['N.A. Rivera-Vera'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Many Latin American countries have faced dictatorships in the second half of the twentieth century. In Chile, the human rights violations that were committed during the dictatorship under General Augusto Pinochet still profoundly impact modern society. The question of how to address these violations has created a situation in which transitional justice gained relevance since the end of the dictatorship. However, traditional conceptualisations of transitional justice have overly focused on judicial dimensions and thereby disregarded other dimensions that are equally as relevant in the transition to a stable democracy. These dimensions include conceptualisations of cultural and linguistic rights that were popularised in the last two decades. This thesis explores the opportunities that an inclusion of effective language policies grounded in the idea of language rights provides to advance transitional justice. This link is investigated through the case of Mapudungun. The findings from this research suggest that the successful implementation of language policies addresses different dimensions of transitional justice and should therefore be included in transitional justice policies, thus aiding the process. The findings from the Chilean case can be beneficial in other transitional contexts in which the inclusion of cultural and linguistic dimensions could contribute to advance transitional justice.","['transitional justice', 'language rights', 'Chile', 'Mapudungun']"

A Nuclear Powerplay: An Analysis of North Korea’s Intimidation Strategy against the International Community,"Chapelon, Amélie","['Yang, S.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons is increasingly worrying the international community, a worry that has only escalated in the present as the threat becomes more and more legitimate. The international community attempts to pacify North Korea to avoid the repercussions of a North Korean nuclear weapons launch using large and diverse amounts of aid in exchange for the demise of the North Korean nuclear program. This thesis explores the effectiveness of North Korea’s intimidation strategy against the international community through the lens of previous agreements, treaties, and aid given to North Korea by the United States, China, and South Korea. The findings identify a repeating pattern within the case studies concerning North Korea’s lack of commitment: it will agree to treaties to receive aid but will not sacrifice its nuclear weapons. Simply put, all aid agreements hoping for the dismantlement of the North Korean nuclear program will not achieve their goal of North Korean denuclearization. The strategy employed by North Korea can be deemed effective based on three unique criteria: advantage gain, recurrence, and diversification of aid. However, the strategy is only effective in the short term as aid can be rescinded as soon as an agreement is broken. More research is needed on the longevity of the strategy and how long it can continue to benefit North Korea.","['Nuclear negotiations', 'Hard Power', ""North Korea's nuclear strategy"", 'International Aid', 'Nuclear Powerplay']"

Knotting Justice from a Transitional Justice Perspective: The Quipu Project: The Untold Story of Forced Sterilisation in Peru,"Rizzi, Martina",['Natalia Rivera Vera'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the role of the Quipu Project in seeking justice for indigenous Peruvian women who underwent forced sterilisation. In the 1990s, under Alberto Fujimori’s administration, 311,000 women and 25,000 men, got sterelised in the name of the National Program of Reproductive Health and Family Planning. Despite the astonishing numbers of victims and the lack of justice they have received to this day, the Quipu Project emerged as an encouraging initiative. Trough an analysis based on transitional justice perspective, this thesis explores how the Quipu Project would be suitable for three key mechanisms of transitional justice: The truth and Reconciliation commissions, Reparation Programs, and Institutional Reform. The Quipu Project has given a glimpse of hope for future prospects for justice by giving victims a platform and a dedicated phone line to voice their experiences. Therefore, this thesis argues that the Quipu Project has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the fight for justice for those who were subjected to forced sterilisation.","['Forced Sterilisation, Quipu Project, Transitional Justice, Indigenous Women, Peru']"

The failure of pan-Arabism: Why Saddam Hussein could not mobilise collective Arab support for his invasion of Kuwait: A study of the interplay between the state identity and the pan-Arab identity in the Arab world during the First Gulf War,"Heringa, Marthe","['Valadbaygi, K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis attempts to explain why Saddam Hussein could not mobilise collective Arab support for his invasion of Kuwait in the early 1990s, despite his use of pan-Arab rhetoric, arguments and justifications. Saddam’s failure to gather support from all Arab states became incontrovertible when an anti-Iraq coalition was formed by the United States which consisted of various Arab countries, including Egypt and Syria. Based on qualitative historical analysis of secondary sources, discourse analysis of Iraqi speeches and content analysis of economic documents, Egyptian and Syrian newspaper articles, this thesis argues that Saddam’s failure was caused by the decline of pan-Arabism and the rise of national statism in the Arab world since the late 1960s. Case studies of Egypt and Syria during the First Gulf War make clear that these countries prioritised the state over the (pan-)Arab nation by advancing state instead of pan-Arab interests and valuing state sovereignty and state power over pan-Arab unity.","['pan-Arabism', 'First Gulf War', 'Saddam Hussein', 'national statism']"

With the objective of providing alternative perspectives on prior assessments of the value of historical city identity for a sense of place in cities, this thesis provides a discussion and analysis of a contrasting modern-day city like Rotterdam. The research is useful for cities that have undergone mass destruction and are in need of general reconstruction in answering questions on how to (re)build a sense of place for their population. Additionally, the findings are written upon existing literature, interviews conducted with local architects and urban designers, as well as a survey of Rotterdammers living and working within the city center. Reflecting on the urban planning practices, it becomes evident that Rotterdammers’ grew their appreciation and awareness towards historical value. Findings show, historical city identity has the potential to foster a sense of belonging, connectedness, familiarity, continuity and through that alter Rotterdammers’ sense of place. However, it fails to provide distinctiveness and support the community’s multicultural identity.","['historical sites', 'sense of place', 'modernism', 'post-war reconstruction', 'place attachment', 'built heritage']"

Commodifying Culture for Development? The ambivalent role of Indigenous tourism as a tool for sustainable development in Peru,"Heckmann, Laura Lynn","['Amann, E.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the past two decades, as the public debate about sustainable development has increasingly gained attention, sustainability goals have also reached the tourism sector, especially in lowand middle-income countries. Subsequently, sustainable tourism alternatives like pro-poor, community-based, eco-, or Indigenous tourism emerged, aiming to provide inclusive economic and socio-cultural benefits to the host communities and thus contribute to broader goals like poverty alleviation and regional sustainable development. This thesis focuses on Indigenous tourism, as a particular form of alternative tourism, and assesses its potential in serving as a tool for sustainable development of the tourism sector and the host communities, taking Peru as case study. Whereas singular aspects of Indigenous tourism have already been discussed in prior research, this thesis aims to provide a full overview of the impacts of Indigenous tourism by combining insights from an economic and socio-cultural perspective. The analysis utilizes a mixed-method approach that combines qualitative literature-based research with primary data analyses and is based on neoliberal and Marxist economic theory as well as sustainable tourism studies, critical development, and post-colonial theory. Discussing the various prospects and challenges (both economic and socio-cultural) of Indigenous tourism in Peru, this research identifies clear requirements for successful development and subsequently advocates for the promotion of Indigenous tourism as a mean toward more inclusive and sustainable development of Peru´s tourism sector and the host communities.","['Peru', 'sustainable development', 'sustainable tourism', 'Indigenous tourism']"

Embellished Identity: On the identity communicated by Parsi gara embroidery.,"Turkenburg, Aurora","['Jong, A. de']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Religious Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis has sought to answer how gara, a type of embroidery embellished on traditional sari, works as a communicative tool of Parsi identity to both non-Parsi and Parsi. In order to achieve this, we shall see first how dress is able to communicate identity to oneself and others through a process this thesis dubs embellishment, before focusing in on the social, historical, and religious aspects of gara, and uncovering what collective Parsi identity is communicated through gara exactly. This thesis concludes that the process of embellishment communicates an identity that is Parsi through applying an identity narrative on dress which is interacted with by others to formulate a temporarily fixed identity of the wearer. This identity narrative embellished on gara has social, historical, and religious roots, all of which are discussed in the thesis at length. This thesis thus answers two important questions in the study of identity communication through dress, by explaining how identity can be transmitted though dress, as well as how this identity is formulated.","['identity', 'parsi', 'dress', 'fashion', 'embroidery', 'religion', 'material culture']"

Constructivist Perspective on Israel-Russia Relations in the Context of the War in Ukraine: Trading Democracy for Security - Israeli Identity and Politics of Fear,"Šliogerytė, Barbora Ūla",['Dr. Kayhan Valadbaygi'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"On 24th February 2022, Russia began the greatest and most atrocious military campaign in Europe since World War II, which fundamentally changed the architecture of the international order. In several days, Russia has been condemned by the majority of the democratic world. The EU and the USA imposed historically unprecedented sanctions, as well as passed multiple resolutions in the UN condemning the invasion. Even countries such as Taiwan, despite the threats from China sided with its democratic counterparts and sent financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Similarly, Israel also joined the efforts in providing humanitarian aid, transferring Ukrainian refugees to Israel, and building field hospitals. However, amid the pleas of the Jewish origin Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelsnky, Israel refused to supply arms to Ukraine in order not to jeopardize its close relationship with Russia. Many in Israel have emphasized its national interests and security concerns as the main explanatory factor. However, the research argues that in order to unfold the complexities and ambiguities of Israeli-Russian relations in the context of the war in Ukraine it is necessary to go beyond the classical IR theory. A constructivist approach provides a more thorough indebt analysis. It demonstrates that the historical collective trauma of the Jewish people has been embedded in Israeli national identity, which guides its foreign policy. It argues that Israel’s relations with Russia in the context of the war in Ukraine echo Zionist ideology, which considers anarchy, power, and self-help - the cornerstone of the realist worldview - to be the guiding principles of international relations.","['Israel, Russia, Ukraine, Constructivism']"

It argues that their ambivalent status as swing states has both benefited them and presented challenges, particularly in overcoming their historical relationship with Russia. The focus on Russia, rather than their relationship with the European Union, is due to the extensive existing literature on the topic, allowing for an in-depth exploration within the scope of this research.","['European culture, Poland, Hungary, ambvialence, Russia, memory, Politics']"
