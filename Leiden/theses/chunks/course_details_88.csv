Incorrect Old English or in Correct Old English? An Analysis of the Corrections in the Twelfth-Century Eadwine Psalter,"Baalen, Amos Mark Willem van","['Porck, M.H.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis provides a linguistic analysis of the corrections to the Old English gloss of five psalms (Psalms 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45) in the twelfth-century Eadwine Psalter. These corrections are especially prevalent in the first part of the Eadwine Psalter (Psalms 1-77) and derive from the tenth-century Regius Psalter. The corrections are analysed in order to determine whether they can be characterised in terms of their type, frequency and the degree to which they adhere to Old English, i.e. whether the corrector introduced any modernisations into the gloss. Besides showing that the corrected glosses in the Eadwine Psalter generally conform quite well to the corresponding glosses in the Regius Psalter, the results of the analysis demonstrate that the corrector has used relatively few lexical and morphological modernisations in his corrections. This may be seen as surprising for a corrector who was working in the early Middle English period. It is also clear that nouns and verbs are among the most heavily corrected word classes and that there are very few individual recurring lemmata among the corrections. Generally, the results conform to current scholarship on the Eadwine Psalter.","['Late Old English', 'Early Middle English', 'Glosses', 'Psalters', 'Twelfth century', 'Corrections', 'Eadwine Psalter', 'Regius Psalter']"

Freedom of Expression: Religiously Offensive Speech in France and the Case of Charlie Hebdo,"Zandonella, Eva","['Oster, Jan']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to explore the topic of religiously offensive cartoons, taking the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015 as a starting point. After applying the legal framework and different legal philosophical justifications for free speech to the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, the analysis will take a closer look at a similar controversy in Denmark. As in the Danish cartoon controversy, analysing the broader socio-political context can provide a deeper understanding of the root causes of the protests following the attack. Drawing on critical discourse analysis this thesis investigates the question to what extend the public discourse on free speech in France after the attack on Charlie Hebdo and the role of French Muslims in this debate reflect power relations within the French society. Such power relations indeed manifest themselves in this discourse as it was the official side who started the discourse and had the power to chose wording, meaning of concepts, the topoi and to define ingroups and outgroups. Societal inequalities can also be noticed through participation and representation of French Muslisms and their interaction to the other groups present in the discourse.","['Freedom of Speech', 'religiously offensive speech', 'France', 'Charlie Hebdo']"

a sociolinguistic investigation of language attitude among youth in Rongcheng,"Jiashuo, Zhang","['Rint, Sybesma']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Language attitude is one of the most critical issues in sociolinguistics and since the study of Lambert et al. (1960), relevant research with various research methods has proliferated. The research results can help explain the nature of the distribution of language variations and is of vital importance when considering language restoration, maintenance or death. Besides, the language attitude research has theoretical significance on language planning and policy. The purpose of the current study is to determine the evaluative reactions of the younger generation in Rongcheng towards speakers of the standard language, Putonghua, and the non-standard variety, Rongcheng dialect. 47 high school and university students in Rongcheng participated in the study and the direct method of questionnaire and the indirect method of the matched guise technique are combined. In the matched guise experiment, six guises were selected for evaluation in the dimensions of social status and group solidarity. Generally speaking, on solidarity dimension, Rongcheng dialect is rated higher than Putonghua, while on status dimension, Putonghua is rated higher. The accented Putonghua is a form between Putonghua and Rongcheng dialect. On social status dimension, it is rated lowest compared with Putonghua and Rongcheng dialect and on group solidarity it is rated similarly to Putonghua. The findings indicate that Rongcheng dialect is the language variety with covert prestige in Rongcheng. Besides, subjects’ language attitude tend to be multi-valued: factors such as gender, educational level and etc. are linked to subjects' differentiated attitude towards Rongcheng dialect and Putonghua.","['language attitude', 'social status', 'group solidarity', 'matched guised test', 'language prestige']"
To Translate or not to Translate: The Value of Re-introducing Translation Exercises in the Secondary School Curriculum for Second Language Acquisition,"Lindenburg, Sjoerd","['Dorst, A.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the ongoing debate about the role of translation in second language learning. In the past, scholars and teachers alike assumed that translation caused interference and therefore halted a learner’s progress in learning a second or foreign language. More recent research, however, has attempted to counter common conceptions regarding translation’s ineffectiveness as a language-learning and language-teaching tool. My thesis provides an overview of past and current language acquisition theories and teaching methods, and explains why most of these theories and methods are considered to be flawed. The recently developed task-based teaching method aims to address these flaws, and calls for task-based language exercises, including task-based translation exercises. In a pilot study I investigated the value of task-based translation exercises when Dutch secondary school students are learning grammatical aspect (i.e. the present perfect) in English. Overall, the study showed that using task-based translation exercises enhances the use and understanding of grammatical aspect (i.e. the present perfect), although there appeared to be a discrepancy between HAVO and VWO participants.","['Translation', 'Translation Theory', 'Second Language Learning', 'Task-Based Teaching Method', 'Task-Based Translation Exercises', 'Grammatical Aspect', 'Secondary School', 'Communication']"

All Refugees Are Migrants but Are All Migrants Refugees? Framing of Migrants by Politicians and Non-Profit Organizations in the Netherlands,"Oudsten, A. den","['Foster, A.A.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study is about framing of migrants by political parties and non-profit organizations in the Netherlands. The recent increase in the influx of immigrants in the Netherlands has intensified the immigration debate and brought about more polarization in the debate about ‘refugees’; on the one hand the use of negative frames; and on the other positive frames. The frames used in the immigration debate aim to influence the general public’s attitude towards the issue. This study consisted of a content analysis of six political parties (VVD, PVV, PvdA, SP, SGP, CDA) and six non-profit organizations (Vluchtelingenwerk, Stichting Vluchteling, Stichting Gave, Cordaid, Rode Kruis, UNICEF) in two time periods to determine if there are any shifts in the way immigrants are framed. The first time period is before the recent increase, in 2012, and the second period is the current year, which is after the large influx of immigrants. The analyzed texts are the election programs of the political parties and the annual reports of the non-profit organizations. The content analysis focused on frame categories and the use of frame categories in combination with stock issues and means of persuasion. One of the main findings of this study is the need for a ‘neutral’ frame in the immigration debate. Secondly, the use of framing by some political parties in combination with social movement stock issues. And thirdly, the recent increase of immigrants in the Netherlands did not cause an increase and diversification of frame use in all the analyzed texts. The findings of this study complement our understanding of the frame use of these actors regarding immigrants in combination with stock issues and means of persuasion.","['Framing', 'Persuasion', 'Stock issues', 'Migration debate']"

"The Russian Apprehensive Construction: Syntactic Status Reassessed, Negation Vindicated","Baydina, Ekaterina","['Verhagen, Arie']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Predicates of fear and apprehension in Russian can be followed by clauses with a marker of negation that does not alter the truth value of the proposition as in 'Ja bojus’, kak by ne bylo dožd’ja' (I am afraid that it might rain), where it is the possibility of rain that causes the fear and not the contrary. The negative particle ne thus seems superfluous and illogical if the two clauses are assumed to be linked by subordination. This thesis reapplies Jespersen’s insight of paratactic negation (Jespersen 1917) to address this well-known problem of Russian syntax. Corpus-based evidence is presented in support of analyzing clauses with 'kak by' and negation as instantiations of an autonomous, independent-clause construction rather than as embedded complements. By way of corroboration, the historical path along which the construction is likely to have developed is also examined to demonstrate its main-clause origins. While this analysis provides an elegant solution to the problem of negation by removing restrictions stemming from the notion of embeddedness, the precise function of negation is explored within an intersubjective approach (Verhagen 2005). The role of negation in the construction is shown to consist in cognitive coordination whereby the speaker instructs the addressee to entertain two mental representations of an apprehension-causing situation and to adopt the one in which this situation is construed as non-existent through the use of negation.","['fear and apprehension', 'Russian', 'paratactic negation', 'intersubjectivity']"

Is the Climate the Culprit? Drought in Darfur and Turkana: a Comparison.,"Rodenburg, Lara","['Williams, Corey']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis the influence of drought on the conflicts in Turkana in northern Kenya and Darfur in Sudan is researched, both of which involve pastoralists, but which also differ in many other respects. First, a theoretical background on the relation between environmental degradation and violent conflict is provided, exploring the academic debate on the topic. The following chapters constitute a thorough overview of the histories and important factors for both the Darfur and Turkana conflicts, investigating the role of drought in the conflicts and its interplay with other causal factors. The last chapter compares the different ways in which drought influenced both conflicts. In the theoretical framework it is found that most often environmental factors alone do not cause violent conflict, but they can act as “threat multipliers”. This idea holds true for the conflicts in Darfur and Turkana. In both cases drought led to increased migration of pastoralists, causing increased tension in receiving areas. However, the effect of drought on the conflict is found to be much more direct in Turkana than it is in Darfur.","['Environmental degradation', 'Violent conflict', 'Turkana', 'Darfur', 'Drought']"
"Beyond the Formal Will: A research into concepts of the will in Kant, Schelling, and Cohen","Been, Lars Niklas","['Sneller, H.W.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis I will make a critical assessment of the Kantian formal conception of the will in light of Schelling and Cohen. My research question is twofold: how to assess the Kantian concept of will, given its notorious 'formality'? And under which conditions could Schelling's and Cohen's conception of the will meet the (assumed) flaws of the Kantian notion of the will? How could we evaluate Kant’s concept of the will in terms of its ‘formality’? What is the strength of Kant’s concept of the will and what is its weakness? Kant has provided us with a theory of how every rational human being can be ethical. We universally derive our ethical obligation, Kant claims, from the pure form of reason. This form of reason, motivating our will to act well, keeps our will formal. How can we assess this formality? On the one hand, the form of reason ensures that the individual can autonomously will and correspond to the ethical laws of a rational subject. This is the strength of Kant’s formal ethics. On the other hand, the form of reason makes our will lifeless, because Kant eliminates everything material. According to Kant, the will ought not be motivated by emotional inclinations nor serve a material purpose. Kant is not concerned with the matter of the action or what is to result from it, but solely with the form and the principle from which it does itself follow (Kant, 1984, 61). Kant’s morality is based on the presupposition that there ought to be a purely formal disposition to do good. Is there also a practical and vital disposition to do good? In other words, what would make the will dynamic? Could Schelling and Cohen perhaps solve the issue raised here? The problem of the lifelessness of the will lies in the transcendental nature of Kant’s will. The faculty of thinking and willing are united in Kant’s practical philosophy. In both Schelling and Cohen a new road is opened for a will that is not limited by reason. They both propose that there is a spirit that motivates the will, instead of reason. They also allow a dynamic power that has a disposition towards this spirit of the will. Both philosophers have a vital concept that replaces Kant’s formal concept of disposition, namely the concepts of Yearning and tendency. These concepts are not a motive of thinking but purely a motive of willing. Under the condition of making the will independent of the faculty of thinking, Schelling and Cohen are able to meet the flaws of Kant’s notion of the will.","['will', 'formal', 'reason', 'spirit', 'lifeless', 'vital', 'Kant', 'Schelling', 'Cohen']"

De kritische Surinaamse journalist: ook kritisch over eigen verificatiegedrag? De rolopvattingen en het verificatiegedrag van Surinaamse journalisten.,"Kerkum, Annick van","['Burger, Peter']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Wie kijkt naar journalistieke werkwijzen, kijkt al snel naar de rolopvattingen van journalisten. Een rolopvatting is de wijze waarop een positiebekleder, in dit geval de journalist, meent zijn rol te moeten vervullen. Vier belangrijke rolopvattingen van journalisten zijn de populistische verspreider, de onafhankelijke waakhond, de kritische bemiddelaar en de opportunistische bemiddelaar. Een journalist kan meerdere rolopvattingen tegelijkertijd hebben. Door de veranderingen in het journalistieke werkveld mede door de komst van het internet is de rol van populistische verspreider weggevallen, internet neemt immers de taak van het verspreiden van informatie over. Het duiden van informatie is echter een belangrijke taak voor de journalist als onafhankelijke waakhond en kritische bemiddelaar geworden. Onderzoek wijst uit dat er verschillen zijn in de rolopvattingen tussen westerse journalisten en journalisten uit derdewereldlanden. Deze scriptie focust op de journalistiek in Suriname, onderzoekt welke rolopvattingen Surinaamse journalisten aannemen en of dit samenhangt met hun verificatiegedrag. In deze masterscriptie is er een tweeledig onderzoek gedaan naar de rolopvattingen en het verificatiegedrag van Surinaamse journalisten. Het eerste onderzoek is een survey naar voorbeeld van Hermans et al. (2011), die door middel van een profielschets de rolopvattingen van Surinaamse journalisten blootlegt. De resultaten van deze survey worden vergeleken met die van Nederlandse journalisten, om op die manier een link te leggen tussen Suriname en Nederland. Het tweede onderzoek is een gemengde methode in navolging van Diekerhof & Bakker (2012), waarbij er per Surinaamse journalist drie artikelen worden geanalyseerd op het gebied van brongebruik, waarna de uitkomsten worden besproken in een aansluitend interview. Ook deze uitkomsten worden vergeleken met die van Nederlandse journalisten. Aan hand van bestaande literatuur werd verwacht dat de Surinaamse journalist zichzelf ziet als opportunistische bemiddelaar, maar deze ziet zichzelf net als de Nederlandse journalist als onafhankelijke waakhond en nog in meerdere mate als kritische bemiddelaar, zo is gebleken uit onderzoek. Een belangrijke taak die hierbij hoort is verificatie. Surinaamse journalisten bleken echter, net als Nederlandse journalisten, informatie alleen te checken als dit makkelijk gedaan kan worden. Door bijvoorbeeld het gebruik van quotes werd verificatie ook wel vermeden. Tijdsdruk of wantrouwen tegenover de bron bleek geen reden te zijn om niet te checken. Wel gaven Surinaamse journalisten aan dat zij op hun intuïtie konden rekenen. Een belangrijk verschil tussen Surinaamse en Nederlandse journalisten is dat Surinaamse journalisten Facebook veel meer als bron voor hun journalistieke werkzaamheden gebruiken.","['Suriname', 'Verificatie', 'Bronnenonderzoek', 'Journalistiek', 'Rolopvattingen', 'Verificatiegedrag']"
The Enforceability of Labour Rights in Bilateral Trade Agreements of the European Union: The Case of CETA,"Tsiami, Lydia","['Gruni, Giovanni']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"On the 30th of October 2016, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Council Donald Tusk, Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada (CETA). In line with the EU’s external policy on the inclusion of social provisions in its bilateral and regional trade agreements, CETA contains a chapter entirely dedicated to the protection of labour standards in the context of trade relations, as a means of contributing to the overarching objective of ‘sustainable development’. The so-called ‘Trade and Labour’ Chapter includes detailed provisions on the protection and promotion of labour rights, as well as a special mechanism stipulated for the resolution of labour-related disputes. As regards the protection of labour standards, the European Commission has dubbed CETA as a ‘truly progressive’ agreement. Since both partners have experience in including labour provisions in their trade agreements, it could be assumed that the Agreement favours a revolutionary approach towards the trade and labour linkage, that could set a precedent for future trade agreements. This is the exact rationale of the Commission concerning the formulation and contents of the ‘Trade and Labour’ Chapter in CETA: according to the Commission not only have both Parties committed themselves never to undermine EU high labour standards ‘for the sake of commercial interests’, but instead to cooperate in encouraging ‘others around the world - particularly developing countries- to raise their own’. However, a closer examination of the labour provisions in CETA suggests that the Commission’s assertive stance on the preservation of high labour standards may well be unsubstantiated, which would in turn require the EU to revise its normative aspirations. The present thesis will therefore challenge the institutional expectations, arguing that the labour clause in CETA is defined by such crucial weaknesses that labour rights are rendered unenforceable.","['EU', 'trade agreement', 'CETA', 'social policy', 'trade policy', 'sustainable development', 'labour rights', 'CLS']"

This work seeks to outline the various dimensions of anti-satellite weaponry by reviewing the technical, strategic, and legal aspects of these weapons. This work discusses the possible impact of ASAT missiles on navigation, communication, information gathering, and early warning systems. Specifically in regards to the unhindered growth of Chinese ASAT capabilities, such missiles are becoming an increasingly relevant threat in our time. Thus, this thesis also draws possible connections to Chinese military doctrine in recent years. Following this analysis of the militaristic aspects, the final section of this paper reviews the legal restrictions on ASAT missiles, including international laws and norms, whereas in all practicality no treaties or norms adequately discourage construction or use of these missiles. Thus, this thesis attempts to outline the serious security threat that is posed by ASAT missiles, particularly in regards to China.","['Anti-satellite Missile', 'Space Security', 'Satellite', 'China', 'Orbit']"

Legitimation strategies in territorial disputes: the case of Russia and Ukraine's dispute over Crimea,"Kingstone, Kamila","['Bader, Max']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis argues that the Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko have so far justified their territorial claims to Crimea in strikingly similar ways. Through a qualitative and quantitative content analysis of each president's key speeches, this study finds that both presidents emphasise national-historical arguments when addressing a domestic audience and normative arguments when addressing an international audience, but that both presidents weave the two types of arguments together to create an overall narrative. When compared against each other, this study also finds that Putin uses the most national-historical arguments while Poroshenko uses the most normative arguments. Several conclusions are drawn from these findings, including that the plethora of possible legitimation strategies make positions in a conflict relatively easy to justify, that the Crimea conflict is likely to be intractable, and that more research should be conducted on legitimation strategies in territorial disputes.","['legitimation strategies', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Crimea', 'Putin', 'Poroshenko', 'Rhetoric', 'International norms', 'Historical', 'Territorial claim']"

This supposed vengeful motive is an aspect that allows the animals to act as agents of guilt. Part of the guilt finds its origin in the history that humans and animals share, and in this thesis, specifically in the Western societies. In this shared history animals were more often than not treated horribly. However, in recent years, humans have come to think of animals quite differently than they used to. Animals and humans differ most significantly in the aspect of consciousness: where animals are merely conscious, humans are self-conscious. In horror literature the most important aspect is the monster, and a monster is almost exclusively an animal that has acquired self-consciousness. The animals in the four discussed horror narratives are all seemingly in possession of a self-conscious mind, making them horrific monsters. But, besides being a scary monster that threatens the lives of its antagonists, the acquirement of self-consciousness gives the monster a purpose, it becomes an agent of guilt. In this function the animals can confront the characters in the story with repressed feelings originating from guilt, and, more significantly, through these animals a critical view on human society is offered.","['Horror', 'Literature', 'Critique', 'Poe', 'du Maurier', 'Benchley', 'King', 'Vengeful', 'Agent of guilt']"

The Contemporary Curator as Cultural Leader: Examining the Role of the Curator within the Context of Contemporary Global Culture,"Maasse, Natalie","['Leigh, Nana']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The question of what it means to be an art curator in the expanded field of artistic production has been a subject of enigmatic allure in the field of the arts. Discussions on the subject have produced interesting and productive contributions in terms of the role and purpose that is assigned to the curator, of which ‘mediator’ and ‘process shaper’ have achieved major currency. In response to the major challenges brought forth by the rapidly evolving global cultural climate of the last decade – migration, global capitalism, new forms of imperialism-, the practice and discourse of curating is seen to have made a shift from mere mediating towards an emphasis on the performance of leadership within the arts. The thesis statement made in this regard is that contemporary curating constitutes a new form of leadership, that is, cultural leadership. This statement is examined from the main question whether it is indeed possible and productive to conceive of the contemporary art curator as cultural leader? As this is still a largely un-theorized topic, the present research will comprise a theoretical treatise and will be conducted from a combination in methods of literature analysis and critical theory. The avant-garde will be employed as a working concept to explore and assess the new notion of the curator as cultural leader.","['Cultural Leadership', 'Curating', 'Avant-garde', 'Contemporary Curating', 'Globalization', 'Contemporaneity', 'Interdisciplinary']"

The Politics of Power Balancing Vs. Enmeshment Theory An Analysis of Indonesia’s Response to Regional Power Competition in the Asia-Pacific Region,"messelaar, meena","['Black, Lindsay']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis places Indonesia’s strategic regional policy for dealing with power competition within Asia in the context of its relationship with ASEAN, China and the US. The main question this thesis addresses is whether Indonesia, as a secondary state in the Southeast Asian region, is more likely to deal with the politics of the regional order through power balancing or institutional enmeshment. It will compare the arguments of Robert R. Ross, who argues that the balance of power in Asia-Pacific politics is affected by military power, and Evelyn Goh, who argues that the regional order is more complex and that regional frameworks such as ASEAN will also help influence larger regional counterweights such as China. In focusing on the power balancing actions that secondary states take, Ross argues that Indonesia uses military power, with the US by its side, to balance against China. Goh does not believe Indonesia can simply power balance against China, but that it will also try to enmesh China in regional entities. Both Ross’s and Goh’s arguments will be tested through a case study on Indonesia’s behaviour in the regional dispute in the South China Sea to determine which of the two arguments is more relevant to Indonesia’s strategic regional policy. This study is relevant because it provides a more detailed analysis of Indonesia’s capabilities to deal with power competition in the region. This thesis concludes that Indonesia is more likely to deal with power competition in the Asia-Pacific through the enmeshment theory of Evelyn Goh.","['Asia-Pacific', 'Indonesia', 'Power Competition', 'Enmeshment', 'Power Balancing']"

Confronting the Civil War Trap. The effect of power-sharing arrangements on rebel intra-group dynamics and post-war conflict initiation.,"Liesveld, Michelle","['Maat, E. van der']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Why do armed non-state groups initiate conflict after being part of a power-sharing arrangement ending a prior civil war? In response to the spike in civil wars after the end of the Cold War, peace agreements with power-sharing arrangements have long been argued to be the best civil war resolution, as a result, these have become a default tool in civil war resolution. However, in more than half of these cases, civil war did recur. Empirical research shows that power-sharing is indeed successful in stabilizing peace among former adversaries. The answer to why civil wars terminated by negotiated settlements with power-sharing start again is likely to be found within the groups included in the settlement. The problem is not so much the resolution of hostilities between (former) foes, but rather the rise of hostilities among former allies. This thesis argues that power-sharing might (temporarily) establish a balance of power between former adversaries, at the same time it negatively affects the balance of power within the groups, causing intra-group security dilemmas and rivalry leading to remobilization and initiation of conflict. This theoretical proposal is tested in a qualitative study of post-civil war Sudan and Tajikistan, by questioning how power-sharing affected the internal dynamics of the rebel groups. What made rebel groups initiate conflict again, or, why did they not?","['power-sharing', 'rebel groups', 'intra-group dynamics', 'rivalry', 'civil war recurrence']"

De multiculturele discussie: Hoe de berichtgeving over de multiculturele samenleving in het journalistieke debat tussen 1990-2008 is veranderd.,"Oerlemans, Zeping","['Schrover, Marlou']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Wetenschappers claimen dat het debat over de multiculturele samenleving een grote ontwikkeling heeft doorgemaakt. Waar de multiculturele samenleving begin 1990 nog als een nastrevenswaardig doel werd beschouwd, deden politici, journalisten en opiniemakers deze tien jaar later af als een volledig mislukt project, dat de normen en waarden van de westerse samenleving in gevaar had gebracht. Ondanks dat er consensus bestaat over deze verandering, zijn er geen concrete cijfers beschikbaar die aangeven in welke mate deze verandering plaatsvond en wat de belangrijkste oorzaken hiervoor waren, waardoor voorgaand onderzoek in feite enkel steunt op plausibele aannames. Het ontbreekt aan een studie die vanuit historisch oogpunt systematisch analyseert hoe deze verandering plaatsvond en wat de aanleiding en de oorzaken hiervoor waren. Dit onderzoek vult het gat op en draagt bij aan de wetenschappelijke discussie door de ontwikkelingen in het journalistieke debat over de multiculturele samenleving tussen 1990 en 2008 in kaart te brengen. Uit de discoursanalyse blijk dat het journalistieke debat veranderde door het artikel ‘Het multiculturele drama’ van Paul Scheffer, de aanslagen op 11 september en de moord op Theo van Gogh. De kritiek die Scheffer gaf op de multiculturele samenleving was alleen mogelijk doordat het ideaal van de multiculturele samenleving tussen 1990 en 1999 veranderde van een samenleving waarin migranten als allochtone gemeenschap in de Nederlandse maatschappij moesten integreren naar een samenleving waarin migranten zich aan moesten passen aan de Nederlandse dominante cultuur.","['Multiculturele samenleving', 'Krantenonderzoek', 'Multicultureel debat', 'Discoursanalyse', 'Integratie']"

Whereas parallel Czech and Hungarian claims to greater autonomy garnered a sense of legitimacy from historical precedents in the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, no similar examples could be cited by German nationalists in western Bohemia for their supposed region. Instead, German Bohemians relied on the culturally situated potency of the Heimat-genre as well as the documentary ‘realness’ of photographic images. Making use of specific tropes and vocabularies, both textual and visual, guidebooks and other tourist material encouraged outsiders, especially Germans elsewhere, to literally or figuratively visit and witness Deutschböhmen for themselves. Consequently, readers were introduced to an area that was distinct from the rest of Bohemia and an inherent part of the timeless territory of the German Heimat.","['Nationalism', 'Tourism', 'Photograpy', 'Bohemia', 'Deutschböhmen']"

Crime’s Role in the Legitimization of Islamism in Bosnia and Implications for the New Crime-Terror Nexus,"Filipac, Lucija","['Duyvesteyn, I.G.B.M.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Research on the “new” crime-terror nexus points out a recent trend of criminals turning to Islamist terrorism in Western Europe, assumes this is due to an overlap of criminal and terrorist milieus, and argues this is significant because former criminals make more effective terrorists (Basra, Neumann & Brunner 2016). Despite being left out of Basra, Neumann and Brunner’s study, Bosnia’s militant Islamists possess well-developed criminal capabilities. This research draws on the explanatory power of the concept of legitimacy to analyze the development of the Islamist movement in Bosnia and how it uses crime. Through contextualizing and synthesizing open-source information on five post-war terrorist attacks in Bosnia, I argue that the leaders of the Bosnian Islamist movement have since the Bosnian War effectively established and drawn on local and international networks to recruit for and fund terrorist activity, thus diminishing the significance attributed by Basra, Neumann and Brunner to the role former criminals play in financing the Islamist movement and carrying out terrorism. This research encourages a reassessment of some of the main assertions of the new crime-terror nexus and suggests a need for its further study in Bosnia, a country of particular significance to the global jihadist movement.","['crime-terror nexus', 'terrorism', 'new crime-terror nexus', 'Bosnia', 'Islamism', 'jihadism', 'crime', 'legitimacy', 'legitimization']"

China’s Growing Presence and True Intentions: Autocracy Promotion and Strategic Interests in Central Asia,"Arends, Aaron","['Wang, Enoch Z.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This bachelor thesis examines China’s growing presence in Central Asia and relates it to the persistence of authoritarian regimes in the region. It questions if China is promoting autocracy abroad through its foreign policy or as a result of its economic initiatives. China’s recent investments in the form of the ‘Silk Road Economic Belt’ have significantly increases its interests in the region. By promoting autocratic values and ensuring the survival of regimes in its vicinity, China could bolster the regions’ security whilst simultaneously strengthening its own legitimacy. Although this research argues that China does not show to have such ideological intentions, it reveals that China’s foreign policy can inadvertently support the existing autocratic regimes of Central Asia. Guided by its strategic interests, China is actively changing the power balance in the region. To obtain a better understanding of China’s foreign relations, this research will analyse the rhetoric, motivations, and true intentions behind its foreign policy in Central Asia.",

Using Lacan’s ‘Mirror Stage’ and his tripartite schema of the ‘Real’, the ‘Imaginary’, and the ‘Symbolic’ orders as a template, I will address the repercussions of the Fall and establish to what extent the move from the Real, through the Imaginary, to the Symbolic can be seen to be mirrored in the move from a pre-lapsarian state to a post-lapsarian reality in 'Paradise Lost'. In the first chapter, I argue that, since God exists in perfect proximity to the Real-like Word, Satan embodies the post-lapsarian Symbolic word in and through his separation from God's prototypical, pre-lapsarian language. In chapter two, I extend this main argument and apply it more locally to the Edenic level of Adam and Eve and their respective relationships with the Word of God. The Fall of Man, then, comes to feature as the event that introduces the Lacanian Symbolic order to Eden, by the hand of Satan, its prime instigator.","['John Milton', 'Paradise Lost', 'Jacques Lacan', 'The Fall of Man', 'Symbolic', 'Real', 'Imaginary', 'Mirror Stage']"

Er wordt met name gekeken naar de 63e provincie van Turkije, namelijk Hatay. Deze provincie was tot 1937 van het Syrische mandaat, is een jaar later onafhankelijk geworden en is door een referendum in 1939 deel van Turkije geworden. De provincie is een microkosmisch Syrië omdat het religieus en etnisch erg divers is. Dit maakt het een kwetsbaar gebied waar de Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (Partij voor Rechtvaardigheid en Ontwikkeling - AKP), met haar soennitische retoriek, een groot deel van de bevolking niet bereikt. Deze grensprovincie is daarom bij uitstek de beste casus om naar de zwakke plekken in de soevereiniteit van de Turkse staat te kijken.

The history of 1965-66, a history of mass killings and imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of alleged communist Indonesians, has for a long time been silenced and mystified by anti-communist myth-making that was created under Suharto’s authoritarian rule. Despite the end of Suharto’s regime in 1998 and numerous attempts to counter the state propaganda, this master-narrative that labels victims as perpetrators deserving of their fate is still widely available in contemporary Indonesian state and society. This thesis examines how and why master- and counter-narratives of “1965” continue to exist and circulate in Indonesia today. By combining a focus on contestations of the past in public space with research into the perceptions of the younger generation in particular, it explores how the politics of memory work in everyday practice. A survey conducted among 170 high school pupils in Yogyakarta provides unique insight into the highly complex and problematic ways in which the history of 1965-66 is remembered by a group of young Indonesians today. Thereby, this thesis provides further insight into the lasting legacies of mass violence in post-authoritarian Indonesia.","['politics of memory', 'anti-communism', 'mass violence', 'myth-making', 'youth', 'history education', 'history', 'memory', 'narrative', 'Indonesia', 'Southeast Asia']"

In June 2007, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa Delgado introduced the proposal known as the Yasuní-ITT initiative which aimed to put a moratorium on any future drilling in the area in exchange for compensation from the international community to the tune of US$3.6 billion over a period of approximately 10 years. Although the initiative received overwhelmingly positive and favorable reactions from governments and organizations around the globe, it was cancelled in 2013 by Correa due to lack of funding. The controversy over Correa’s conclusion of the Yasuní-ITT initiative has been a part of larger discussions occurring within Ecuador over the past few decades concerning changing rights, new forms of representation, and alternatives to the traditional development practices. Accompanying these new formulations of citizenship is the idea of ‘sumak kawsay’ or 'buen vivir,' a pluralistic concept stemming from an Andean indigenous cosmovisión which promotes indigenous knowledge, social welfare, democracy and living within ones means and in harmony with ones community, including not only humans but with all aspects of nature, including animals, plants and the elements While buen vivir is appealing to social movements, conservationists and leftist academics both within and outside of Ecuador for a myriad of reasons, the failure of the Yasuní-ITT initiative has cast doubts as to whether it provides an alternative political paradigm that can function economically on a national scale within the capitalist world structure in which we currently operate and exist. This thesis aims to analyze whether sumak kawsay can accomplish its goals of respecting nature within Ecuador while also economically benefitting both the state and the Ecuadorian people.","['buen vivir', 'sumak kawsay', 'alternatives to development', 'economic viability', 'rights of nature', 'Ecuador', 'Yasuní-ITT initiative']"

Interest in the Heartland - New Great Games in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation,"Ballering, Thymen Jelle","['Wang, Jue']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Unlike the nineteenth century, the competition for power in Eurasia is increasingly fought between Russia and China. In turn, according to the prevailing neorealist discourse, these powers compete for security and economic influence in what is referred to as ‘the New Great Game’. In recent years, China is seen to increasingly tilt the balance of power from Moscow’s traditional sphere of influence towards Beijing – especially in the economic realm – with Russia attempting to retain its hegemonic position. Accordingly, a pressing question is what implications the spillover of this competition for hegemony in Central Asia has for Sino-Russian relations in the region’s most important multilateral organisation, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. In this thesis the above query is assessed by three schools of thought: limitationism, alarmism and normalism. In scholarly discourse limitationist and alarmist discourses have been prevalent, but not entirely convincing, discussing the implications of the New Great Game on the SCO leadership. They have generally emphasised (and polarised) either the cooperative or the competitive nature of Sino-Russian relations in Central Asia’s and the SCO’s New Great Game scenario respectively. Conversely, the framework on which this thesis’ explanation of the Sino-Russian relations in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is based, is the altering balance of power, combined with dual cooperative and competitive Sino-Russian relations in Central Asia, as discerned by ‘normalists’. It can be concluded that analogous to their simultaneous converging and diverging interests in Central Asia at large, Sino-Russian relations in the SCO should be regarded as practical interrelations based on ‘complex reciprocity’ (Yu 2007, 79). They are a tacit compromise to, ultimately, let the SCO function as an satisfactory diplomatic forum where Moscow and Beijing can regulate the New Great Game: their relations in CA, China’s rise and Moscow’s traditional sphere of influence.","['Central Asia', 'China-Russia relations', 'China', 'Russia', 'Shanghai Cooperation Organization', 'SCO', 'New Great Game', 'Heartland Theory', 'Sino-Russian balance of power', 'Neorealism']"

In particular existing theories in “conventional” International Relations theory fail to fully explain the case of High-Speed Rail Diplomacy in Southeast Asia. What's interesting about China’s High-Speed Rail Diplomacy in Southeast Asia is that although territorial disputes have shaken the relationships of both China and Southeast Asian nations, there seems to be no tension in negotiations about infrastructural projects. Quite the opposite is happening, as both Southeast Asian Nations and China encourage bilateral negotiations when it comes to infrastructural projects. Current accounts on High-Speed Rail Diplomacy only view the development between a stark dichotomy between “good” or “bad”, failing in formulating statements to China’s state behaviour and its perspectives on its own rise. This research intends to introduce the theories of processual constructivism, which include the process approach and relationality theory, to the discussion on High-Speed Rail Diplomacy and China’s outbound infrastructure investment strategy. Finally, the theoretical framework of processual constructivism and its views on relationality will be applied to the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway project to illustrate how projects like these are a way for the Chinese government to operationalize a “peaceful Rise”.","['High-Speed Rail Diplomacy', 'Chinese foreign policy', 'Chinese International Relations Theory']"

Heritage as dispossession and re-appropriation: the case of Borobudur temple,"Guagnini, Sara","['Paskaleva, Elena']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I have traced the evolution of Borobudur from a sanctuary to a sacred landscape to show the role played by heritage in the production of, and resistance to, social inequalities. Moreover, I have looked at how all of this affects the space and connects heritage to broader agendas of sustainability. I have done so by focusing on a set of social actors such as Indonesian bureaucrats and NGOs workers related to the difference perceptions of the site as: a monumen nasional (national monument) to a taman nasional purkabala (archaeological park), to a taman wisata (tourism park), to a World heritage site, but also, from a site of kearifan lokal (local wisdom) to a saujana (cultural landscape), and particularly to a mandala saujana (Borobudur cultural landscape).On this background, I will attempt to answer the following questions: how notions of heritage are mobilized by social actors at Borobudur in such a way to produce, as well as to counter, social inequalities such as the social and cultural evacuation of the space? What limits and challenges do these social actors face? What lessons can be learned in terms of sustainability? My argument is that processes of heritage involve continuous re-negotiation of perceptions through encounters, alliances, and creative appropriations. If we want to understand to what extent the power of culture is taking over the culture of power in the contemporary historical moment in any given context, we should look at the dynamics of such articulations.","['heritage', 'spatial cleansing', 'governementality', 'sustainability', 'Borobudur temple']"

Education of Migrant Children: A Comparison between Shanghai’s and Germa-ny’s Education System,"Seidel, Julia","['Wang, Enoch', 'Pieke, Frank']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Education systems play a key role in integrating (im-) migrant children into society. In Shang-hai, migrant children do not have access to equal education, due to the household registration system. The local government has taken steps to gradually open public schools for migrants. However, it remains questionable if migrant children will be able to succeed if they have few-er resources of cultural and social capital. To illustrate how cultural and social capital influ-ence the educational success of students, Shanghai will be compared to the German education system. The example of Second generation Turkish immigrants' school performance is an indi-cation that the German education system underlies cultural and social capital constraints. Even though Shanghai's school's system has institutional barriers, a comparison can help to explain how mechanisms of social exclusion play out. A comprehensive school model could help to cancel out the effects of cultural and social capital. The aim of this research is to a deeper understanding of how education systems influence social mobility of (im-) migrants in different contexts.","['Education System', '(Im-) migration', 'Cultural and Social Capital', 'Social Mobility', 'Inequality']"

Gawain and Marriage: A Comparative Study of Middle English and Old French Literature,"Ruby, Éloïse","['Pelt, N.T. van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Gawain was one of the most popular Arthurian figures in medieval literature, featuring in numerous texts both as a protagonist and as a supporting character. Scholars have studied Gawain’s reputation and representation in literature in detail, yet the significance of marriage or of the absence of marriage in Gawain romances has been overlooked. This thesis examines Gawain’s relationships with women and his attitude towards women and matrimony in medieval romances, studying his portrayal both as a lover and as a husband in a selection of thirteenth to sixteenth century French and English Arthurian romances. I use a new, interdisciplinary approach by applying the framework of New Historicism to the romances I examine, and by discussing the themes of marriage and love in light of the texts’ cultural and political backgrounds and literary sources. My claim that the English Gawain’s motives and behaviour are portrayed as more virtuous and courteous than the French Gawain’s, both in pre-marital and marital relationships, is supported by a careful close reading and analysis of The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle, Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Ywain and Gawain, De Coniuge Non Ducenda; and Le Chevaliers as Deus Espees, Le Chevalier à l'Épée, and La Mule Sans Frein. Gawain marries more often in the English romances in this corpus, for the purpose of preserving his courtesy, that of others, or to stabilise a conflict; while he is more frivolous and rarely marries in the French romances. The married state contradicts elements of Gawain’s traditional French and English characterisation and is therefore almost always an imbalance and a temporary state which authors must right in the romances’ denouements. Based on my findings and discussion, I conclude that the various uses of marriage in the romances’ plots and Gawain’s different portrayals as a husband reflect regional and national traditions, as the romances were tailored to ruling elites with different concerns and backgrounds. The use of the culturally charged theme of marriage in Arthurian romances allowed authors to infuse romances with symbolical meaning.","['Gawain', 'Middle English', 'Arthurian romance', 'English literature', 'Marriage', 'Medieval marriage']"

A brief look at the historiographical context for this term and how the Mongols' public image has begun to change precede an analysis of sources from across the Mongol world in order to try to find out what Mongol rule meant to contemporaries. Tackling this issue via Persian, European, and non-Muslim sources from Armenia, Georgia and Iraq helps to provide a balanced view of the Mongols across time and space. Each chapter looks at a collection of sources for a picture of initial Mongol destruction to see how far territories under their control could have recovered, before moving on to address the burdens and benefits of Mongol rule for those they conquered. The chapters then end with a quick look at travel and trade (the pillars which Pax Mongolica is built on) across various regions and time periods. An analysis of each set of sources follows per chapter, with potted source studies to begin with for a frame of reference. Finally, a broader overview determining the existence or extent of Pax Mongolica is provided in the conclusion with some suggestions with how to move forward in the historical discourse.","['Mongols', 'Pax', 'Persia', 'China', 'Europe', 'Rashid al-Din', 'conquest']"

How does the emergence of the AIIB affect Sino-Japanese relations?,"Twiss, Jermaine Oscar Martinus Bram","['Verver, Michiel']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In January 2016, the newly established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) started its operations. Supposed by media and academics to be partly a reaction to an unsatisfying international financial system, the emergence of this bank - which is still ongoing - has incited heated debate about the intentions behind its founding. One point of concern for more conservative analysts is the effect of its emergence on Sino-Japanese relations. Is the AIIB aiming at changing these relations and in what way does it or does it not? This thesis argues that concerns over a supposed hidden agenda or over supposed structural changes in China's foreign relations are not completely reasonable. The way in which the AIIB has been presenting itself to the world in its first operational year does not confirm worries among media and academics so far. Consequently, based on its first operational year of extensive cooperation with other development banks, the AIIB seems to be an institution that is rather conducive than detrimental to global development, also to the extent of Sino-Japanese relations.",

Mental health behaviour in contemporary South Korea: the dynamics between professional mental health care and shaman practices as a possible alternative,"Duijn, Desiré van","['Breuker, R.E.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis investigates how sociocultural factors influence Koreans’ preference for alternative services instead of professional biomedical mental health services for disorders such as depression and anxiety in present-day South Korea. The starting point of enquiry is the claim that there are low biomedical mental health service utilization rates and the suggestion that people may prefer informal services over institutionalized, psychological care. This research investigates the possible conditions for this disparity, and the historical, socio-cultural reasons that may undergird such differential access. On the basis of a public discourse analysis, this thesis argues that a possible reason for this disparity could be that the access of professional services may be more stigmatized than alternative services. Due to a competitive landscape of possible alternatives, Koreans have a variety of options consisting of shamans, fortune tellers and pastors to choose from. Consequently, the following chapter shifts attention to the pull factors of shamanic ritual practices as a possible alternative for professional mental health care. This research suggests that as a result of a relatively more cultural sensitive approach, the flexibility of the shamanic ritual of kut furnishes feelings of reassurance, joy and unity for the client by providing means to individualize the ritual through language and materialization and a certain amount of playfulness.","['South Korea', 'Mental health behaviour']"

Many nation-states are tapping into their Silk Road past for the purposes of modernization, development, and creation of national identities. This process is critically explored examining the “authorized heritage discourse” of the Silk Road – those parts that are highlighted in particular, and dominate over others, according to top-down principles of “value” and “knowledge”. The alleged benefits of the authorized Silk Road discourse are contrasted through an examination of the lands that they purport to represent. Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is an area where urban sites have been transformed according to the top-down values of the authorized Silk Road discourse. However, it is argued that many of the local residents of these cities do not find benefit in these transformations, and instead reveal some of the core issues of the contemporary usage of the Silk Road. Two of these issues are highlighted in particular: gentrification and spatial cleansing. These have affected entire communities, which are assimilated into the Chinese nation through changing modes of identity formation. Meanwhile, cities are given of a false veneer of benefit that masks the new processes of exploitation that are taking place.","['Xinjiang', 'Urban', 'Heritage', 'Silk Road', 'China', 'Uyghur']"

Framing of the Uyghur ethnic group in Chinese media,"Kuiper, Jelle","['Schneider, Frank']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis, I analysed and interpreted 9 articles of the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the CCP, that most immediately followed the 5 July Urumqi events in 2009. When analysing, I focused on how the authors of the newspaper frame the Uyghur ethnic group. I expected that this newspaper would frame this ethnic group in a negative way and that the riots would be described as terroristic and a danger to the unity of the PRC. However, Most of my expectations of the analysis turned out to be untrue. The People’s Daily did not frame the Uyghur ethnic group in a negative way, as it did not even mention the existence of this group. It did frame the organizers, planners, and ‘bandits’ of these events in a negative way, but the articles never relate them to the Uyghur ethnic group. Also, the articles never related the events to terrorism directly. While they stated that the events threatened the unity of the Chinese multi-ethnic nation, the term terrorism was only indirectly linked with the 5 July events. This denial of the existence of a Uyghur collective identity can be interpreted as a matter of power, as the Uyghur separatists can not take part in the discourse created by these articles without being associated with the malicious forces from abroad. However, the articles frame the Uyghur ethnic group indirectly within the nationalist discourse of ethnic unity. I argue that the articles of the People’s Daily, by repeating the importance of maintaining ethnic unity and opposing ethnic discrimination, reflect the CCP policy of ronghe. Ronghe means the assimilation of the minorities to the majority, the Han. By not blaming the Uyghur ethnic group, but some far away vague forces and organizations, the CCP tries to maintain the Chinese multi-ethnic nation, including the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.","['Uyghur', ""People's Daily"", 'Ethnicity', 'Framing', 'July 2009 Events']"
Sex Work in South Korea: A Call for Decriminalisation,"Krens, Michelle","['Herber, E.D.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research answers the question: “How did sex work regulation develop in South Korea and what are the effects of the current regulation on sex workers in South Korea?” The goal is to show that sex work in (South) Korea is not a recent phenomenon and that the current practice of criminalising sex work has negative consequences for sex workers. I explain why the oppression and empowerment paradigm fail to account for the complexities of the sex industry. In this thesis I embrace Ronald Weitzer’s polymorphous paradigm, which recognises the diversity of variables in the sex industry that is necessary to effectively analyse sex work in South Korea. Using Weitzer’s pillars for a “best practise” of sex work (visibility, eligibility, health, rights and safety) I analyse the situation of three different kinds of sex workers: female indoor sex workers, male indoor sex workers and Bacchus ladies. The results of this analysis show that criminalization of sex workers in South Korea does little to improve their living conditions and can create life-threatening stations. In conclusion, I opt for decriminalisation of sex workers in South Korea and emphasise the importance of involvement of sex workers in policy making and research.","['South Korea', 'Decriminalisation', 'Sex Work']"

Empowerment and electricity: the role of identity in Iran’s alliance with Armenia after the Nagorno-Karabakh War,"Zeltzburg, Lilit","['Warnaar, Maaike']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"One of the most important actors in Middle Eastern politics today is the Islamic Republic of Iran. This country has been the subject of much controversy over the past years, partly due to the fact that it is the only state in the world that officially bases its domestic policy and legal system on Shi’a Islam. However, the extent to which Shi’ism influences Iran’s foreign policy has been disputed. It has been argued by some that Iran’s behaviour on the international arena has more to do with political and economic interests than with defending their religion; others have claimed that, on the contrary, some of the country’s actions cannot be explained without taking into account the influence of the Shi’a identity. One situation that has been explained from both perspectives is Iran’s decision to support Armenia, rather than their Shi’ite neighbour Azerbaijan, in the Nagorno-Karabakh war of 1988-1994. This conflict presents an interesting case study in the question of the influence of Shi’ism on Iran’s foreign policy. Some have claimed that Iran’s support of Armenia aligned perfectly with the Shi’a ideology of supporting and uplifting the oppressed, viewing Azerbaijan as the aggressor in the situation, rather than a fellow Shi’ite ally. At the same time, it is undeniable that Iran’s partnership with Armenia has provided and continues to provide economic benefits to both states. As such, the question arises: to what extent did the Iranian regime’s Shia identity influence the country’s decision to support Armenia, rather than Azerbaijan, in the Nagorno-Karabakh war?","['Iran', 'Armenia', 'Azerbaijan', 'Nagorno-Karabakh', 'Neo-realism', 'Identity', 'Islam', 'International Relations']"

The obstruction of international environmental regulations in the United States,"Moen, Brechtje","['Gageldonk, Maarten van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper researched several aspects contributing to the obstruction the United States faces when considering the implementation of international environmental policies. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was supposed to be a pivotal step in the international fight against climate change. However, the United States made the decision not to ratify this treaty. Since the Kyoto Protocol, the views of the American public on environmental issues have become increasingly polarized. The fossil fuel industry and the conservative movement both undertake actions with the aim to prevent the implementation of climate change legislation. The fossil fuel industry spends millions of dollars annually on obstructive climate lobbying. The goal of this lobbying is to influence the political sphere to oppose environmental regulations. There is a negative relation between the conservative movement and environmentalism, especially among political elites. The conservative movement is often opposed to environmentalism due to the fact that the ideology behind the conservative movement is against government intervention. The actions taken by the conservative movement and the fossil fuel industry are executed in order to weaken the position of the environmental movement. In order to minimize the negative effects of global warming, the threat of climate change needs to be put on the national agenda. Governmental support is needed to prevent the United States from continuing to be one of the largest contributors to the global amount of carbon dioxide emissions. In this thesis, the actions of the fossil fuel industry and the conservative movement are examined in order to understand the role they have in the obstruction of environmental agreements in the United States.","['environmental obstruction', 'environmental regulations', 'kyoto protocol', 'climate change']"

This paper explores the consequences of the measures and stance of the British government towards trade unions since 1979, focusing on the years when Thatcher was in office, and argues that during this period, overall, British trade unions'influence and power declined, as the balance of power shifted in favour of capital. The first part provides a historical background of post-WWII trade unionism in Britain. Then, Thatcher's measures and attitude towards trade unions are analyzed. Thirdly, a case study on the miners' strike illustrates in more concrete terms the effects of the British government's actions on trade unions. The final two chapters examine the responses of British organized labour to external (global economic changes) and internal (actions of the British government) pressures, and evaluate possible paths for the future to restore trade unions' influence and power.","['democracy', 'trade union', 'strike', 'labour', 'neoliberalism']"

Transnational Racial Consciousness and Fair Skin Discourses. First-Generation Indian Migrants in the Indian Diaspora in the Netherlands,"Qureshi, Shehnaaz","['Wickramasinghe, Nira']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"People’s physical appearances and beauty ‘from the outside’ have been part of a variety of cultural discourses for a long time in history. Though, in more recent times, human bodies have increasingly fell subject to the democratization of social norms and values, and as a result the body has become a reflection of symbolic meanings (Baghel et al., 2014). In culturally-diverse India, the image of beauty has been changing continuously but it is argued that one perspective on Indian physical beauty has remained quite stable (or at least appears to exist in contemporary India): the aspiration of having lighter skin colors (Kumar, 2002; Glenn, 2008). Even though many researchers recognized that racial categorizations based on skin colors have been reduced in different parts of the world, there still appears to be a correlation between beauty, skin color and social identity among some people in the Indian society today (Glenn, 2008). In examining to what extent skin lightening practices and aspirations have shifted from India to the Netherlands in a transnational context, the goal is to find out the perceived sense of racial consciousness of first-generation Indian migrants living in diaspora in the Netherlands. Grounded in the theories of Social Constructivism by Berger and Luckmann and Racial Identity theory by Helms, this thesis concludes that 1. Migration to the Netherlands has not changed the racial awareness of first-generation Indian migrants consciously 2. Skin color does play a role - though marginal - in migrant’s Indian intracultural environment in terms of marriages, but it is not significant in their Dutch intercultural environment. 3. Most of the first-generation Indian migrants living in the Netherlands do not use fairness creams, and if they do, it is for medical reasons rather than to match cultural and aspirational expectations.","['Migration', 'Diasporas', 'Racial consciousness', 'Skin color', 'Discourses', 'Transnationalism', 'India', 'Netherlands']"
"The Somali post-colonial failed state experience: the Italian Trusteeship Administration, Somali society and Siad Barre’s regime","Lux, Federico","['Bellucci, Stefano']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper aims at analysing how these two periods of Somalia’s recent history influenced and laid the foundations for rivalries between different factions within the country, which eventually exploded in an excruciating conflict. Firstly, the aim of this paper is to assess how and why the Italian administration of Somalia was overall a failure, and to which extent it was harmful for the future of the country as a whole. Indeed, the targets that the United Nations demanded Italy to achieve within a decade were out of reach for a newborn country that was still struggling with mending the wounds of the Second World War. Hence, there will be in-depth focus on the structural flaws that characterised the establishment of the Italian administration and it mistakes on a social and political level once operational in the country. Secondly, this thesis will analyse the societal structure of Somalia, which is for the vast majority based on clan divisions (Paolo Tripodi 361). The objective of this section to examine how such divisions played a crucial role in combination with the policies implemented by the colonial and post-colonial administrations, which proved to lack any specific knowledge of the “very complex system of clan families” (Richard Dowden 97). Thirdly, this paper will aim at analysing the influence of Siad Barre’s regime, and how the policies he attempted to implement acted as gunpowder for a perfectly mixed explosive machinery","['Somalia', 'Italy', 'Siad Barre', 'United Nations Trusteeship']"

These movements have had a strong influence on popular entertainment, and have spawned a myriad of books, films and TV series.During the same time period the art of animation has also emerged as one of the most profitable media genres and as a powerful means for reaching millions of young children and their families. These representations of environmentalism have received attention from academia, however coverage of productions lying outside of the mainstream films from Disney, Pixar and the Japanese Studio Ghibli remains rather scarce. Furthermore, previous studies have primarily focused on the environmentalist discourse manifested in singular films, which does allow for an in-depth analysis of the work itself, but does not permit for more widely applicable conclusions to be drawn, such as through a comparative analysis of Western and Japanese animation.Thus the research question that this thesis attempts to provide an answer to is “how do approaches to environmentalist discourse in Japanese and non-Japanese animated films/television series compare to each other and what are the implications for the entertainment industry as a tool to disseminate such discourses?”For this purpose it analyses the contemporary state of environmentalism in the West and in Japan. Afterwards several case studies are performed and conclusions are reached that there are specific ways in which nature and environmentalist discourse are portrayed in the West and in Japan, and that they have significant implications for the industry.","['Environmentalism', 'Animation', 'Japan']"

Het omvallen van het Tokugawa shogunaat had ook grote gevolgen voor religieuze groeperingen, waaronder de boeddhistische organisaties. Naast het feit dat deze niet meer de privileges hadden die ze wel genoten onder het shogunaat, werd er ook een hoop materieel, waaronder tempels, kunst en grondgebied, goed beschadigd tijdens de haibutsu kishaku 廃仏毀釈 . Sommige vormen en organisaties binnen het Boeddhisme, zoals Shugendo (de praktijk van het verkrijgen van niet-alledaagse krachten in het berggebied), werden verboden, ceremonies werden verboden of overgenomen. Een echter nog belangrijker gevolg voor het Boeddhisme in Japan toendertijd was het inhoudelijk aanpassen aan de moderniteit, Westers gedachtegoed en het nieuwe geïmporteerde concept religie wat tot voor kort nog niet bestond in Japan. In deze thesis wordt gekeken wat er door deze reorganisaties van het rituele landschap allemaal is veranderd binnen het Japanse Boeddhisme en wat Japans Boeddhisme überhaupt inhoudt. Vervolgens wordt ook het gedachtegoed van enkele geleerden besproken, wiens gedachtegoed invloed heeft gehad op de shinbutsu bunri en de manier waarop de situatie van het Japanse Boeddhisme door deze scheiding is veranderd.

The Black Man and the Bomb: The interconnection between racism and anti-nuclear protests in South Africa and the United States,"Tiel, Max Wouter","['Scott-Smith, Giles']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The 1970’s are commonly known as a period of détente, or ease of tensions during the Cold War. But despite that, existing nuclear powers as the United States were still developing new weaponry and enlarging their nuclear arsenal whilst new nuclear powers such as South Africa entered the world stage. This created a situation in which large groups of peoples felt the need to start protesting the nuclear developments again, and a new wave of anti-nuclear protests started halfway through the 1970’s. A particular group of peoples participated in these protests: black anti-nuclear protesters. But to what extent were racism and anti-nuclear protests interconnected in the United States and South Africa between 1976 and 1981? This thesis provides a comparison of the black protest movements in these two countries to provide a starting point for an international research on the interconnection between racial discrimination and anti-nuclear protests. There is an interconnection between racial discrimination and anti-nuclear protests. Both African Americans and black South Africans felt a feeling of injustice and felt racially discriminated due to the nuclear policies of their countries. For the African American protesters, the investments in the nuclear programme were unacceptable because they had very poor living conditions, much worse than white Americans. For the South African black protesters, the nuclear developments by the white minority government had to be stopped since this provided much military strength for the government. In their opinion, the racist apartheid laws could never be ended if the government gained such a strong position in Africa. David Meyer’s theory of Political Opportunity Structure explains that successful protest groups in the past managed to become part of the political system and step into the political space, instead of just showing their dissatisfaction with the government policy. Being well institutionalized in society would make it easier to step into the political space that was present in the détente period. But for the South African protesters this was much harder than for the American protesters since they could only institutionalize themselves in a revolutionary organization such as the ANC, or in church organisations such as the AACC. This resulted in a great difference in the way the protest movements were organized in the United States and South Africa, and in the protest methods they used. Both the American and the South African protesters were aware that the nuclear developments in their countries were dependent on foreign allies or enemies, and although the movements were very different, both relied heavily on international allies. There was also contact between the South African and the American protesters, but this did not result in a clear transfer of ideas.","['anti-nuclear', 'protest movements', 'United States', 'South Africa', 'AACC', 'ANC', 'Political Opportunity Structures']"

Women and Post-Disaster Management in Japan: Voices from Tohoku,"George, Sabrina","['Cheuk, Ka-Kin']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the aftermath of a disaster, women’s suffering is often compounded in the face of increased vulnerabilities to physical and mental illness, unsafe temporary living conditions, and the many instances in which women’s opinions, requests, and capabilities are ignored. This thesis discusses gender inequality within post-disaster management in Japan, with a focus on the 2011 Triple Disaster which consisted of an earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown within the Tohoku region. The framework of gender within public health and post-disaster management is used to examine women’s experiences in the response and recovery phases of the Triple Disaster as seen through film and academic literature. This paper argues that the role of women in the aftermath of the disaster reflected and reinforced gender inequality in Japanese society. The inadequate living conditions for women in emergency shelters, the silencing of women’s voices after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown, and the distinct lack of female participation in disaster management all give credence to the notion that the gender dimension of disasters was and continues to be significantly overlooked. It is evident that the gender issues present in the aftermath of the 2011 disaster are part of larger societal structures not only in Japan but also in the wider field of public health.","['gender inequality', 'post-disaster management', 'Japan', 'anti-nuclear movement', 'public health', 'gender', 'Triple Disaster', 'Fukushima', 'natural disaster', 'earthquake']"

Analysis concerns a sample of articles highlighting dichotomies between the conceptual blocs of “Western Civilization” and “Islamic Civilization”; specifically the representation of Daesh on both sides of the discursive equation as a neo-orientalized entity, thereby arguably re-enforcing conceptions of Islam as an inherently barbaric, medieval, and threatening culture and religion. Based on the samples analyzed, this thesis uncovers a self-perpetuating cycle of neo-orientalist representation of Daesh, identifiable on a micro scale in its own publications as well as the British news publication. Similarities concerning the representation of Daesh in the scrutinized samples are identified and deemed problematic, opening discussion into the realm of the ethics and responsibility of contemporary journalism.","['neo-orientalism', 'self-orientalization', 'news discourse', 'new barbarism', 'journalism', 'propaganda', 'denial of coevalness', 'clash of civilizations', 'ISIS']"

A section devoted to the particular strategies that apply to the penetration into China clarifies that this phenomenon is capable of reaching out to a difficult to reach audience. The case study of a popular Korean drama series will exemplify how and why the Hallyu took off in China. Furthermore, perspective will be given to the receiving side of the phenomenon. The Chinese audience has different opinions on the influence of the Korean wave. It appears to not just be embraced, there are also critics who are skeptical towards the phenomenon. The connection between this skepticism and the sociopolitical field will be considered regarding the relationship between China and the Korean peninsula. The implications of the Korean wave on this relationship show to be relevant towards the behavior of the North East Asian region on a political field.","['Korean wave', 'cultural products', 'China', 'soft power', 'sociopolitical field']"
Development Through Trade: A Win-Win Situation?,"Stuurman, Linda M.","['Ligtvoet, Inge']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2005, the WTO Aid for Trade initiative was launched, with the aim of intensifying the involvement of developing countries in global trade to stimulate development. Various aspects of the program have been praised and criticized. However, the activities of multinational companies in the context of Aid for Trade seem to have been neglected. Western companies have been supported by Western governments to conduct business in Africa, as a result of Aid for Trade. As such, Corporate Social Responsibility becomes increasingly important as these companies are expected to be contributors to development. This paper examines to what extend Corporate Social Responsibility can contribute to development in Africa. Research is conducted through case studies of Western, responsible companies that are active in Africa. Analysis of these cases shows that, despite extensive CSR-programs, companies tend to favor their own interest over the African interest, resulting in very limited, or no actual contributions to development in African countries.","['Aid for Trade', 'Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Development', 'Africa', 'Heineken', 'Afriflora', 'Glencore']"

Taking into account Chechnya’s past turbulent struggle for independence, the research question for this thesis is: Why have Chechens minimized their attempts to secede from Russia? The analysis uses a model of Sorens, based on the rational decision making of individuals, in order to uncover the current disincentives to secede for Chechen individuals. The analysis asserts that individuals need to be convinced of the benefits of independence, and need to believe that Chechnya could be a viable state on its own. The conclusion of this thesis is that there are a wide variety of considerations that have contributed to the demise of secessionism in Chechnya. The most important considerations are: firstly, that the economic and political costs of independence have come to outweigh the benefits; and secondly, that the costs of collective action have become too high due to the significant level of repression in Chechnya. This thesis aims to contribute to the existing academic literature on secessionism in general by showing that the concept is not as clear-cut as is often assumed, and that there are a wide variety of components that need to be taken into account.","['Chechnya', 'Russia', 'Secession']"

The ‘’rise’’ of China has been subject of ongoing discussion with a main focus on China’s move from being a developing country to an increasingly powerful state (Narayanan 647, 654). It led to a heated debate among American political scientists and I.R. scholars, since many perceived China as possible a threat to the stability of the international order and the United States’ power position. Especially realist scholars predicted large conflict between the US and China in the future. However, thereafter other political scientist and I.R. scholars stepped forward to counter these arguments. A different standpoint asks for a different strategy in approaching China, nevertheless no consensus on what foreign policy the US should follow could be reached. The debate on what China would do in the future and what it would mean for the international order is not just one of the past. In fact, it is still going on. The question is whether these debates actually have brought forward some accurate predictions that could be used when designing the foreign policy of the US, or that some theories already have proved to be faulty and therefore can be disregarded. In addition, I will have a look at whether there is a certain ‘’anti-Chineseness’’ present when theorising China’s future and the potential threat the country could become.","['China', 'United States', 'International Relations', 'Foreign Policy', 'Rise of China']"
Advocatus Diaboli: A Contrarian Stance on the Chinese policy of ‘Hukou’,"Harrison, Emily","['Wang, Jue']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Internal migration in China has created a serious problem that has been identified by many scholars and policy makers for decades. The Chinese government attempts to restrict migration flow through a policy called ‘hukou’ that in its simplest form ties individuals to accessing public services only in one registered location meaning agricultural hukou type people can find moving to urban areas extremely difficult; ultimately creating a dualistic society within China and the policy has led to massive displacement and discrimination of one fifth of the population. Given the controversial and discriminatory nature of hukou, this paper will analyse why the Chinese government would choose to continue to implement such a policy and how through hukou’s implementation, the Chinese leadership is able to maintain domestic stability and have it contribute to their continued legitimacy through success in the fields of economic prosperity, social stability and national unity. The paper will examine both the economic and political benefits of hukou and the reasons why this may affect the decision to reform the policy.","['hukou', 'legitimacy', 'economic', 'political', 'migration', 'China', 'urbanisation']"

Rendaku in Japanese Surnames,"Bokhorst, Michelle van","['Uegaki, Wataru']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"There are many irregularities regarding rendaku (sequential voicing) in Japanese surnames (Sugito 1965, Kubozono 2005, Tanaka 2017). A characteristic of Japanese surnames is that the final consonant of the first element of the name determines whether rendaku occurs. It is possible to categorize these surnames based on the natural class in which the consonant belongs. This classification can explain rendaku in surnames to a certain extent, but there are still many irregularities within a category and even within specific surnames, where names can occur both with and without rendaku. Therefore the purpose of this research is to have a clear overview of rendaku in surnames by investigating the variation within a category and within specific surnames. The first aim of this research is to investigate whether the rendaku rate depends on dialects, since an informal report of the Nikkei Shinbun suggests that a few surnames undergo rendaku more often in East Japan (Iwasaki 2013). The second aim of this research is to further investigate the occurrence of rendaku within a category in order to explain the irregularities. Furthermore, it is investigated if there is a connection between the regional variation of rendaku and the category to which a surname belongs. In order to investigate this, 231 native speakers of Japanese filled out a digital questionnaire in which they were asked for the region they came from and to convert 80 surnames written in kanji into hiragana. The results indicate that the region seems to determine variation within a surname. However, there is no connection between a category and regional variation. This thesis presents three possible explanations for the irregularities within a category. Firstly, the word type of the first element might have an effect on rendaku. Secondly, for some morphemes it is lexically specified whether they undergo rendaku or not, regardless of the category. Thirdly, external factors such as the names of people in the surroundings or well-known place names might also influence the results.","['phonology', 'rendaku', 'Japanese', 'surnames', 'regional variation', 'sequential voicing', 'dialects']"
Cross-border Integration in the Greater Copenhagen Area and the Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai Eurometropolis: The Effect of EU Cross-Border Policy,"Cingöz, Cinar","['Regilme, S.S.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the last decades, the processes of Europeanisation and globalisation have resulted in a reduction of economic barriers between countries and an increasing pace of connectivity among them. For cross-border urban areas, facing increasing economic challenges and competition from large financial powerhouses such as London and Paris, ensuring cross-border economic integration has become a pivotal strategy. From the 1957 Rome Treaty, to current cohesion funds such as Interreg and legal cooperation mechanisms such as the EGTC, the EU has aimed to assist these areas in their challenges and ensure economic progress. The Greater Copenhagen Area, consisting of the cities of Copenhagen and Malmö and the Eurometropolis, comprising the cities of Lille, Kortrijk and Tournai, are two cross-border areas which have profited considerably from EU funding and have established various projects. Although both regions share many geographic and organisational similarities, their economic conditions and strategies differ considerably. While the Greater Copenhagen area has become a relatively developed area and established a decentralised cooperation structure based on Interreg funding, the Eurometropolis is defined by considerable local differences and, through the EGTC programme, has established a cross-border partnership of a legal nature. After several decades of EU regional financial assistance and increasing critical rhetoric towards EU policies, the thesis aimed at examing economic development in the Greater Copenhagen area and the Eurometropolis by focussing on two areas, namely infrastructure and mobility and employment. In the case of the former, the construction of the Oresund Bridge provided an opportunity for local authorities to enhance cooperation among local authorities and introduce new infrastructure projects. Further integration in Danish and Swedish employment markets was identified and aims to further enhance mobility between Copenhagen and Malmö. Development in the Eurometropolis in terms of mobility and employment has been significant, however, large infrastructure projects between the cross-border areas have not been realised, albeit the strong opportunities to do so. Considering the aforementioned developments, it is argued that EU influence has indeed provided for considerate economic development in both areas. Although progress in both infrastructure and mobility and employment has been indicated, the research has established as well challenges to further cross-border integration, some of which being a lack of national authorities to increase cross-border cooperation and their inability to fully advantage EU financial assistance.",['Cross Border Integration EU Cohesion Policy']

Gamification in Japan: a critical analysis,"Hooghiemstra, Dave","['Veere, Henny van der']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Recent years have marked the beginning of a new era for businesses to engage customers with their brand and products, using the internet as the primary mediator. Social media has proved to play a pivotal role in providing new ways of customer engagement and encouraging customer’s buying behavior, of which a concept known as “gamification” has grown out to become a global phenomenon. In this thesis I will provide an answer to the question of how the concept of gamification has developed within the Japanese market and for what purposes it is used in contemporary Japan, in both commercial and non-commercial contexts. I will demonstrate how gamification can be used as a mechanism to urge on a user’s intrinsic motivation, by utilizing extrinsically motivating game elements such as rewards. Implementing gamification in a company’s business strategy can be an effective way to engage customers, which then has the potential of establishing new, or strengthening existing relationships. This will be demonstrated based on a variety of examples within the Japanese context, including convenience-store chain Seven-Eleven Japan and Japanese idol group AKB48.","['gamification', 'Japan', 'games', 'motivation', 'play']"
Three Anniversaries of the Crimean Reunification with Russia: Analyzing Legitimization Strategies in Russian Media Justifying the Intervention in Crimea,"Loman, R.M.J.","['Boele, O.F.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the strategies that the Russian regime uses to legitimize the Crimean intervention in 2014. It will do so by analyzing news articles from RT and Komsomolskaya Pravda that are concerned with the first, second, and third anniversary celebrations of the Crimean reunification with Russia. Furthermore, the Russia-1 documentary Crimea: The Way Home will be assessed, which was broadcast one year after the intervention in Crimea. Using Von Soest and Grauvogel’s literature on legitimization strategies in post-Soviet authoritarian states, it can be concluded that the Russian regime employs several strategies in order to justify its actions regarding the intervention in Crimea. The main strategies are concerned with President Putin being framed as a charismatic leader of the Russian state, the claim that the Russian regime acted according to procedural mechanisms, and the foundational myth that Russia and Crimea share. Employing these and other claims to legitimacy, the Russian regime aims at justifying its actions and mobilizing public support, not only from the Russian population, but also on an international level.","['Crimean annexation', 'Russian media', 'Komsomolskaya Pravda', 'Russia-1', 'RT', 'Legitimization strategies']"

The Internet and Parliamentary Democracy,"Fleuri, Lucas","['Heyer, Anne']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Abstract: There has been an ongoing academic debate on whether the use of the internet is either positive or negative for citizen engagement and/or political participation. The role the internet has on political participation can be divided into three domains: its use as a communication source, its use as a communication medium, and its use as a virtual public sphere. Scholars that argue against the positive role of the internet on political participation find in their research of these domains that the internet doesn’t drastically increase citizen engagement. Therefore, they see the internet as an inefficient method of increasing political participation. However, this thesis is departure from previous studies as it does not measure success as the increase of new citizen engagement, but instead sees the increase of participation by those citizens that are already politically engaged as a success. This study examines how the internet can be used for politically engaged citizens to keep informed of parliamentary democracy through Parliamentary Monitoring Websites (PMWs). Parliamentary Monitoring Websites play a pivotal role in strengthening parliamentary democracy and these PMWs have been made possible by the evolution of information and communications technologies (ICTs). This thesis explores how the different innovations of ICTS have contributed to strengthening parliamentary democracy by studying current Parliamentary Monitoring Websites in the United Kingdom.","['Political participation', 'parliamentary democracy', 'information and communication technologies', 'parliamentary monitoring websites.']"

Starting from the analysis of current theories on photography and art, I will see how they can be applied to documentary photography, regarded as a practice that only aims at informing the public. Then, tracing back to colonial photography, I will show how documentary photography appears to present an aesthetic of its own, which has had a fundamental role in the structuring and circulation of fantasies, sentiments and ideas between “Western” countries and Asia. Besides, I will determine to what extent this aestheticization of Asian countries has been fostered by contemporary magazines, such as National Geographic. Finally, through the analysis of some of the most iconic images by the documentary photographer Steve McCurry, I wish to show how in the name of artistry, the documentary practice is failing in providing the viewer with visual documents.","['photography', 'documentary', 'aesthetics', 'asia', 'art']"

Sino-Japanese relations are often described as having ‘warm’ economic relations, but ‘cold’ political relations. While some scholars argued these relations can coexist without influencing each other, recent studies show that political tensions between China and Japan can also impact economic relations. Because of this, this thesis expected the Chinese business community to attempt to influence the government during periods of heightened Sino-Japanese tension. After an analysis of the voice of governmental actors and the business community in government publications and media sources published around the time of the 2005 and 2012 anti-Japanese protests, this thesis concludes that 1) Chinese businesses attach considerable importance to Sino-Japanese political disputes and in some cases attach more importance to these disputes than financial gain, 2) There is no clear evidence that public attempts to influence the government were made during these two periods.","['China', 'Japan', 'Sino-Japanese relations', 'business', 'Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands', 'policy', 'lobbying']"
How to think like a Zhuangzian sage; the logic of not knowing if one knows anything,"Fidrmuc, Jan","['Els, Paul van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Zhuangzi is an ancient Chinese philosophical text written in the Warring States period. The text is usually classed as Daoist, a strain of philosophy whose core message is traditionally summed up something like ‘go with the flow’ . In the Zhuangzi specifically, the author (whose name is also Zhuangzi ) shows us how to do this with some pretty intense logical discussions. In these discussions Zhuangzi often uses the example of an ideal person to show how the logic of the book can be put into practice in the optimal way. This ideal person, usually referred to as the sage, can be seen as representing something close to the goal of the whole book. The aim of this essay is to find the many aspects of this sage and to mould them into one congruent whole. The Zhuangzi was written in turbulent times and, according to Watson, all philosophical texts of this time were written to answer the question: how can man live while there is such horrific things happening around him ? Watson says that, contrary to his contemporaries, Zhuangzi tried to solve this problem by escaping the world, rather than by trying to create systems in which men could thrive. Watson suggests that “the central theme […] may be summed up in a single word: freedom.” Kuppermann defines the Zhuangzi as a text which is supposed to cause self-transformation, leading to a better life . Puett somewhat incorporates both these views into one. He says that Zhuangzi was concerned about people being restricted, although his solution is to be bound by nothing but by the innate rules of existence: ""Zhuangzi turns out to strongly be committed to the notion that there are proper patterns in the natural world that a cultivated person will inherently follow."" Ivanhoe echoes this statement with the line: ""There is a pattern in nature and Daoist sage follows it. While from the perspective of Heaven all things are equally valued, they each have a proper place and follow their roles."" This Heavenly pattern is referred to by the Zhuangzi as the Dao, or the Way. According to Ivanhoe, ""[Zhuangzi] thinks some people understand not only a better way but the Way. People who grasp the Way and embody it are able to move through life with profoundly enhanced power and ease"" . Does the Zhuangzi however, even have a point? Recently, scholars have had big problems with accepting the fact that Zhuangzi seems to recommend and criticize certain views while he at other times ""seems to advocate radical skepticism and relativism"" . Although the Zhuangzi shows many types of skepticism this essay will discuss mainly epistemological skepticism and relativism pertaining to perspectives. Hansen argues that Zhuangzi is genuine in his extreme skepticism and that Zhuangzi believes that there is no innate concept of right and wrong, and that therefore every way is right . As some authors have noted, it seems contradictory to think that Zhuangzi would try to convince others of his perspective after telling them their perspective is already right. Hansen believes that Zhuangzi only criticized other people because it is natural for him to do so: ""Like the sages, we have an innate disposition to discriminate—to shih-fei in the conventional Confucian way."" I still consider this an unsatisfactory answer. One of my main reasons for this is that if every way is equally right, then there would be no sage. Zhuangzi would not have needed to write about an ideal person if everyone was an ideal person. Most other authors have argued against Hansen’s reading. Schwitzgebel tried to argue that Zhuangzi is not sincere in his skepticism, that he uses skepticism as a sort of therapy , Ivanhoe seems to hold a similar view . This is the view that is most different from Hansen. There are also readings that attempt the seemingly impossible, those that say that Zhuangzi was genuine in his perspective relativism while still trying to give the reader some sort of advice. Ziporyn’s work is probably the best example of this. Roth goes for the recently abandoned mystical version, but includes a discussion on skepticism. He quotes Lisa Raphals as saying that the Zhuangzi makes use of skeptical methods but not skeptical doctrines. Raphals argues that there is one type of knowing ’illumination’ which is exempt from Zhuangzi's skepticism. My view has similarities to all of these views. What seems to have evaded the scholarly community is that this contradiction can be solved using almost the same logic as Hansen, but to prove a different point. We can agree with Hansen’s idea that Zhuangzi's skepticism and relativism is aimed at showing there is no innate right. Then, contrary to Hansen I will claim that it is exactly this equality that makes Zhuangzi say it is pointless to debate. Since there is no innate right everyone has to accept that they cannot put more value in their own opinion than in that of others. Since Zhuangzi entered the debate does this not mean he contradicts himself? It does not. Zhuangzi is only critical of others’ partiality towards a certain perspective. This is comparable someone criticizing an offensive war while commending defensive ones, as was done by the Mohists . This attitude of giving precedence to one’s own viewpoint over those of others is referred to by Zhuangzi as Weishi, which he contrasts with yinshi: ""[t]he former involves a rigid attachment to oneself and one’s intellectual commitments; the latter involves a complete freedom from such an attachment, a freedom to act spontaneously as the situation demands."" It is important to note that Yinshi is not a perspective, it is more of a state of mind or, to use Roth’s words: a mode of adherence to viewpoints . I will try to argue that the Zhuangzian sage adopts a certain mode of thinking that anyone can make use of no matter what his original perspective. This state of mind will change one’s own perspective, in fact, the aim of this state of mind is to lose attachment to one’s perspective so that one can change between perspectives according to what the situation might require. Roth talks of a state where one is even more removed from perspectives than in the yinshi state. This state is called ""losing the self"". This state involves complete impartiality to perspectives, which, Zhuangzi says will make us adopt whatever perspective is most useful in any situation. Thus, what we saw earlier as the aims of the Zhuangzi: living a better, freer life, should be happen more easily after losing the self. I wish to shed further light on the understanding of this concept by linking it to the “self loss experiences” described by Simpson. These experiences, he writes have been described by people of many different cultures, usually in a religious context, therefore proving it is a real experience that many people, if not all, have access to. In the conclusion I will explain how these two topics: skepticism/relativism, and losing the self are connected in the sage; how the sage uses knowledge of these things to act in a way (that the author of the) Zhuangzi would approve of. One thing for the reader to bear in mind is that the sagely state of mind should be applicable to every person. The goal of the Zhuangzi is for its reader to achieve his own goal. Somewhat paradoxically however, this involves changing one’s goals depending on the situation, since the achievement of one’s goals depends especially on what goals one has set for oneself. This is somewhat of a ever changing process and this essay is my best attempt to explain it in a linear fashion.","['Zhuangzi', 'Sage', 'How to go with the flow']"

"The MENA region, the virtual water trade, and the opportunity cost of agriculture","Bacon, Daniel","['Ennis, C.A.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The agricultural virtual water trade is estimated to contribute 248 billion cubic metres to the water security of the MENA region every year, and this thesis examines the theory of the virtual water trade to find out how exactly the region has integrated into that trade. Despite sizeable and growing virtual water dependence in the region, and a state of abstract water scarcity, 85 percent of MENA water withdrawals are still committed to agriculture. For the region to commit its scarce water resources to low-value productivity such as agriculture carries a very high opportunity cost. This paper will ask the following questions: How has the MENA region integrated into the virtual water trade, what is the opportunity cost of its agricultural policies, and how does it perpetuate its agricultural policies? This paper makes two principal arguments. Firstly, this paper acknowledges the important role played by imported foodstuffs in meeting the food and water security needs of the region. Generally, the region imports low-value water-intensive crops such as wheat, and exports higher-value crops such as tomatoes and citrus fruits, though until recently wheat production has also been prominent and widespread in the region. This paper argues that because the MENA region relies on water from rivers and aquifers (blue water) to irrigate, whereas other parts of the world can make use more of soil moisture (green water), the opportunity costs for the water use in the MENA region are far greater than those in other parts of the world. This paper will make an attempt to calculate those costs, showing that the MENA region exports virtual water for a far higher opportunity cost than is borne by those countries that export virtual water to the MENA region. Secondly, this paper argues that the region’s reliance on imported virtual water backgrounds and conceals policies of water mismanagement and misallocation – policies which are then perpetuated by nationally and internationally funded major water engineering projects that prolong unsustainable practices.","['virtual water', 'agriculture', 'trade', 'MENA', 'irrigation', 'water security']"

The analysis of the Russian Orthodox Church's basic teaching on human dignity freedom and rights, an official church document published in 2008 is central to this research. The content reveals a large difference between the Orthodox Christian world view and the Western liberal world view. Whereas Orthodox Christianity defines freedom as freedom from evil, Western liberalism defines freedom as individual autonomy. Connected to this difference in definition is the rejection of the philosophical foundation of Western society by the Russian Orthodox Church. What motivates the church to oppose liberalism is the protection of Christians in their quest for salvation. Taking into account the opinions of other scholars who have analyzed this document, I conclude that its publication points to a strategy adopted by patriarch Kirill. This strategy can be summarized as seeking to enlarge the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in society, without doing concessions in terms of dogma.","['Russian Orthodox Church', 'human rights', 'religion', 'morality politics', 'norm entrepreneurship']"
Video Games and U.S Military recruiting – A case study of America’s Army,"Latz, Dennis","['Bloemendal, Albertine']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Is the game America's Army a valid representation of the US military and functions as a successful recruitment device in the cyber age? In order to answer those questions, this paper will analyse the game America's Army in detail. Whether the game is a valid representation of the US military will be depicted with the help of a set of sub-questions that are related to the ethical side of the new recruitment device. Valid in this scenario undermines that the use of violent games as a strategic deployment to attract people to the military is in todays cyber age not a new phenomenon and one that does not harm the youth. In order to measure the validity of the game, however, a section about the effects of the Teen-rating the game received will further shed light on the ethical critiques some scholars put forward. A teen rating in video games allows the army to attract players to the game from an age of 13 onwards and thus expose young players to the world of war. In the end this paper aims to answer the question whether one can then still talk about a valid representation or whether the army officials put forth the wrong set of analysis and would have been better off with creating more of a commercialised game that has a standardised age limit of at least 18 years. Furthermore, this paper will measure success with the help of the intentions the game producers had while creating the game. There are two key intentions that will be closely taken into account while answering this question. Firstly, reaching a young audience with the help of the Teen rating and secondly informing the public about the military. In order to measure the success here, this paper will analyse statistics about the amount of downloads the game received. An analysis of how the game effectively informs the public about the military will be conducted to further understand the dynamics of the new recruitment device. Comparison and components of analysis of other commercialised video games that are deemed to be the most popular ones in the video game industry will then further establish whether the army managed to create a game that fulfils the standards that effectively lead to a big audience of players.","['US military recruiting', 'video games', ""America's Army""]"

Too often did not only the army and the political officers on the ground, but the government officials in London as well work without a clear goal in mind. The question that begs to be asked is who was responsible for the policy in Mesopotamia. Hence, this is a study of the interaction within the British Empire during and right after World War I and its effects on policy development in Mesopotamia. When you zoom in on the British Empire, you will notice a diverse range of interests. This world encompassing Empire was not a monolith. Different regions and different political entities had conflicting ideas on the future of Mesopotamia.

Door de jaren heen heeft Japan haar drugsbeleid ingevoerd en aangepast naar aanleiding van internationale invloeden en binnenlandse opkomst van drugsgebruik onder de bevolking.

Recently, there has been an increase in the representation of lower classes on screen and domestic servants have more representation, even though it is limited. The attention on the previously ignored is a shift from traditional values and breaks social taboos. The movies La Nana (Sebastian Silva, Chile, 2009) and Que Horas Ela Volta?

This thesis provides a cultural study on film narrative and style, covering class, gender and ethnicity differences on the maids in a comparison of La Nana and Que Horas Ela Volta?. These movies aim to present class division in Chile and Brazil with the maid as narrative and make the maid visible. However, this thesis argues that maids are a little visible with their presence in movies, but unheard. The hypothesis is that the movies address the social oppression of domestic servants and although the new identity-forming of lower classes is somewhat broken through, the maid remains a largely invisible, ambiguous, and unrepresented character.","['Latin America', 'Domestic Servants', 'Maids', 'Film Studies']"

Against this background, this thesis sets out to investigate the ways in which collaboration between public and private actors has been realized in the case of Swedish development aid, and the role that recipient ownership has received in this context. Having been among the most progressive actors in the field of development aid, Sweden has sought close cooperation with the private sector, as well as aid recipients throughout its practices. In order to gain a better understanding of the changes which have taken place over the course of the years, a case study analysis is conducted of Sweden’s past engagement in the form of the ‘Small Industries Program’ in Tanzania on the one hand, and its recent private sector support through the ‘Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund’ on the other.","['Ownership', 'Sida', 'Small Industries Program', 'Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund', 'Swedish Development Cooperation', 'Development Aid', 'Sweden', 'Public Private Partnerships']"

They also both ended their premierships on the same day, 28th November 1990. A country’s prime minister can act as the main representative of the government and often the leader reflects the country’s policy. Therefore, this BA thesis will analyze the questions: How does the relationship of Lee Kuan Yew and Margaret Thatcher illustrate the alliance between the former coloniser and the colonised? And how did they perceive each other as prime ministers?","['Lee Kuan Yew', 'Margaret Thatcher', 'Singapore', 'United Kingdom', 'postcolonialism', 'Special Relationship', 'colonialism']"

Reviewers Sharp as a Knife: The Reception of La Sakakin fi Matabikh Hadhihi al-Madina by Khaled Khalifa,"Weiland, Nienke","['Naeff, Judith A.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis deals with the reception of Lā Sakākīn fī Maṭābikh Hādhihi al-Madīna, a novel about an aristocratic family living in Aleppo, that disintegrates more and more due to the influence of the ruling party. It was composed by Syrian writer Khaled Khalifa, and published in 2013. For the research project, a combination of online sources was examined, namely official reviews published on websites of newspapers, and reader responses on social networking site Goodreads. After giving an overview of reception theory and Arabic literary criticism over time, the method used for analysing the texts is described. It was derived from an article by Wendy Griswold, in which she divided readers into different audiences and described their evaluations. The same is done in the thesis, readers are divided according to the language they communicate in (Arabic vs. English / Dutch), as well as concerning the way they publish their reactions (use of social media vs. official websites). Succeeding chapters discuss important findings, firstly with regard to literary value, secondly regarding politics, and thirdly concerning social morals. Its excellent reception in the Arabic world was called into question, as well as the assumption that ‘Western’ critics do not comment on the literary value of Arabic novels. The thesis concludes by summarising its results, of which the most outstanding may be the critical attitude towards authority of users of social media in combination with their, on the whole, conservative ideas.","['Reception', 'Arabic', 'Literature', 'Syria', 'Khalifa']"
Het verband tussen schoolstress en stressoren,"Schönherr, Yka","['Veere, Henny van der']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Hiroshi Ono, een Japanse professor die gespecialiseerd is in educatie, sociologie en economie, bespreekt in zijn “Does Examination Hell Pay Off?” het beruchte fenomeen in Japan waarin prestatiedruk hoog ligt. Japanse middelbare scholieren met de aspiraties om te studeren aan het hoger onderwijs zijn zich bewust van het intensieve proces dat hen te wachten staat. Vanwege de Japanse cultuur staat het namelijk zeer hoog in het vaandel dat zij terecht komen op een universiteit van hun voorkeur. Deze zijn vaak prestigieus van aard. Hoe hoger de instituut in het klassement staat, hoe groter de kans is om na de studie te belanden in een bedrijf dat eveneens prestigieus van aard is. Bedrijven met een hoog aanzien hebben de grootste voorkeuren vanwege de goede startersfunctie, de garantie op een permanente functie en de opbouw van een succesvolle carrière. Om deze droom te verwezenlijken, storten Japanse scholieren zich volledig op de voorbereiding van de toelatingstoetsen en worden ze sinds de kinderjaren klaargestoomd voor die momentopname. De toelating tot de universiteiten is geheel afhankelijk van de toetsresultaten, waardoor de prestatiedruk extreem hoog ligt. Deze periode van voorbereiding heeft daarom de naam toegewezen gekregen als juken jikoku 受験地獄, wat letterlijk naar het Nederlands wordt vertaald als examenhel (Ono, 2007, 271). Deze fase bezorgt de studenten een hoop stress, met somatische gevolgen van dien. Uit het onderzoek van Trueba et al. is bijvoorbeeld gebleken dat de lichamelijke condities van een groep Amerikaanse studenten tijdens de examenperiode achteruit zijn gegaan, hoewel er voor aanvang van het onderzoek is aangetoond dat zij in goede gezondheid waren. Examenstress kan dus negatieve emoties opwekken, waaruit fysieke klachten kunnen voortkomen. Depressie, een psychologische aandoening, ontstaat uit een chronisch patroon van negatieve stemmingen en blijkt een correlatie te hebben met de verzwakking van het immuunsysteem en daarnaast een verminderde werking van de longfunctie (Trueba et al., 2013, 206).","['juken jigoku', 'examenhel', 'stress', 'stressoren']"

A Bite of China: China's Attempt to Project Soft Power,"Niu, Peilin","['Landsberger, S.R.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"A Bite of China is a food-themed documentary that was broadcast on the China Central Television(CCTV) on May 14, 2014. It has soon become popular among both domestic and International audiences. However, the show is not considered to be just food-related, but a way to present China's history and culture through the country's cuisine. The popularity of A Bite of China has spurred my curiosity to investigate the factors that contribute to the attractiveness of the series. Food serves as a window through which both domestic and international audiences get to understand China's culinary culture. According to the statements of Director Chen Xiaoqing, the main motivation to create the series is to show China's culinary culture to the whole world in order to promote Chinese culture. Since it is challenging to collect and analyze the audiences' feedback about the show, l will focus on the producers' perspectives to investigate the production and presentation of A Bite of China. In this thesis, the concept of soft power which proposed by American scholar Joseph.S.Nye will be applied in the analysis of the show. The connection between China's soft power and the presentation of the show will be built to some extent.","['China', 'Soft power', 'Food']"
Disguises of Power: Kawaii in the Japanese Cyberspace,"Georgieva, Antoaneta","['Cwiertka, Katarzyna J.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research begins with a critical analysis of the kawaii and the cyberspace literature in the Japanese context. Based on that framework, I distinguish three main kawaii discourses: as advertisement and for attraction; as a statement or rebellion; and as soft power. I select three Japanese organisations, belonging to different sectors, in order to examine whether there is an intention behind utilising their respective kawaii aesthetics to communicate a particular idea. While the messages differ based on the organisation, similar visual techniques are expended in all three cases. I hypothesise that the visual kawaii content of each organisation would fall into one of the aforementioned three main types of kawaii discourse. All examined organisations are not directly associated with the culture of cuteness. Analysis of the materials is made through visual discourse analysis, website scraping and website crawling. It revealed that indeed, all of the organisations have an agenda, put forward through the respective cute imagery. However, that agenda did not necessarily fit within the above straightforward categories that the literature suggested. Therefore, for the particular circumstances of my research, I revised the aforementioned kawaii categories to also encompass: kawaii discourse as a tool for continuity and ease; as a contraption of attraction; as a quest for peace. Finally, I conclude that cyberspace is a much more versatile medium than any of the historical kawaii channels and therefore, its contemporary communication implications do not necessarily fall into a particular category – it can address multiple ones simultaneously, reaching a vast audience. In addition, I present a visualisation of the Japanese governmental sector website network, which reveals unforeseen external digital connections of the Ministry of Defense website with closely related to kawaii organisations.","['kawaii', 'cute', 'cyberspace', 'Japan', 'online']"

"The Hidden Identity of the Russian Homosexual Man, Expressions of the Russian dusha in Kargaltsev's Asylum","Ansermin, Chiara","['Boele, Otto']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Male homosexuality in Russia cannot be interpreted through Western paradigms: it must be analyzed in relation to the Russian historical and socio-political context. Since the 18th century Russian rulers have framed homosexual men as enemies of the Russian nation. They have constructed a form of nationalism based on the notion of an authentic and pure heterosexual Russian in opposition to a false and corrupted homosexual non-Russian. The scholar Baer dismantles the Russian political discourse of national identity: he affirms that when reading male homosexuality in Russia from a cultural perspective, the Russian homosexual man stands at the very core of the Russian national identity. The scholar contends that there is an evident relation between the Russian homosexual man and the Russian dusha, or Russian soul. Baer argues convincingly that because of the socio-political marginalization and repression the Russian homosexual man constantly endures, he incorporates the intrinsic characteristics of the Russian dusha of depth of feeling and redemptive suffering. Therefore, he is the true perpetrator of the Russian national identity. The aim of this thesis is to enhance Baer’s innovative understanding of male homosexuality in Russia as to stimulate further research in the academia and contribute to the public debate regarding this topic. In order to do so, the artwork Asylum- a collection of photographs representing naked Russian homosexual men who immigrated to the United States to find political asylum- from the contemporary Russian artist Alexander Kargaltsev has been analyzed with the purpose of detecting how it contributes to the understanding of the Russian homosexual man as true perpetrator of the Russian national identity. The two photographs that best express the relation between the Russian homosexual man and the Russian dusha have been analyzed. By assessing different components of those two photographs in relation to the condition of homosexual men in contemporary Russia, it can be confirmed that the Russian homosexual man incorporates the intrinsic characteristics of the Russian dusha of depth of feeling and redemptive suffering. Hence, he is the true perpetrator of the Russian national identity, as Baer firmly asserts.","['Male Homosexuality', 'Russian dusha', 'Russian National Identity']"

De uitslag van de Taiwanese presidentsverkiezingen in 2016 heeft echter voor een grote verandering gezorgd in deze bloeiende toerisme-industrie, in negatieve zin. Het doel van deze scriptie is om antwoord te geven op de vraag of de inwoners van Taiwan de komst van Chinese toeristen zien als een mogelijke bedreiging voor hun soevereiniteit. Deze scriptie bestaat uit twee delen. Het eerste deel bestaat uit een literatuurstudie waarin de achtergrond van het toerisme tussen China en Taiwan wordt toegelicht, samen met een toelichting over de rol van de Taiwanese presidentsverkiezingen. In het tweede deel worden de resultaten van een enquête besproken en geïnterpreteerd.

American Exceptionalism: A discursive tool to justify foreign policy?,"Kortmann, Florianne","['Fynn, Jennifer']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis argues that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 as part of the War on Terror declared by President Bush in the aftermath of 9/11 can be seen in the light of American Exceptionalism. American Exceptionalism has actively been used as a discursive tool to justify US foreign intervention in the past. By looking at the historical context of American Exceptionalism one will see how American Exceptionalism originated, how it was adapted and how it was often manipulated by prominent figures in a way that served national interests throughout time. Myths and illusions surrounding American Exceptionalism were created which became part of a discourse that shaped and strengthened US national identity over the centuries. However, in the aftermath of 9/11, these pre-existing beliefs were shattered and a national identity crisis followed. Nonetheless, President Bush managed to once again accommodate and reaffirm the pre-existing national truths and to simultaneously reshape and reform them in a way that made American Exceptionalism become a state fantasy. The discourse surrounding this state fantasy became an important tool for President Bush to justify the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.","['American Exceptionalism', 'National Identity', 'State Fantasy', 'Civic Culture', 'Myth', 'US Foreign Policy', 'War on Terror', '9/11']"

Partly due to the self-interest of the United States, the Doha Round has failed. This essay elaborates on the foreign trade relations of the United States and discusses the chronology, objectives and failure of the Doha Round. Three arguments are presented for why the United States' trade liberalization policy has changed and caused the Doha Round to fail. The first argument explains the protectionist strategy of the United States regarding its agricultural sector. The second argument goes into the emerging economies that are threatening the leading position of the United States. The third and final argument points out alternative negotiations on trade, for example the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that have partly replaced the objectives of the Doha Round on a regional level.","['trade', 'liberalization', 'united states', 'protectionism', 'free trade', 'doha round', 'TTIP', 'TPP', 'WTO']"
The Power of Web 2.0: Influencing Millennials During the 2008 US Presidential Elections,"Steenwijk, Laura van","['Moody, Simanique']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will examine what effects web 2.0 had on the likelihood of millennials to vote in the 2008 US presidential elections. To tackle this question millennials and their characteristics should be looked into. Since most of the people that use web 2.0 to get campaign information are people born between 1977 and 1994, consequentially the focus will be on this age group, also known as millennials or generation X (New Strategist Press 255). In fact 6 out of 10 millennials report that they use Facebook as their major source to get their campaign information (Mitchell, Gottfried and Matsa 2). Moreover, this thesis will cover how media in general can influence the public and what kind of effects a message can have. Media influencing theories such as coercion, the Elaboration Likelihood Model, framing, and the inoculation theory will be examined as well as what effects these could have on the public. By means of a literature review the effects of web 2.0 on the likelihood to vote will be touched upon. Thereby the concepts of political participation and political engagement will be clarified. The rise of web 2.0 up to the presidential elections of 2008 will also be explored. Again, by means of a literature review scholars’ view on the social media use during the 2008 presidential elections and the most frequently used social networking sites, or SNS, such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace will be examined. Subsequently, the actual social media campaign of presidential candidate Barack Obama has to be analyzed. This analysis will look at how the characteristics of millennials in combination with the discussed media influencing theories and the influence of web 2.0 affected the likelihood to vote among millennials. All this research will be done with the theory of cognitive dissonance in mind. Cognitive dissonance theory states that a person experiences dissonance, a feeling of emotional discomfort, whenever his or her actions and cognitions are in conflict and will seek to reduce this dissonance (Dickinson and Oxoby 297). What is expected is that due to the theory of cognitive dissonance people will tend to look up information that already fits their framework and will actively seek for affirmation with their peers, especially when confronted with this feeling of dissonance.","['Web 2.0', '2008 US Presidential Elections', 'Millennials']"

The primary purposes of this study are, first, to provide an analysis of Kuwaiti foreign policy toward Iraq and, second, to determine the role of regional inter-state structures in shaping this policy. Using journalistic accounts, statements from government officials, and data concerning macroeconomic activity and military expenditure, this research shows that relations have indeed gotten closer between Kuwait and Iraq, particularly since 2010. Additionally, evidence is presented demonstrating that Kuwait is engaging in a foreign policy strategy of hedging in its relations with Iraq, allowing it to prepare for multiple potential security threats while maximizing short-term economic and political benefits. It is argued that closer ties between Kuwait and Iraq have been enabled and incentivized by the changing structure (both material and social) of international relations in the Gulf region. Finally, through its analysis of Kuwaiti foreign policy toward Iraq, this thesis seeks to demonstrate the potential usefulness of the concepts of strategic hedging and structural power in the analysis of small state behavior in international relations.","['Kuwait', 'Iraq', 'strategic hedging', 'structural power', 'bargaining leverage', 'Arab nationalism', 'sovereignty', 'constructivism', 'Gulf Cooperation Council', 'regional power politics', 'small states in international relations']"

Coetzee's The Childhood of Jesus,"Slotboom, Hidde","['Liebregts, P.T.M.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis offers an ethical reading of J.M. Coetzee’s The Childhood of Jesus. Taking Derek Attridge’s concept of ‘the singularity of literature’ as its point of departure, it first discusses the relation between literature and ethics. According to Attridge, the singularity of a literary work consists of its ‘transformative difference’. As such, the event of reading is a confrontation with the otherness of the text. It is precisely this confrontation that characterises responsible and ethical reading. Then it is argued that allegorical readings of The Childhood of Jesus cannot do justice to its singularity. Instead, the reading of the novel proposed here focuses on the notion of ‘responsibility’, suggesting that a focus on this concept increases the understanding of ethics in the novel. This analysis connects responsibility to four closely related aspects: its ground, the characters' worldview, the 'idea of the family', and the role of learning. By doing so, it demonstrates the possibilities of applying Attridge's theory to a work of literature, but it also shows its limitations.","['Coetzee', 'Ethics', 'The Childhood of Jesus', 'Responsibility']"
Democratic Consolidation in Guatemala: The Effect of CAFTA-DR on the Strengthening of Democratic Institutions,"Meer, Dionne van der","['Solheim, H.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The thesis is concerned with the topic of democratic consolidation in Guatemala. The country became a formal democracy in the 1980s, but since that moment it has started an ongoing process of democratic consolidation. Within the same time period we see the emergence of neoliberalism in the region. Neoliberalism focused on the opening up of markets to international trade and included the introduction of many free trade agreements such as CAFTA-DR. While CAFTA-DR had as primary objective to facilitate trade, there were also political objectives attached to it that revolved around promoting democracy in the region. The aim of the thesis is to research how CAFTA-DR promoted democracy and to what extent it contributed to the strengthening of democratic institutions in Guatemala. The thesis identifies three main ways through which CAFTA-DR influences democratic consolidation. The agreement aims at increasing institutional transparency, strengthening the rule of law and enhancing accountability structures. While there are many elements present in the agreement that help to strengthen democratic institutions, obstacles are present that can significantly limit the effect of the agreement.","['democratic consolidation', 'Guatemala', 'CAFTA-DR', 'Neoliberalism']"

"Inherent: The Role of the English Language in the Japanese Language, Japanese Commercial Media and Japanese Identity","Kastelijn, Terry","['Hoogerbrug, J.E.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"For centuries, Japan has shown its aptitude in selecting and accumulating certain preferential and beneficial aspects of foreign cultures and influences, with the purpose of enriching Japanese society. A big number of foreign cultural artefacts have managed to establish themselves as an inherent part of Japanese identity. One of the most intrinsic foreign influences on the Japanese culture is the introduction of the English language, which has found its place in many of the cultural domains, to the point of becoming an inherent part of them. As such, this thesis was able to analyse a brief selection of these. Firstly, the Japanese language is analysed to show how English has become a part of it, through loanwords and breaking taboos. Second, this paper examines the influence and usage of the English language in Japanese commercial media, with a focus on ornamentalism and storefronts.

Turkish Foreign Policy Under the AK Party: Turkey's role in the Middle East in the Post Arab Spring Era,"Conboy, Edward","['Meijer, Roland']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis utilises a constructivist perspective to understand the ideational components of the AK Party’s foreign policy discourse and how it dramatically transformed Turkey’s relationships with states in the MENA region. The thesis then goes on to analyse the difficulties the AK Party's foreign policy struggled to cope with the regional disorder brought about by the Arab Spring. The party’s electoral hegemony and almost-continuous rule allowed them to wield tremendous power and transform conceptions of the Turkish nation. The AK Party’s nationalist project departed sharply from Kemalist discourses by eschewing the traditional concern for secularism and a realist foreign policy outlook by instrumentalising and reinventing discourses of Islamic and Ottoman Heritage. This new nationalist project positioned Turkey at the centre of the Islamic World and as inheritor to the Ottoman Empire and sought to justify an unprecedentedly proactive foreign policy that saw Turkey forge ties with most states in the MENA region. Furthermore, it constructed durable ideological ties between the AKP, the state and Turkish society when formulating, justifying and defending the party’s foreign policy discourse and practice. Key to this transformation in theory and practice of Turkish foreign policy was former Professor of International Relations, and chief advisor to Prime Minister Erdoğan, Ahmet Davutoğlu. Davutoğlu can be clearly identified as the key personality leading this transformation, successfully channeling his theory into practice under the AKP and dramatically improving Turkey’s ties with MENA states with the “no problems with neighbours policy”. However, though Davutoglu and the AKP experienced profound success, the regional discontent and transformations brought about by the Arab Spring necessitated a dramatic recallibration of Turkish foreign policy discourse and practice to be more in line with the realist, Kemalist paradigm of the past.","['Turkey', 'Turkish Foreign Policy', 'The AK Party', 'Ahmet Davutoğlu', 'Neo-Ottomanism', 'Turkish Nationalism', 'Arab Spring', 'Strategic Depth']"

Housing as a Fictitious Commodity?: A Historical Insight into Comparisons of Housing in Hong Kong and Singapore,"Brown, Timothy Alexander","['Wang, Jue']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The recent years have seen a rise in the interest and media coverage concerning the housing markets in Hong Kong and Singapore. Both cities are routinely ranked as some of the most expensive property markets internationally, and have thus been the subject of significant comparison. This is often done on the basis of the two cities sharing commonalities in history and the situations of their housing markets, but in doing so, these comparisons negate the influences that the political environments over the course of history have had on the two governments' approaches to housing policy. In particular, the two governments operate from very different perspectives, as this paper will demonstrate with the use of theoretical frameworks concerning international political order and political economy. Drawing on research into the historical and political trajectories of the two cities with specific regards to housing development, this paper aims to identify the political influences on the history and approaches to housing development in Hong Kong and Singapore that are overlooked in much of the coverage and comparisons employed today.","['hong kong', 'singapore', 'housing', 'political economy']"
What Role for Dialogue Among Allies? Public Discursive Threat Construction of a Nuclear Iran Among Netanyahu’s Israel and Obama’s U.S.,"Hovers, Fanny","['Schonmann, Noa']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Alliance politics and securitisation theory have been studied and theorised. However, research on a possible link between these fields remains absent. Yet, when we look at prevalent alliance theory by Walt, we see that security and threat perceptions play a great role in the formation and persistence of state alliances. We would then expect that the discursive construction of these threats would too. This research takes the “special relationship” between the United States and Israel and their most recent rift over a nuclear Iran as its case study. Other than most analyses of the construction of threat within foreign policy discourse, this research aims to trace interaction between two converging or diverging formal state discourses. A Post Structuralist discourse analysis of formal speeches given by Netanyahu and Obama on policy towards Iran will show that over the eight years of their simultaneous leadership, interaction between their respective discourses increased and took an a more direct form. Results thereby illustrate that securitisation discourse should perhaps more often be studied as not simply emanating from and interacting with the domestic realm. It is not simply a dialogue between leadership and a respective domestic audience. Obama and Netanyahu are also required to legitimate their foreign policy options towards one another and both of their domestic audiences.","['discourse analysis', 'alliance theory', 'israel', 'united states', 'foreign policy', 'speech analysis', 'post-structuralism']"

What if the Atlas shrugs: The impact of the rights of nature on foreign trade,"Gankema, Maaik","['Edmund, Amann']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Ecuador became the first country in the world to acknowledge the rights of nature in the constitution. However, Ecuador is dependent on the revenue generated by the export of (crude) oil. The regions where the oil deposits are located are found in fragile ecological environments, the Amazon rain forest for example. These regions are also home to many indigenous communities. These communities belong to the poorest section of Ecuadorean society, and the communities are also the first to be negatively affected by the exploitation of the oil fields. This essay strives to explain the effects of constitutional rights of nature on the economic position of the country. Environmental, and ecological challenges have risen to prominence in recent years. A majority of countries have signed the Paris Climate Accord in 2016. Ecuador was the first country to enshrine the rights of nature in the constitution. Other countries might follow and therefore research is needed to learn from the Ecuadorean experience. A special focus must lie on the trade position of developing countries when developing ecological policies, or rights of nature. Because trade is needed to develop and might clash with the intention of nature conservation.","['Rights of Nature', 'Ecuador', 'MNE']"

Two Tātācāryas at the Court of Virūpākṣa II - A socio-historical study of Anantārya's Prapannāmṛtam 123 - 125,"Buriola, Giulia","['Bisschop, Peter']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study offers a socio-historical analysis of three selected chapters of the Prapannāmṛtam, a hagiography composed by Anantārya most probably in the 17th century. The aim of the present research is that of showing how the socio-political and religious affiliation of the author can be identified as the main force which led to the composition of chapters 123-125, here under analysis. Anantārya is a proud member of the decayed Tātācāryas, a family of raja-gurus which had dominated the political and religious scene of Vijayanagara between the 14th and 16th century: Prapannāmṛtam 123-125 might, in this sense, be read as a praśasti (eulogy) of the glorious past of the family, expressed through the celebration of the miraculous events narrated in chapters 123-125. The political and religious strength of the family is put forth, in the narration, by the acts of two Tātācārya teachers, Nṛsiṃhārya and his younger brother: it is thanks to their actions that, in chapter 125, the religious conversion of king Virūpākṣa II and its subjects from Śaivism to Vaiṣṇavism takes place. Moreover, through the analysis of an alleged ‘a-historical’ hagiographic text, I introduced the issue of how, in the Indological context, the concepts of ‘history’ and ‘historiography’ should be revised in light of new, more fruitful, theories (e.g. Bloch 1949, Bulke 2001 and Corrao & Viola 2005).","['Prapannāmṛtam', 'śrīvaiṣṇavism', 'Tātācārya family']"

Learning and Challenging - Chino’s Kara-Yamato Binary Structure Revisited in the Context of Modern Japanese Art,"Wei, Siqi","['Hoogerbrug, J.E.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores whether and to what extends Chino’s kara-yamato binary structure in traditional Japanese art history can fit into Japanese art in modern time periods, and what would be the reason behind. It does so by analysing different artworks in the Meiji period, the early Taisho period and the contemporary period, and applying Chino's structure onto these artworks. In doing so, it extends the context of the structure further and tries to discover if new understandings of the structure can be added to the academic debate. The result of the analysis suggests that whether or not Chino’s structure can be applied onto certain contexts highly depends on Japan’s view towards the West in that context. The structure can fit better in earlier periods, and does not fit in more modern periods. Such change in the applicability of Chino's structure is influenced by Japan's cultural relation with the West throughout its modern history. It suggests that Japan has moved from the status of seeing itself in the cultural periphery in relation to the West, to taking more proactive role to challenge social inequalities and (re)construct cultural identities.","['modern Japan', 'Chino Kaori', 'art history', 'gender']"

Being Old in an Aging Nation: An Investigation to the Rising Crime Rates Amongst the Japanese Elderly,"Hilzinger, Annette","['Herber, Erik']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Contradictory to a common assumption in criminology, which assumes crime rates to be the lowest among senior citizens, the crime rates among the elderly share of the Japanese population is on the rise in recent years. This development is accompanied by a rapidly aging Japanese population. Considering the speed of this process in Japan and seeing other industrialised nations follow the aging trend, this phenomenon poses a severe threat to the economy and social security in aging societies and Japan in particular. As the number of elderly offenders is rising much faster than the total share of senior citizens in Japan, it is of crucial importance to identify potential causes for the rise of criminal offenses amongst the Japanese elderly. Analysing crime rates, demographic change, government reports and secondary literature, this study identifies potential factors that contribute to rising elderly crime rates between 1989 and 2014. As a result, this research finds that social disintegration is the most significant factor in explaining the changing crime patterns in Japan.","['Elderly people', 'Japan', 'Crime rates', 'Demographic change', 'Social disintegration']"

Let It Go: A New Way of Looking at Gender Discourse by Breaking the Disney Formula,"Krouwels, Sabine","['Newton, Michael']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Disney has been releasing Disney Princess films since 1937. They started out with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and just now, a thirteenth film has been added to the list: Moana. A distinct change in character is noticeable when looking at the princesses. The princesses from the first generation (1937-1959) have passive characters, they are submissive, enjoy domestic chores and play no active role in their own tales. They simply wait to be swept off their feet by a prince. In fact, they represented what people considered to be the perfect woman in those days. However, nowadays, that is not what we consider the perfect woman to be. The second generation princesses (1989-1998) introduced a change. They were rebellious, took agency and instead of falling for any man, they wanted the right one. However, these films still focus on finding love, as if that is all that a woman's life should be about. The most recent princesses (from 2010 onwards) are increasingly more independent and active. They do not rely on men to save them, take matters into their own hands and determine their own fate. They are progressive princesses and continue to increasingly become more proactive and independent. These new princesses provide the twenty-first-century audience with role models they can actually learn from. Disney is not there yet, but they are slowly but surely letting go of the Disney formula.","['Disney', 'gender', 'Disney formula', 'princesses', 'Disney princesses']"

Strategisch Stiekem,"Beune, Rosanne Corine","['Lubben, Sebastiaan van der']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In het najaar van 2013 verstrekte PvdA-minister Ronald Plasterk in Nieuwsuur verkeerde informatie over hoe Amerikaanse veiligheidsdiensten aan Nederlandse belgegevens kwamen. Hij deelde zijn fout niet met de Kamer, maar naar eigen zeggen wel met de commissie-Stiekem: een commissie die zich bezighoudt met geheime informatie van de AIVD. Dat bleek na een lek vanuit de commissie naar het NRC. Een schandaal leek onvermijdelijk en de politieke situatie werd breed uitgemeten in het nieuws. De hechte relatie die er bestaat tussen politiek en journalistiek kwam de betrokken politieke partijen goed van pas: zij kozen hun strategie en probeerden afhankelijk van hun doelstelling het schandaal uit te vergroten of juist te blokkeren. Het lek uit een geheime commissie is een ernstig feit en dat daar tot op de dag van vandaag niemand voor verantwoordelijk is gehouden ook. Als burgers en journalisten de strategieën van politieke actoren kennen, kunnen zij hen kritischer bekijken en bevragen. Daarom staat in dit onderzoek de vraag centraal welke strategieën van politici om de Stiekemgate te blokkeren of te amplificeren we terugzien in de media. De uitgevoerde analyse toont aan dat het mogelijk is om in deze casus strategieën van politici te achterhalen met behulp van een theoretisch model. Dit model gaat uit van twee hoofdstrategieën: een blokkadestrategie en een amplificatiestrategie. Deze twee vormen kunnen betrekking hebben op presentatie, verantwoordelijkheid en beleid. Om de criteria van deze strategieën te herkennen in uitspraken van politieke actoren, zijn de retorische technieken van politici onderzocht. Hiervoor is publiek beschikbaar materiaal geanalyseerd, waarin uitspraken van politici voorkomen. Door deze uitspraken aan de hand van het theoretisch analysemodel te beoordelen, zijn drie strategieën naar boven gekomen. De eerste is een presentatiestrategie met ethostechniek om het schandaal te blokkeren, die door zowel de PvdA als de VVD werd uitgevoerd. De tweede is een verantwoordelijkheidsstrategie met een logostechniek die D66 inzet. Tot slot volgt een verantwoordelijkheidsstrategie met behulp van een pathostechniek van de PVV. De vondst van deze strategieën toont een onzichtbare samenwerking aan tussen de PvdA en de VVD tijdens de aanloop naar en het verloop van de Stiekemgate. Het voorspellend theoretisch model houdt stand in het onderzoek naar deze casus. Door meerdere vergelijkbare analyses uit te voeren kan de bruikbaarheid van dit model worden getest. Als het model in vervolgonderzoek standhoudt, wordt het van toegevoegde waarde voor het vakgebied van de journalistiek.","['Politiek', 'Media', 'Strategie', 'Politieke partij', 'Journalistiek']"

This is to be an exercise in the recently emerging research program of what I have termed the empirical philosophy of history, as developed by Herman Paul. I supplemented this framework with certain Bourdieusian insights, adopting analytic tools — concepts like forms of capital and fields — that were specifically constructed to reveal more clearly the social elements and forces at play in the development of the dispositions or embodied commitments to goods that constitute personae. After elaborating my methodological framework, I move to outlining the basic elements that went into the making of the Marxist historian’s persona; the primary commitments to epistemic, moral and political goods that were embodied by the Historians’ Group’s founders — Dona Torr, A. L. Morton, Maurice Dobb and Christopher Hill — who played a primary role in its making. These consisted of the epistemic commitments to obtaining a dialectical and historical view or understanding of history, the moral commitment to the emancipation of the proletariat and the political commitment to Communism of the Soviet variety as espoused by the Communist Party of Great Britain. The obtaining of these commitments required the exercising of the appropriate virtues like employing the dialectical and historical materialist methods, engaging in class analysis and maintaining loyalty to the Communist Party. These virtues in turn implied an opposition to vices that consisted of their lack in other historians’ scholarly personae, pejoratively referred to as ‘bourgeois’. However, there was also a struggle internally regarding the proper interpretation of these commitments and virtues, one that played out both within the Historians’ Group itself and the wider Party. The contours of this struggle and the practices of contestation it involved —abounding in virtue and vice language — is clarified through the prism of dispositional variations that existed among the Group’s members, which I distinguish as the academic and non-academic. However, these are not presented as discreetly definable entities, but rather as consisting of a common network of commonalities (as in a family resemblance concept), thereby allowing for consideration of the variations that existed among members of each, while also allowing for the role of contingency that had a major effect on the making of the Marxist historian’s persona.","['Marxist historiography', 'scholarly personae', ""Communist Party Historians' Group"", 'British historiography', 'historical materialism', 'Christopher Hill', 'Maurice Dobb', 'A.

Een foto zegt meer dan de begeleidende woorden,"Blaas, Fenna","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In het onderzoek naar framing is visuele framing ondergeschikt is aan tekstuele framing. Het is volgens veel onderzoekers dan ook van belang dat visuele framing meer wordt betrokken bij het onderzoek naar framing (o.a. Coleman, 2010; Dan & Ihlen, 2011; Brantner, Geise & Lobinger, 2012; Iorgoveanu & Corbu, 2012). Met name het onderzoek naar de samenwerking tussen visuele en tekstuele framing is relevant. Onderzoek naar framing richt zich meestal op slechts één van de twee communicatievormen, wat een incompleet beeld geeft. Een recent onderzoek dat de samenwerking tussen visuele en tekstuele framing bestudeert is van Wilkes (2015). Wilkes analyseert patronen en veranderingen in de titels en bijschriften gebruikt bij één iconische nieuwsfoto, aan de hand van keywords. Als blijkt dat deze onderzoeksmethode toepasbaar is op andere nieuwsfoto’s, kan het vaker herhaald worden en waardevolle inzichten opleveren voor de journalistieke praktijk. De vraag die deze thesis beantwoordt is dan ook: Is de onderzoeksmethode die Wilkes aandraagt algemeen toepasbaar op nieuwsfoto’s? Om deze vraag te kunnen beantwoorden wordt de onderzoeksmethode van Wilkes herhaald, waarbij de foto van de verdronken peuter Alan Kurdi als case study gebruikt wordt. Uit de replicatie blijkt dat de onderzoeksmethode van Wilkes (2015) op een aantal punten tekort schiet. Allereerst is een deel van de onderzoeksmethode moeilijk te repliceren, omdat Wilkes zich richt op een zeer specifiek soort nieuwsfoto: een foto waarop twee kanten van een politiek conflict zichtbaar zijn, maar waarop het conflict zelf niet zichtbaar is. Dat beperkt het aantal foto’s waarop de onderzoeksmethode toegepast kan worden. Daarnaast zegt Wilkes de relatie tussen beeld en tekst te willen onderzoeken, maar ze onderzoekt slechts patronen in de tekst. Daarbij gaat zij er vanuit dat de foto, bijschriften en titels hetzelfde frame hebben. Haar onderzoeksmethode draagt dan ook nauwelijks bij aan het onderzoek naar visuele framing en de samenwerking tussen visuele en tekstuele framing.","['Framing', 'Visuele framing', 'Nieuwsfoto', 'Bijschriften']"

Outsiderism: The Origins of an American Tradition,"Bouma, Vincent I.","['Bilt, Eduard F. van de']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Electoral competition has been an essential part of acquiring the American presidency since Jackson’s election of 1828. Competition made strategic considerations to ensure the maximization of electoral support increasingly relevant. One phenomenon that traditionally dominated strategic thinking during American elections is ‘Outsiderism’: during campaigns candidates deliberately assume an outsider position in the electoral arena, not on the basis of genuine motivations, but for the categorical purpose of vote-maximization. Despite the fact that Outsiderism has constantly been deployed over the course of history, it has yet to receive scholarly attention. This thesis, therefore, offers an analysis of Outsiderism in the realm of American presidential campaigns. It investigates Outsiderism’s roots in the subsequent campaigns of Jackson and Van Buren through an analysis of their respective campaign biographies. Furthermore, it links Outsiderism to the framework of Rational Choice Theory, which elucidates the rather manipulative motives that induce Outsiderism. Thus, this thesis seeks to clarify to what extent Jackson and Van Buren conformed to Outsiderism during their campaign. Why did they as would-be presidents see the need to present themselves (to a certain extent) as outsiders to American politics? The results suggest that both Jackson and Van Buren as presidential candidates employed Outsiderism, although Jackson to a lesser extent than Van Buren, because they deemed it as advantageous for garnering the required support to get elected. As a result, they have paved the way for a campaign strategy that has remained dominant until today.","['Outsiderism', 'strategy', 'US elections', 'Van Buren', 'Jackson', 'anti-governmentalism', 'populism', 'Rational Choice Theory', 'campaign']"

Shame, it is held, is crucial to our self-development and our relation with others because, besides the negative self-evaluation it is commonly known for, shame also encompasses a strong personal involvement. After investigating the financial crisis of 2008 it is found that the financial sector is characterized by the convergence of a high reliance on virtual systems as well as an inability to feel shame. To further study the effect of virtualization on shame, three necessary conditions for shame are proposed based on the work of Kierkegaard, Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre: integrity, embodiment, and responsibility. By examining the effect of virtualization on these three necessary conditions I arrive at a general conclusion about the effect of virtualization on our ability to feel shame. The final section expands the scope of these findings to see whether the found effect of virtualization on shame can be noticed in other social spheres that are gradually becoming more virtual.","['Shame', 'Phenomenology', 'Banking crisis', 'Existentialism', 'Shamelessness', 'Virtualization', 'Technology']"

The instrument used for this research is a sociolinguistic questionnaire, which had the participation of 194 second generation Cape Verdeans, of whom 168 with both Cape Verdean parents, 15 with only the father Cape Verdean, and 11 with only a Cape Verdean mother. The study intends to answer the questions: i) what is the role of Creole in the every-day life of the second generation Cape Verdean, ii) what is the attitude towards the transmission of Creole to the children, ie the third generation and iii) how does language relate to the identity of this second generation? The results of the study suggest that while the attitude towards heritage language and culture and its transmission is positive, the practice of the Creole language in everyday life and specifically with the children does not support this attitude and possibly does not contribute to the transmission and maintenance of the Creole language in the Cape Verdean community in the Netherlands.","['heritage language', 'language attitudes', 'Cape Verde immigrants in Holland', 'intergenerational language transmission', 'intergenerational language maintenance']"

The job of this extraordinary judicial counsil was to punish the main actors that had caused so much trouble for the Habsburg regime during the 'Wonderjaar', the year 1566-1567 when an iconoclastic fury spread in the Netherlands. There is still very little known about the ways of the Counsil of Troubles, despite the fact that there is an abandunt of eyewitness testimonies preserverd, ready to be studied. This thesis is a first attempt to do this. It is done for the city Zaltbommel in Guelders. In Zaltbommel there was no fury, but a religieus accord was struck at 23 oktober 1566, explicitly against the wishes of the then governor Margaretha van Parma. Three persons were executed by the Counsil of Troubles, and at least thirty-six were banished. What was the method of the commissioners of Alba, who where sent to investigate and punish? With whom did they talk? And how much help did they receive from the inhabitants of Zaltbommel and its city council?","['Beeldenstorm', 'Alva', 'Raad van Beroerten', 'Filips II', 'Zaltbommel', 'Gelre', 'Commissarissen van Alva', 'Wonderjaar', 'Iconoclastic Fury', 'Counsil of Troubles']"

De image bites van Angela Merkel,"Jacobs, Rick","['Koetsenruijter, A.W.M. (Willem)']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Soundbites worden continu uitgemeten in de media. Kijk bijvoorbeeld naar Geert Wilders die vlak vóór het achtuurjournaal een oneliner naar buiten brengt in de hoop meegenomen te worden in de nieuwsuitzending (Jacobs, Van Mierlo, Ditzel & Van Gent, 2015). Minder aandacht is de afgelopen jaren besteed aan image bites, terwijl die steeds meer in de media aanwezig zijn (Grabe & Bucy, 2009). Het zijn de krachtige afbeeldingen die politici kunnen maken of breken. Vanwege het nog onbekende onderzoeksterrein met betrekking tot de invloed van afbeeldingen op politici, loont het de moeite om te kijken naar diverse variabelen die via afbeeldingen invloed hebben op de betrouwbaarheidsperceptie van, in dit geval, bondskanselier Angela Merkel. De centrale vraag van dit onderzoek is: Welke aspecten spelen een rol in de betrouwbaarheidsperceptie van Angela Merkel via image bites? Hiervoor is uitvoerig literatuuronderzoek verricht, waarbij enkele belangrijke elementen naar voren zijn gekomen, zoals gezichtsuitdrukking, gedrag en de setting waarin de politicus verkeert. Er zijn 41 experimenten en open interviews afgenomen met WO studenten aan de faculteit geesteswetenschappen. Hierbij zijn vele inzichten verkregen in de manier waarop een homogene groep de betrouwbaarheid van een politicus inschat aan de hand van 34 voorgeselecteerde afbeeldingen. De eerste deelvraag van dit onderzoeks- en adviesrapport is: op welke manier wordt de betrouwbaarheid van Angela Merkel geïnterpreteerd door middel van verschillende visuele compositie-elementen? Aan de hand van verschillende theorieën is het containerbegrip ‘betrouwbaarheid’ bekeken. Vervolgens zijn diverse theorieën onderzocht waarin de aanwezigheid van bepaalde variabelen in afbeeldingen, zoals de diverse camerastandpunten, zijn belicht. Ook is de theorie over het vrouwelijk geslacht in de politiek onder de loep genomen, omdat de vrouwelijke politicus zich blijkbaar anno 2016 nog steeds moet bewijzen ten opzichte van de mannelijke politicus. Vervolgens is het theoretisch kader gekoppeld aan hetgeen uit de diverse experimenten is gekomen door middel van de vraag: in hoeverre komen de resultaten van de Q-methode overeen met hetgeen reeds uit de theorie is gekomen? Het doel hiervan was om de reeds ontwikkelde theorie te toetsen aan dit onderzoek en daarnaast nieuwe inzichten aan te bieden die eventueel van toegevoegde waarde kunnen zijn voor verder onderzoek middels de Q-methode. Uit dit onderzoek zijn onder andere vier factoren voren gekomen die het concept betrouwbaarheid rondom Angela Merkel, via de zogenoemde image bites, verklaren en die zijn: expressie, interactie, informaliteit en leiderschap. Hierbij neemt Merkel verschillende rollen aan. Ze moet emoties tonen, maar toch een sterke leider zijn, ze moet de ‘echte’ Merkel laten zien, maar toch stabiel overkomen en leiderschap uitstralen. Verder blijkt ook in dit onderzoek dat vrouwelijke respondenten meer gevoelig zijn voor Merkel als vrouw in de politiek dan de mannelijke respondenten. Tot slot is opvallend de enorme hoeveelheid aspecten die respondenten meenemen in de beoordeling van betrouwbaarheid van een politicus aan de hand van foto’s. Zelfs de kleur ogen werd geopperd door een van de respondenten als mogelijke invloed op de betrouwbaarheidsperceptie.",['Angela Merkel betrouwbaarheid beeld bondskanselier vrouw image bites']

National Identity Construction: A Case Study on Tuareg Nationalism in Mali,"Riepma, Annemieke","['Williams, Corey']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the existing literature on nationalism, little research has been done that offers insight in the formation and deformation of national identities. This thesis will aim to do just that. The reason being that in 2012 it was the fourth time since independence a Tuareg led rebellion broke out against the Malian state. This thesis argues that a thorough understanding is needed of what constructs and deconstructs national identity to prevent a fifth rebellion to occur in the future. This thesis will contribute to such an understanding by building upon a political theory called 'Politics of Partaking', developed by Patrick Chabal, one of the leading scholars in African History and Politics. To answer and illustrate how Chabal’s Politics of Partaking help understand national identity construction among the Tuareg, it will take the four rebellions as separate case studies. The findings will suggest that Chabal´s Politics of partaking can help understand how national identities are constructed by analyzing the relation between the Tuareg and the state.","['Nationality', 'Identity', 'Tuareg']"

De kwaliteit van storytelling in online news galleries,"Arets, Kristy","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie staat het onderzoeksmodel naar de kwaliteit van storytelling in online news galleries van Caple en Knox (2015) centraal. Het model dat een systematische beoordeling van de kwaliteit van storytelling in online news galleries biedt, is pas een jaar oud en weinig in de praktische uitwerking en de toepasbaarheid getest. Het onderzoeksmodel bestaat uit drie onderdelen: image sequencing, text cohesion en news type. In dit onderzoek wordt specifiek onderzoek gedaan naar een onderdeel van het onderzoeksmodel namelijk text cohesion. In dit deel van het onderzoeksmodel worden de bijschriften van online news galleries beoordeeld. Aan de hand van een groter corpus dan dat Caple en Knox (2015) hebben gebruikt om het model op te stellen wordt het model geëvalueerd. Dat wil zeggen dat er dertig dagen lang dagelijks van achttien verschillende media online news galleries zijn vastgelegd in een databestand. Dit heeft een bestand opgeleverd van 508 online news galleries met daarin 8043 afbeeldingen met bijschrift. In deze database zijn tevens de algemene eigenschappen van de galleries vastgelegd en daarnaast zijn de waarden die in het onderzoeksmodel genoemd worden vastgelegd en gecodeerd. De vraag die centraal staat in het onderzoek is: “In hoeverre is het huidige onderzoeksmodel van Caple en Knox geschikt om kwaliteit in storytelling in online news galleries te evalueren?” Er wordt zowel kwantitatief als kwalitatief onderzoek gedaan naar een specifiek onderdeel in het onderzoeksmodel genaamd ‘text cohesion’, waarbij de bijschriften van de online news galleries aan bod komen. Het onderzoeksmodel bestaat ten tijde van het voorliggende onderzoek pas een jaar en de praktische uitwerking en toepasbaarheid ervan is nog niet geëvalueerd. Uit deze evaluatie zijn enkele aanvullingen op het huidige model naar voren gekomen die het model zouden kunnen verbeteren. Zo blijkt dat de sectie caption uniqueness als betrouwbaar te meten kan worden beschouwd, maar dat de sectie text relations uitbreiding behoeft. De sectie text relations valt uiteen in twee onderdelen welke na evaluatie door middel van dit onderzoek incompleet blijken te zijn. Daarom wordt in de conclusie van dit onderzoek beargumenteerd dat aan het onderdeel nuclearity de waarde ‘none’ toegevoegd moet worden en aan het onderdeel caption relations de waarde ‘thematic’ toegevoegd moet worden. Door het toevoegen van deze waarden aan het onderzoeksmodel kan op een meer betrouwbare wijze onderzocht worden wat de kwaliteit van van storytelling in online news galleries is.","['mediastudies', 'storytelling', 'textrelation']"
Politeness Theory in Contrastive Business Communication Guides,"Lashley, Chinelo","['Foster, Tony']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Brown and Levinson’s (1987) typology of politeness strategies is based on the basic wants of a model person (MP). Their concepts of face and positive and negative politeness have been groundbreaking in the fields of pragmatics and intercultural communication. However, their claim of having developed a universal model has been refuted by many scholars (Bargiela-Chiappini 2003; Watts 2003; Hill et al. 1986; Matsumoto 1988; Nwoye 1992; Mao 1994). In this paper, I use a contrastive language guide by Baxter and Baxter (2011) to attempt to analyze [1] how their pragmalinguistic advice relates to Brown and Levinson’s theory of politeness; [2] what influence the sociological variables have had on Baxter and Baxter’s choice of politeness strategies that are incorporated with face-threatening acts (FTAs); and [3] what the key underlying cultural differences are between the Dutch and the British in their choice of politeness strategies. The results of this study indicate that the pragmalinguistic advice relates to Brown and Levinson’s theory by using positive and negative politeness strategies when an FTA is incorporated into an utterance. Furthermore, sociological variables do play a significant role in the selection of politeness strategies, as they adhere to the discernment principles of their respective cultures. The key difference between the Dutch and the British is found in the sociological variable Low context communication.","['politeness', 'communication', 'pragmatics', 'intercultural', 'semantics']"

The research questions that this thesis tries to answer are the following: Can the selected short stories be considered literature about ageing? If so, why and how this process of ageing is depicted in Hindi Literature? In order to answer these questions, the research of Mike Hepworth (2000) on literature about ageing in British Literature is used as theoretical framework. Indeed, the parameters given by Hepworth for recognising examples of literature about ageing can be used as general criteria for the analysis of literary texts worldwide. Differences and similarities between Hepworth’s analysis and the description of ageing in selected Hindi short stories are taken into account for this critical analysis. According to the study of the four selected short stories, it is observed that one of the main focus of Hindi literature about ageing is the pursuit of denouncing elderly abuse, in all the form they are perpetrated. This work also suggests that literature about ageing is also present in Hindi Literature and it can be recognised as a literary theme on its own.","['Ageing', 'Elderly abuse', 'Short stories', 'Hindi Literature', 'Literature about Ageing']"
Default ironic constructions in Dutch,"Walles, Iméne","['Boogaart, Ronny']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis looked for default ironic constructions in Dutch. To do so a new definition of verbal irony was proposed: Verbal irony are utterances that (1) have an argumentative force that is opposed to the speaker’s evaluation, (2) are incongruent with its (co-text and) context and (3) leave the fact that they are ironic implicit. It is claimed that in Dutch an ironic interpretation can be emphasized by not. Therefore a corpus was set up with tweets containing #not. The ironic tweets in this corpus were analyzed on word frequency and remarkable patterns. This led to a list of words and patterns that were further analyzed. Through the analysis sixteen potentially default ironic constructions were found. These constructions were checked against three criteria for default ironic constructions: (1) not containing semantic anomalies, (2) not containing contextual information and (3) being ironic by default. Three constructions turned out to be default ironic constructions: lekker Adj, DP  weer lekker bezig and het gaat weer lekker (deictic adverb) (PP).","['verbal irony', 'default ironic constructions', 'argumentative force', 'not', 'Dutch (as a second language)', 'Twitter']"
