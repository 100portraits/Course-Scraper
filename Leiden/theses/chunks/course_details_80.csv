Bridging Relations along the Trans-Boundary Mekong River: China's Hydropower Diplomacy in Cambodia,"Dümmer, Josien Jacobien","[""d'Hooghe, Ingrid""]",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In a global community ever more transformed by climate vulnerabilities, cooperation along transboundary rivers has increasingly transcended from the environmental, to the political domain. This holds especially true for the industrially powered economy of the People’s Republic of China, which, after its initial economic take-off, started pursuing an energy diplomacy strategy vis-à-vis the neighboring Greater Mekong Sub-region. However, predominantly known as the ‘upstream superpower’, that ambition poses challenges for this country on a quest for water resources. This thesis focuses on the Mekong sub-region country Cambodia, which, since becoming a member of ASEAN and WTO, has deepened economic, as well as political ties with China. Here, the effects of China’s importance to Cambodia are evaluated, by looking at three critical components: 1) investment; 2) aid; and 3) trade. The analysis shows how China, through the provision of economic incentives through these pathways, has managed to increase both political support, while safeguarding domestic energy security. The thesis uses Cambodia’s hydropower sector as its case study to show how China’s regional pursuit, geo-economics strategy, and energy diplomacy can shed light on recent regional power shifts and China’s increasingly recognized regional role as a cooperative leader.","['Cambodia', 'China', 'Energy Diplomacy', 'Sino-Cambodian Relations', 'Overseas Hydropower Investment']"
Ustopian Literature: A Matter of Perspective in Twentieth Century Utopian and Dystopian Literature,"Perez, Nathalie","['Leeuwen, Evert Jan van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The dystopian genre has had a surge of popularity in television and movies the past few years with movies such as the Hunger Games and series such as Netflix’s Black Mirror. However, the genre’s popularity had its beginning in the early years of the twentieth century, in particular, thanks to the contributions of Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. Their books, Huxley’s Brave New World (1932) and Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), are to this day lauded for their prophetic elements. On the one hand, Brave New World explores scientific progress and the negative consequences it could entail. Some of the inventions present in the novel were not yet invented at the time that Huxley wrote them, such as for example birth control for women. On the other hand, Orwell’s exploration of cruelty by totalitarian regimes and the high-tech espionage of their citizens through cameras in Nineteen Eighty Four, well before the Soviet Union’s KGB and the East-German Stasi applied them during the Cold War, prophesied the rise of surveillance technologies in modern technocracies. These two foundational dystopian novels have their origins in the two authors’ critique of optimistic utopian narratives. The works of H.G. Wells, in particular, were viewed adversely by Huxley and Orwell. Despite the negative incentive, there are clear similarities between the novels of these three public intellectuals. H.G. Wells had a ground-breaking approach to communicating his ideas about science and society to a wider audience. In his scientific romances he combined aspects of the social novel with scientific theories about the progress of human civilization in order to express his vision of how to rid the world of its ills, which ultimately inspired, on the one hand, the scientific explorations of utopia in Brave New World and, on the other hand, the social protest against dystopian developments in Western society that Nineteen Eighty-four was to become. These would ultimately become two distinct kinds of dystopian literature: Huxley’s science-fiction dystopias and Orwell’s social dystopias. There are of course also combinations of both. The close readings of H.G. Wells’ Perez 4 Men Like Gods (1923), Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four will highlight the similarities between the three novels in terms of their treatment of the utopia/dystopia dichotomy and will show that the authors’ personal backgrounds played an important role in determining each different approach to the building of a utopia/dystopia in the respective novels.","['ustopia', 'dystopia', 'utopia', 'george orwell', 'aldous huxley', 'H.G.

The Question of Democracy: Exploring Israel’s Jewish and Democratic State,"Rabbani, Lina","['Forough, Mamad']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The self-image and international recognition of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state has prompted a wide range of scholarly debate since its establishment in 1948. The long-lasting Israel-Palestine conflict has led to a series of harmful acts within the state and as such, has resulted in many questioning Israel's claims to democracy. Since Israel is considered an example of a Western democratic state and is often recognized by the West as being the only successful democracy in the Middle East, this thesis aims to analyze this claim. By approaching the matter from a legal perspective, specifically focusing on the conception of citizenship and the allocation of land within Israel, the research demonstrates that laws practiced by the Israeli parliament leads to clear tension between the concepts 'Jewish' and 'democratic’, since the laws put into place to govern the citizens of the state have as a priority to uphold the Jewish character of the state and to protect the Jewish majority residing in Israel. As such, this research concludes that Israel should not be considered compatible to a traditional Western democracy, since the state's two identities, Jewish and democratic contradict each other in practice.","['Democracy', 'Israel', 'Jewish and Democratic State', 'Zionism', 'Palestinians', 'Israel Laws', 'Israeli Citizenship', 'Israeli Land Use']"
The Syrian conflict: an Illustration of China's new foreign policy strategy? Between non-action and intervention,"Biesold, Damon","['Forough, Mohammadbagher']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"An analysis on China's ambiguous stance on the Syrian conflict and the subsequent issues arising from it. China has over the years developed a foreign policy that deflects from its initial non-intervention motto to a more decisive role in global and regional politics. Despite reaffirming its commitment to non-interventionism, its stance and support towards Russia and the Assad's regime amidst the Syrian conflict, raises questions on whether or not China is abiding by its own rules. This thesis looks at this particular change in behaviour with the following research question: to what extent is it possible to consider China's involvement in the Syrian conflict as intervention? Firstly, this thesis seeks to analyse China's stance by looking at the use of its veto power at the United Nations Security Council, which seeks to implement resolutions aimed at sanctioning Assad's regime, offering thus its unwavering support to both Russia and Syria. Secondly, it asserts whether China's has indeed been involved military in the conflict through the transfer of arms from China to the Middle East, in particular Syria and Iran.",['China Foreign Policy Syria Arms transfer']

The European Monetary Union in an age of populism: To what extent have populist parties utilized structural features of the European Monetary Union in their attempt to raise public support?,"Lembke, Max","['Joost, Augusteijn']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"European integration efforts have led to the creation of a variety of political and economic institutions. Yet the main stimuli for these efforts have always been of an economic nature (K. R. McNamara 2006, 802). The success of early integration efforts in the form of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), has led to the establishment of further, more embedded institutions, such as the European Union (EU) and the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In particular, the creation of the EMU has been characterized, as “the most striking example of economic integration in history” (K. R. McNamara 2006, 803). Whilst some praise the ideological consensus reached and celebrate the economic and political successes; others highlight the incompleteness of the project (Jones, Kelemen, and Meunier 2016, 1010). The recent financial and European sovereign debt crisis exposed the underlying weaknesses of the EMU (Nicoli 2017, 392). Most notably, the European Central Bank (ECB) as the epicenter of the EMU, had its weak output and weak input legitimacy exposed (Alcidi, Giovannini, and Piedrafita 2014, 9). The continued reliance on the economic results, known as output legitimacy, used to rectify the lack of democratic representation, known as the input legitimacy, was unfeasible in the long-term (Alcidi, Giovannini, and Piedrafita 2014, 9). Academics such as Kathleen McNamara and Erik Jones outline, that this is due to the inherent shortcomings of the EMU’s structural features. This critique is not limited to the scholarly domain but it should be pointed out that “most citizens realized that integration entails serious normative costs” (Majone 2014, 1216). Citizens thereby experienced the adverse effects of economic growth and successes of past years which had previously been induced by the EMU. Although the crisis has recently been out of public attention, Mario Draghi, president of the ECB points out that, “the crisis has shown that the monetary union is incomplete and that the weaknesses need to be remedied” (Mario Draghi 2014). Yet, this has not occurred and the incompleteness of the monetary union, specifically its weaknesses, highlights the danger that the EMU is still currently facing; a danger, which does not only call into question decades of European integration but could send the entire integrated monetary union into financial turmoil and with it, the world economy. Whilst economic academia has focused on the consequences and causes of the crisis, political scientists have shifted their focus to the recent rise of populist parties throughout Europe. These have heavily critiqued the policies and alleged shortcomings of the ECB and with them the EMU. Nevertheless, whilst recognizing the rise of populist parties throughout Europe and the economic crisis, current academic debate in both the political and economic domain remains largely disconnected. Hence this thesis shall depart from current academia by exploring the connection between the structural weaknesses and the attempt by populist parties to generate public support by answering the question: To what extent have populist parties utilized structural features of the EMU in their attempt to raise public support? To answer this question, this thesis shall first provide an overview of the academic debate regarding the shortcomings that weaken the EMU and the structural features that aid their mandate through conducting a literature review. Furthermore, an overview of approaches to identify the positioning of political parties will be provided. This thesis shall utilize a version of the wordscore approach, a computerized quantitative methodology proposed by Laver et al. in 2003 (Laver, Benoit, and Garry 2003). This approach treats words as data, in order to identify the emphasis on a specific topic or position through assessing the use-frequency of a key term or phrase. This standardized methodology allows for the assessment of a variety of text types across time, which will provide the necessary data to answer the previously defined research question. To support the findings, qualitative discourse analysis will be used. This will be applied to analyze the Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany, AfD), in Germany and the Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs (Freedom Party Austria, FPÖ), in Austria which shall serve as case-studies for this thesis.","['democratic deficit', 'EMU', 'Europe', 'Germany', 'Austria', 'Populism']"
Imagining Place: How Do Katsushika Hokusai’s Landscape Prints Combine Local and Transcultural Elements? A Consideration of Cultural Appropriation,"Kiss, Cintia","['Mueller, Doreen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Katsushika Hokusai, one of the most influential reformers of Japanese popular art, contributed towards the formation of landscape genre within the ukiyo-e aesthetic. Hokusai’s vision of space reflects his Edokko understanding of place, which he filled with cultural references towards his contemporary identity and Japanese belonging. Furthermore, his genius lies in his enthusiastic, restless spirit that paved his life-long learning and experimentations in multiple stylistic traditions. Influences of Western style and technique can be discovered throughout his ‘early’ woodblock print designs, which marks one of the earliest traces of his tendency of appropriation. His mature landscape designs in the Thirty-Six Views of Mt Fuji series reflect a synthesis of such appropriations. The forty-six prints of this specific series fuses Western concepts of perspective, colour and shade with famous spaces within Japan that are connected with a common direction towards Mt Fuji. Under the Wave off Kanagawa, also known as the Great Wave, also incorporates such elements, and in addition to the established recognition of Mt Fuji, popularizes the animated wave motif at the same time. This particular design of Hokusai is re-imagined throughout the course of the artist’s lifetime, then in the context of Japonisme, post-war Japan, and through other modern and contemporary re-appropriations. Hokusai’s characteristic landscape of appropriated fusion of influences embarks on the journey of transcultural appropriation that elevates the Wave’s status from a Japanese symbol of identity to that of a global icon. Hokusai’s idea of landscape exemplified in the Great Wave is re-interpreted in multiple contexts, receiving new meanings through appropriations continuously.","['Katsushika Hokusai', 'Cultural Appropriation', 'Japanese Landscape Prints', 'Thirty-Six Views of Mt Fuji', 'Under the Wave off Kanagawa', 'Mt Fuji', 'Japonisme', 'Transcultural Appropriation', 'Ukiyo-e Prints']"

CULTURAL STEREOTYPES AND THE LACK OF WOMEN’S PARTICIPATION IN GUATEMALAN POLITICS: A Study on Sandra Torres and the Outcome of the 2015 Guatemalan General Elections,"Ilieva, Siya","['Vieira, Eduardo Alves']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Stereotypes are powerful constructs embedded in humans’ minds that are difficult to be changed. Furthermore, in the region of Latin America, machismo and marianismo beliefs dictate the proper behaviour of men and women and establish norms of conduct. Hence, existing cultural expectations regarding the role of females in the society translate into concrete realities that limit females’ availability for professional development. This Bachelor Thesis studies the influence of gender stereotypes, machismo and marianismo beliefs in Guatemala on the outcome of the 2015 general elections in the country and the defeat of Sandra Torres. To this end, articles from both national and international newspapers are analysed through critical discourse analysis. Since media conveys knowledge and reinforces meaning regarding the position of males and females in the society, it is discovered to be a powerful influencer on the way the Guatemalan population votes. Therefore, this Bachelor Thesis provides an explanation about the relationship between media representation of Sandra Torres and her loss in the 2015 general elections. Additionally, the results of the analysis of the case study in Guatemala illustrate how media strengthens existing cultural norms and expectations regarding the role and the behaviour of females, which in turn impact people’s attitudes towards women in a certain manner; thus, obstruct females to engage with politics and to develop a professional career in the field.","['culture', 'gender stereotypes', ""women's participation in politics"", 'Guatemala', 'Sandra Torres', '2015 Guatemalan general elections', 'machismo', 'marianismo', 'critical discourse analysis']"

Tōkaidō Yotsuya kaidan’s Oiwa: Analysis of a kabuki vengeful ghost,"Mansi, Rachele","['Smits, I.B.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This essay analyses Oiwa, the female vengeful ghost protagonist of the kabuki play Tōkaidō Yotsuya kaidan, written by Tsuruya Nanboku IV in 1825. Due to its popularity, Oiwa has been a widely discussed topic by experts of the field, but there is a fundamental issue to reconsider if we are to achieve a better understanding of this character: why did she turn into a vengeful spirit? By applying the theoretical concept of intertextuality, i.e. by considering the relations between Yotsuya kaidan and other texts such as its sources and other plays from Nanboku’s repertoire, this thesis challenges the consolidated opinion that Oiwa turned into this frightful creature out of jealousy towards her unfaithful husband. Although jealousy is impossible to exclude, it argues that key to unravelling the motivations behind Oiwa’s revenge is the status of Yotsuya kaidan as the parody of the famous dramatization of the forty-seven ronin’s tale Kanadehon Chūshingura (1748). As propaedeutic to the making of this point, this work also looks at a less discussed side of Oiwa’s character, that as a daughter, wife and mother of a samurai household at the end of the Edo period.","['Tōkaidō Yotsuya kaidan', 'Oiwa', 'Vengeful ghost', 'Jealousy', 'Kabuki', 'Intertextuality']"
"Turkish migration to Germany in the 20th century and beyond: effects on economy, identity, culture and politics","Herborn, Julia","['Migliori, Laura']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"While Turks have been welcomed to the German Federal Republic (FRG) with the launch of the guest worker program in the 1960s, their presence seems to have developed into a contemporary issue. The purpose of this thesis is thus to examine the reasons and effects of a change in public perception regarding the migration of Turks to the FRG between the 1960s and the present day. This development will be revealed through an analysis of magazine articles from the 1960s as well as more recent ones, and the distinctive media framing of Turks within them. The change in perception of Turkish individuals in Germany will be analyzed from an interdisciplinary approach, including economic, identity, cultural and political perspectives. First, a range of migration theories will be reviewed and a short historical background will be given in order to contextualize the subject matter. Subsequently, the main factors contributing to a change in the perception of Turkish migrants in Germany will be highlighted by presenting economic, identity and culturally driven, as well as political factors. This approach is vital since all of the named factors had a considerable effect in shaping the way Turks are being viewed. As will be highlighted by the research, the perception of Turkish migrants in Germany subsists to be a particularly significant one, due to its contribution to country’s identity, culture, society and everyday life. The migration of Turks to Germany is not only a subject of much and ongoing controversy, but has also been shaping German identity, culture and discourse in a considerable way. The research will thus contribute to the already existing field through an interdisciplinary approach, revealing the connection of a range of factors in shaping the perception of Turkish migrants within Germany. This will consequently allow for a broader and more advanced insight into the overall subject matter.","['Migration', 'Guest Workers', 'Germany', 'Turkey', 'Changing Perception']"
Leadership Capital and the Houthi Mobilization,"Karisto, Anna","['Azoulay, Rivka']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Houthis managed to invade the capital of Yemen in 2014. During the preceding decades, the Houthis had turned from a religious student organization into a political and military organization and gone though six wars against the government. Reasons for their success have been argued to be their popular support and adaptability in identity construction, while the role of framing in the mobilization process has also been studied. This research ties these explanations together by means of the tripartite leadership capital theory by Nepstad and Bob, and shows how the components of the theory, namely, cultural, social, and symbolic capital helped the Houthi leadership in gaining support. This research shows that the symbolic capital of the Houthi movement is not attributed to one person but rather the family. In addition, this research examines the opponents of the Houthis and shows that leadership capital also partially explains why certain individuals supported the Houthis and others did not. Furthermore, this research critically assesses the role of the Houthi leadership in the mobilization process during the wars and shows that the role of leadership shifted when the conflict escalated, as many individuals joined the fight with Houthis for reasons completely unrelated to the leadership.","['Yemen', 'Houthi Movement', 'Leadership Capital', 'Leadership in Social Movements', 'Structure and Agency']"

To meet the growing energy needs, Lao is constructing hydropower dams on the Mekong mainstream which will have negative transboundary impacts. In this thesis, I focus on the absence of escalated inter-state conflict in the Mekong River Basin despite the disputed construction of hydropower dams on the Mekong mainstream. The question that I aim to answer is whether the Mekong River Commission (MRC) is accountable for the absence of escalated inter-state conflict despite the controversial construction of hydropower dams on the mainstream. I found that for the MRC to be accountable for the absence of escalated inter-state conflict, it should have applied issue linkage to settle the dispute, it should have settled the disputes through a dispute-settlement mechanism and it should have monitored the development of the river. I found that the MRC is not accountable for the absence of escalated inter-state conflict and maintenance of cooperation, because its dispute-settlement mechanism failed to settle the Xayaburi dispute and the MRC was not directly accountable for the issue linkages created. I conclude that another driving force must have been accountable for the absence of inter-state conflict.","['hydropower', 'conflict', 'monitoring', 'dispute settlement', 'mekong', 'benefit-sharing', 'issue-linkage']"
Immigration discourse in Russia,"Martirosyan, Tsowinar","['Robbe, Ksenia']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores how the discourse around immigration in Russia is shaped by the government, and by society segmented in actors disapproving or favorable of immigration. From the selected primary sources, four main themes of discussion and four subsequent main techniques of persuasion used in argumentation around the themes are identified and scrutinized through critical discourse analysis. The main themes are economy, security, lifestyle and demography; the main techniques are play on emotion, anecdotal approach, comparison and statistical manipulation. The main findings of this paper constitute the following. The government pursues a dual policy to maximize the number of its adherents, and in its rhetoric most noticeably uses comparison for the purpose of justifying its policies. Anti-immigrant groups exploit all techniques extensively and mostly build their numerous arguments around economic, security and lifestyle concerns. Immigrant advocacy groups refrain from thorough discussion of security issues, present a limited amount of economic arguments, and focus instead on lifestyle and demography. They use all techniques as well but mainly play on emotion and narrate individual stories, displaying the immigrants’ perspective and encouraging leniency.","['Russia', 'CIS', 'immigration', 'government', 'society', 'discourse']"

In Turkey in particular, mothers-to-be are affected by a changing political rhetoric portrayed in national media, the influence of friends and family within their immediate social surroundings, and the cultural understanding of the doctor’s role in the clinical environment. Accordingly, my research puts forward that the Global Health challenge of unprecedented increases in C-sections world-wide cannot be viewed independently of the specific environment through which mothers navigate leading up to birth. Although influencing factors in the decision-making process stem from the political, social and medical perceptions at large, their composition is highly context dependant. Through the lens of body politics, my research will address the medicalization of the female body as well as the increasing normalizing of the surgical birth procedure intended for emergencies. Rooted in biopower, body politics, as informed by Dr. Wendy Harcourt, will constitute the framework to make sense of the factors influencing women leading up to their delivery. Using this approach, my qualitative research will shed light on how women’s decision-making processes regarding child delivery are shaped in Turkey’s political, socio-cultural and clinical environment.","['Medical Anthropology', 'Global Health', 'Cesarean Sections', 'Turkey', 'Body Politics', 'Biopower']"
Tourism in Tunisia: Trick or Treat?,"Righetti, Laura Stephanie Mariette","['Henderson, Christian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The economic impacts of tourism have been discussed widely, but mostly through the Tourism-led growth hypothesis. That is why; this thesis will contrast two viewpoints that I apply to the tourism industry, which are the tourism-led growth hypothesis and the resource curse approach. Tunisia will be a useful case study because it epitomizes the debate on tourism due to its colonial history and the fact that its mass tourism development was centred on the well-known ‘sun, sand, sea’ package. The positive economic impacts of tourism, but also the costs of tourism will be analysed by the means of answering the following research question: How has mass tourism influenced the economic development of Tunisia since the late 1980s?. The purpose of this thesis is to research and understand the development and the economic impacts of the tourism industry in Tunisia. The theoretical framework will give an overview of the literature regarding the various perspectives on tourism. The conclusions drawn from this research provide insights into the positive economic impacts of the development of the tourism sector in Tunisia. I will also demonstrate throughout my thesis that there are constraining factors to the economic development of the industry. This implies that Tunisia could upscale its economic benefits from this sector. The aims of the research are to give recommendations to Tunisian policy-makers, and to suggest further research on the cross-sectoral linkages between tourism and the agricultural sector.","['Tunisia', 'Middle East', 'Tourism', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Resource Curse', 'Crowding out effect', 'Tourism-led growth hypothesis']"

Mexico; a failed state?,"Boon, Franka","['Crevels, Mily']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis analyzes the ongoing debate to what extent Mexico can be considered a failed state. There are different points of view about the concept of the failed state, on the one hand it is commonly accepted; and on the other hand it is mainly seen as a Western paradigm. Mexico has longstanding problems with violence and the failure of the government to provide internal security, both a result of the democratization of this century and the war on drugs by the government. The government cannot address the violence effectively because of the dysfunction of institutions like the police. Another longstanding problem that influences the country are the human rights abuses, in relation to the war on drugs. However, despite these longstanding problems, the Mexican state overall is not failed and will not fail in the near future because it functions effectively on other levels. Economically the country has a strong position in the region. Moreover, the government is able to perform its daily tasks effectively. The failed state paradigm does not take into account the specific cultural and historic characteristics of state development, which is different in every region. The structural problems in Mexico can pose a threat to democracy in the country, but will not lead to state failure.",['Mexico failed state']

El tango, por su génesis y circulación, se identificó como música popular, o perteneciente a los modos de circulación cultural propios de las clases populares de Buenos Aires y Montevideo a principios de principios del siglo XX. A lo largo de la historia ha recibido influencias de otros estilos musicales como el sainete español, la habanera, la milonga criolla, el jazz, pero poquísimas son las referencias que emparentan el tango canción surgido a partir de 1916 con la ópera lírica. Por el contrario, tango y ópera están inscritos como dos géneros antagónicos, sin mayor relación aparente que la técnica vocal lírica implementada por Gardel en sus interpretaciones. Incluso hoy en día la sensibilidad respecto de esta dicotomía sigue siendo muy vulnerable. El presente trabajo está orientado a distinguir la operación narrativa del tango canción y de la ópera lírica verista, y a identificar los puntos de encuentro que pudieron tener estos dos géneros artísticos y su rol en la conformación del identitario cultural, indagando sobre los elementos comunes que aportó la inmigración italiana y sobre el proceso que hizo posible esta vinculación.","['opera verista', 'tango canción', 'identidad cultural', 'inmigración italiana']"

Were Afghan refugees denied legal rights by the Iranian government during the Taliban era in Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001.,"Amir, Roma","['Shahnahpur, Saeedeh']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis proposal seeks to assess the legal plight of Afghan refugees who fled to Iran, when the Taliban came into power in 1994-2001. It will investigate the factual circumstances to establish their status as refugees under international law. It will define the role of the Iranian State and its legal responsibilities to refugees. Analysis of the historical facts involving the refugees, and the legal responsibilities of the State of Iran leads to the conclusive findings enclosed. It concludes with recommendations for the State of Iran, how to raise its standard of treatment of refugees within its borders to international human right standards. Most of the Afghans fled to Iran, but also to other neighboring countries such as Pakistan and Uzbekistan. According to Strand and Suhrke (2004) This mass displacement involved 2,3 million Afghans refugees in Iran. As this thesis proposes failures on behalf of the State of Iran it is important to identify the factual conditions refugees were facing in the host country. As, this paper is critically examining how the government of Iran, the host country, dealt with the Afghan refugees during the Taliban reign from 1994 until 2001, It argues laws imposed on Afghan refugees in Iran were disproportionate. This thesis intends to convey how important the refugees could be for Iran and how Iran better could deal with the refugees. It does so, by identifying, facts, legal issues and through analysis and conclusion; proposes international protocols and standards for change.","['Iran', 'Afghanistan', 'war', 'Taliban', 'Afghan refugees', 'Iranian government', 'law']"

Ik zet de bevindingen in de context van de academische literatuur, en naast de definitie van de overheid, door een kwalitatieve content analyse te maken. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de overheid weliswaar een idee heeft wat het salafisme inhoudt, maar ondertussen religieuze concepten te veel benadrukt, daar waar de websites ze zelf minder aandacht geven. Ondertussen schenkt de overheid te weinig aandacht aan religieuze concepten die voor de websites juist heel belangrijk zijn. Dit komt met name omdat de overheid zich op veiligheid concentreert, en niet zozeer op de theologie. De theologische aspecten die de maatschappelijke veiligheid mogelijk kunnen bedreigen, krijgen hierdoor meer aandacht dan theologisch gerechtvaardigd zou zijn. Hierdoor is de definitie van de overheid in theologische zin onvoldoende accuraat, en slechts beperkt van toepassing in de Nederlandse context.","['Salafisme', 'Nederland', 'AIVD']"

MY SOUL IS NOT ME,"Mierlo, Sietse van","['Bdaiwi, Ahab']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this essay I will defend the thesis that Aquinas’ account of practical reason does not entail, and is inconsistent with, the autonomy of morality. That is to say, I believe that Aquinas holds the position that morality depends upon theoretical reason and upon our given desires. In order to defend this position, I will make two claims. On the one hand, I will defend the thesis that Aquinas does not accept the existence of the is-ought gap. That is to say, Aquinas believes that we sometimes can justly conclude a normative assertion from a set of factual premises. On the other hand, I also have to justify my belief that Aquinas holds an instrumentalist account of practical reasoning. In other words, Aquinas claims that reasons for actions supervene upon our inner desires. I will try to justify my belief in these two claims by explaining two major concepts in Aquinas’ philosophy. Firstly, I will explain how the notions of goodness and being relate to each other semantically and metaphysically in Aquinas’ philosophy. We will see that ‘being’ and ‘goodness’ are synonymous in denotation. Secondly, I will explain the meaning and use of ‘prudence’ in Aquinas’ practical philosophy. The content of our decision how to act is ‘determined by’ or ‘supervenes upon’ our prior desires.","['Aquinas', 'is-ought gap', 'John Finnis', 'New natural law', 'Prudence', 'goodness and being']"

Yakuwarigo Lost in Translation: A Foreignising Approach to Translating Yakuwarigo,"Heerink, Dorien","['Bovelander, Maud']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The main topic of this thesis is yakuwarigo in translation. Yakuwarigo, the Japanese word for role language, is a type of language use often used in works of fiction which evokes the image of a certain type of character, such as an old man or a young girl, by using certain first-person pronouns, copula and sentence-ending particles (Kinsui 2013). Translating yakuwarigo can be extremely challenging because the Japanese language has many opportunities for variation where English does not. For that reason, yakuwarigo is often standardised in the target text, even though this negatively impacts the uniqueness of the characters (Terada, 2015). While there is quite a bit of literature available on yakuwarigo, hardly any research has been done on the topic of yakuwarigo in translation. In this thesis, the feasibility of translating yakuwarigo from Japanese to English using a foreignising translation strategy is examined. The research question is: “To what extent is it possible to translate yakuwarigo from Japanese to English with a foreignising translation strategy?”. The answer to this question is formed by two parts: a theoretical framework and a case study. In the theoretical framework, a number of different topics are discussed, such as translation strategies, equivalence, and stereotyping. In the case study, six characters of a manga (Japanese cartoon) are analysed in the original version as well as in a fan translation. Additionally, a new translation of is proposed based on the acquired information. It was found that despite the fact that it is impossible to translate yakuwarigo to English perfectly, it is possible to translate characters in such a way that their language reflects their main personality traits. This is done by adapting the font, punctuation and lexical choices, among others, to the character’s personality as a way of compensating for the original yakuwarigo.","['Yakuwarigo', 'Role Language', 'Translation', 'Japanese', 'English', 'Manga', 'Foreignisation']"

The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is the source of mysteries and fantasies on the international stage when it comes to the topic of human rights. This thesis is an attempt to give a critical outlook on the situation in order to understand the major issues raised by the case of North Korean human rights. It will try show what causes this biased perception of North Korean human rights that we have in Occident by setting a theoretical framework, giving an overview of the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and analysing some of the main sources used to deal with human rights in North Korea. This study will conclude by saying that human rights in North Korea are indeed unique in many aspects and that they are not to be taken lightly. But the view that Occidental countries have on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is twisted by a Western perspective that is the source of many fantasies and approximations regarding this country. Finally, we will see that the North Korean case echoes to a much broader problem in the international community.",['Human Rights North Korea']

Despite the disappointing results so far, the ambition to establish a viable regional organisation lives on and was put back on the agenda in several countries in the region, nowadays collectively referred to as Eurasia. This revitalisation has resulted in the Eurasian Economic Union, a new agent that is supposed to turn the tide in the process of region-building amongst post-Soviet states. The first part of this research compares the EAEU with its predecessors and provides answers on how the EAEU attempts to break with the legacy of unsuccessful regionalism. The second part is devoted to a comparative analysis on the EAEU and EU, which the young regional organisation claims to emulate. This examination covers the analysis and synthesis of similarities and patterns in fields where forms of emulation are acknowledgeable. The outcomes are presented though linking the results of two comparative analyses with primary data obtained through questionnaires. Lastly, within this thesis the uniqueness of Eurasia as a symbioses of Asian and European traditions plays a central role.","['Comparative Regionalism', 'Institutional Emulation', 'Eurasian Economic Union', 'Eurasianism', 'Eurasian Integration', 'Post-Soviet Affairs']"
Silenced Ghosts: A comparison of Spanish and German “reconciliation” attempts,"Murgatroyd, Benjamin","['Rodriguez Idarraga, Nicolas']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"During the 20th Century, both Germany and Spain had atrocities committed against specific groups of people at home under fascist leaderships. Both countries democratised with the death of their leader, leaving members from the previous regime in power. However, two very different approaches to reconciliation were taken. Germany prosecuted the leaders of the old regime, implemented collective guilt across the population, and either destroyed fascist memorials and insignias or actively challenged them with counter-memorials. As opposed to following the German path to reconciliation, the fruits of which could be seen during the democratisation of Spain, the new democracy decided to implement the 1975 Pact of Forgetting, an unwritten agreement to not bring up the atrocities committed under Franco for fear of retribution. In order to understand the events that led to two very different outcomes through the use of interviews, analysis of the Suárez’s cabinet, and analysis of the use of memorials in both cases, this paper will ask why did Spain choose to avoid a similar reconciliation process to the one taken by West Germany thirty years prior despite being in a similar state and what role did public history play?","['Spain', 'Germany', 'Reconciliation', 'Memory', 'Franco', 'Francoist', 'Nazi', 'Suárez', 'Catalonia', 'Memorial', 'Justice', 'Truth', 'Amnesty', 'Statecraft', 'Heidelberg', 'Holocaust', 'Civil', 'Junta', 'Bundestag', 'Adenauer']"

Machismo y política en Chile: Participación de las mujeres en la política nacional durante la presidencia de Michelle Bachelet,"Saitlova, Martina","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,es,"Este trabajo trata la participación política de las mujeres a nivel nacional en Chile. El énfasis se pone a los cambios en la participación política de las mujeres a nivel nacional en el período 2000 - 2010 con el enfoque en el liderazgo político y en la agenda de género del gobierno de Michelle Bachelet. También este trabajo estudia la evolución de la participación de las mujeres como candidatas en las elecciones parlamentarias en dicho período. Para el análisis de esta temática se utilizan varias teorías de autores como Fernández Poncela, Franceschet, Fernández Ramil, Ríos y Reyes Housholder que describen ante todo la oportunidad política de las mujeres, el liderazgo femenino y la participación sustantiva y descriptiva de las mujeres que son claves para este trabajo. La mayoría de los datos fueron recogidos durante el trabajo de campo que complementa la literatura sobre esta temática. Las entrevistas con varios expertos tratan los temas de machismo, percepción de las mujeres de parte de la sociedad, el comportamiento de los partidos políticos hacia las mujeres, las razones de mayor participación de las mujeres y la figura de Michelle Bachelet y su impacto en la política chilena. El análisis intenta a responder la pregunta si el liderazgo de Michelle Bachelet ha aumentado la participación política de las mujeres y la política de la primera presidenta de Chile ha generado un aumento de las mujeres en la política nacional. El análisis muestra que el impacto de Michelle Bachelet no fue tan alto como se tenía esperado. El trabajo señala que la figura de Bachelet tiene un valor simbólico porque logró visibilizar la agenda de género y la necesidad de la equidad de género en Chile. También es posible resumir que el ámbito político chileno sigue siendo muy machista y muy complejo para que haya una mayor inserción de las mujeres a cargos políticos. Bachelet es una excepción que logró un éxito, pero en el campo de las políticas pro-mujer no siempre fue exitosa. Durante su segundo gobierno logró que se aprobara la ley de cuota de género que finalmente terminó con la baja participación política de las mujeres, pero todavía es necesario promover más las políticas públicas dirigidas a las mujeres y desarrollar la política de género como muestra este trabajo.","['Machismo', 'Chile', 'representación pública de las mujeres', 'presidencia de Michelle Bachelet', 'perspectiva de género', 'política de género en Chile', 'género y política.']"

Market Liberalization versus Market Protectionism: The Role of Government in Silicon Valley and China’s Technology Sector,"Tideman, Laurens","['Gonzalez Vicente, Ruben']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on Silicon Valley and China to understand what elements have made Silicon Valley and China’s technology sectors so successful, and to what degree they are different. Specifically, it will focus on the role of the government in shaping the respective markets. The American and Chinese view of the government’s role in economic development differs both in theory and practice. The U.S. traditionally advocated for a liberal free-market view of the economy, with the government having a facilitating role. In contrast, true to its socialist ideology, China has advocated a strong role of the government in the economy, where the government principally takes on a controlling and planning role. While in theory these views are at the opposite side of the spectrum between freedom from the state versus control by the state, in practice there are variations and exceptions. The goal of this thesis is to provide further insight on these similarities and differences through a case-study based analysis of both Silicon Valley and China's tech sector.","['technology hubs', 'government', 'market liberalization', 'silicon valley', 'statism', 'china']"

"Cross-Dressing and the Performativity of Gender in Shakespeare’s plays Twelfth Night, As You Like It and The Merchant of Venice – Then and Now","Immers, Naomi Lisette Gabrielle","['Dijkhuizen, Jan Frans van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In her highly influential book Gender Trouble, as well as in other publications such as “Performative Acts and Gender Constitution” and “Imitation and Gender Insubordination,” Judith Butler argues for the performative nature of gender and especially the performativity of heterosexual masculinity. She discusses gender as a theatrical performance and claims that gender is, in essence, an imitation of a non-existent original. She argues that gender is collectively produced by society in a way similar to how plays are produced for the stage. The performance of cross-dressing can be especially disruptive of the illusion that gender identity is built around a stable core, and often highlight the every-day performance that is masculinity. Although most Shakespeare plays do not explicitly discuss cross-dressing practices, female roles in Shakespeare’s England were performed by young boys. Some of the plays do discuss the theme overtly, especially those that feature double cross-dressing. In the plays As You Like It, The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, Cymbeline, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona, female characters disguise themselves as men for an array of reasons. The boys in these plays literally perform two genders as a role – both the (traditional) female and male gender role are performed on the stage. Through this, the boundaries of gender are blurred and its performativity highlighted. Scholars such as Michael Shapiro and Stephen Orgel have researched gender in Shakespeare’s plays extensively. In their respective books, Gender in Play on the Shakespearean Stage and Impersonations: The performance of gender in Shakespeare’s England, they discuss what effect the presence of the boy actors has on the plays and how Shakespeare deliberately alluded to their presence. Through jests, comments and allusions, Shakespeare’s plays explore the act of cross-dressing, homoeroticism and question gender boundaries. Shakespeare’s (double) cross-dressed characters highlight the performativity of gender, especially masculinity, in a way similar to what Butler discusses in her works on gender performativity. Casey Charles, in his essay “Gender Trouble in Twelfth Night”, applies Butler’s ideas to several scenes in the play. He argues that “Judith Butler's critique … provides a useful model for understanding” how Shakespeare’s plays disrupt traditional ideas on gender and sexuality. His application of Butler to Twelfth Night in turn provides a model for the analysis of other plays in this thesis. In this thesis, I will first discuss Butler’s ideas on performative gender. Secondly, I will analyse how gender is portrayed as a performative act in three plays: The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night and As You Like It. Thirdly, I will discuss how the casting boys or (young) men in original productions of these plays impacts the meaning of the disguises, as well as that of the plays as a whole. After investigating the original texts and productions, I will also analyse modern productions of the three plays by Shakespeare’s Globe company, and show how they deal with the notions of boy actors, performative gender and cross-dressing, as well as Shakespeare’s original comments and allusions. I will argue that within the three plays, comments, humour, and reflexive allusions highlight the presence of the boy actor. Through these, the plays also portray gender – especially masculinity – as a performative act that is similar to the acts that Butler describes in her work. Since most modern productions opt for women to play the cross-dressed characters in the play, many of the intended allusions are lost. Therefore, it is essential for the preservation of both the originally intended plays as well as the timeless messages on gender they carry that all-male productions remain.","['shakespeare', 'gender', 'judith butler', 'performative gender', 'merchant of venice', 'twelfth night', 'as you like it', 'cross-dressing']"

"Hamburg at the Imperial Diet of 1640-'41, a New Diplomatic History","Quartero, Felix","['Ebben, Maurits']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Despite Hamburg's eminence as an imperial centre of commerce and diplomacy in the lead-up to the Congress of Westphalia, study of the city's own imperial politics and diplomacy has been harkened by a shortage on source material. In general, historians have stressed Hamburg's tendency to fare a neutralist, autonomic and commerce-driven course. This study has set out to give a complete and positively defined interpretation of the city's diplomacy, assessing its political ambitions, diplomatic means and day-to-day manifestation at the Imperial Diet in Regensburg of 1640-1641 by way of the relatively complete correspondence between the Senate and its diplomats, as well as the financial accounts of the mission. In all, Hamburg’s access to government dignitaries and its use of the services of Imperial bureaucrats demonstrate a more versatile and active diplomatic involvement in Imperial diplomacy than perhaps envisioned earlier by scholars. Positively defined, its diplomacy operated at eye-level with that of the King of Denmark, using funds, support from the Electors and publication in a similar fashion and to a comparable degree. Hamburg’s engagement with the Empire’s dignitaries, bureaucrats, and institutions such as the Imperial Aulic Council show Hamburg’s ready use of the institutions of the Holy Roman Empire, and underline that in important respects the city was far from diplomatically isolated or disengaged with matters of Empire.",['Hamburg diplomacy Holy Roman Empire Hanse']

Bilingualism and Choices: The Use of English in Korean Hip Hop Songs,"Koene, Kayra","['Jeffery, Jill']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Although hip hop first set foot in South Korea 25 years ago, the genre has received exponential popularity over the last 5 years. Korean hip hop takes after its American counterpart in many ways, including the use of the English language. Within the Korean hip hop scene there are many ethnical Koreans that were American born, or lived in America for years. These ethnical Koreans are fluent in Korean as well as English. So how does the English use of these Koreans compare to the English use of hip hop artist that are only fluent in Korean in terms of vocabulary or slang, poetic devices, grammatical preferences and frequency? This paper will analyze Korean hip hop lyrics by both artists that speak fluent Korean and English as well as artists that speak only fluent Korean. Through register analysis and literary analysis this paper will quantitatively determine the differences between English usages of the two groups. This paper provides numeric data as well as examples that show that these differences in proficiency level are also apparent in relatively short texts like song lyrics. In this way this research will assess differences in English use between Korean English bilinguals and Korean monolinguals.","['bilingualism', 'korean', 'english', 'discourse']"

A Tale of Two Empties: the philosophy of emptiness in Buddhism and Daoism,"Eenink, Bram","['Harris, Stephen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"A comparative analysis between the concept of emptiness in the Buddhist and Daoist tradition. A general introduction of the Buddhist tradition was given, followed by a specific discussion of the Madhyamaka school and its concept of śūnyatā. Śūnyatā designates the absence of an intrinsic essence to any aspect of existence and can thus be considered a form of philosophical emptiness. This was followed by an analysis of the Daoist tradition, which deals with emptiness in multiple forms: its central concept of ‘way-making’, the notion of spatiality, and the ethically relevant wu-forms. Finally, a comparison between Daoist and Buddhist forms of emptiness was offered. Both philosophies consider the meaning of emptiness to involve the ambiguity of linguistic definition, the utility of spatial or causal receptivity, and the ethics of selflessness. In the conclusion, emptiness was offered up as a philosophical through-line that can unite disparate schools of thought and provide the foundation for a more global philosophy.","['Daoism', 'Buddhism', 'Emptiness']"

Effect of language context in non-native perception of intonation: Insights from Dutch listeners' perception of Mandarin,"Shek, Eric","['Chen, Yiya']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Previous studies have indicated that native and non-native listeners’ attention to differences in segments and lexical tones is heightened when language context is removed. Do they also display greater sensitivity to intonational differences in the absence of language context? To examine this question, this thesis tests the ability of Dutch and Mandarin listeners to identify Mandarin questions and statements that differ only in intonation in three different levels of language context: no language context, a neutral language context, and a constraining language context. All listeners were found to identify questions and statements better with each increasing level of language context. This suggests that the presence of a meaningful semantic context facilitates the perception of intonational meaning. Moreover, Mandarin listeners were better at identifying questions and statements than non-native listeners in sentences with language context. But the difference between Mandarin and Dutch listeners’ abilities was minimal in sentences without language context. This result suggests that the effect of language experience on intonation perception is diminished at the lower auditory processing level.","['Mandarin', 'Dutch', 'intonation perception', 'auditory processing', 'lingustic processing', 'context']"

"The tension between Utopia and Dystopia under late capitalism: control, alienation and resistance in ""Mr. Robot"" and ""Black Mirror""","Bartolone, Giulia","['Horsman, Yasco']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"By examining two of the most acclaimed and popular televisual productions recently released, Mr. Robot (USA Network, 2015 - present) and Black Mirror (Channel 4/Netflix, 2011 - present), I wish to show up to what extent they portray the expansion of capitalism into the political, cultural and social dimensions of our Western contemporary reality as a phenomenon weakening our utopian sense of the future. Drawing upon the field of social theory, I will argue that Mr. Robot, with its emphasis on the political and cultural domains, shows how mechanisms of control and manipulation responding to the logic of late capitalism and consumerism are influencing our ability to imagine a new and alternative system to the current one. In the case of Black Mirror, criticism towards late capitalism revolves around the use and abuse of new technologies, which implement the spiral of image addiction, the power of commodities, and cause a dramatic change in the way we perceive the boundaries between life and death. Throughout my analysis, I will refer to the utopian genre, and, specifically, its most recent variation of critical dystopia, with the aim of considering the tension and interaction between utopia and dystopia in the two TV series as a strategy, first, to raise awareness in the public about the most degrading aspects of our reality and, secondly, to reinvigorate a concept of utopia not as escapist thinking, but as a transformative impulse to change society and potentially overcome the cultural deadlock of capitalism.","['utopia', 'dystopia', 'late capitalism', 'postmodernism', 'societies of control', 'Mr. Robot', 'Black Mirror']"

Second language users’ attitudes towards the ‘correctness’ of global English pronunciations,"Catling, Amy","['Smakman, D.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In a pronunciation evaluation task, 30 Dutch students of English Language & Culture responded to questions about the ‘correctness’ in pronunciation of 4 speakers of global Englishes. This included two L1 speakers (from London and New Delhi), and two L2 speakers (from Groningen and Zhengzhou). Follow-up interviews were conducted with 10 participants for further insight. Results showed that the pronunciations were ranked as most to least correct in regard to their similarity to RP. However, three factors were highly influential in participants’ evaluations. Firstly, prosodic features were found to be the defining feature of ‘good’ pronunciation. Secondly, identification of a speaker’s accent affected participants’ overall evaluations. Finally, a speaker was thought to have a lower standard of pronunciation if they did not have an RP accent, regardless of how easy they were to understand. Overall, English was found to be indexical of the UK or USA due to RP and GA being the standard pronunciation models, and if these teaching models are to continue to be the norm, there is an overwhelming need to increase the use of other pronunciation models as stimuli in the classroom to address the practical realities of using English today.","['sociolinguistics', 'second language acquisition', 'language attitudes', 'English', 'international English', 'pronunciation']"
Where the unstoppable force meets the immovable object: Understanding the Sino-Russian relationship through the lens of China’s SREB and Russia’s EEU,"Wegter, Laura M. L.","['Forough, Mohammadbagher']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"A review of the literature on the Sino-Russian relationship identifies a widening mismatch between expectations and reality. Scholarly expectations highlight the propensity of conflict, based upon traditional security considerations resulting in a definition of the Sino-Russian relationship that is limited, instrumental and asymmetric—an ‘axis of convenience’ according to mainstream scholars. Tensions are held to be most conspicuous in Russia and China’s shared backyard: Central Asia. Since the 2010s, both China and Russia have engaged in efforts to rearrange their regional backyards and consolidate influence over their smaller neighbours. The simultaneous, yet juxtapositional, establishment of Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and China’s Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) are widely deemed to reflect the independent foreign policy objectives of each party as well as the traditional security considerations underlying their regional projects. As a result, they have led many analysts to foresee a new Great Game in the region. To date, tensions have not surfaced, why? Contributing to critical scholarship, this thesis engages in securitization theory to gain insights into the different identities and security drivers underlying both powers’ regional initiatives. Appreciating the normative and ideational underpinnings of Russia’s EEU and China’s SREB, this research provides a new take upon the question why, and to what extent, the relationship does work—instead of why it does not, or will not, work. A poststructuralist discourse analysis has been conducted to examine these discursive representations of identity and security and answer this thesis’ main research question: To what extent do the security discourses of Russia’s EEU and China’s SREB explain the compatibility of the two initiatives? The findings of this thesis provide a balanced and contextualized account of both powers’ regional initiatives and give greater attention to the forces of convergence shaping the Sino-Russian relationship in the region and beyond.","['Sino-Russian relationship', 'Central Asia', 'Eurasian Economic Union', 'Silk Road Economic Belt', 'China', 'Russia', 'regionalism', 'poststructuralist discourse analysis']"
"Abenomics, or: How we learned the public to stop worrying and ignore the debt","Schreur, Valerie","['Black, L.O.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Debt refinancing or consolidation is a trend for states worldwide. In Japan, due to Abenomics’ extensive monetary policy, state debt has risen greatly. This debt is deemed sustainable to the official discourse of financial institutions, since it is held nationally and debt is sought to be refinanced through the national financial system. This paper challenges this account that the state debt is sustainable, by analysing the specific discursive construction of the public the BOJ and the MOF enforce to render the state debt as sustainable. The result of the research is that the BOJ and the MOF try to utilise the public through identity construction, but that this identity is incompatible in terms of spatial, temporal and ethical dimensions. This undermines the credibility of the financial institutions, pressuring the sustainability of the state debt and the success of Abenomics. This research analyses the state-specific condition that allow for state debt, and therefore forms a lesson in how to assess discourse by financial institutions that can be applied to case studies worldwide.","['Abenomics', 'BOJ', 'State debt', 'MOF']"
Le narrateur dans Madame Bovary: impersonnel et impassible ?,"Oosterwijk, Rogier","['Schulte-Nordholt, Annelies']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,fr,"In this thesis, I analyze the view that the narrator of Madame Bovary takes on the society of the (fictional) French provincial town of Yonville. Gustave Flaubert, the author of the novel, strongly insist in his famous Correspondence on the impersonality and the objectivity of the author. Being the emissary of the author, the narrator therefore also has the task to withhold himself from any subjective statements or emotions and so on. However, there are multiple indications (both resulting from the novel itself and from the remarks of scholars) that question the approach so called ‘impersonal’ of the narrator. Giving ironic descriptions of his characters, and sometimes mocking them overtly, he doesn’t always seem to live up to the position of an objective narrator. Apparently, there is a contrast between Flaubert’s aesthetics (as pronounced in his Correspondence), that state that the narrator has to stay impersonal and even impassive, and the actual approach of the narrator in Madame Bovary. The claim we have made is that the narrator is above all a person himself as well, who has his own feelings that he expresses accordingly.","['Madame Bovary', 'Narratologie', 'Objectivité', 'Flaubert', 'Yonville', 'Impersonnalité']"

The horizontal character of time in Heidegger and Husserl,"Voets, Nina","['Uljée, R. (Rozemund)']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,nl,"This thesis discusses the thinking on time by Husserl and Heidegger. Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit and Husserl’s Vorlesungen are the two main sources of study. Husserl’s primary purpose with Vorlesungen is to deliver a phenomenological analysis of the consciousness of time. The preliminary goal that Heidegger sets for himself in Sein und Zeit is to provide an interpretation of time as a possible horizon of Dasein. The main question of this thesis is: What role does the concept of ‘horizon’ play in Seit und Zeit by Heidegger and in Vorlesungen zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins by Husserl, and how do these concepts relate to one another? Over the past decades, a number of comparative studies on Husserl’s and Heidegger’s concepts of time have appeared, many of which argue that Husserl’s Vorlesungen strongly depend on a metaphysical thinking on time. Heidegger too is critical towards Husserl, directly or indirectly, due to the fact that to his judgement, Husserl reduces all experience to transcendental subjectivity, which results in everything being present to the subject. The purpose of this thesis, however, is to demonstrate that with Husserl as much as with Heidegger, we can speak of an ontology of time. This is clarified, amongst other things, using Husserl’s concept of ‘horizon’. The horizon concept that Husserl uses, appears to be merely empirical and ontic, as opposed to Heidegger’s existential-ontological horizon concept. Yet this thesis demonstrates that Husserl’s horizon does in fact have ontological attributes. To conclude so appears to be a small contribution to existing studies on Husserl and Heidegger, yet it certainly has consequences for an accurate interpretation and comparison of time concepts by Husserl and Heidegger. Even though the ontological character of time with Husserl is not thematic, it can certainly be found in Vorlesungen and therefore cannot be ignored. As a result, Husserl’s ideas can no longer be considered exclusively metaphysical.","['time', 'horizon', 'Heidegger', 'Husserl', 'phenomenology']"

When the massacre took place in 1988, international responses were limited, however, nowadays it seems to be receiving newfound attention within human rights fora such as the Human Rights Council. Central to this thesis is identifying how this newfound attention has come into existence. Firstly, it looks at whether it can indeed be established that the massacre is receiving more recognition now, than when it took place 30 years ago. Secondly, it conducts an analysis of the development of the 1988 movement, arguing that the movement was able to influence the recognition through years of professionalization and the exercise of their own agency. Thirdly, it looks at the close interdependence of Iranian activists in exile, and Iranian activists who remain inside Iran, attributing the movement’s impact to their close cooperation.","['Iran', 'massacre', 'activism']"

Reality Status in South American Indigenous Languages,"Groeneweg, Willem","['Crevels, Mily']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this typological survey, I study the distribution of irrealis markers in a sample of nine South American indigenous languages. I do this to assess the typological validity of Reality Status, a crosslinguistic grammatical category defined by Elliott (2000) about which there is much debate. This category assumes that a notional distinction of realized and unrealized events underlies the formal marking of the irrealis. Based on Elliott’s notional definition, and inspired by Michael (2014), I set out a group of irrealis parameters, grammatical categories which are expected to be marked for irrealis in a language which makes an RS distinction, and study which of these parameters are marked for the irrealis. I argue that assuming RS is often not adequate in explaining the distribution of irrealis markers and that this distribution should instead be explained by assuming a focal meaning of future prediction, which shows interaction with either degree of assertion or metaphorical inference from markers of deictic space. Together, these factors can account for the distribution of the irrealis markers in this sample.","['Reality Status', 'realis', 'irrealis', 'South American indigenous languages', 'linguistics', 'language typology', 'mood', 'modality']"
Spelfouten op Koreaanse webforums: Een fonologische verklaring,"Oechies, Lorenzo","['Wiedenhof, Jeroen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Korean internet discussions, especially those of teens, tend to be full of deliberate spelling errors. In this work, I tried to find out if there is any phonological way to clarify these alternative spellings by analysing a multitude of discussions on the Korean internet platform Naver Cafe. I collected spelling errors from these discussions and compared them to the official spelling of Korean. To ensure a consistent corpus of data, I only considered recent discussions about BTS, a Korean boy band that is popular among female Korean teens. All collected spelling errors could be divided into accidental spelling errors and deliberate spelling errors. Most of these deliberate spelling errors are based on the pronunciation rules of the Korean writing system, making the spellings stand closer to their actual pronunciations than their correct counterparts. A small proportion of all deliberate spelling errors is based on morphophonological rules that are usually only applied in the context of verbal morphology. All of this shows that Korean language users tend to be very creative while writing their language, usually for the sake of coming across cute or innocent. From this we can conclude that even spelling errors can be a fruitful source of information.","['Korean', 'orthography', 'phonology', 'Hangul', 'spelling']"

Jewish Responses to Shylock: A Yiddish Translation of Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice',"schouten, J.M.","['Fonte Rodrigues, Catarina', 'Rodrigues Fonte, Catarina']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis describes the development of Yiddish theatre which evolved in Eastern Europe and later moved to the United States of America as large groups of Eastern European Jews began to move to the United States in the 1880s and 1890s. American-Jewish authors and playwrights used the high status of Western canonical writers – mainly Shakespeare – in order to introduce their immigrant audiences to the new culture of their homeland. One of these playwrights was Joseph Bovshover, who published a translation of The Merchant of Venice in 1899. In it, he replaced many of the references to the classical mythology or to the Christian religion with Jewish concepts, in order to familiarise the readers with the play. He also applied a translation strategy of transference of references to Venetian culture in to create a sense of authenticity. In his translation he wrote a preface in which he described his appreciation of Shakespeare’s work and especially of Shylock as a tragic hero. This change of depiction was typical of Jewish adaptations of The Merchant of Venice, in which Shylock was consistently depicted as a tragic hero rather than a villain. Bovshover attempted to find a balance between presenting the audience with an authentic Shakespeare translation while at the same time allowing the audience to relate itself to the characters in the play. He did this by transferring the references to Venetian culture literally into Yiddish, while adapting most of the references to Christianity to the Jewish context from which the audience came.","['Shakespeare in Translation', 'Yiddish theatre', 'Translation Studies', 'Jews in America', 'Immigrant Theatre']"
Terugverwijzingen en nieuwe stappen in Griekse wiskundige bewijzen,"Jong, Cecile de","['Rademaker, Adriaan M.', 'Berkel, Tazuko A. van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Both δέδεικται and ἐδείχθη are used by Greek mathematical authors in their proofs to refer to something that has already been proved. In this master’s thesis, the use of the passive aorist and the middle perfect in ancient Greek mathematical texts is discussed. The modern interpretations of the verbal aspects in (literary) Greek by Rijksbaron, Sicking and Stork serve as a theoretical framework. I intend to demonstrate that mathematical Greek, despite its dense, formulaic language, does follow the rules of Greek grammar that hold for conventional language use. This research focusses on metacommunicative verbs, that refer to the procedure of a proof, as opposed to verbs that are used in the construction of a diagram. The indicative forms and participles of a selection of verbs (δείκνυμι, ἐπιτάσσω, προτίθημι, εὑρίσκω, λέγω and δίδωμι) were analyzed in a confined corpus including works of Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius. The aim was to explain the distribution of the aorist and perfect forms. This analysis led to the conclusion that the aorist emphasizes the performed action and marks a new step in a proof. The perfect, on the other hand, stresses the attained result of an action and is therefore used to refer to a finished proof or a completed construction of figures. In the conclusion, a hypothesis will be offered on the interpretation of the perfect imperative, a heavily debated phenomenon that is frequently encountered in Greek mathematics.","['Grieks', 'wiskunde', 'perfectum', 'aoristus', 'Euclides', 'Archimedes', 'Apollonius', 'Greek', 'mathematics', 'Euclid', 'aorist', 'perfect']"
FILLED PAUSES IN FIRST AND SECOND LANGUAGE USERS: HOW SPEAKER-SPECIFIC IS U(H)M ACROSS LANGUAGES?,"Sleebos, Y.M.A.","['Heeren, W.F.L.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis has two aims: (1) find a speaker-specific feature or combination of features of filled pauses that is the same for speakers’ first and second languages and (2) test the robustness of this feature or combination of features over time. Some studies have shown language-specific characteristics of filled pauses, while other studies have shown that these characteristics are carried over from the first language to the second. Research has focused on the similarities and differences of the filled pause type (uh and um) and the duration of filled pauses between two languages. It has focused on the phonetic content of filled pauses within a language but has not compared the phonetic content between languages. Therefore, this thesis researched the distribution (number of filled pauses) and phonetic features (the total duration of the filled pause, the vowel duration, the nasal duration, the mean F0, the mean and SD of F1, F2 and F3, the static midpoint of F1, F2 and F3 and the dynamic trajectories of F1, F2 and F3). ANOVAs were conducted to test for significant effects of both language and speaker and interactions between language or speaker and filled pause type. ANOVAs revealing low language-specificity and high speaker-specificity were pursued in order to find the optimal language-independent speaker-specific feature. Linear discriminant analyses were conducted to determine which individual feature and combinations of features could best classify the speakers. Almost all features showed some speaker-specificity, but the mean F0 returned the highest classification rate. The ideal feature combination was mean F0, vowel duration, nasal duration, the mean and SD of F1, F2 and F3. Linear discriminant analyses conducted using only information from one language returned high classification rates. More importantly, linear discriminant analyses done across two languages returned moderate to high classification rates. In addition, a linear discriminant analysis conducted with features taken from the first recording session to classify features from the recording session three years later revealed moderate classification rates. These results mean that (1) filled pauses contain language-independent speaker-specific information and (2) these speaker-specific features remain robust and consistent over time. In addition to other factors, these features in filled pauses can be used effectively in forensic speaker comparisons.","['Forensic Phonetics', 'Filled pauses', 'Speaker-specificity', 'Second language users', 'Forensic Speaker Comparison']"
An Acoustic Comparison of Taiwan Mandarin and Singapore Mandarin,"Lowe, Nicholas","['Sybesma, R.P.E.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis compares similar phonological features across Táiwān Mandarin and Singapore Mandarin by measuring the acoustic properties of the variables in question. Despite both varieties’ official claim of being identical to Běijīng Mandarin, they have developed a significant number of differences in parallel. I hypothesize that this is because both of these varieties grew out of having Mandarin imposed upon populations that were originally and largely Southern Mǐn speaking. To test this, I modified the Labovian sociolinguistic interview for an online survey format for easy distribution. I focused largely on four variables, the first three of which are theoretically available in both of the varieties of Mandarin under investigation: 1) dentalization of the retroflex sibilants, 2) dentalization of the velar nasal codas following mid to high front vowels, and 3) unrounding of the rounded high front vowel. The final variable under investigation was a possible fifth tone only available in Singapore Mandarin. Despite whatever ease this afforded in data collection, the online survey format also created a lot of disparity between recordings that could have been avoided by using a laboratory setting, or even just consistent recording equipment. Keeping this defect in mind, I found both the behaviours predicted in prior literature, but also its exact opposite, leading me to believe that an online survey format will need a lot of honing before it can reliably be applied to research based on measuring acoustics.","['Linguistics', 'Mandarin', 'Chinese', 'Taiwan', 'Singapore', 'phonology', 'phonetics']"
The Expression of Linguistic Stereotypes on Gender: A Comparison Between the Japanese Animated Movie “Kimi no Na Wa” (君の名は) and the English Dubbed-Translated Movie “Your Name”,"Weit, Dinette van der","['Dorst, Lettie']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This dissertation investigated the occurrence of linguistic stereotypes regarding gender in the Japanese animated movie Kimi no Na Wa (君の名は) compared to the English dubbed-translated movie Your Name. The Japanese audio script functioned as the source text (ST) and the script of the English dub as the target text (TT). Based on previous research of Spiridon (2014), Okamoto (1995), and Lakoff (1973; 2004), stereotypically gendered language was listed for both the ST and the TT. This study researched whether the TT favoured transferring Japanese gender markers (foreignization), conforming to English gender stereotypes (domestication), or omitting ST gender markers (neutralization) as a translation strategy. Based on results from earlier studies (Inoue (2003), González Vera (2012), De Marco (2006), Pettit (2005)) and considering the role of dubbing constraints, it was hypothesized that neutralization would be the favoured option in Your Name and that few new gender markers would be introduced in the TT. The data analysis consisted of an ST analysis to determine the gender markers in the ST, a TT analysis to determine which translation strategies were applied in the rendering of the ST markers, and a TT analysis to determine whether any new gender markers had been introduced in the TT. The translation procedures of Vinay & Darbelnet (1995) were used to establish how the gendered items had been rendered in the TT. The results suggest that the hypothesis is confirmed, since only 32 out of 386 gender markers were rendered in the TT and 197 were newly introduced, which shows that neutralization was indeed the favoured translation type in the TT. Thereby, sentence-final particles were mostly represented in the ST versus hedging language in the TT. Some possibilities for future research include replicating this study for the subtitled script and investigating the characters’ pitch.","['Audiovisual Translation', 'gender', 'stereotypes', 'dubbing', 'animated movies']"

In an attempt to highlight the complex nexus between visual culture and politics, this thesis examines this intersection between culture and politics using the American political climate as a case study of a larger global political trend of democracy fatigue, post-truth politics, and populist discourses. This thesis sheds light on the hopeful and critical postmodern dramatic storytelling that illustrates the importance of critical drama within a contemporary post-truth American socio-political sphere. As there has been a longstanding academic focus on the authoritative accounts in cinema and television, particularly in a post 9/11 context, this study embraces a discourse analysis that is concerned with how such accounts are ‘contested’. Drawing on a postmodern theoretical framework and HBO’s The Night Of, this thesis offers a fresh analysis of post-truth politics and the ability of visual culture to present and highlight a disillusionment with political currents.","['Post-Truth Politics', 'Visual Culture', 'Populism', 'Dystopia', 'Neo-noir', 'Television', 'Islamophobia', 'US', 'Postmodernity', 'Postmodern Uncertainty', 'Terrorism', 'National Security.']"
Tribalism and Statehood: the Kurdish Question,"Hengst, Jan","['Schonmann, Noa']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Kurdish question of statehood has been relevant for centuries, and the debate has especially flared up in light of the Kurdish assistance against ISIS, and the 2017 referendum for a Kurdish state. Up to this day, and for over a century, the Kurdish tribes have struggled to find a structure of self-governance in the form of an autonomous state. Despite having been a culture present in the Middle East in history and tradition from before the arrival of both the Turks and the Arabs, they seem to have been left out when cultures such as the two latter transformed their respective social structures to statehood. During the creation of many Middle Eastern states, and afterwards during the period in which these consolidated their domestic structures, the Kurdish tribes were involuntarily assimilated into a number of “new” states after the fall of the Ottoman empire. Once in submission of their new boundaries, the Kurdish peoples had to accept a variety of foreign realities concerning their own political, economic, and social beliefs. This thesis concerns itself with the relationship between Tribalism and Democracy, and how 'the tribe' as both a social structure and a signifier of identity can be both a stimulant and an impediment to nationalism.","['Kurds', 'Nationalism', 'State', 'Identity', 'Tribalism', 'Tribe']"
New Media Art and Embodiment: Encountering Artificial Intelligence,"Panagidou, Semeli","['Zwijnenberg, R.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the role and influence of artificial intelligence in our contemporary society through the inter-subjective and embodied experience of new media art. By exploring the intersecting lines between art, technology, cognition and society, it discusses the potential in artistic practices involving intelligent technologies, to reframe the way in which we engage with Artificial Intelligence. This research benefits from an interdisciplinary approach that reaches through and beyond the field of contemporary art to challenge the mainstream discussion on the future of A.I. and the ethics of its applications. In order to do so, this thesis begins by establishing an understanding of embodiment in light of postcognitive approaches that move away from the dualism of mind and matter and negate representationalist paradigms of perception. This forms the basis from which to explore the particular subjectivities and material encounters in the practice and experience of new media art that engages with intelligent technologies. This thesis uses specific case studies involving creative applications of A.I. in contemporary art to reveal our interaction and co-existence with intelligent technologies as intricate and uniquely entangled. With the support of scientific, philosophical and aesthetic theories, it ultimately argues that such applications of A.I. in artistic practice provide a unique perspective for a transformative encounter with regards to the self, to our performed reality and to our becoming in a posthumanist environment.","['artificial intelligence', 'embodiment', 'new media', 'posthumanism', 'hybrid art']"
A comparative study: transitional justice and education in Rwanda and Cambodia,"Khairy, Asmaa","['Regilme, Salvador']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Transitional justice plays a central role in helping nations move forward in post-conflict periods in which nations have suffered from mass violence and other atrocities. Moreover, educating youth on the past is necessary in order to work towards reconciliation and preventing the reoccurrence of atrocities. By presenting a comparative study of two countries that have gone through the same type of horrific violence, this thesis will examine the transitional justice approaches adopted in the field of education Cambodia and Rwanda, whereby it will conclude which one has promoted the most effective way of dealing with the past. According to International Centre for Transitional Justice (2018), the aims of transitional justice is ‘the recognition of the dignity of individuals, the redress and acknowledgment of violations and the aim to prevent them happening again.’ Thus, I argue that education plays a crucial role in transitional justice, and is not only important in teaching youth about a country’s history, but schools also help shape politics and create intergroup relations. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the research on the relationship between transitional justice and education. By presenting two case studies, I will analyse which one of the two approaches in education has proven more successful as a mechanism of transitional justice. Lastly, I will conclude with a summary of the findings and give further recommendations.","['Comparative study', 'Education', 'Rwanda', 'Cambodia', 'Transitional Justice']"

This thesis aims to answer: To what extend did Catalan and Tibetan activists deploy the window of opportunity created by the Torch Relays preceding the Olympic Games to empower their nonviolent resistance campaigns? In this thesis two case studies are discussed: the nonviolent resistance campaign of Catalans during the 1992 Barcelona Olympics on the one hand and the actions of pro-Tibet activists surrounding the Beijing Olympics of 2008 on the other. In both cases, the Torch Relays will be taken as focal point, because it turned out that the ""game"" between activists and authorities was played during the Torch Relay preceding the opening of the real Games. By focussing on the perspective and agency of the activists, this research takes a bottom-up approach. In short, this thesis argues that the Olympics Torch Relay can function as this temporarily window of political opportunity, which activists can deploy to empower their nonviolent resistance campaigns.","['nonviolent resistance', 'Beijing Olympics', 'Barcelona Olympics', 'Olympic Games', 'Olympic Torch Relay', 'Sidney Tarrow', 'Social Movements', 'Sport Mega-Events', 'Bottom-up approach', 'Catalan', 'Tibet', 'activism', 'Window of political Opportunity']"
"Learning environments, learning strategies and finding regularities in second language inflectional morphology","Veldhuizen, Claire","['Grijzenhout, Janet']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study aims to gain an insight into the similarities and differences in the acquisition of foreign language morphology in secondary school learners with different native languages. To this aim, the linguistic behavior of English and Dutch students was examined in the context of the overgeneralization phenomenon and the dual-mechanism theory. The groups were asked to conjugate both existing and non-existing nouns and verbs in one or two of their foreign languages. The results show that overgeneralization plays a major role in the foreign language acquisition of both groups, particularly in irregular conjugation. However, with more target language experience, these errors dissipated, confirming a prediction based on the dual-mechanism theory. Moreover, the results show that the language learning environment had a major influence on the students’ perception of foreign language learning strategies, which in turn affected their language use and behavior. The responses of the English students, who learned Dutch in a predominantly naturalistic learning environment, demonstrated spontaneous and intuitive language use. This contrasts with the responses of the Dutch students, who learned English in an institutional environment and showed forced, rule-based language use. These results are supported by findings in German, in which the Dutch students showed similar language behavior to English, despite the close genetic relationship between German and Dutch.","['L2 acquisition', 'WUG-test', 'Learning environments', 'Learning strategies', 'Inflectional morphology']"

Great Expectations: Transparency of the European Commission,"Verhoek, Beaudine","['David, Maxine']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Today, there is broad consensus that the European Commission of the European Union needs transparency in order to function as a representative democracy. The transparency development within the Commission shows an interesting pattern, especially after Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker came into office in 2014. The current transparency debate revolves around the question to what extent the Commission has overcome opacity under the leadership of President Juncker halfway through its mandate. Advocates of transparency argue in favor of a relative increase of Commission transparency by democratic standards compared to other public institutions. A more critical account detects a more ‘captured transparency’, highlighting the loopholes and obstacles for the Commission to overcome in order to become an effective representative democracy. This work provides a detailed and multi-disciplinary examination of the questions how transparency has progressed within the Commission. An examination of the transparency developments will be made of the Commission’s Directorate General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets (DG FISMA), because this department has the highest number of meetings with interest representatives and stakeholders on policy-making. The analysis that follows will establish a comprehensive framework of the relationship between the implementation of transparency measures in the Directorate General and its interpretation. Therefore, this work provides for an institutional analysis of policy change. The paper concludes that the current Commission transparency policies in place have several flaws and that it leaves room for improvement to strengthen democratic legitimacy. However, the study also shows that when change is brought about in a broad and practical form it can - on the long-term - fulfil the democratic transparency promise of President Juncker. The recommendations resulting from this research may serve as a basis for the future development of transparency measures in the area of European studies.","['European Commission', 'Transparency', 'Juncker', 'Democratic Deficit']"

In search for justice. Legal and judicial inequality in eighteenth-century Suriname.,"Canfijn, Imran","['Fatah-Black, Karwan']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Eighteenth-century colonial Suriname has been a plural society, divided by people’s race, status, religion and socioeconomic class. Similar to almost every other early modern state, Suriname did not know any uniformly codified legal systems nor a constitution that enshrined the rights of its inhabitants. To the contrary, legislation was fragmented, hybrid and often arose impromptu. In addition, Suriname did not know any comprehensive criminal laws or procedure either. This thesis argues that, largely due to these legal lacunae, the colonial authorities could unabashedly treat different population groups on unequal legal and judicial footing. However, this thesis also stresses that several previously accepted assumptions with regard to colonial justice must be nuanced. It concludes that, despite the disparate and biased forms of treatment, colonial justice has been considerably more thorough than deemed before, even with regard to minority groups such as the enslaved and manumitted. There have been no signs that the Surinamese courts functioned as kangaroo courts; all suspects were offered a trial. In addition, verdicts of convicts did not come about arbitrarily but were rather based on jurisprudence. The authorities took into consideration the conclusiveness of the evidence and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances as well. As a result, punishments were much more varied than the merely horrendous corporal and capital punishments that have dominated historiography hitherto. Moreover, from the second half of the eighteenth century, several minority litigants started to search for justice on their own behalf. In the end, the colonial authorities did certainly not always adopt a one-dimensional stance in favour of white colonists at the expense of other population groups.","['Legal history', 'Colonial justice', 'Criminal law and procedure', 'Suriname', 'Atlantic slavery', 'Manumission', 'Social stratification', 'Discrimination of status', 'Racial discrimination']"

The Whigs drew a fiercely demarcated confessional split between Protestant and Catholic states, informed by a broad sympathy for different denominations of Protestantism, and a deep distrust of Catholicism. Toryism, conversely, was rooted in a suspicion of any Christian belief other than Anglicanism. Consequently, the Tory confessional map of Europe was more nuanced and suspicious of continental engagement. These divisions became more topical as the War of the Spanish Succession intensified, and polemics became increasingly accusatory and conspiratorial. These conspiracies derived from the two parties’ own understandings of Europe, and their unwillingness to comprehend the opposite idea. Whig pamphlets presented Tory peace efforts as an attempt to undermine the Protestant Succession, by strengthening France and the Pretender. Calls for peace were seen as a pretence for a cull against international Protestantism. Tory pamphlets, contrastingly, could not understand the Whig sympathy for international Protestantism. Consequently, they argued that such discourses were a front for the imposition of radical Whig government. The war necessitated higher taxes, bringing in a stronger military, which could impose its will on the Queen and country. Further, the influx of dissenting Protestant refugees into the country could only mean a strengthening of the Whig vote. The rising conspiratorial climate drew reactions in calls for unity. These calls for unity were party political, in spite of authorial attempts at appearing impartial. The two unity discourses that arose understood their idea of unity through their party political understandings of Europe. The Whig call for unity was based on rationalism; later Whig texts drew cynical critiques of the political process into a broader understanding of governance, which meant moving away from the superstitions of the Tories and an acceptance of Whig government. The Tory bid for unity contrastingly derived from its pre-Revolutionary ideas of a nation united under a monarch, which was wedded to a national church. Attempts to impose any other form of unity, under any person other than the monarch, was a factional way of distracting the nation from its purpose. This thesis therefore demonstrates the importance of competing ideas of Europe in the dynamics of the Rage of Party. As well as this, it provides two relative novelties: it reconstructs the Tory ‘idea of Europe’ in 1707-1713, which has been traditionally neglected in the historiography. It also highlights the importance of both parties’ ideas of Europe in their calls for unity. In so doing, this thesis provides new insights into the history of the latter part of Queen Anne’s reign, particularly relating to how the two parties were animated in their competition for power.","['Europe', 'Whig', 'Tory']"

Examining the Effects of Accent and Speech Rate on Judgments of Speaker Credibility","Bernstein, Emily","['Heeren, Willemijn']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Previous studies have found that non-standard language varieties are at risk of discrimination in legal contexts. Additionally, slow speech has been shown to be less credible than normal speech. However, little is known about how accent and speech rate interact. In order to investigate this phenomenon further, this thesis examines how Dutch listeners judge utterances on a seven-point scale when presented with auditory stimuli in two accents of Dutch (Standard Dutch and Moroccan Dutch) and two speech rates (normal and slow). Contrary to previous studies indicating that non-standard language is perceived as less credible, the results of this study revealed that listeners generally perceive both accents as equally credible at a normal speed. Slower speech was judged as less credible in both varieties, but Standard Dutch was given lower ratings overall. The results suggest that what has previously been established for slow speech in languages such as English also holds true for Dutch, and may have adverse consequences for individuals in contact with the law.","['non-standard language', 'discrimination', 'Dutch', 'credibility', 'speech rate']"
India and the Belt and Road Initiative,"Trembeczki, Zsolt","['Black, Lindsay O.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"While its economy desperately needs investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, India not only refuses to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s massive regional interconnectivity project, but claims that it violates its sovereignty and serves only China’s power ambitions. Some Indian analysts even argue that by establishing naval facilities in the Indian Ocean and strengthening land connection between China and Pakistan, the BRI is part of China’s encirclement strategy against India. Others downplay such arguments as products of unfounded distrust. Following a structural realist approach to evaluate the BRI’s implications for the economic, military, and geopolitical balance of power between China and India, this thesis presents a more complex picture. It makes the case that the BRI indeed alters the relative distribution of power to China’s advantage, but both alarmist warnings about encirclement and optimistic hopes about the potential economic benefits are exaggerated or require stronger evidence.","['India', 'China', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'BRI', 'OBOR']"

Democratic Confederalism; A Kurdish Solution for Liberation after Decades of Struggle?,"Cleyndert, Emilie","['Yildirim, Mehmet']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“Although, according to the founders of the Republic of Turkey, a Turkish ethnic nationalist ideology had to become the fabric of society, the irony is that this ideology is at the same time the main source of political conflict and violence” (Jongerden 2001, 81). The establishment of the Turkish Republic under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, consolidating Turkish Nationalism as State Ideology, was the beginning of a history full of paradoxes and contradictions. Especially the Turkish central government and the Kurdish community entered a century of ups and downs what would become known as the ‘Kurdish Question’. While the Turkish Nationalists have remained constant in their ideology, the Kurds have witnessed a turbulent ideological development throughout history, which has both divided as unified the Kurdish community on different occasions. Although the dream of an independent Kurdistan has always been in the background, the Kurdish community has not always been able to pursue this dream, or been willing to. In the more modern days, however, when the Kurds in Turkey became more active again in their struggle for independence, the PKK gained prominence among the Kurds, with Abdullah Ocalan as its leader. Thereupon, since the late 1990s, Ocalan would become to represent the PKK, whereas the PKK in its turn would represent the entire Kurdish Nation (Bozarslan 2008, 351). Thus, when Abdullah Ocalan came up with the ideology of democratic confederalism, the Kurdish community followed. How did Ocalan, however, after all these years, come up with this ideology one may wonder, and how does this democratic confederalism apply to the ‘Kurdish Question’? In order to be able to research this complicated issue in the most effective ways, the theoretical framework of the issue must be determined and defined correctly, prior to the actual analysis of the case. This means that in order to fully comprehend concepts such as the ‘Nation-State’, it must be established what the concepts of the ‘Nation’ and the ‘State’ individually withhold, after which, the concept of the ‘Nation-State’ can be explained and analyzed in the light of the Kurdish Question. Furthermore, to properly grasp these conceptions, we must understand their foundations. Therefore, by means of chronological order, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Ernest Renan, and Max Weber will be examined, to lay down the basic rationale behind ‘State formation’, ‘the Nation’ and the ‘State’. In addition, the contexts of ‘Nationalism’ and the Right to Self-Determination will be assessed. Based on this theoretical framework the ideological development of the Kurds in Turkey will be decomposed and analyzed to investigate how the direct secessionist Kurdish ambitions for an independent Nation-State evolved into an ideology of Democratic Confederalism.","['Turkey', 'Kurds', 'PKK', 'Democratic Confederalism', 'Nation', 'Nation State', 'State Formation', 'Abdullah Ocalan']"

Additionally, it is necessary to understand the norms being used by non-native speakers and how the differences may affect communication. This research focuses on how requests were produced by native and non-native English speakers. In specific, it analyzed both which strategies were utilized in forming requests as well as how many were used. The data for this research was collected using in an open role-play involving 38 female participants who had various grammatical competence and were of four different nationalities. The participants’ request strategies were analyzed relative to both their grammatical competence and nationality. The first set of analyses found neither grammatical competence or nationality to a reliable predictor for which request strategies were used. A second set of analyses indicated that nation might be a predictor of a speaker’s use of modal modification to a head act.","['second language acquisition', 'request strategies', 'pragmatics', 'second language pragmatics', 'English as linguage franca']"

Religious Conflict and Resolution in the Pluralistic Communities of Nigeria's Middle Belt,"Os, Mirte van","['Rodriguez, Nicolas Idarraga']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Although Nigeria is becoming an important economic and political actor in the world, it is facing many security challenges. In the Middle Belt region of the country where the Christian South and the Muslim North meet, exists a high level of intercommunal religious violence. While first establishing the developments that have led to this violence, this thesis looks to answer the following question: Why are some pluralistic communities in this region more prone to intercommunal religious violence than others? It does so by comparing local political systems in several LGAs (Local Government Areas) with similar ethnic-religious make-up. What has been found is that in those LGAs where a mechanism of informal local power sharing had emerged, very little to no violence took place, whereas in those LGAs where one group was in power, tensions easily turned violent. The final chapter explores what use these findings might have for conflict resolution programs in Nigeria, and Africa as a whole. Another result of the analysis is that the Nigerian situation represents the same causes as religious tensions in Europe, where the influx of Muslim migrants causes tensions. I suggest that there might be more lessons learned from Nigeria’s situation, than most people think.","['Religious Conflict', 'Nigeria', 'Islam', 'Christianity', 'Pluralistic Communities', 'Conflict Resolution']"

Displaying History in (post)colonial Britain,"Volkers, Iris","['Fatah-Black, Karwan']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"ABSTRACT This thesis looks at British memory culture in (post)colonial times from the turn of the twenty-first century onwards. Up until that point the academic field was introduced to the development of new studies such as (post)colonial studies, subaltern studies and museum studies. Theories and critiques on memory culture developed as well and, on their part, were met with interest as well as critique. Not only did these critiques address the incompleteness of these memories, but also the celebratory qualities of these nationalistic memories. Reconsiderations did not only come from scholars, but also from subaltern communities and migrant minorities. Besides that, this time was marked by increasing protests against selective narratives, the heritage of Empire and the one-sided colonialist displays in museums. Protesters and critical scholars were looking for the representation of the subaltern stories of imperial times. They believe that their role in this history as well as in the (post)colonial present of today, is not addressed as it should be. Britain was one of the biggest colonising countries in the history and had an enormous Empire that covered almost a quarter of the global landmass and a little shy of a quarter of the world population on its absolute high-point. The influence Britain had on the world, as well as the other way round, as one can imagine, has been significant. Many British people refer to these facts with pride. Their culture and patriotic believes both rely heavily on the glorious past. Few people seem to think of slavery and discrimination when the British Empire is mentioned. In the case of the United Kingdom, it is especially interesting to compare and contrast different examples of museums and their endeavours to cope with (post)colonial realities of Britain’s imperial past and (post)colonial present. In a country with a profound love for their British heritage, a very traditional culture and a perpetuity of Empire in its current Commonwealth structure, the people and the institutions seem to struggle to ‘come to terms with’ the entire history of its imperial past and to acknowledge the existence of colonialism in today’s present. The museums that serve as exemplary cases for this research are the British Museum (London), the Pitt Rivers Museum (Oxford), and the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum (Bristol). These museums differ from each other in respect to their outreach, their environment and their status. Each of these museums, however, have been confronted with the challenge to adapt to contemporary composition of the British society and the changing social and political climate. In the end, this thesis will show that the attention for decolonisation has affected the museum sector in Britain. Museums are no longer self-evident and sacrosanct institutions . Some of them tend to bend towards finding solutions to fit in, and possibly survive, within the changing social and political climate. But, execution of the proposed measures and the willingness to make profound changes to their traditional institutions remain minor and moves towards a ‘new’ history pattern seem to hold off.",['Museums in (post)colonial Britain']

The Obama's administration democracy promotion response to the Egyptian Uprising,"Iudica, Federica","['Thakur, Vineet']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims at assessing the US rhetorical response in terms of democracy promotion to the events of the Arab Uprising, with a particular focus on the political transitions started in Egypt after 2011. Given the long history the mutual interests between the US and Egypt, the study conducts a throughout discourse analysis on the US statements and speeches delivered in the period 2011-2014, using the method of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). The analysis identifies three major narratives displayed by the US narrative, namely democracy promotion, regional stability/US-Egypt partnership and security interests, in order to understand how the discourses came together in the US rhetoric. More specifically, the thesis contends that, after an initial cautious support for the Egyptian democratization, the Obama administration increased the narrative on democracy promotion in 2011 and 2012, while associating it to the regional stability discourse. However, after the initial democracy euphoria displayed in the first two years after the revolution, the exam of the documents seems to reveal a notable prioritization of the security narrative in 2013 and 2014, especially with reference to counterterrorism practices and regional security. Finally, the thesis underlines the presence of a tension between the democracy promotion and the fostering of security objectives which worsened after the ouster of Morsi in July 2013.","['democracy promotion', 'Arab Uprising', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'International relations', 'Discourse analysis']"

In a world where countries compete with one another, where having a good image internationally is seen as an important element, nation branding can serve as a good strategy. However, over the last decade, the concept of ‘nation branding’ has been emerging rapidly and at the same time, it has also faced criticism among scholars. Nation branding is a strategy that governments take in order to create and improve the image of their nation in the eyes of the world. Therefore, when the government of Kosovo launched the nation branding campaign ‘Kosovo – The Young Europeans’ the purpose was to represent the youth of Kosovo and positively brand the image of the country. The campaign in itself brought mix feelings and different views among people. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to find out what is the impression of Kosovars regarding this initiative. What are their thoughts about the campaign? Did it have an impact? Nine interviews have been conducted for the purpose of this research. Whether the campaign had an impact, whether it brought something new or whether it was worth the money, these are some of the questions that were asked to the respondents.","['Kosovo', 'The Young Europeans', 'Nation Branding', 'Nation Brand', 'Nation Image', 'Branding Strategy']"

THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN DUTCH COUNTER-TERRORISM POLICY,"Wal, Lydia van der","['Duijvesteijn, I.G.B.M.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Recent insights have revealed that engagement with civil society can reinforce the effectiveness of counter-terrorism efforts. This study investigated when and to what extend the Dutch security and intelligence services (Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (AIVD)) started to recognise the importance of civil society based on their annual reports since the attacks of 9/11 (2001-2017). A documentary analysis of sixteen annual reports and additional documents, was used to measure the development in the extent to which civil society has played a role in countering radicalisation and terrorism in the Netherlands. Based on the reports published online by the Dutch secret and intelligence services since 9/11, this thesis found that there is surprisingly limited attention and interest for civil society. This study contributes to the existing discourse on engagement of civil society and counter-terrorism efforts, by performing an empirical study of annual reports published by the Internal Security and Intelligence Services in the case of the Netherlands. In addition, the issue investigated in this study provides insight into a real potential for improving our understanding of democratic counter-terrorism.","['Civil society', 'Counter-terrorism', 'Security and Intelligence Services', 'The Netherlands', 'Radicalisation', 'Soft power approach']"
Uploading policies to the EU level - Estonia’s opportunities on the issue of cryptocurrencies.,"Krijnen, Lydia","['Scepanovic, Vera']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis is aimed at linking the regulatory discussion about cryptocurrencies with the larger theoretical debate on whether small Member States are able to influence the direction of European Union [EU] policy making. Research was done in the form of a casestudy on Estonia. The following research question was set: To what extent can Estonia upload domestic policy regarding cryptocurrencies to the EU level? It was found that Estonia’s ability to upload its domestic policy regarding cryptocurrencies to the EU level is now restricted, not because of a lack of capabilities to use available strategies, but mainly because of the lack of clear domestic policy, which at the same time also should not conflict with existing EU regulation. Still, Estonia could be perceived as a leader in the regulatory competition as it is already concerned with reinvention of the innovation of cryptocurrencies: estcoin. Estonia could improve its chances by specifying its plans for reinvention, by focusing on what the common interests would be and by implementing them at the national level first. Another improvement would be to look for regional coordination or strategic partnerships, which would become easier when the plans for estcoin are more defined.","['Cryptocurrencies', 'Europeanization', 'Policy-making process', 'European Union', 'Estonia', 'Uploading']"
"Minds, Materialism and Mental Representation","Hegarty, Michael","['Gijsbers, Victor']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This essay argues that naturalism about mental representations is a failure: the matrix of explanatory requirements, ontological commitments and intuitions in naturalist accounts fails to result in a self-consistent notion of representation. Mental representations are posited to explain an intentional agent’s behaviour and this explanatory role depends crucially on what the representation is about. Therefore it is necessary that representations have determinate content in virtue of which they cause behaviour. Naturalist accounts try to combine these explanatory requirements with a physicalist ontology in which intentional properties must be reduced to, or be supervenient on, the physical. Moreover, it is often demanded that two intuitions are respected: that representations are interpreted, and that there is a strong dividing line between mental and non-mental which should be recoverable from an account of mental representation. I argue that no consistent notion of representation can balance all these demands. The most labile commitments are the pre-theoretical intuitions, so I suggest either we radically alter these in light of theoretical results to persevere with a physicalist ontology, or we keep them and accept that physicalism cannot do them justice. Finally, I present a reason for choosing the latter position. I argue that the leading naturalist accounts still fail to yield determinate content in virtue of which representations are used to cause behaviour (i.e., they fail William Ramsey’s job description challenge (JDC)). I suggest one plausible solution to this (‘Representation as’), but which would be unacceptable to a naturalist. If there are no other options for naturalist accounts to secure the required determinate content other than ‘Representation as’ it follows that no naturalist account can pass the JDC. I suggest this results from the naturalist starting point that representations are subpersonal entities: only entities at the personal level are equipped to pass the JDC as Ramsey lays it out. Therefore, true representations are only at the personal level. Subpersonal posits in explanations of cognition may have explanatory value, but there is little relevant similarity between them and non-mental representations so as to validate thinking of them as representational as such.",

Developing a Sustainable Union: Identifying the correlation between renewable sources of electricity and European integration,"Soppe, Kjeld","['Gerrits, A.W.M.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The primary goal of this article is to identify the correlation between European integration and the transition to renewable sources of electricity. Several factors, such as environmental concerns and depleting deposits of fossil-fuels, have made the European Union and its member-states decide that in order to secure accessible, cheap and stable electricity, new sources of energy are required. The premise of this article is that past and contemporary European integration in energy policies is built upon energy security in correlation with the specific characteristics of fossil-fuels. The result is a unique combination of international cooperation and national sovereignty which needs to be identified and understood. Therefore, this article will first of all identify past European energy policies based on fossil-fuels. These are the founding documents of the European Coal and Steel Community and the European response to the 1973 oil crisis. These events will be followed by an analysis of EU-wide energy policies in recent year. In the following chapter, several forms of energy which can act as a substitute to fossil-fuels in the EU will be analysed, to precisely define what their specific characteristics are and how they can potentially be used to reduce dependency on fossil-fuels. When this is done, the three case-studies of the Netherlands, Sweden and Bulgaria will serve as a description of how states are currently approaching the transition to renewable sources of electricity, and what kind of problems and limitations they identify. The decision has been made to identify three individual states instead of the EU as a whole because of the fact that each state is in a unique position and is therefore deserving of an individual analysis. This study is relevant because in contemporary academic literature, the topics of European integration in energy policies and renewable energy is often overlooked. Most experts either focus on identifying European policies or the technical aspects of renewable energy, but they are seldom combined. This is problematic because it is almost certain that an increased reliance on renewable energy will have profound effects on societies in EU-member states and on the way the EU is integrated regarding energy policies. The question is therefore not if there is a connection between European integration and renewable sources of electricity, but how the transition to renewable sources in electricity generation influences European Integration within the field of energy cooperation. This article is meant to form as a basis for further research in the connection between the transition to renewable sources of energy and European integration and will therefore be a combination of a description and an analysis.","['European', 'Integration', 'Renewable', 'Energy', 'Electricity', 'Netherlands', 'Sweden', 'Bulgaria']"

The two countries are not allied. They belong to different international blocs and diverge on a number foreign policy issues. They have different preferences and goals. Yet, their relations have been connoted by consistent mutual empathy. The fact that Italy is a “Western” country – being one of the founders of United Europe and a member of NATO – has never jeopardised its relations with Tehran, even when an anti-Western attitude was strategically preferred by Iran for both domestic and international purposes. Not even Khomeini’s revolution and the international sanctions did completely stop their relations, and Italy has long been Iran’s main trading partner.We can say that two thousand years of history and cultural traditions make the two countries closer than it may superficially appear and are the basis for a deep political discourse. In my analysis I will examine how the two countries have managed to safeguard their respective interests within a reciprocal relationship that has remained constant despite the arising of internal ideologically antithetical situations, e.g. in Italy the opposition between DC and PCI1 during the cold war, and in Iran the transition from the Pahlavi regime to Khomeini’s theocracy. The interests, the will to keep commercial and business channels in general open have been the winning cards that can make us say today that the ‘special liaison’ exists, is factual and can be fully analysed in the IR field.","['Iran-Italy', 'Special Liaison', 'economic culutre and political Relations']"

Worryingly, the last time the world’s scientific community deemed a nuclear apocalypse this close was in 1953, after the USA had announced they would “pursue the hydrogen bomb” (Bulletin). In the same period, in response to the widespread anxieties caused by the increasing nuclear threat, science fiction stories abounded that explored various post-nuclear apocalyptic scenarios. Two of the most lastingly influential novels in this genre are John Wyndham’s The Day of the Triffids (hereafter, Triffids) (1951) and Richard Matheson’s I am legend (1954). Both texts explore the apocalypse as a phenomenon wherein the civilizations of man inevitably rise and fall. In both narratives the characters experience an apocalypse that is caused by humanity and the protagonists have to learn to live in a post apocalyptic world. The narratives explore the nature of science, technology and the identity of man within a pattern of creation and destruction. This thesis explores the apocalypse as a cyclical phenomenon in which the apocalypse is both the end and the beginning of civilization.",['Apocalypse']

Miscalculations of Saudi Arabian Foreign Policy towards Lebanon: How Short-Sighted Power Behavior Backfires,"Gasseling, Malte","['Schonmann, Noa']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores Saudi Arabia’s power behavior towards Lebanon in order to explore the pattern of Saudi Arabia’s waning influence. After all, it is among the most powerful regional actors and wields immense financial as well as religious resources compared to lightweight Lebanon. Nevertheless, Saudi action in Lebanon backfires seemingly frequently, either strengthening its opponents or weakening its allies. It is argued that Saudi Arabia is very capable of using their economic might in Lebanon; however, the more they strangle Lebanon the more likely Lebanon is to fall into Iran’s open arms. This, in turn, hurts Saudi Arabia’s overarching goal of regional influence and limiting Iran’s expansionism. On top of that, Saudi’s credibility, trust and legitimacy were thwarted after the 2009 elections and especially after the 2017 Hariri debacle in Lebanon. While prioritizing immediate national interest is natural for any country, Saudi Arabia’s policies disregarded the Lebanese target population’s perception and failed to achieve its regional interest with regards to pushing back Iranian influence. Hence, its prematurely hard power-driven policy pushed its allies away into the open arms of Iran. Saudi Arabia indeed has immense soft power resources, which, however, it has been largely ineffective in utilizing thus far. After all, it has become evident that despite its small size, Lebanon is the stage for regional power play. If Saudi Arabia continues to employ such a miscalculated policy, it will threaten its regional standing despite its immense, yet waning, economic might. Consequently, an unbalanced use of soft and hard power behavior of Saudi Arabia results in a cost inefficient foreign policy. Instead of self-defeating its efforts, it should be in Saudi’s self-serving interest to winning the hearts and minds of the people for effective power conversion and a strong standing to challenge Iran.","['Saudi Arabia', 'Lebanon', 'Power', 'Middle East', 'International Relations', 'Foreign Policy', 'Hard Power', 'Soft Power', 'Politics']"

Negen docenten van zowel onder- als bovenbouw (vmbo tot vwo) zijn geïnterviewd over hun literatuuropvattingen en hoe deze opvattingen tot uiting komen in de lessen. Het onderzoek betreft een (gedeeltelijke) replicatie van de studie van Van Koeven (2011) waarbij literatuuropvattingen in het christelijk basisonderwijs centraal stonden. Er is sprake van opvallende verschillen tussen de literatuuropvattingen van docenten Nederlands op open en gesloten christelijke middelbare scholen. Docenten op open scholen blijken in het geheel geen grenzen te stellen aan de boeken die gelezen worden door hun leerlingen. Ieder boek is toegestaan: ook boeken waarin seksuele, gewelddadige, of occulte zaken beschreven worden. Docenten op gesloten christelijke scholen stellen wel grenzen. Bepaalde boeken met controversiële thema’s, zoals seksualiteit worden niet behandeld in de klas of mogen door leerlingen niet gelezen worden voor hun lijst. Net als in het onderzoek van Van Koeven is er op de scholen geen gemeenschappelijke identiteit die bepalend is voor de omgang van docenten met boeken. De door de docenten gebruikte argumentatie om een boek wel of niet te behandelen, bestaat vooral uit intuïtieve denkbeelden en emoties. Deze subjectieve argumentatie was voornamelijk aanwezig bij docenten van de onderbouw. Er ontbreekt bovendien een helder geformuleerde visie op hoe de christelijke identiteit van de school samenhangt met het fictie- en literatuuronderwijs, wat de discussie over controversiële boeken moeilijk maakt. Ik doe enkele aanbevelingen om die discussie in het voortgezet onderwijs te stimuleren en te voorkomen dat (controversiële) boeken ongelezen blijven.","['literatuuronderwijs', 'middelbare scholen', 'bijzonder onderwijs', 'christelijk onderwijs', 'controversiële literatuur']"
Conflating piracy and maritime terrorism: the need for long-term solutions,"Filipe, Beatriz","['Black, Lindsay']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Malacca Strait is one of the most important sea lanes of communication which is crossed by one third of the international trade every year (Huang, 2008). Hence, the necessity to guarantee the safety of this region is crucial to the international community dependent on this trade. The Malacca Strait is composed by three major countries: Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, which have concomitant maritime arenas. The focus of the thesis falls upon Indonesia and Singapore, the countries have reported rates of piracy and terrorism which concern the international community. The mechanisms used to deal with these two same threats vary between the two countries that keep different positions towards the best ways to deal with pirates and terrorists in the region. Singapore used the securitization of the conflation of piracy and maritime terrorism to guarantee the allocation of resources to maritime crimes. While Indonesia kept both crimes under the international radar, adopting a more cautious and neutral position concerning its maritime outlaws. However, the two countries achieved the same failed results since the policies implemented reached short-term results, leading to the necessity to develop more appropriate tools to achieve long-term solutions.",['Piracy Maritime terrorism']
A Defence of Free Speech on University Campuses: Why Universities Need Free Speech,"Jongerius, Frederick Bastiaan","['Boot, Eric']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Freedom of speech is one of our most cherished freedoms. If there is one institution that, throughout history, has most embodied and protected this fundamental freedom, it is the university. So one would expect the freedom to express almost anything on campus. One would be gravely mistaken. This paper argues that, in a relatively recent trend on American universities, views deemed offensive, hateful or discriminatory are increasingly censored. Free speech is stifled by means of speech codes, free speech zones, no-platforming controversial speakers and much more. After having examined the severity of free speech restrictions in part one, part two of this paper presents a defence of a Millian, or ‘broad’, understanding of free speech. Following John Stuart Mill, broad free speech allows for the expression of almost any view, including those found offensive, hateful or discriminatory. For allowing all views to be heard is essential to the university’s goals of establishing the truth and forming the students into critical thinkers. Finally, arguments in favour of free speech restrictions on universities are discussed and refuted accordingly. In concluding, this paper advises universities to refuse to implement free speech restrictions, as these are antithetical to the goals of the university.","['Free Speech', 'Higher Education', 'John Stuart Mill']"

"The Adat Law toolkit: F.D. Holleman's life and thought in the Netherlands, Indonesia and South Africa","Sher, Daniel","['Schrikker, Alicia']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Customary law in South Africa was transformed by its incorporation into the colonial and later Apartheid state. In this regard, the work of colonial administrators and scholars were important as their visions of idealised ‘tribal’ society and chiefly rule with despotic and patriarchal qualities were often largely reproduced in official state policy, and served to legitimate white minority rule. Literature on this subject has tended to either be situated within a national narrative, or largely focus on British policies of indirect rule. Tracing the career and thought of F.D. ‘Frits’ Holleman in the first half of the 20th Century, as he moved from judicial and scholarly appointments in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI), to posts at Leiden University in the Netherlands and ultimately Stellenbosch University in South Africa, allows for a more explicitly global approach to the subject. It also demonstrates an insufficiently-acknowledged transfer of Dutch colonial expertise and experience from an established body of Indonesian adat law scholarship, originating at Leiden University, to an emerging field of customary law scholarship in the strongly Afrikaner Nationalist environment of Stellenbosch. While Holleman’s work on South African customary law was in some ways distinct from what he had worked on before, many of the concepts and characteristics he ascribed to African societies were straightforwardly transposed from his work on adat law, which stood within a tradition of scholarship that demonstrated both paternal/empathic concern for protecting non-Western law, and a strong essentialising impulse, leading to broad and enduring generalisations about supposedly ‘primitive’ societies. Beyond Holleman’s own trajectory, this study holds broader significance in the way it demonstrates the spread of theories of adat law far beyond their place of origin, and their influence on South African thinking about customary law. Moreover, the structural factors which allowed Holleman and his ideas to travel, suggest connections far deeper than a single individual; Holleman’s case has implications for how we think about the ongoing relationship between the Netherlands and South Africa, and indeed a triangular relationship between the Netherlands, Indonesia and South Africa. It may also offer a new lens with which to view the revival of traditionalist politics in both South Africa and Indonesia.","['Customary law', 'Apartheid', 'Adat law', 'Netherlands East Indies', 'Orientalism', 'Volkekunde', 'Leiden University', 'Afrikaner Nationalism', 'Stellenbosch University', 'Global intellectual history']"

The movie is about the heroic story of General Panfilov’s 28 soldiers of the 316th Rifle Division and their defense of Moscow in November 1941. To mirror the heroic tale of the Battle for Moscow, the first-hand account of battalion commander Baurdzhan Momysh-Uly on the battle near Volokolamsk is used, written down by Russian reporter and writer Alexander Bek in 1943. Two primary sources that represent the October and November fighting in the Battle for Moscow in 1941, but from two different perspectives, a blockbuster movie one and a classic literary one. The research question of this thesis consisted of three questions: how can the nearly collapse of the Soviet state by Unternehmen Barbarossa (June-December 1941) historically be explained? How is its overarching symbol, the heroic story of Panfilov’s 28, presented in the war movie ‘28 Panfilovcev’? How do in comparison contemporary firsthand accounts of Red Army soldiers reflect to this heroic picture? This thesis will examine the heroic story of Panfilov’s 28 from its early roots of a newspaper article to its modern day presentation in a blockbuster movie, catapulted to the mass consumers in the large cinemas of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The conclusions of this research of the story Panfilov’s 28 and its political use of the past will make a contribution to the academic debate of the disastrous early war months for the Soviet Union in 1941 as well as in understanding the movie ’28 Panfilovcev’ as an example of present day Russian cultural policy.","['Panfilov', 'Red Army', 'Moscow', 'Barbarossa', 'Volokolamsk', 'Myth', '1941', 'Stalin', 'Alexander Bek', '28 Panfilovcev']"

Heinlein implemented his political convictions into his work, evolving through his career from a socialist viewpoint to a libertarian – arguably even anarchistic – viewpoint. This thesis tracks this development through a critical analysis of three novels from the early, middle, and late stages of his career. In Beyond this Horizon, which is a reaction to the Great Depression in the United States, Heinlein describes a utopian society based on a socialist economy in which all problems of the twentieth century are solved. In Starship Troopers, which is Heinlein’s response to President Eisenhower’s decision regarding the end of nuclear testing, he explores the ideology of a society which promotes individual freedom, arguing that freedom and responsibility ultimately leads to patriotism. The third novel, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, is Heinlein’s libertarian retelling of the American revolution and is the culmination of his political development from socialist to libertarian ideology.","['Heinlein', 'Beyond this Horizon', 'Starship Troopers', 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress', 'Libertarian', 'Science Fiction', 'Political development']"

"Strategisch manoeuvreren in het actietype ""Nederlands verkiezingsdebat"". Een onderzoek naar het strategisch manoeuvreren van lijsttrekkers in Nederlandse verkiezingsdebatten gedurende de verkiezingen van 2012.","Hijman, Esther Cornelia Petronella","['Haaften, Ton van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze masterscriptie wordt verslag gedaan van een onderzoek naar de verkiezingsdebatten in aanloop naar de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 2012. Verkiezingsdebatten zijn voor lijsttrekkers een uitgelezen gelegenheid om hun eigen standpunten en belangrijkste argumenten uiteen te zetten. Zodoende trachten zij de kiezer te overtuigen op hen te stemmen, zodat zij uiteindelijk voorop kunnen gaan bij het vormen van een nieuwe regering en het leiden van het land. Door middel van de uitgebreide pragma-dialectiek, waarin strategisch manoeuvreren een belangrijke rol speelt, is een analyse gemaakt van lijsttrekkers in drie verkiezingsdebatten uit de campagne van 2012. De notie strategisch manoeuvreren verwijst naar het feit dat discussianten een verschil van mening niet alleen willen oplossen, maar het meningsverschil ook willen winnen. Er bestaat dus zowel een dialectische als een retorische dimensie. Strategisch manoeuvreren vindt altijd plaats in een specifieke argumentatieve praktijk, in de pragma-dialectiek ook wel argumentatief actietype genoemd. Om een zo compleet mogelijk beeld van het strategisch manoeuvreren te geven, wordt dus eerst de argumentatieve praktijk, oftewel het argumentatieve actietype, van het Nederlands verkiezingsdebat gekarakteriseerd. Uit deze omschrijving blijkt dat het belangrijkste doel van de lijsttrekkers is om de (potentiële) kiezer te overtuigen. Het overtuigen geschiedt door het gewenste beleid te beargumenteren, waardoor het publiek gelijktijdig wordt geïnformeerd over de inhoud van het nieuwe beleid. Hierbij is het informeren ondergeschikt aan het overtuigen. Daarnaast dienen politici zich aan een aantal regels te houden. Ze dienen rekening te houden met de institutionele regels van het verkiezingsdebat, zoals met respect debatteren en andere deelnemers niet persoonlijk aanvallen. Daarnaast moeten ze, net als in alle andere actietypen, rekening houden met de pragma-dialectische discussieregels. De primaire resultaten van de analyses laten zien dat politici gebruikmaken van drie verschillende argumentatietypen, waarvan de pragmatische argumentatie het meest gebruikt werd. Daarnaast laten de analyses zien dat binnen het verkiezingsdebat ruimte is voor het gebruik van verschillende stijlfiguren en presentatiemiddelen en dat politici zich bewust aan het publiek, de (potentiële) kiezer aanpassen. Uit deze primaire resultaten zijn drie strategische keuzes (eigenaarschap, framing en het gebruik van autoriteitsargumentatie) geëxtraheerd en is gekeken naar hoe de keuze van de argumentatie, de keuze uit de presentatiemiddelen en de aanpassingen aan het auditorium samen bijdragen aan de vormgeving van de strategisch keuzes. In deze analyses wordt nogmaals benadrukt dat politici alles in het werk stellen om de kiezer te bereiken en te overtuigen. Deze scriptie kan beschouwd worden als een exploratief-analytisch en hypothesevormend onderzoek, dat gebruikt kan worden bij verder onderzoek naar strategisch manoeuvreren in het Nederlands verkiezingsdebat. Zodoende kunnen de analyses uitgevoerd worden op een recentere casus of kan er een groter corpus gebruikt worden.","['Verkiezingsdebatten', 'Strategisch manoeuvreren', 'Politiek taalgebruik', 'Verkiezingen 2012', 'Politiek debat', 'Argumentatief actietype']"

Shakespeare's Verb Morphology: The Development from -th to -s in Shakespeare’s Plays,"Zegers, Leanne","['Tieken-Boon van Ostade, Ingrid']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"William Shakespeare (1564–1616) – as far as we know – wrote thirty-seven plays over a time period of twenty-three years (Hoenselaars 2012:xv–xxii), one could wonder if traces of the changing verb-morphology of the Early Modern English Period (1500–1700) should be found in his writing (Crystal 2004:3). One example of this changing verb morphology is that, during this period, the third-person singular present tense inflection -th fell out of general use and the -s inflection became a part of Standard English (Nevalainen 2006:89). This thesis discusses if Shakespeare’s verb morphology represents this morphological shift. To answer this question, this thesis analysed the verb morphology of third-person singular present tense verbs in three of Shakespeare’s plays, more specifically comedies, one from the beginning of his career, one from the middle and one from end, i.e. The Two Gentlemen of Verona (1589–1593) , Twelfth Night (1601–1602) and The Two Noble Kinsmen (1613–1615). This analysis has presented results that prove that the use of the -th inflection by Shakespeare in his plays decreased throughout his career.","['Shakespeare', 'Morphology', 'Linguistics', 'Verb Morphology', 'Plays', 'Early Modern English']"

The findings conclude that across the literature similar themes and suggestions are repeated, and this paper distils these findings to two key factors which appear to garner the most benefit from remittances: (1) That remittances be facilitated; and (2) that remittances be utilised. If both conditions are met, we identify that remittances appear to help to economic growth, if these conditions are not met, remittances can be a hinderance to economic growth. The facilitation and utilisation of remittances can only be made possible by government intervention through remittance-based and other, macroeconomic policy. These policies can only be supported by a government which is democratic, corruption-free and is committed to good governance. Nigeria and Morocco are used as case studies to demonstrate this relationship as Nigeria has lax policies regarding remittances overall, while Morocco has strong facilitation policies, but poor utilisation of remittances for economic growth.","['Remittances', 'Economic growth', 'Government intervention', 'Facilitation and utilisation of remittances', 'Morocco', 'Nigeria', 'Remittances, help or hinderance']"

Visual Vernacular: an Inter and Intra Sign Language Poetry Genre Comparison,"Brandwijk, Marieke van","['Nyst, Victoria']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Within sign language poetry there is a genre that has not been the subject of scientific research yet, even though it has been around for quite some time: visual vernacular. It differentiates itself from other types of sign language literature in that it hardly ever uses anything but iconic signs, and this is what makes it internationally comprehensible across sign language borders. It is even understandable to audiences who do not have any knowledge of a sign language. Besides iconic signs, it uses many cinematographic techniques such as role switching from and to different subject or objects within the story. Visual vernacular is different from another type of sign language literature called classifier stories mainly in that the latter uses sign language specific lexicon which visual verancular does not. Another similar form of art, this time outside the sign language realm, is pantomime, but this is different from visual vernacular in many ways, one of the most prominent of which is that pantomime performers are only the storyteller whereas visual vernacular performers swith between the storyteller, main protagonist and any other subject or object in the story. By making a literary overview and using a dataset of different types of visual vernacular stories, this thesis provides an inter and intra sign language poetry genre comparison.","['sign language', 'signing', 'poetry', 'visual vernacular', 'iconicity', 'cinematographic', 'deaf', 'pantomime', 'sign language literature']"
Een fenomenologisch onderzoek naar de 'burn-out' om tot een vollediger begrip van lijden te komen,"Rijn, Nick van","['Uljée, Rozemuns']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek zal proberen, middels een fenomenologische kijk op een burn-out, te achterhalen hoe lijden gerelateerd is aan het mens-zijn alvorens te komen tot een vollediger begrip van lijden, waarbij deze relatie in acht wordt genomen. De ontologie van Jean-Paul Sartre zal dienen als kader voor de fenomenologische analyse van een burn-out. De fenomenologische analyse van een burn-out aan de hand van Jean-Paul Sartre heeft filosofische relevantie omdat het lijden aan een burn-out laat zien dat lijden niet kan worden gereduceerd tot het stoïcijnse begrip van lijden als negatieve toestand. Als ziekte vindt een burn-out niet zijn oorsprong in fysieke of psychische aandoeningen. Een burn-out vindt, daarentegen, zijn oorsprong in de omgeving van degene die uiteindelijk lijdt aan een burn-out waarbij de omgeving druk uitoefent op de aangemeten identiteit van desbetreffend persoon. Wanneer de diagnose ‘burn-out’ is gesteld, dan wordt deze aangemeten identiteit - het ‘wat’ deze persoon is – ervaren als gebroken. Een burn-out onthult het ‘wie’ van de mens als zijnde dat zijn eigen zijnsgemis ondergaat en het belang van diens omgeving om te bepalen wat hij is in een betekenisvol en emotioneel geaffecteerd geheel. Hierdoor vormt de casus van een burn-out een toegang voor het begrijpen van de relatie tussen het lijden en de mens van waaruit een bijdrage kan worden geleverd aan een beter begrip van lijden.","['Fenomenologie', 'Sartre', 'Ontologie', 'Stoicijnen', 'Lijden']"
Identity and Political Obligation,"Natera, Noel Donato","['Mokrosinska, D.M.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"The problem of political obligation revolves around questions regarding the locus, limits, content, and normativity of political obedience. Contemporary debate on these questions has settled around a handful of approaches, which includes theories from consent, gratitude, fair play, natural duty, and association. The purpose of the present dissertation is to put forward an alternative to these approaches by showing how a constitutional conception of identity can be used to address the questions at the center of the problem of political obligation. This account will be based on certain existing approaches, especially associative ones, but will depart from these significantly by downplaying the normative independence of associative obligations and taking an approach that places the universal human good inherent in our identities at the root of the normativity of political obligation, while assigning it a key role in answering the central questions that a valid theory of political obligation must address.",

"Face, Vocalisation and Violence in an Ethics of Relating","Springham, Anna-Liisa","['Chouraqui, Frank']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Vocalisation is formed in the inversion of the face, up until it reaches the face it is a sound akin to blowing through a blade of grass, it has pitch and intensity but little shape. The shape of vocalisation is formed in the ""mask"", the resonant chamber at the front of the head, the inverted face. Thereby, vocalisation is the sonic manifestation of the shape of the face outside of the body. This creates an ambiguity as to the directionality of the face, in that, when someone vocalises visibly towards me, I cannot be sure which way the face, sonically captured in vocalization, is facing. It’s unclear if the other is just talking to themself or to me or are half in half out or are rotating. The chord of vocalisation, the fact that each and every vocalisation is heard/felt as sound in the face and the face captured in sonic form outside of the body simultaneously, suggests that the interaction may be a Narcissus' story, where the face is more often or than not reflected back towards the self. This thesis is supported further if we think about vocalisation as a form of self-pleasure, in the erotic experience of forming vocals and the enjoyment of hearing one's own voice, reflected in the story of Echo. This seems to point towards a social failure or at least ambiguity of the interaction between self and other, if the self is always talking to the self. The experience further still, starts to feel violent when we de-mute or make sonic vocalisation, rarely done in a philosophy of voice. Incorporating sound's intrusive quality on the body into this intersubjective interaction points towards a violent potentiality. The intrusion of the sound of the other on my soundscape, my extended body, is the sonic extension of the body of the other in vocalisation, commanding a piece of my hearing territory, thereby penetrating my body. The problem is that I cannot avoid this because that bodily intrusion has a face attached. In reference to Levinas’ ethics of the face, I am forced to partake in these socially unfulfilling interactions out of a sense of duty to the other's face. To not acknowledge the face in response, even though that inevitable involves an intrusion, is also to estrange the other. Hence, I agree to maintain these interactions in a conduct of consensual violence. The ambiguity of vocal presence leads to a situation where it is violent not to be violent, in my vocal intrusion upon the other.","['Voice', 'Philosophy', 'Ethics', 'Levinas', 'Face', 'Violence']"
De deelstaat Oost-Indonesië: oprechte dekolonisatie of verhuld koloniaal gezag? Daerah-vorming in Timor en Onderhoorigheden 1945-1949,"Borgers, Thijs","['Luttikhuis, Bart']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In november 1946 sloten de Nederlands-Indische overheid en de door Soekarno uitgeroepen Republiek Indonesië het Akkoord van Linggadjati. Hierin spraken zij af om in het kader van de dekolonisatie Indonesië om te vormen naar een federatief verband. Deze federatie zou bestaan uit vier deelstaten: Sumatra, de Republiek, Borneo en Oost-Indonesië. De meest concrete uitvoering van het federale stelsel vond plaats in Oost-Indonesië. In de historische beschouwingen over de dekolonisatie is echter de meeste aandacht uitgegaan naar de interacties tussen de Nederlands-Indische overheid en de Republiek op Java. Vanwege de nauwe focus op de Republiek zijn de politieke processen binnen de deelstaat Oost-Indonesië nauwelijks onderzocht, waardoor de deelstaat Oost-Indonesië vaak beschouwd als niets meer dan sneer richting de Republiek, als troefkaart op de onderhandeltafel, of in het ergste geval als een Nederlandse marionettenstaat. Deze gangbare beschouwingen gaan echter voorbij aan de oprechte poging tot dekolonisatie in Oost-Indonesië. Door de focus te leggen op de Nederlandse bestuursambtenaren en hun Indonesische collega’s ter plaatse ontstaat een nieuw beeld over de werkzaamheden die verricht werden omtrent federalisering en dekolonisatie in de deelstaat Oost-Indonesië. De conclusie van dit onderzoek luidt dat tussen 1946 en 1949 Nederlandse bestuursambtenaren een nieuw politiek systeem poogden op te zetten waarin er daadwerkelijk sprake was van een oprechte poging tot dekolonisatie, en waarbij steeds meer bestuurstaken overgingen op het Indonesische bestuur.","['Indonesië', 'Oost-Indonesië', 'Dekolonisatie', 'Federalisering', 'Deelstaat', 'Daerah', 'Timor en Onderhoorigheden', 'Timor', 'Soemba', 'Soembawa', 'Flores']"
"Meisjes in een mannelijk bolwerk. De plotselinge toelating van meisjes tot de hogere burgerschool, 1863-1906. Over masculiniteit, principes, en praktijk","Dingemans, Maartje","['Janse, Maartje']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Hoe valt te verklaren dat meisjes al vanaf 1871 deelnamen aan het onderwijs op de hogere burgerschool? Het hbs-onderwijs diende bij uitstek om de ondernemende, moderne burger op te leiden, een notie die lijnrecht tegenover het negentiende-eeuwse ideaal van de passieve, zorgzame vrouw staat. Het is daarom des te frappanter dat meisjes nog geen tien jaar na de oprichting van de hbs, zonder actieve steun van pressiegroepen, werden toegelaten tot juist deze school. Bovenstaande vraag tracht beantwoord te worden via een blik op het masculiene karakter van de hbs, waarom meisjes in 1871 werden toegelaten, en waarom steeds meer meisjes deel konden blijven nemen aan het onderwijs op de hbs. Literatuur keek tot nu toe voornamelijk naar de meningen die feministen, politici, en pedagogen over gemengd onderwijs hadden, terwijl geconcludeerd wordt dat die discussie amper impact had op de praktijk. De focus in dit onderzoek ligt daarom bij die praktijk middels raadpleging van verzoekschriften tot toelating, enquêtes onder schooldirecteuren en gedenkboeken van hbs’en.","['onderwijs', 'gender', 'emancipatie', 'hogere burgerschool', 'negentiende eeuw', 'liberalisme']"
"BAITHAK GANA: EEN VERGELIJKING TUSSEN SURINAME, NEDERLAND, GUYANA EN TRINIDAD & TOBAGO","Ramnath, Wanita","['Rutten, Gijsbert']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to be silent (Hugo, 1865) is een populair gezegde van Victor Hugo, Franse dichter en schrijver (1802-1885). Dit is zeker het geval geweest bij de Hindostaanse contractarbeiders geweest in de koloniën Suriname, Guyana en Trinidad & Tobago. Met de komst van deze immigranten begint de baithak gana zich in deze landen te ontwikkelen. Dit genre Hindostaanse muziek maakt vijf fasen mee, vanaf het ontstaan tot heden. De onderzoeksvraag is: Welke veranderingen hebben de liedteksten van de baithak gana in Suriname, Nederland, Guyana en Trinidad & Tobago ondergaan en welke verschillen en overeenkomsten zijn er tussen deze landen? Het doel van dit onderzoek is documentatie en om de lezer informatie te geven over de invloeden die de baithak gana heeft gehad door de jaren heen, veranderingen die plaatsgevonden hebben in dit genre en de ontwikkelingen van de baithak gana in Suriname, Guyana, Nederland en Trinidad & Tobago. Ook is onderzocht of dit genre in deze landen overeenkomsten en verschillen heeft en of er toename van leenwoorden te constateren is. Verder is er nagegaan of er sprake is van creolisering van de baithak gana. Wat de Guyanezen en de Trinidadianen taan singing noemen, kennen de Surinamers en Nederlanders als baithak gana. De Hindostaanse immigranten zijn zowel in Trinidad & Tobago, Guyana als in Suriname uit India aangevoerd voor het werk op de plantages. Deze immigranten namen hun cultureel erfgoed mee en ontwikkelden in het land van aankomst dit verder. Net zoals een taal leeft, leeft de muziek ook. Invloeden van andere talen en culturen zijn niet uitgebleven: creolisering vindt plaats. De baithak gana is door de jaren heen veranderd als er gelet wordt op tekst en muziek. Ook westerse invloeden hebben een rol gespeeld. Met de komst van multimedia zijn de veranderingen die plaatsvinden in de baithak gana niet meer tegen te houden. De liederen uit Guyana en Trinidad & Tobago zijn een- of tweetalig: in het Guyanees- of Trinidadiaans-Engels of in het Hindi. De liederen die geremixt of zelf geschreven worden door zangers, zijn vaker tweetalig: in de Bollywoodliederen worden enkele regels uit het Engels opgenomen in de songtekst of andersom. In Guyana en Trinidad & Tobago genieten de liederen een nationaal draagvlak, omdat veel van deze liederen in een variant van het Engels wordt gezongen, de officiële taal van Guyana en Trinidad & Tobago. Deze landen hebben geen variant van het Bhojpuri, zoals Suriname en Nederland dat wel hebben met het Sarnami. Dit ligt aan de koloniale taalpolitiek die in Guyana en Trinidad & Tobago wel van grote invloed is geweest, waardoor in deze landen de Engelse taal de oorspronkelijke taal van de Hindostaanse immigranten heeft verdrongen. De onderzoeksresultaten zijn in figuren verwerkt en geven de veranderingen bij deze muzieksoort weer. Verschillende liederen uit de diverse perioden die geanalyseerd zijn, geven een overzichtelijk beeld van de ontwikkeling weer. De respondenten en interviews hebben meer inzicht gegeven in het geheel. Observaties hebben ervoor gezorgd dat er een beter beeld gecreëerd kon worden over de baithak gana. De originele, oorspronkelijke baithak gana, waren religieus getinte liederen in het Hindi, Sanskriet of Urdu. Er werden slechts drie muziekinstrumenten gebruikt bij deze liederen: de dhol, het harmonium en de dhantaal. Door de veranderingen, in vooral taal en tekst, is de baithak gana haar originele status kwijtgeraakt. De baithak gana is nu meer dansnummers met leenwoorden uit de diverse talen en een rijk aanbod aan westers instrumentarium. Vulgair taalgebruik maakt deel uit van de songteksten en ook maatschappelijke onderwerpen worden bezongen. Deze veranderingen zijn ook in Nederland, Guyana en Trinidad & Tobago te merken. De generatie van tegenwoordig, vooral de jongeren, zijn geïnteresseerd in beats uit het westen. Zij eisen de moderne stijl op wat de semi-baithak gana, meer hindipop en chutney, in leven houdt. De moderne stijl van de baithak gana geniet internationaal draagvlak en heeft een goede toekomst.","['Baithak Gana', 'Suriname', 'Nederland', 'Hindostaanse muziek']"

De digitale longform: de dood door duizend mogelijkheden?,"Enklaar, Oscar","['Pleijter, Alexander']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In het afgelopen decennium heeft de journalistiek veel veranderingen ondergaan. Door technische ontwikkelingen en de komst van het internet is de manier waarop mensen media gebruiken en nieuws tot zich nemen veranderd. Dankzij het internet kan iedereen gemakkelijk 'uitzenden', met veel concurrentie voor de traditionele mediabedrijven als gevolg. De gevestigde bedrijven waren genoodzaakt zich te onderscheiden en experimenteerden met nieuwe journalistieke vormen, waaronder de digitale longform. De digitale longform is een relatief nieuw genre dat zich kenmerkt door haar lengte en diepgang, waar een narratief en multimediale en interactieve elementen rijkelijk aanwezig zijn. Het Amerikaanse The New York Times zette de digitale longform op de kaart met Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek, waarna ook in Nederland volop met deze vorm werd geëxperimenteerd. Over het algemeen worden digitale longforms enthousiast ontvangen, maar er zijn ook negatieve geluiden te horen. Het zou – juist in deze tijd van financieel zwaar weer in de journalistiek – te veel tijd en geld kosten. Daarnaast zou het inzetten van allerlei verschillende modaliteiten voornamelijk afleiden van het eigenlijke doel van de journalistiek: informeren. Verschillende onderzoeken bogen zich over de informatieverwerking van multimediale elementen in journalistieke verhalen, waaronder Deuze (2004), Opgenhaffen en d'Haenens (2011) en Dowling en Vogan (2015). Waar deze onderzoeken toetsend van aard waren, wordt er in deze masterthesis gekeken naar hoe het publiek de aanwezigheid van een narratief, multimedia en interactieve elementen ervaart. De hoofdvraag luidt: Hoe ervaren mensen de digitale longform als nieuwe vertelvorm in de journalistiek? Voor dit onderzoek keken veertien respondenten naar twee nadrukkelijk verschillende producties: De Kunst van het Stelen (NRC Handelsblad) en Het DNA van MDMA (NOS op 3). Aan de hand van de hardopdenkmethode en diepte-interviews valt te concluderen dat de respondenten in principe open staan voor de digitale longform, mits het voldoet aan een paar essentiële punten. Zo is het belangrijk dat afbeeldingen en video's iets toevoegen en niet slechts een herhaling zijn van de tekst. Daarnaast moet de techniek in orde zijn, daar verschillende respondenten zich mateloos stoorden aan falende techniek. Een verhalende schrijfstijl wordt tot op zekere hoogte gewaardeerd, maar maakt een verhaal al snel kinderachtig. De lengte van de artikelen en afzonderlijke elementen is belangrijk: eindeloze lappen tekst worden door zowel jong als oud verafschuwd. Ten slotte valt het op dat vooral de interactieve elementen gewaardeerd worden. Onderdelen waar respondenten zelf het heft in handen kunnen nemen blijken populairder dan de andere onderdelen van de longforms. Zolang de producties voldoende scoren op deze punten, staan de nieuwsgebruikers open voor de digitale longform.","['longform', 'receptieonderzoek', 'multimediale specials']"

The results were generated statistically through a survey that was forwarded to parents of students in the second, third and fourth year of primary school. The following information was collected from the parents: * The governing language used in the household; * Influential factors of the language choice; * The opinion on the importance of learning Frisian; * The opinion on bilingualism in general. The results indicate that the parents made a conscious choice of their native language. 29% of the respondents speak Frisian at home, exclusively, whilst 49% speak both Dutch and Frisian. The main reason for the choice of speaking Frisian with the next generation is the positive view on bilingualism and the strong will to pass the Frisian language and culture to the next generation. The conclusion of this research shows that the Frisian language is likely to survive and the expectation of a complete language shift from Frisian to Dutch within the next generation is highly unlikely.","['language maintenance', 'language shift', 'Frisian', 'taalbehoud', 'taalverschuiving', 'Fries', 'Minority language', 'heritage language']"
'It's Sanity in the Midst of Insanity' Nigeria's Covenant University as a Political Choice of Order,"Rajman, Sean Miles","['Goede, Meike de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis serves to politically conceptualize and explain the popularity of Pentecostalism in Nigeria. The paper focused on the choice of students and employees Covenant University to join that same university. Covenant University is a private university which is a subsidiary of the Living Faith Church Worldwide (LFCWW), one of the largest Pentecostal churches in Nigeria. This choice of university represents a clear choice to affiliate with or join the Pentecostal community and faith. Covenant University is also a community under full control of the church and a Pentecostal societal model. As an multidisciplinary project, the thesis involved using system-level conceptual analysis of political theory combined with an anthropological ethnographic micro-level study of the Covenant University community. The main argument of the thesis is that while the Nigerian sociopolitical landscape is in a state of disorder, meaning that it is void of a supraethnoreligious ethic and is plagued by extreme violence in everyday life, Covenant University and the LFCWW present themselves as communities of order. This is because they are governed by an overarching ethic derived from scripture and because the main compound of the LFCWW is safe contrasted to the Nigerian public space. Church members and staff explicitly separate themselves from the non-believing populous and the government in a dichotomous friend-enemy fashion. The thesis concludes that the choice of Covenant University as a workplace or place of study constitutes a political choice of order over disorder. As this choice mirrors becoming a Pentecostal church member, the analysis of it bares the political importance the Pentecostal movement in Nigeria.","['Pentecostalism', 'Nigeria', 'Political', 'Order', 'Disorder', 'African', 'Religion']"

It studies the setup, the methods and the resources of the Austrian Cultural Fora and the Dutch embassies. By analysing the cultural diplomacy frameworks, this dissertation explains the incentives of the two countries to invest in cultural policies abroad. The diplomatic activities present national values and promote a politically and economically beneficial Image of the Netherlands and Austria abroad. Despite the aim to establish a coherent approach, the diplomats adapt cultural diplomacy to the political and societal circumstances in the host country to achieve both economic benefits and international cooperation. This research analyses semi-structured interviews with elites working in the field of international cultural relations at the Austrian and the Dutch Ministry for Foreign Affairs as primary sources and supports the findings with secondary literature.

Zachte waarheid en harde leugens,"Bierman, David Erik Theodoor","['Vries, Mark Leon de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Mr. president, please try to contain your dignity,' sprak een bezorgd adviseur tegen de Amerikaanse president Andrew Johnson na zijn polariserende speech op 3 september 1866 te Cleveland, Ohio. 'I don't care about my dignity', snauwde de president op zijn beurt terug. Zijn temperamentvolle karakter stond volledig in de aanvalsmodus, en met goede reden. Een vijandig publiek had hem succesvol uit de tent weten te lokken terwijl hij achter zijn spreekgestalte stond. Keer op keer hekelden Republikeinse toeschouwers hem en werd er vanuit alle hoeken gejouwd. Gefrustreerd en geëmotioneerd had hij een aantal heftige uitspraken over de Republikeinen gedaan die, na landelijke verspreiding door toedoen van de noordelijke en zuidelijke kranten, niet in zijn voordeel uitpakten. Johnsons toespraak in Cleveland was het begin van een enorm verlies van zijn imago, dat de dagen ervoor nog enigszins positief opgebouwd was. Tot dan toe waren de media de campagnetoer relatief gunstig gezind geweest: op de uitgebreide speeches van de president in Philadelphia en New York was weinig negatief commentaar gepubliceerd. Maar na 3 september keerde het tij voor de president en begon de kritiek vanuit de Republikeinen en ook vanuit zijn eigen Democratische achterban toe te nemen. In plaats van de campagnetoer te stoppen, zette hij echter door, wat later een compleet verkeerde keuze zou blijken. Johnons koppigheid, zijn aanhoudende verwijten tegenover vooraanstaande Republikeinen en het pure racisme dat doorscheen in zijn speeches leidden ertoe dat zowel zijn Republikeinse als zijn Democratische aanhang steeds meer vraagtekens zetten bij zijn competentie als president. Het was vooral dat ene zinnetje over zijn dignity dat hem duur kwam te staan. Verslaggevers hadden de woordenwisseling tussen Johnson en zijn adviseur gehoord en stuurden die door naar het hoofdkantoor van hun krant. In de dagen erna verschenen de woorden in nieuwsbladen door het hele land. Vooral de Republikeinse media spraken schande van Johnsons houding en brutaliteit; 'onwaardig', 'oneerbiedig' en 'ronduit walgelijk' waren enkele van de termen die gebruikt werden om zijn optreden te beschrijven. Ook zijn antwoord op een opmerking die vanuit het publiek kwam, 'Hang Jeff Davis op!', werd slecht ontvangen. Hij reageerde: 'Waarom hangen jullie zelf Thad Stevens en Wendell Phillips niet op?"" Zijn woorden verspreidden zich snel en gaven de Republikeinen een nieuwe kans om hem af te schilderen als onbetrouwbaar, hatelijk en kwaadwillend. Dit was een beeld wat Johnson na 3 september tijdens de toer telkens weer zou bevestigen, tot groot genoegen van zijn politieke opponenten.",['Kranten Herald Tribune Amerika Swing Circle']

Every bird flies with its own wings - a history of professional pilots in Tanzanian aviation (1917-2017),"Leeuw, Marjolein de","['Leliveld, A.H.M.', 'Bellucci, S.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"There is a shortage of highly skilled aviation personnel in Tanzania. More than half of the pilots flying in the country are foreigners, while there are simultaneous reports of unemployed Tanzanian pilots. This, in combination with the lack of research on Tanzanian aviation in general, provided the starting point for this research on the changing position of Tanzanian pilots in the Tanzanian air transport sector from 1917 to 2017. This thesis is the result of a historical qualitative research with a six months fieldwork period carried out in Dar es Salaam in 2014/2015. Additional data was collected in 2016 and 2017. Researching Tanzanian aviation elites has its own methodological challenges of access and positionality. The thesis gives an overview of a century of flight and fliers in Tanzania. It is argued that Tanzanian pilots have experienced some degree of deprofessionalization through loss of expertise, autonomy and status as a result of global and local conditions. However, measuring the state of community is not very helpful in examining Tanzanian pilots. Tanzanian pilots are not helpless in the face of deprofessionalization. Some Tanzanian pilots have moved into management functions at their airlines and others have organized in the Professional Association of Tanzanian Pilots (PATP). The labor aristocracy thesis proved not sufficient to explain the behavior of Tanzanian pilots. While once maybe rightly considered a labor aristocracy, Tanzanian pilots have become a very heterogenous group. In order to counter deteriorating conditions, some pilots organized in the PATP; this pilots-exclusive association used its connections to gain momentum, but it had severe confrontations with state and employers and pilots left the group when they got employed. This suggests that the Tanzanian pilots in the PATP were in some ways acting as a labor aristocracy, but judging from their composition, it was also an attempt to get back into one. Non-organization rather than organization became a way of dealing with the changes. The situation and (in)actions of Tanzanian pilots was very complex and must be understood in its own context. Further research is needed to find out more about individual motivations and to examine how different airlines deal with highly skilled workers. This thesis adds a Tanzanian perspective to debates on professional workers and changing professions in a globalized world.",

Subtitling Characterization.

James R. Keller (2015) argues that Frank resembles the ‘vice’ – a figure from the early modern stage that is also related to the well-known villain – and describes a number of traits. These traits are linked to Frank’s language use by using Culpeper’s stylistic framework of characterization cues (2001), resulting in a qualitative analysis of the Frank’s language use. Next, Vinay and Darbelnet’s procedures (1995) and Gambier’s subtitling procedures (2006) are used to analyze the way in which Frank’s character statements and metaphors have been translated. The analysis shows that fewer information than expected was omitted in the translation, despite the spatiotemporal constraints and technical limitations inherent in subtitling. Any changes seemed to result in a change in emphasis, but not in characterization interpretation. Other information sources, such as video and audio that complement the subtitles, also confirm the character traits.","['translation', 'characterization', 'subtitling', 'subtitles', 'television', 'series', 'house of cards', 'effect']"

"'You Have to Know How to Play, Otherwise They Will Catch You"": Young Women and the Navigation of Same-Sex Intimacies in Contemporary Urban Senegal","Oudenhuijsen, Loes","['Dijk, Rijk van', 'Spronk, Rachel']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores how same-sex intimacies are navigated by young women in contemporary urban Senegal. Central to this research are various social spaces where sociality and sexuality are co-constructed among women. The analysis is based on six months of ethnographic fieldwork in urban Senegal, predominantly Dakar, with a focus on participant observation to grasp the tacit knowledge of same-sex intimacies. In particular, this thesis examines the football field, local queer organisations and a variety of other homosocial environments such as the home and queer parties. Through a careful adherence to the Senegalese value of sutura (discretion, modesty), by making use of play, and by displaying respectability, homosocial spaces ranging from the relatively private home to the fairly public football field allow for the occurrence of same-sex intimacies. This thesis makes use of Henrik Vigh’s (2006; 2009) conceptualisation of social navigation to understand how enacting same-sex desires is a twofold process of balancing personal desires and social expectations. The social environment is an ambiguous terrain in which expectations of proper womanhood, marriage, and parenthood need to be calibrated even as such expectations may change over time due to processes of globalisation, economic recession, or governmental changes, as well as with age, as new expectations and responsibilities arise as people grow from youth into (social) adults. This thesis will demonstrate how women navigate their same-sex intimacies in different ways in various social spaces, drawing on Henri Lefebvre’s (1991 [1974]) conceptual triad of social space. In these social spaces, gender is enacted relationally, and shifting notions of masculinity (jump) and femininity (sexy) attest to the ambiguity and fluidity of gender constructs. Together, these social spaces and the same-sex intimacies that they enable form a loosely connected community of practice (O’Mara 2013) that combines a specific lexicon (jump and sexy) with tacit understanding of same-sex intimacies. By examining how young women navigate existing spaces and create alternative spaces in trying to secure decent lives for themselves, this thesis shows how these different spaces form central loci of urban social reproduction. In these spaces, symbolic manifestations of gendered bodies coalesce into a network of queer women. Examining corporeal and erotic interactions between women helps theorise how these performative aspects of life contribute to the intersubjective meaning-making of sexuality and a sense of being at home in the world.","['Senegal', 'same-sex intimacies', 'social navigation', 'social spaces', 'gender', 'sutura', 'homosociality']"

Bridging Old and New Authoritarianism in President el-Sisi’s Egypt: How has the hybridization of classical and newer forms of authoritarian rule manifested under el-Sisi’s regime since 2014?,"Hughes, Anthony M.","['Forough, Mohammadbagher']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The geopolitical realignment which took place in the Middle East and North Africa since the uprisings of the Arab Spring has brought about a new manifestation of authoritarian rule in Egypt under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Egypt is among a growing number of countries around the world governed by a paradoxically open, yet harshly repressive, type of new authoritarianism. At the same time, with the presidency of the former General el-Sisi entering its fifth year, the return to power of Egypt’s military establishment has seen a resumption of the older authoritarian methods used by past Egyptian leaders to quell dissent against the government, and to maintain power generally. This thesis seeks to answer how President el-Sisi’s actions since becoming President in 2014 has led to a hybridization of both classical and new authoritarian theories. Through the significant utilization of the country’s national security apparatus, manipulation of the political and justice systems, and reliance on vast sources of economic aid from the United States, Europe, and the Persian Gulf states, el-Sisi appears to exhibit strategies from both old and new theories of authoritarianism. This thesis demonstrates the Egyptian experience of hybridized authoritarianism by incorporating overviews of authoritarianism generally, discussions of authoritarian theories, scholarly debates, and evidence from Egypt’s national security, legal, judicial, political, economic, and foreign relations sectors. This thesis will lend itself to broader scholarly discussions on authoritarianism in contemporary times, as well as on international relations in the Middle East, and the durability of strongman regimes in the developing world. While this thesis can only provide a secondary overview of Egypt’s recent return to authoritarianism, the researcher hopes it will make a small contribution to the political and foreign policy affairs in a region both rich in history and fraught with conflict.","['authoritarianism', 'new authoritarianism', 'Egypt', 'el-Sisi', 'hybrid authoritarianism', 'post-Arab Spring', 'Middle East', 'international relations', 'global order']"
De koepelgevangenis als model voor een vrije samenleving,"Laar, Lambert van","['Mokrosinska, D.M.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In 1787 ontwerpt Jeremy Bentham een gevangenis waarbinnen een aantal in die tijd weinig controversieel geachte correctieve mechanismen op vernieuwend efficiënte wijze worden geoperationaliseerd. Het ontwerp is eenvoudig: vanuit een centrale toren kan een inspecteur in een oogwenk alle gevangenen zien, terwijl hij zelf voor hen onzichtbaar blijft. Zo worden de gevangenen gedwongen om het toezicht en daarmee de discipline te verinnerlijken. Twee eeuwen later wijdt Michel Foucault aan dit ‘panoptisme’ een hoofdstuk dat wel zo duister is, dat het in herinnering roepen ervan sedertdien garant is komen te staan voor een onmiddellijke diskwalificatie van om het even welk beleidsvoorstel. De panoptische zelfdiscipline zou immers de algemene vrijheid te draconisch beknotten. In weerwil van deze unheimische verbintenis van panoptisme en onvrijheid, breekt dit werkstuk een lans voor Benthams architectonische figuur. De stelling is namelijk dat een algemene vrijheidsbeperking binnen een panoptisch model dikwijls in dienst staat van de verruiming van een andere, complementaire opvatting van vrijheid. Hierbij wordt aangesloten bij de twee opvattingen van vrijheid die Isaiah Berlin onderscheidde. Bij wijze van voorbeeld wordt de in oktober 2017 aangekondigde kilometerheffing eerst panoptisch geduid, om vervolgens te bespreken hoe de vrijheid van de burger juist dankzij het panoptisme evenwichtig geborgd blijft.","['panopticum', 'panopticon', 'vrijheid', 'liberty', 'kilometerheffing', 'vehicle miles traveled tax', 'Jeremy Bentham', 'Michel Foucault', 'Isaiah Berlin']"
Translations of Political Speeches Into English and Polish,"Prokop, Piotr","['Jeffery, Jill']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The analysis of translation poses a number of challenges, ranging from establishing what constitutes ‘good’ translation to assessing how felicitous a particular phrase is in a given context. When this context is politics, and the translations analysed are political speeches, there are even more factors to be considered. This paper analyses political speeches made in English or Polish as well as their written translations in the other language. The data gathered for the purpose of this paper is a set of six texts, three speeches and their translations. This paper uses a multi-layered model of discourse analysis to investigate a number of specific categories related to the layers of knowledge, agents and the text itself. The paper finds that one of the speeches was created with the explicit aim to be translated into English, while the other two are mainly focused on the audience that speaks the language of the source text. Overall, the results of this paper suggest that comparing the linguistic aspects of a speech and its translation can reveal potentially useful characteristic such as the intended target audience, culturally-significant items or names whose full meaning is particularly difficult to render in another language. The implications of this paper indicate that a similar analysis performed on a much larger scale could provide findings that are more generalisable.","['translation', 'rhetoric', 'political argumentation', 'discourse linguistics']"

This thesis presents an overview of the key historical events and figures of the respective time periods in which the novels are set. The Dead Zone is set during the 1970s and 11/22/63 is set during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Both time periode are represented negatively. The Dead Zone explores the feeling of distrust that the American citizens experienced after Richard Nixon’s Watergate Scandal and the Vietnam War. 11/22/63 shows the flipside to JFK’s hopeful image and the optimistic 1960s. Ultimately, I will show that despite the negative representation of America in the 1960s and 1970s, there is hope for the characters in these novels which enables them to survive and to find peace. The Dead Zone and 11/22/63 contain a hopeful message which is represented through education and love. This hopeful message does not only represent hope for the characters of the novel, but also for the readers of these historical novels, who can find guidance in working through historical events such as the Vietnam War, 11/22/63 and the Watergate Scandal.","['Stephen King', 'The Dead Zone', '11/22/63', 'Historical novel']"

Van Willen tot Denken: Een filosofische beschouwing van de relatie tussen wil en rede in de filosofie van Arthur Schopenhauer,"Kuyper, Simon","['Riessen, Renée van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek is erop ingericht een beter begrip van een belangrijk onderdeel van Arthur Schopenhauers filosofie te scheppen, en daarmee van diens filosofie als geheel. In zijn grootste werk, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung legt Schopenhauer de lezer een systematische filosofie voor waarin de wereld wordt beschreven als een samenstelling van de wil en van voorstellingen. Dit tweede aspect is de wereld van onze alledaagse waarneming, welke zich voegt naar regels ontleend aan ons redelijke denkvermogen. Ten grondslag aan deze wereld ligt de wil, een non-rationele drijfveer die alles stuurt wat we waarnemen. Waar de nadruk bij voorgangers van Schopenhauer, waaronder Kant, altijd lag bij de wereld begrepen door het redelijk intellect, verplaatst Schopenhauer het zwaartepunt naar de irrationele wil. Als een van de eersten die dit doet, wordt Schopenhauer daarom dikwijls ontvangen als radicale tegenhanger van het ratio-centrische verlichtingsdenken dat hem voorging. Wanneer we Schopenhauers werk echter onder de loep nemen, blijkt dit beeld minder goed te kloppen dan op het eerste oog zichtbaar. Aan de hand van analyse van verschillende van Schopenhauers belangrijkste werken, alsmede een kleine selectie secundaire literatuur, wordt in dit onderzoek beargumenteerd hoe we Schopenhauers positie in de geschiedenis van de filosofie moeten duiden, indien niet langer als een radicale ‘omdenker’ van verlichtingsdenken. Het lijkt er namelijk op dat Schopenhauer in zijn denken in belangrijke mate schatplichtig is aan de Verlichting. De wil verschijnt in zijn filosofie weliswaar als belangrijk begrip, de verhouding tussen wil en rede in zijn werk ligt anders dan hij zelf doet vermoeden.","['Wil', 'Rede', 'Rationaliteit', 'Schopenhauer', 'Verlichting']"

Metalinguistic Awareness and Attitudes of Young Iranians towards Taarof,"Luenen, Anne Fleur van","['Terkourafi, Marina']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Iranian practice of Taarof has been defined as “the active, ritualized realization of differential perceptions of superiority and inferiority in interaction” (Beeman, 1968:56-57). So far, linguistic research on taarof has presented it as a homogenous cultural practice (Koutlaki, 2002; Miller et al., 2014), however, Izadi (2015) shows that the same use of taarof might be evaluated differently by different people. This suggests that the use of taarof may not be so homogenous as it has been presented before. People who over-use taarof are classified as ‘taarofi’ (Izadi, 2016:21), a term that is generally used to indicate that somebody uses taarof, but can now also be used with a negative connotation. Beeman (1986:57) mentioned how young Iranians complain about taarof, although they do not feel they can change this cultural practice, and Izadi (2016) writes that people who use taarof to a lesser extent are evaluated more positively in a professional context. Nanbakhsh (2011:187-188) demonstrated how the use of honorifics by young and middle-aged people has changed. Although he linked the use of honorifics to taarof, it is of course not possible to generalize his findings to other forms of taarof, beyond honorifics. Based on these observations, the aim is to take his research one step further, by researching the attitudes of young people (18-37 years old) towards taarof, first exploratively by means of interviews, followed by questionnaires.","['Politeness', 'Intercultural Communication', 'Taarof', 'Iran', 'Sociolinguistics']"

"The Interlingual Translation of Trauma Theory: The Effects of Stylistic Translation Choices in the Dutch Translation of ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close""","Hirdes, Janine","['Zeven, K.L.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Trauma resists integration into the memory and is therefore difficult to communicate. In trauma literature, authors represent this difficulty to communicate trauma with the help of several stylistic devices, such as run-on sentences, unclear references, and deviant punctuation. These stylistic devices allow the readers to experience the trauma as if it was happening to them. Since the communication of trauma is already problematic in itself, the interlingual translation of trauma literature is even more challenging. Translation universals suggest that deviant stylistic choices in the source text (ST), i.e. the stylistic devices used to portray trauma in trauma literature, are often normalized in the target text (TT). In this thesis, I examined how interlingual translation affects trauma narratives and whether the stylistic choices associated with trauma are retained in translation. I answered these questions with the help of a case study on ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close."" In order to examine the different stylistic devices used to portray trauma, and in order to find out what happens to them in translation, I conducted a comparative reading of the chapter “WHY I'M NOT WHERE YOU ARE 9/11/03” and its translation “WAAROM IK NIET BEN WAAR JIJ BENT 11-9-03.” I categorized my findings with the help of translation universals, during which I found evidence of a missing universal. Furthermore, I found that the translation choice with the biggest consequences is the splitting up of run-on sentences. By taking a closer look at some of the longest run-on sentences in the chapter and perhaps even the book, namely the run-on sentences consisting of more than a hundred words, I discovered that more than half of these sentences were split up. As a result, the intended effect of the run-on sentences on the reader is also not transferred, and therefore elements of trauma are lost in translation.","['trauma theory', 'run-on sentences', 'stylistic effects', 'interlingual translation', 'translation universals']"

EU policy makers have strengethened the mandates of Frontex and the EU Naval Force Mediterranean by coupling border operations with disrupting smuggling and trafficking networks, implementing a UN-imposed arms embargo on Libya, and fighting terrorism in Libya. My findings that EU militarized border control operations pursue European security and law-enforcement interests in the Mediterranean Region provides useful insights into the EU’s emerging migration governance regimes.","['militarization', 'humanitarianism', 'frontex', 'Operation Sophia', 'border control', 'EU migration', 'border security', 'European Neighbourhood Policy']"

An Acoustic Analysis of Generational Change of the Open-Mid Front Rounded Vowel [œ] in Finland-Swedish,"Strandberg, Janine","['Smakman, Dick']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This apparent-time study examines generational phonetic change in the Finland-Swedish community, occurring as a result of increased contact with the Finnish majority language. Finland-Swedish is a variety of Swedish that is spoken as a first language by approximately 300,000 people in Finland, while also retaining a status as an official national language alongside Finnish (Hult & Pietikäinen 2014: 4). In the past Finnish and Swedish were largely spoken in different regions and culturally distinct communities. However, lately the Finnish society has become more linguistically mixed, causing the Finnish language to have a larger impact on the lives and language of Finland-Swedish speakers. Using acoustic analysis of formants, the study explores whether Finland-Swedish vowel production in young highly proficient bilingual speakers is undergoing change due to influence from Finnish. The project focuses on the Swedish open-mid front rounded vowel [œ], a more open allophone of [ø] that only occurs before /r/ (Riad 2014: 38; Leinonen 2011: 78). Sample tokens for [ø] and [œ] in different phonological contexts were collected through recordings of photo-elicited interviews from several consecutive generations of bilingual Finland-Swedish speakers. Measuring the first and second formants of the samples, the study examines the phonological differences between the older and younger generations of speakers. The measurements showed that while older-generation late bilingual speakers produced distinct formant values for both allophones, younger native and early bilingual speakers demonstrated more variation in their abilities to differentiate between the allophones in production. Additionally, a survey investigating the perception of [œ] and [ø] in Finland-Swedish suggested that native bilingual Finnish and Finland-Swedish participants were less accurate in matching allophones to target words than monolingual Finland-Swedish participants. The results of both the acoustic analysis and the survey suggest that input from Finnish may affect the perception and production of allophones [œ] and [ø] in the spoken Swedish of native and early bilingual Finland-Swedish speakers.","['sociolinguistics', 'linguistics', 'phonetics', 'Swedish', 'Finland-Swedish', 'linguistic variation', 'bilingualism', 'minority languages', 'apparent-time study', 'generational change']"

The exhibition aimed at representing the multiplicity of Chinese cuisine in the States, as well as the discussions regarding the definition of authenticity in cuisine and more generally culture. The thesis interprets food first as a frame to identity, an example of Derriderean parergon: food both shapes and is shaped by cultural identity. Statements by chefs and home cooks who were interviewed for the exhibition are analysed in order to support this perspective. In a second moment, the thesis considers the materiality of food as the element which enables the visitor to establish, through synaesthesia, an empathic connection with the stories narrated in the museum.

FROM PRACTICE TO THEORY: Military Ideas on Civilian Morale in Germany and the United Kingdom after the First World War 1919-1939,"Gent, Gijs van","['Dassen, Patrick', 'Brocades Zaalberg, Thijs']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the conceptualisation of ‘civilian morale’ as a military idea in Germany and the United Kingdom between 1919 and 1939, arguing that the First World War played a major in morale’s emergence within military theory. Adopting a hybrid approach to total war theory, the thesis employs the ideal-types of total mobilisation, total control, total aims, and total methods for its basic structure, but also looks at morale in relation to war as it was understood by contemporaries in a its historical context. Using the ideas of two prominent theorists: Erich Ludendorff and Basil Liddell Hart, this study concludes that morale was conceptualised as a new determinant factor in future warfare. It shows that the key lesson of the Great War had been that nation formed the core of any military effort, and whoever could successfully mobilise the nation possessed the greatest strength. Morale served as the variable that determined the success of this mobilising process. Controlling home front morale was thus essential for avoiding your own military collapse, but the theorised ways for achieving this differed between Liddell Hart and Ludendorff, which this thesis attributes to a dichotomy between Liddell Hart’s liberalist views as compared to Ludendorff’s totalitarian views. This divide also informed morale’s conceptualisation as a war target, with Ludendorff viewing the enemy’s morale as one of the elements that needed to be completely annihilated, with Liddell Hart conceptualising it as means for limiting war; the collapse of morale hastening the end of a war. Finally, this thesis examines two major technological innovations to come from the First World War: poison-gas and the airplane, and tracks how their role was theorised for use against morale as a war aim, underwriting civilian morale’s emergence as a concept of modern warfare.","['morale', 'interbellum', 'Germany', 'United Kingdom', 'military history', 'intellectual history']"
Millennials and politics.What is the connection between new social movements and youth’s political engagement?,"Chambinaud, Camille","['Choi, Nankyung']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Inspired by social movements emerging across the globe such as the Occupy Movement in the United States, this master thesis investigates the influence they have on youth political socialization. Keeping in mind the context of western democracies and the privileged easy access to digital media and social networks, this dissertation investigates the effects of the different aspects of new social movements on youth and to what extend this can influence their participation in the political life. The literature review will go over the following topics composing the theoretical framework of this work: the civil society and public participation in western democracies on a broad level, social movement theory, the role of new social media and digital platforms in politics, and finally an overview of the literature on youth’s political participation. In order to investigate the incentives pushing younger demographics to engage in social movements such as the ones previously listed, this thesis will ask the following research question: how technology-enabled youth engage in new social movements? In attempt to answer this question, I argue that (1) new social movements are mainly structured and organized through digital platforms, using social networks to mobilize more people, and (2) young citizens in western democracies use the internet and digital platforms as an information tool and feel disconnected from the traditional political actors. This thesis will be simply structures: the first chapter will consist of an introduction of the issue addressed here. The second chapter will encompass the literature review, going over the existing literature on the framework mentioned before and the limitations it presents. The third chapter will analyse the effects of civic engagement on youth and will be followed by a case study on Occupy Wall Street, examining the role of youth and technology in that movement. The last chapter will consist of the conclusion.","['social movements', 'youth', 'political socialisation', 'occupy wall street']"

Moreover, a new research technique, called prompted self-monitoring, was used to tap into children’s knowledge of phonetic standards with respect to various onset consonant cluster types. Comparisons were made between children’s onset cluster realizations before and after a non-specific prompt for self-repair (i.e. hm?) to examine whether children would improve toward the adult-model and reveal more knowledge of adult-like phonetic standards in the prompted repetition than in their initial, spontaneous repetition. The results indeed revealed improvements, showing a hidden potential, but also deteriorations and no changes. Attempts were made to explain these changes and no changes in relation to the speech mechanism of the young, developing speaker.","['Consonant cluster acquisition', 'Onset consonant clusters', 'Self-monitoring', 'Prompted self-monitoring', 'Word production mechanism', 'Word production development', 'Phonetic standards']"
To What Extend Has Sectarianism Increased During the Yemeni Civil War?,"Greenwell, Elliott","['Schonmann, Noa']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Internecine conflicts have been going on in the Republic of Yemen almost from the moment that the republic was established in 1990. However, what distinguishes the most recent bouts of fighting from past clashes is the way religion has been brought into the fray. Antigovernment Houthis have stated that they are defending their unique Zaydi version of Islam against Wahhabi/Salafi subversion. Those leading the pro-government faction increasingly portray the conflict as part of the larger struggle against Iranian/Shia infringement of Sunni areas. Constructivist theories of international relations can go some way in helping to understand these recent developments. The definition of an “identity” – whether in terms of religion, ethnicity or culture – serves as a rallying point for a collective body that perceives itself as being under some kind of threat. Hence, as the Saudi military coalition encroached into Houthi-controlled areas in the west and north of Yemen, the Houthis promoted their distinct ethno-religious identity to help mount resistance. In addition, the Houthis focused on their Shia identity to gain support from Iran, the traditional defender of Shia Muslims, as well as from the international community, which generally condemns ethnic or religious discrimination. As for the opposing side in the Yemeni government, explaining the conflict in terms of not only Iranian but also Shia expansionism (the two generally being seen as synonymous) helps to secure continued Saudi support. This paper evaluates how this kind of political sectarianism is framed by Yemeni leaders and spokespeople of the two sides in their public comments – largely speeches, interviews and official statements. At the same time, it takes a broader perspective and applies the same kind of analysis to the stories published by key regional news outlets. By putting this frame analysis into a simple “then vs now” comparison, this paper seeks to determine whether sectarianism has in some way grown worse over the last five years. It is the contention of this paper that, although there is an endemic sectarian element to the Yemen conflict, this is largely exaggerated by observers who claim that it is its main driver. The apparent increase in the religiosity among the opposing parties can be traced to the presence of foreign sponsors, who have a vested interest in portraying the conflict as part of something that transcends base power politics.","['Yemen', 'Sectarianism', 'Framing']"
