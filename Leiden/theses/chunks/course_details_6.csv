How can we measure fatigue objectively? The relationship between fatigue and tapping speed as measured by smarthphone,"Chondronasiou, Angeliki","['Band, G.P.H']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"We can often feel mentally or physically tired, leading to a decrease in our performance, even of simple tasks. People are not always aware of this tired feeling, or they ignore it, which can lead to errors or a decrease in their quality of life. Thus, it would be beneficial to be able to detect fatigue rapidly and accurately, using objective measurements. Objective measurements can include the tapping speed (TS) of an individual as measured by a smartphone. Smartphones create new opportunities for recognizing fatigue and are a non-intrusive way to measure it in real life. In our study, we used the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), one item of which measures fatigue. Our study also used an app installed on participants’ smartphones, called TapCounter, which measured various participant functions while they were using it, with a focus being TS. We aimed to find a relationship between fatigue and TS and to further explore this relationship. We examined whether there was a variation in fatigue throughout the day and whether there was a relationship between the SF-36 and TS of the previous 7 or 28 days. We found a relationship between fatigue and TS. We also found that participants’ TS decreased later in the day, meaning that screen taps were more rapid than earlier in the day. Finally, we were not able to find a relationship between fatigue and specific TS time periods. This study further investigates a new way of measuring fatigue that is inexpensive and that can be tracked daily in participants’ life.",

Until debt do us part: The effect of shame resilience on contact between people in debt and their creditor,"de Graaf, Natalja","['Seip, E. C.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Lack of contact is one of the reasons people in debt cannot receive the help they need to improve their financial situation. Therefore, this study focuses on whether increasing shame resilience for people in debt leads to more willingness to contact their creditor. Literature shows that indebted people experience shame over their situation. This shame causes them to show avoidance behaviour and ignore the creditors that reach out for contact. The Shame Resilience Theory (SRT; Brown, 2006) states that an increased sense of power and a decreased feeling of being trapped can cause someone to become more resilient to shame. Besides, where shame leads to avoidance behaviour, feeling powerful leads to approach behaviour (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Thus, based on SRT we hypothesised that increasing power, decreasing feelings of being trapped, and a combination of the latter, leads to an increase of willingness to contact a creditor compared to the control group. Participants (n = 182) were randomly divided into four conditions: the power, the trapped, the combined, and the control condition. Each condition received a different manipulation. As a result, increasing power increased participants’ willingness to contact. More research is suggested on reducing feeling trapped and its effect on willingness to contact.","['Debt, Contact, Creditor, Shame resilience, Power, Trapped']"
"The Relation between Executive Functioning, Gender, and the Effectiveness of Prediction-based Learning","Elkhoury, Caroline","['Jolles, D.D.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Generative learning strategies (GLSs) are activities that enable learners to develop an understanding that goes beyond the information presented by the instructor, depending on how they try to make sense of the information presented to them. GLSs have become more popular in recent years. Prediction-based learning is one of the most popular and widely used GLSs. Despite its widespread use, much knowledge still needs to be gained about the moderators by which generating a prediction may improve learning. The present study investigated the effects of gender and executive functioning on the effectiveness of prediction-based learning and the underlying mechanisms of prediction-based learning by combining behavioral assessments with neuroactivity measures (fMRI). 62 native Dutch-speaking young adolescents (38 girls), aged 11 to 13 years old, performed a numerical trivia fact learning task, measuring the test performances of generating predictions, following direct instructions, and learning. A questionnaire regarding executive functioning, critical thinking, and curiosity was also administered. Results indicate that making predictions shows beneficial outcomes in learning among young adolescents, especially among boys. This is likely due to their different approach to learning compared to that of girls. Among one pilot participant, neural activation of a frontoparietal network and frontal, temporal and occipital regions were observed. There are likely many other (external) factors that could potentially affect the effectiveness of prediction-based learning. Further research is recommended to determine these factors in order the gain more knowledge about the mechanisms by which generating a prediction may improve learning.","['Prediction-based learning', 'Instruction-based learning', 'Gender', 'Executive functioning']"
Are You Sure You Like This Brand? Brand Preference and the Role of the Need for Closure Under Self-Uncertainty,"Kluten, Marvin","['Brizi, A.', 'Molenmaker, W.E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study aimed to understand whether induced self-uncertainty affects the evaluation of international and national brands in favor of the national brand, and if the need for closure moderates this effect. It was predicted that induced self-uncertainty would increase brand preference for national over international brands. Furthermore, it was predicted that this effect of the induced self-uncertainty would be especially true for participants with low NFC and less so for participants with high NFC. In total 141 Dutch participants filled out the online questionnaire. Based on an ANOVA and a moderation analysis it was concluded that neither the condition nor NFC, had a significant effect on brand preference. Lastly, no significant interaction effect was found as well. However, the manipulation check revealed no difference in self-uncertainty between groups. To conclude, NFC did not affect brand preference, and further research is needed to explore the role of self-uncertainty in brand evaluation.","['Self-uncertainty, need for closure (NFC), brand preference, brand evaluation, national brands, international brands']"
"“Yes, And…” or “Yes, But…”: Listening With the Intent to Understand or With the Intent to React. A study about different listening styles and perceived power differences on the amount of shared information, feeling of being understood and social attractiveness.","de Wal, Jamie",['Harinck; S.'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: In many fields, active listening is considered an influential communication skill. While there has been an increasing amount of literature on active listening, there is little or hardly any evidence of research about argumentative listening. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of active listening and argumentative listening to each other, in two different power settings: high power and low power, to see what difference these conditions make in the amount of shared information, feeling understood and social attractiveness. Design: 120 participants were randomly assigned to a 2x2 design. After writing down a story about a conflict, the participant engaged in a 5-minute conversation with a confederate. The power condition roles were manipulated and the confederate listened actively or argumentatively. Results: People share more information, feel more understood and evaluate the other person as more socially attractive when the listener is listening actively, compared to argumentatively. The power manipulation was not successful so no conclusions can be drawn in relation to perceived power differences. An explorative analysis suggested that with a stronger power manipulation there could be a difference in power settings and feeling understood, where in an argumentative listening setting, a person in high power could feel more understood than a person in low power. Conclusion: People do not only respond to an overall level of responsiveness of a listener, but the way someone is responding also matters. This study showed that we should listen to understand, not to reply.","['Active listening', 'argumentative listening', 'perceived power settings', 'information sharing', 'feeling understood', 'social attractiveness']"

Sociale cognitie bij kinderen: Een onderzoek naar het gebruik van Virtual Reality als meetinstrument vergeleken met een traditionele test.,"Malkoc, Altijana",['Nina Krupljanin'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Over the years various tests have been developed for measuring social cognition in children. The aim of this research was to measure social cognition by using a traditional test as well as a new developed Virtual Reality test, in order to determine if children benefit from the use of Virtual Reality. Both tests are based on a subversion of the Social Cognitive Skills Test and the total scores of the tests are compared with each other. A sample of 60 children, between 9 and 12 years old, took part in this research in which they completed both tests. Results showed that there were no significant differences in test results for the overall score of social cognition. Further analyses of the results showed that 10 year old children perform better dan 9 year old children, but the results for children above the age of 10 are not significantly different. The difference between boys and girls has also been investigated. The results showed no significant differences for boys and girls on both tests. For future research it is recommended to create a Virtual Reality environment in which children are included and can participate. That way it would be more likely that children can benefit from the use of Virtual Reality for testing social cognition.","['Social Cognition, Virtual Reality']"

The influence of voice opportunity and voice expectations on wind turbine project acceptance of local residents: De invloed van inspraak en inspraak verwachtingen op de acceptatie van windturbineprojecten door omwonenden,"Wildenburg, Wouter",['Emma ter Mors'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Wind turbines are an effective source of energy for climate change mitigation. The placement of windmills is often challenged by residents in the local area. In a previous study, it was found that given to local residents about the implementation of windmills in the local area could be an important factor in local wind turbine project acceptance, and that this relationship was mediated by perceived procedural fairness and trust in the wind turbine company. The focus of this experimental scenario study (N=679) is to replicate and build on this previous study. In the current study, participants were asked to empathize with the residents of a fictional town, where a wind farm would be located. Depending on the experimental group, voice expectations were manipulated by randomly assigning to three manipulation groups where they were told that it was common, uncommon that they would be given voice by the company and another group where no voice expectations were manipulated. Participants then either received an opportunity to voice their opinion or received no voice opportunity. In this study it was predicted and found that receiving voice compared to no voice would increase wind turbine project acceptance. It was also predicted and found that this relationship was sequentially mediated by perceived procedural fairness via perceived trust. And lastly, it was predicted that voice expectation served as a mediator between voice opportunity and acceptance. Both of these findings replicated previous research. No significant interaction effect of voice opportunity and voice expectations was found.","['Voice', 'expectations', 'acceptance', 'trust', 'procedural fairness', 'wind energy']"
Moral Conviction and its Effect on Secondhand Clothing Consumption,"Bijl, Marijn",['Coen Wirtz'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"There is some indication that moral conviction relates to pro-environmental behavior, but it is not clear if moral conviction about fast fashion relates to secondhand clothing consumption. The present study (N = 254) addresses the factors past green behavior and guilt when not acting green involved in the relationship between moral conviction and its effects on previous secondhand clothing consumption and the intention to buy secondhand clothing. An online survey was conducted to collect data from a total of 254 respondents from Germany and The Netherlands to test the influence these factors have on the relationship. Results showed that moral conviction about fast fashion was positively related to past and future secondhand clothing consumption. However, past green behavior did not affect these relations. As expected, guilt when not acting green mediated the relationship between moral conviction and intention of buying secondhand clothing. However, it did not mediate the actual behavior. This study adds to the current literature by giving a deeper insight in the factors behind secondhand clothing consumption, which can indirectly help reduce the global warming. This is important to look into, to get an understanding of how we can enhance the consumption of secondhand clothing to reduce carbon emissions and save resources like water and energy.","['moral conviction, secondhand clothing consumption, past green behavior, guilt, sustainable intention']"

China in Africa: Exploring power relations of Chinese Multinational Corporations in African countries,"Sorkale, Eva",['Ruben Reus'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"China is growing as an international competitor with its gaze directed toward Africa. Chinese state-owned Multinational Corporations (MNCs) gradually gaining a foothold in African countries raise worries for other investors like the West. The impacts of Chinese MNCs on the international capitalist market are researched in debt but I will connect this to the study of power relations. Not only will this give insights into the local employees as active subjects that are engaged in various relationships of power, but it will also highlight how macro and micro-level actors mutually influence each other. Eventually, I will argue that these power relations are unequal and used by actors to preserve relations of power. Central to this thesis is a discussion of power as a dynamic and socially constructed relationship that can be used to preserve structures of power. This approach toward power follows Foucault in his understanding and goes against the idea of power as a possession. Power relations become visible in Chinese Multinational Corporations (MNCs) expanding overseas to Africa which has implications for actors at both the micro and the macro-level. Power relations visualize that all actors are involved in processes of legitimizing themselves and through this process produce and reproduce power relations.","['Power relations', 'MNCs', 'China', 'Madagascar', 'Neoliberalism', 'International Development']"
'Gewoon wat het kind nodig heeft',"Pardieck, Nena",['E. Denessen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Summary This exploratory qualitative study researched ten teachers’ practice and views on adapting education to student needs in primary education. Over the years the education has changed from a teacher-centered perspective to a more student-centered perspective. Education needs to be inclusive by adapting to the diverse needs of students. Education that takes students’ needs into practice leads to higher motivation and higher student outcomes. However, it remains unclear how teachers define student needs and use these to form student-centered education by adapting education to the needs of students. To gain more insight this study was conducted to examine the three following research questions: how do teachers define student needs? What data do teachers collect to describe student needs? How do teachers adapt education to student needs? The research questions were examined by conducting semi-structured interviews with ten teachers from a diverse range of primary schools in the Netherlands. Interviews were transcribed and coded based on existing literature. Codes were analyzed in two ways, cross-case and within-case. Results demonstrate teachers define student needs as ‘things the student needs’, teachers diagnose student needs through observation of student behavior and schoolwork, lastly teachers adapt education by convergent differentiation where the same learning goals apply to all students. Based on these results three main conclusions are found. Firstly, teachers lack a clear and explicit definition of student needs. Secondly, teachers describe student needs from their own perspective derived from personal interpretations of the conducted observations. Thirdly, teachers adapt education to student needs based on the belief of convergent differentiation. Finally, limitations and implications for further research as well as advice for the practice are discussed.","['onderwijsbehoefte', 'passend onderwijs', 'adaptief onderwijs', 'leerkrachten', 'basisonderwijs']"
The relationship between psychiatric family history of mood disorders and symptom severity in patients with bipolar disorder,"Gatersleben, Lisa","['Koenders, M.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Bipolar disorder is a complex mood disorder, which is often underrecognized or diagnosed with a substantial delay. Therefore, it is important to determine factors that might predict the symptomatology of bipolar disorder. Research suggests that the psychiatric family history of bipolar disorder patients may be a potential predictor. The current study investigates whether (the degree of) psychiatric family history of mood disorders has an effect on the symptom severity of bipolar disorder patients. Methods: The present cross-sectional study included 69 bipolar disorder patients. Patients with first- and second-degree family members, patients with only first-degree family members, and patients without family members with mood disorders were compared on symptom severity. Symptom severity was measured in terms of age of onset, number of previous episodes, suicidality and daily functioning. Results: The results indicated that (the degree of) psychiatric family history of mood disorders did not have an effect on symptom severity in terms of age of onset, number of previous episodes, suicidality and daily functioning. Conclusion: The outcomes of this study suggest that the relationship between the psychiatric family history of mood disorders and the symptom severity of bipolar disorder patients might be mediated or moderated by other factors, such as the degree of substance abuse or the type of mood disorder. Further research is necessary in order to create more insight in these potentially influential factors, which may facilitate the identification of bipolar disorder patients’ clinical profile.","['bipolar disorder', 'psychiatric family history of mood disorders', 'symptom severity', 'age of onset', 'previous episodes', 'suicidality', 'daily functioning']"

Improving the Measurement of Anxiety-Linked Attentional Bias - A Pilot Study Investigating the Bias for Novel Stimuli,"Schlenker, Anna","['Putman, P.L.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Attentional biases seem to perpetuate social anxiety by locking focus onto threat-related information. The classical dot-probe task has been the golden standard of measuring selective attention based on variations in reaction times (RT) due to bottom-up saliency. In recent decades, concerns have grown over this task's reliability, partly due to statistical concerns over its indexing method and because it fails to account for top-down behavioral strategies that circumvent bottom-up attentional capture. This pilot study tested the novel Parallel Target Attention Task (PATAT) assessing attentional biases towards novel stimuli, as it aims to overcome these shortcomings. The task measured participant’s responses to two target stimuli presented in proximity to a familiar and a novel stimulus. An attentional bias was then calculated as a straightforward sum of participant responses to novel stimuli. By contrasting images of faces and natural scenes, we examined whether a bias for novelty is category specific. Last but not least, we investigated whether people who display higher levels of Behavioral Inhibition (BI), pay more attention to novel stimuli. The task was able to measure an attention bias toward novelty in the majority of participants but fell short on replicating a category-dependent bias. Also, contrary to our hypothesis that novel stimuli elicit more bottom-up attentional capture in such participants, data showed the opposite trend, consistent with the observation that such individuals generally avoid novel experiences. Theoretical and methodological implications of the results are discussed.","['attentional bias', 'dot-probe task', 'novelty', 'behavioral inhibition', 'social anxiety', 'pilot study']"

Exploring the mediating role of trust and satisfaction between clinician-expressed empathy and information recall in advanced cancer care.,"Hoogenboom, Sterre","['Van Vliet, L.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous studies have found a relation between clinician-expressed empathy and patients’ information recall in bad news consultations. The question that rises is: What are the underlying mechanisms that determine this relationship? In this study we aimed to i) determine if there is a relationship between clinician-expressed empathy and recall of provided information (total recall, recall of core information and recall of additional information) and to ii) determine whether the relationship between empathy and recall is mediated by changes in trust and satisfaction. This study was part of a larger project. The general study had an experimental video vignette design, of a consultation between a breast cancer patient in the advanced stage of the disease and an oncologist. The level of affective communication in these videos was manipulated and the amount of recall was assessed using a questionnaire. The participants of this study were asked to watch and assess the video while identifying with the video-patient. They acted as analogue patients (APs). The group of participants consists of Dutch speaking cancer patients treated with both curable and incurable intent, survivors of cancer and healthy women. The questionnaire has questions that assess core information recall and additional information recall. A mediation analysis was performed to investigate the mediating role of trust and satisfaction on the relationship between empathy and recall. Our findings have shown a negative effect of empathy on total recall and core recall, unless the patients trust the clinician. The patients that trust the clinician more will recall more total and core information. The patients that are more satisfied by the consultation will recall more core information.",
Strategic over Automatic: trait Attentional Control in relation to trait Anxiety and Attentional Bias to different levels of Threat: Evidence for a reduction in both anxiety and attentional bias towards mild threat.,"Lenferink, Doron",['Dr. P.L.J. Putman'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Anxious individuals tend to be easily distracted by potential threats and maintain their focus on these threats rather than attending to other, possibly more important, things in the environment and this so called attentional bias towards threat may play an important role in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Evidence exists both for automatic bottom-up and strategic top-down information processes underlying attentional bias, with trait attentional control as an important moderating factor between trait anxiety and attentional bias towards mild threat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between trait anxiety, trait attentional control and attentional bias towards different levels of threat. Methods: Fifty-eight healthy University students participated in a cross-sectional experimental design. The current study used data of self-reported trait anxiety, self-reported trait attentional control and attentional bias scores to both mild and high threat using a newly developed emotional dual probe task. Results: Results showed no significant relationships between trait anxiety and attentional bias towards different levels of threat. However, a significant relationship has been established between both trait attentional control and trait anxiety and between trait attentional control and attentional bias towards mild threat. A moderating effect of trait attentional control on trait anxiety´s relation with attentional bias could not be confirmed. Conclusion: This study confirmed that individuals with low cognitive control are more vulnerable to mildly threatening information, and that higher levels of cognitive control are associated with lower anxiety levels.","['attentional bias, trait anxiety, trait attentional control, cognitive control']"
The Role of Healthcare Provider Characteristics in their Opinions on Placebo Applications in Pediatric Healthcare,"Moorsel, Julie van","['Middendorp, H. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"An effective way to reduce negative experiences such as stress, anxiety, and pain in hospitalized children is by implementing placebo applications. A placebo application is a procedure without active elements that can elicit a positive treatment outcome. Despite its beneficial outcomes placebo applications are not frequently used in pediatric healthcare. Gaining insights in the opinions of healthcare providers on placebo applications will help to understand why placebo applications are not used frequently and offer suggestions to optimize usage. The aim of this cross-sectional observational study was to investigate whether the healthcare provider characteristics optimism, anxiety, and knowledge on placebos were associated with their opinions on the effectiveness, acceptability, and utilization of placebo applications. A differentiation is made between treatment-enhancing (e.g. music, Virtual Reality, comfort talk) and treatment-replacing (e.g. open treatment without active elements) placebo applications. Through an online questionnaire, data was collected from 121 healthcare providers (106 female, 15 male). Being more optimistic was negatively correlated with being less anxious (r = -0.43, p < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed that having more knowledge was associated with finding placebos applications more effective (β = 0.23, p = 0.012) and acceptable (β = 0.29, p = 0.001), but not with a higher utilization of placebo applications (p = 0.096). No significant associations were found of the amount of optimism and anxiety of healthcare providers with the opinions and use of placebo applications. Treatment-enhancing placebos applications were considered significantly more effective, acceptable, and utilized more often than treatment-replacing placebos (p-values < 0.001). The results of this study imply that more knowledge of placebos is associated with more positive opinions on placebo applications. The positive opinions and higher use of treatment-enhancing placebo applications indicate that implementing these in pediatric care is within reach. In this study, the reluctance to use placebos in pediatric care can be explained by the common assumption that placebo applications always replace the treatment, not knowing about the treatment-enhancing placebos that can be useful and ethically sound. It is recommended to offer education on treatment-enhancing and open treatment-replacing applications to examine if this increases use in pediatric care.",

However, some people suffer more long-term consequences compared to others, even within the same family. Which factors play a role in the differential experiences following childhood parental death, even between siblings, who experienced the same objective life event? Objective: In the current study, we aimed to investigate the association between childhood parental death and adult attachment, and the role of parental bonding with each parent in this association. We also investigated this in a sibling-context, where we studied parental bonding as a family-wide and an individual factor. Design: 819 participants, aged between 25 and 45 years old, took part in this cross-sectional between-subject study. Questionnaires were administered to obtain information about parental bonding and adult attachment. The study included two parts, where in the first part the hypotheses were investigated in the main sample (i.e., a sample of nonrelated individuals), an in the second part in the sibling sample (i.e., a sample of sibling dyads and triads). Results: Both avoidant and anxiety attachment were more present in the target group compared to the control group in the main sample, but not in the sibling sample. Stronger maternal and paternal bonding were related to less insecure attachment in adulthood in the control group of the main sample, but no associations between bonding with the surviving and deceased parent were found the target group of the main sample. Stronger family-wide and individual maternal bonding were related to less avoidance attachment in the control group of the sibling sample, but not to anxiety attachment. In the target group of the sibling sample, stronger family-wide bonding with the surviving parent was related to less avoidance attachment and stronger family-wide bonding with the deceased parent was related to less anxiety attachment. Conclusion: Childhood parental death appears to be related to more insecure attachment in adulthood. The role of parental bonding seems to be different depending upon whether childhood parental death has been experienced. Within siblings, both familywide parental bonding and individual specific bonding seem to have individual effects on adult attachment, suggesting that including individual and family-wide experiences might shed light upon more complex processes of bonding and attachment formation within families. However, further research is needed to replicate these findings before conclusions can be drawn.","['Childhood parental death', 'attachment', 'parental bonding', 'within-family design', 'multilevel modelling']"

The role of surprise and plausibility in prediction-based learning,"Vel Tromp, Myrthe","['Jolles, D.D.', 'Nieuwenhuis, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"When learning new information, generating a prediction before receiving the information strongly improves the amount of learning. To this date, the mechanisms underlying why generating predictions increases learning are poorly understood. One potential factor that influences this effect is surprise: more surprising information has been demonstrated to deepen information processing when the information differs from our expectations, which occurs when we cannot explain the new information through our belief systems. However, too much surprise may be adverse to learning, as the information may be flagged as implausible and consequently be rejected from our belief network (Munnich & Ranney, 2019). In this study, we investigated the influence of surprise and plausibility on a numerical fact-learning task using three different kinds of learning outcomes: recall, recognition, and memory updating. Using multilevel modelling, we found a nonlinear influence of surprise on immediate recall, as well as a linear influence of surprise on the updating of beliefs. We did not find a significant association between surprise and delayed recognition, nor any significant effects of plausibility on the three measures of learning, although there appeared to be a trend effect of plausibility on the updating of beliefs. Future research should further investigate when newly presented information gets rejected from belief systems, and the role that implausibility of information plays in this phenomenon.","['surprise, plausibility, learning, numerical facts']"

De visie van pedagogisch medewerkers van kinderopvangorganisatie Kibeo op genderneutraal opvoeden,"Bax, Aleid","['Groeneveld, M. G.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Genderneutraal opvoeden komt steeds meer voor in onze maatschappij. In dit onderzoek is bekeken wat er in de literatuur bekend is over genderneutraal opvoeden. Daarnaast is onderzocht wat de visie van de pedagogisch medewerkers van kinderopvangorganisatie Kibeo over genderneutraal opvoeden is. Uit het literatuuronderzoek bleek dat de kinderopvang invloed heeft op de ontwikkeling van kinderen. De eerste levensjaren van een kind vormen een belangrijke basis voor de ontwikkeling, zo ook voor de ontwikkeling van genderidentiteit. Het is gebleken dat pedagogisch medewerkers van invloed zijn op de (gender)ontwikkeling van een kind. Het zou dus mogelijk kunnen zijn dat de invloed van de kinderopvang eveneens van invloed is op de ontwikkeling van genderidentiteit. Naast dit literatuuronderzoek is een kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd. Dit is gedaan door interviews uit te voeren naar de visie van pedagogisch medewerkers. Deze respondenten hebben zich aangemeld via een oproep die is gedaan door een beleidsmedewerker van Kibeo namens de onderzoekers. De respondenten waren vrouwelijke pedagogisch medewerkers die op de groepen werkten met kinderen van nul tot vier jaar oud. Er zijn tien semigestructureerde diepte-interviews afgenomen, die gehouden zijn aan de hand van een vooraf geschreven topic guide. Dit werd gebruikt als rode draad in de interviews, maar hier werd van afgeweken als het interview daarom vroeg. Na het transcriberen van de interviews zijn deze in het computerprogramma Atlas.ti gecodeerd. De belangrijkste codes die aan tekstfragmenten zijn gekoppeld, zijn codes voor de visies van de pedagogisch medewerkers, de gender contrastereotyperende opmerkingen die werden gedaan en de sturing van de respondenten. Na het coderen zijn de interviews aan de hand van deze codes geanalyseerd. Uit de analyse bleek dat het grootste deel van de pedagogisch medewerkers een positieve houding heeft ten opzichte van genderneutraal opvoeden. Door het merendeel van de medewerkers werd het geaccepteerd als er door kinderen met elk soort speelgoed gespeeld werd, ongeacht hun gender. Een belangrijke overeenkomst hierin was de autonomie van het kind. Er waren ook twee negatieve meningen ten opzichte van genderneutraal opvoeden, waarin werd aangegeven dat er een grens zat aan genderneutraal opvoeden en waarin werd afgevraagd of het wel mogelijk zou zijn. Ook door deze medewerkers werd echter het spelen met verschillende soorten speelgoed ongeacht gender geaccepteerd. Naast tekstfragmenten over de visie van de pedagogisch medewerkers over genderneutraal opvoeden zijn er tekstfragmenten bekeken over de sturing van de pedagogisch medewerkers en de omgang met de ouders van de kinderen. Hieruit is gebleken dat de meeste respondenten kinderen aansporen om met allerlei soorten speelgoed te spelen en dat dit vaak in het belang is van de ontwikkeling van de kinderen. Zo laten de respondenten zien dat ze inderdaad voor het belang en de autonomie van het kind kiezen. Aan de omgang met de ouders kan worden gezien dat een deel van de pedagogisch medewerkers de wensen van de ouders voorop stelt en een deel de autonomie van het kind. Door dit onderzoek is er een begin van een algemene visie van de pedagogisch medewerkers van Kibeo in kaart gebracht, maar dit is nog niet bruikbaar voor een beleid voor genderneutraal opvoeden binnen de kinderopvangorganisatie Kibeo. Het advies is om voor dit eventuele beleid in gesprek te gaan met de pedagogisch medewerkers en om nog meer onderzoek te doen naar genderneutraal opvoeden.","['genderneutraal opvoeden', 'kinderopvang', 'pedagogisch medewerkers']"
De rol van genderidentiteit in zelfwaardering en middelengebruik in de adolescentie,"Mansvelt, Romy","['Pol, L. van der']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In this study, the role of gender identity in self-esteem and substance use was examined. It was also studied whether the adolescents’ sex functioned as a moderator. The goal of this study was to give more insights on the role of gender identity, considering that previous research mainly focused on adolescents from the LGBTQIA+ community and not on all adolescents, regardless their sexual preference. Adolscents at the age of 17 (N = 100) filled out quesstionaires to research this topic. Gender identity was measured with the Multi-dimensional Gender Identity Measure and consisted of three different aspects, namely gender typicality (the extent to which someone’s interests and behaviors align with the ones of peers from their gender group), gender contentedness (the extent to which some is content with his or her gender identity) and felt pressure (regarding their gender identity, mainly from their parents). Self-esteem was measured with the Self-Perception Profile for Children – Global self-worth subscale and substance use was measured with five questions regarding the frequency to which they used different substances. Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the effects of gender identity on the dependent factors self-esteem and substance use. The analyses showed that the aspect gender typicality was positively and significantly related to self- esteem and alcohol use. No moderating effects for gender were found for the relation between gender identity and the outcome variables. The current study showed that the aspect gender typicality of gender identity plays an important role in the degree of self-esteem and amount of alcohol use among adolescents. It is important to focus on how to decrease the impact of gender typicality and to increase the normalization and acceptation of diversity regarding adolescents’ gender identity.","['gender identity', 'adolescents', 'self-esteem', 'substance use']"
The Placebo Response Among People with Intellectual Disabilities and Borderline Intellectual Functioning,"Ende, Shir van den","['Gast, D.A.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this study was to investigate the placebo component in people with intellectual disability (ID) showing aggressive behavior. To assess a potential short-term and long-term placebo response in people with ID, participants with an IQ level lower than 85 were included in the analysis. The Social Dysfunction and Aggression Scale (SDAS) and the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) were used. This study was a prospective longitudinal design and a secondary analysis of a randomized study on dietary supplements among people with ID, called the PSYVB study. Our total sample size consisted of 113 participants, with 74 male (65.6%) and 39 female (34.5%) participants. The mean IQ score of participants was 48.56 (SD = 20.7), and the mean age was 22.8 years (SD = 7.2). Our first finding was that a short-term placebo response of 10 days in people with ID was not observed during the run-in time with a rate ratio (i.e. Exp(B)) of .99 (95% CI: .94-1.04; p = .652). However, a long-term placebo response of 16 weeks among people with ID was observed during the trial phase, Z = -3.69, p < .001. No difference was found based on the extent of the placebo response between a low and high IQ (Z = -.92, p = .358) or young and old patients (Z = -1.48, p = .139). However, we could not draw meaningful conclusions due to several limitations. Our data suggests that further study is needed to firmly establish the magnitude of the placebo response among people with ID.",

Seksueel misbruik bij ouders en delinquent gedrag van hun kinderen: Een onderzoek naar opvoedstress en sociale steun als mechanismen in een mogelijk verband tussen ouderlijk seksueel jeugdtrauma en delinquent gedrag van hun kinderen,"Garssen, Eva","['Alink, L. R. A.', 'De Haan, W. D.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In the last decades, a body of research has explored effects of parental childhood sexual abuse (CSA) on child outcomes such as internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Until now, little research has focused on juvenile delinquency as an outcome variable. Therefore, the current study examined associations between parental CSA history and delinquent behavior as reported by their children. Direct and indirect effects of parenting stress, and moderating effects of parental perceived social support were examined in relation to this hypothesized pathway. The data originated from a Dutch longitudinal self-report cohort-study of families reported at a domestic violence bureau. In total, the sample consisted of 191 parents: 164 mothers (85,9%) and 27 fathers (14,1%), and 191 children. The children’s gender was nearly evenly distributed with 47,1% girls (N = 90) and 52,9% boys (N = 101) whom had a mean age of 14,2 years (SD = 1,71). 28,3% of parents (N = 54) reported CSA histories. Various questionnaires (ACE; ISRD; NOSI; MANSA) examined 1) parental CSA, 2) juvenile delinquency 3) parenting stress and 4) parental perceived social support. Analyzations were conducted using a model for moderated mediation. Results from this model showed no evidence for associations between parental CSA, parenting stress, and juvenile delinquency. Moreover, no evidence for moderated mediation was found. Thus, parenting stress did not function as a mediator between parental CSA and juvenile delinquency, and effects of parental CSA on juvenile delinquency via parenting stress did not differ depending on levels of perceived social support. Although the present study cannot shed light on mechanisms that might influence juvenile delinquency in families where a parent has suffered CSA, this is one of the first studies which aimed to investigate this hypothetical pathway. Future research is necessary to gain more insight in the complex mechanisms that might influence juvenile delinquency.","['childhood sexual abuse, juvenile delinquency, parenting stress, social support']"

The current study had two goals: 1) to investigate the reciprocal relationship of phonological awareness (PA) and vocabulary; 2) to profile children who develop vocabulary slower than their peers (low achievers). Participants were 81 kindergarteners from six different groups (Mage = 5.26 years, SD = 0.62). Pre-tests were administered for story-based vocabulary, general vocabulary, PA and executive functioning (EF) and observations were performed for children’s active participation in class. The intervention consisted of a control condition and three conditions in which digital storybooks were read to the children. During all conditions teachers read storybooks of which the prints and an animated version were shown on digiboards. In condition A storybooks were read in a non-dialogic manner; in condition B dialogic reading and semantic consolidation of target words were added; and in condition C phonological consolidation was added to dialogic reading with semantic consolidation. After each condition, story-based vocabulary was post tested. A within-subjects design was implemented, meaning that all participants took part in each condition. Low achievers were selected after condition A and during condition B and C they received individual differentiation. Results indicated that ePrent&ABC effectively improved vocabulary compared to pre-tests, especially during condition B. The story-based vocabulary of low achievers improved significantly after individual differentiation; afterwards, their results were not significantly different from their peers’. A better developed PA influenced the growth in vocabulary. Reversed, there appeared to be no effect of vocabulary on PA, indicating that explicit instruction may be necessary for developing PA. Lastly, a model with predictors EF and active participation, significantly predicted growth in story-based vocabulary. Separately, both EF and participation were non-significant predictors. Schools are recommended to incorporate ePrent&ABC into their curriculum.","['digitale prentenboeken', 'woordenschat', 'fonologisch bewustzijn', 'boekgebonden woordenschat', 'differentiatie', 'executieve functies', 'actieve betrokkenheid']"
"The impact of Covid-19 pandemic-related adversity on the mental health of people with depressive, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders: a longitudinal study in Dutch case-control cohorts","Maran, Patricia","['van Houdt, C']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Since the Novel Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) was declared a pandemic, concerns regarding the Covid-19 pandemic impact on mental health of people with pre-existing mental health disorders have grown. Previous research has shown that symptoms of depression and anxiety were generally stable, or even decreased, among individuals with pre-existing mental health disorders; however, individual differences in exposure to Covid-19 pandemic-related adversity were not taken into account. Therefore, the present study aimed to quantify individual, cumulative exposure to Covid-19 pandemic-related adversity across the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and relate this to changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms and loneliness. Furthermore, we examined whether the effect of Covid-19 pandemic-related adversity on these outcomes differed between individuals with differing chronicity of mental health disorders observed before the pandemic. Methods: Between April 2020 and July 2021, fifteen successive online questionnaires were distributed among the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association Study cohorts. A measure that expresses cumulative exposure to Covid-19 pandemic-related adversity across the 15 measurements waves was derived. Linear mixed linear model analyses were used to answer the research questions. Results: Higher levels of cumulative exposure to Covid-19 pandemic-related adversity related to higher levels in depressive and anxiety symptoms, and loneliness. However, we found no statistically significant differences in the effect of cumulative exposure to Covid-19 pandemic-related adversity on depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as loneliness between chronicity groups. Conclusions: Cumulative exposure to Covid-19 pandemic-related adversity clearly related to higher depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as loneliness. However, it was not possible to detect a clear dose-response relationship. In other words, we found no clear evidence that the effect of Covid-19 pandemic-related adversity was more detrimental to mental health for people with pre-existing mental health disorders.","['Covid-19, pandemic-related stressors, mental health, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder']"
"Facial emotion recognition, vocal emotion recognition and affective empathy in children at risk for criminal behaviour","Gerwen, Sara van","['Swaab, H.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Developmental Psychopathology in Education and Child Studies (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Affective empathy and emotion recognition deficits are hypothesized to underlie impaired social interaction in children exhibiting antisocial behaviour. However, few studies have examined the possible emotion recognition deficits and affective empathy. This study compared facial affect recognition, vocal emotion recognition and affective empathy of children at risk for criminal behaviour to that of normally developing children. It was expected that children at risk of criminal behaviour had impaired emotion recognition and affective empathy, and that emotion recognition deficits and affective empathy were partially related to each other. The high-risk children were recruited through and intervention project connected to several municipalities in the Netherlands, focusing on the underage siblings or children of delinquents and those exhibiting antisocial and disruptive behaviour according to teachers. Facial and vocal recognition of happy, sad, angry and fearful emotions were respectively measured with the Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) test and the Prosody test of the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT). Affective empathy was assessed by recording heart rate (HR) while showing video clips with neutral and emotional content (happiness, fear, pain and sadness). It was found that the high-risk group were less able to recognize fear and sadness in still-faces, and had an overall lower percentage corrected when recognizing emotions from voices, compared to healthy controls. The high-risk group also showed reduced HR to pain and fear, but this was not related to emotion recognition deficits. These findings suggest that children that engage in antisocial behaviour have impaired emotion recognition and reduced affective empathy, but that lack of empathy cannot solely be explained by a less ability to recognize emotions.","['facial', 'emotion', 'recognition', 'vocal', 'affective', 'empathy', 'risk', 'children', 'criminal', 'behaviour']"
The Mediating Role of Self-esteem in the Relationship between Parental Support and Deliberate Self-Harm in Adolescents,"Folkers, Renske","['Wilde, E.J. de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Parents are thought to play an important role in the onset and maintenance of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in adolescents. This study aimed to examine the possible mediating influence of self-esteem on the relationship between perceived parental support and adolescent DSH, correcting for the effects of age, gender, traumatic life events, and substance use. A cross-sectional self-report questionnaire was used to collect data from Dutch high school students between the age of 14 and 18 (Age M = 15.26 years; SD = .74) from various regions throughout the Netherlands. Of the 4,171 adolescents whose data were analyzed, 552 indicated having engaged in DSH in the past. Results showed a direct effect of parental support on DSH occurrence, as well as an indirect effect via self-esteem. Therefore, the results of this study suggest the relationship between parental support and DSH to be partly mediated via self-esteem. These results support the idea that parents play an important role in adolescent DSH and suggest the importance of involving parents when implementing prevention interventions for adolescent DSH.","['Deliberate Self-harm', 'Parental Support', 'Self-esteem', 'Adolescence', 'Mediation']"

In muscle this protein contributes to membrane integrity. It is also found in the brain, but its function there is unclear. Patients with DMD experience a number of cognitive and behavioral problems, and MRI studies have shown reduced gray matter and total brain volume. The current study aimed to assess whether these MRI findings are progressive and whether neural correlates of psychological problems in DMD are similar to those in healthy controls. Previously-acquired pediatric data was combined with newly-acquired data from adult DMD patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Subjects underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan and a neuropsychological evaluation. Linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of age and DMD on the ratio of gray matter to cerebrospinal fluid volume (GMV:CSFV) and total brain volume corrected for intracranial volume (TBV:ICV). An independent-samples t-test and a voxel-based morphometry analysis were used to compare gray matter volume in patients with psychological problems to patients without such problems, to identify global or local gray matter reductions in patients with psychological problems. Patients with DMD had reduced GMV:CSFV and TBV:ICV compared to healthy controls (b=-0.43, p<0.001; b=-0.02, p<0.001 respectively). Both GMV:CSFV and TBV:ICV linearly decreased in both groups (b=-0.09, p<0.001; b=-0.003, p<0.001 respectively), but this was not different between-groups (p>0.05). No global (p>0.05) or localized gray matter volume reductions were found in patients with DMD with psychological problems compared to patients without such problems. In both patients and healthy controls gray matter was displaced by cerebrospinal fluid over time, suggesting this process is not a pathological mechanism in DMD. Patients with DMD did have a lower GMV:CSFV and TBV:ICV ratio, suggesting this is a diseased mechanism. No global or local GM reductions were found in patients with DMD with psychological problems compared to patients without such problems.","['Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'DMD', 'brain', 'cognition', 'longitudinal']"

Information processing speed in multiple sclerosis is associated with higher disability level,"Bronsveld, Eefje","['Hulst, H.E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Information processing speed (IPS) impairment is a disabling cognitive symptom often present in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). IPS is the foundation of higher order cognitive processes, and therefore IPS dysfunction significantly lowers quality of live. Early identification of PwMS at risk for IPS decline is necessary in order to provide timely cognitive rehabilitation and psychoeducation. As such, identifying who will or will not develop IPS impairment over time is important. Here, we investigated retrospectively which characteristics were associated with IPS impairment in a real-life sample of 218 PwMS (158 female; age M=47±12.7; baseline disease duration M=9.8±9.9) that visited the Noorderhart Rehabilitation and MS Centre in Overpelt (Belgium). IPS decline was determined based on performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), with two threshold settings: (1) minus 1.5 standard deviation, and (2) minus eight points decline of raw score. Next to SDMT scores, demographic information was collected (sex, age, educational level) as well as MS-specific characteristics (disease severity [measured with the EDSS], disease duration, MS subtype), and psychological measures (fatigue [FSMC], depression and anxiety [HADS]). The analyses at baseline showed that EDSS score (impaired median=4 [2.5-6]; preserved median=2 [1.1-3.5]; d=0.9), disease duration (impaired M=11±10.8; preserved M=7±7.6; ƞ2=0.04), MS subtype (V=0.26), and perceived fatigue (impaired M=68.2±18.5; preserved M=53.5±20.8; d=0.75) were significantly higher/ progressive for IPS impaired PwMS (N=134) compared to preserved (N=84). Measured over time (average of three years), nine PwMS (N=50) were found to decline from preserved IPS functioning into impairment, independent of threshold setting for impairment. However, for both thresholds no longitudinal differences between IPS impaired and preserved PwMS were found. Our results demonstrate that IPS impairment is very prevalent in PwMS (61% at baseline) and is associated with higher levels of disability (more progressive subtype, longer disease duration, higher disease severity) and more fatigue. Worsening of these factors indicate the need to pay extra attention to IPS functioning. Secondly, IPS impairment does not develop quickly, with only a few PwMS (9/50) who decline into IPS impairment in a three-year period. It is recommended to start early with regular measurements of cognitive functioning to detect initial IPS changes.","['multiple sclerosis', 'information processing speed', 'cognitive impairment', 'level of disability', 'fatigue']"
Non-compliance in an Ecological Momentary Assessment Study on Students` Mental Health.,"Essen, Joël","['Proppert, R.K.K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a data collection method in which participants’ current behaviors and experiences are sampled repeatedly in their natural environment. EMA has advantages over retrospective research methods, in that it reduces retrospective bias, increases ecological validity, and offers the possibility to observe dynamical changes of variables. However, EMA protocols are burdensome for participants and may interfere with their daily activities. This can lead to non-compliance over the course of a study. Missing data can subsequently decrease statistical power, and even induce bias. This paper explored whether missing data can be predicted by various variables related to students’ primary motivation to participate, mental health, stress levels, and demographics. We analyzed data of the first cohort (N = 418) of the ongoing WARN- D project on student mental health. Participants completed a comprehensive baseline survey and took part in an 85-day long EMA study. We predicted overall rates of non- compliance by participant characteristics at baseline (Analysis 1) and weekly rates of non- compliance by time-varying factors during the EMA stage (Analysis 2). Analysis 1 showed that overall non-compliance can be predicted by baseline measures such as age, depression, substance use, and primary motivation to participate. Analysis 2 showed that weekly assessed time-varying measures like time into study, enjoyment of the study, weekly stress, anxiety, and depression may predict weekly rates of non-compliance. Participant’s sex and smartphone operating system were not related to overall non-compliance. Summarizing, non-compliance rates of participants can be predicted by participant characteristics at baseline as well as by time-varying predictors. Our findings may inform future research on potential mechanisms behind noncompliance in EMA designs that should be considered to maximize participation rates while avoiding biased conclusions.","['Ecological Momentary Assessment', 'EMA', 'Missing Data', 'Non-Compliance', 'Compliance', 'Longitudinal Research', 'Mental Health', 'Depression', 'Compliance in EMA']"
The role of cue type and musical background on auditory-motor synchronization: A dual task finger-tapping study,"Hassell, Allyah","['Mudarris, M.A.A.', 'Schaefer, R.S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Auditory-motor synchronization has been widely studied and applied in different settings, including rehabilitation as a means of cueing movement with sound. However, minimal emphasis has been put on how distinct cue types, task conditions, and individual differences in musical background influence the cued movement. To determine the extent these factors influence performance, a total of 43 healthy young-adults were recruited in a within-subjects design and were asked to tap along with their index finger to ~30 second music or metronome excerpts of 120 BPM in a single and dual tasking condition (with a working memory task). The results indicate that there is a significant difference between single and dual-task performance in music (Mdiff = 3.06, SE = 0.71, p < .001, 95% CI [1.01, 5.02]) and metronome (Mdiff = 3.99, SE = 1.18, p = .01, 95% CI [0.72, 7.26]) cues. No significant differences were found between cue types on dual-task cost, a relative measure of performance loss while dual-tasking (Z = -0.52, p = .60, r = -.08, 95% CI [-20.82, 10.64]). Finally, an average/intermediate level of musical background (measured with the Goldsmith Musical Sophistication Index) was not found to be an influencing factor on performance (F(2.14,87.57) = 1.26, p = .29, ηp2 = .03). These findings suggest that auditory-motor synchronization, once thought to be a more automatic process, is impacted while dual-tasking, indicating that cued movement performance declines when attention capacity is limited. This may have implications for movement cueing in clinical settings, where cognitive capacity is often reduced. Furthermore, the interference experienced while dual-tasking was not influenced by cue type, which may imply that music and metronome can be utilized interchangeably in similar study designs. Musical background was not found to influence performance, nonetheless, more studies are needed to measure the influence of more extreme musical abilities seeing as most participants in this study had an average level of musical skills.",
Differentiatie in Wereldoriëntatie: Wat is volgens experts zaakvakniveau en hoe kan dit vastgesteld worden?,"Laan, Akke van der","['Prast, E.J.', 'Denessen, E.J.P.G.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"A teacher's responsibility is to respond to the differences between students, also known as 'differentiation'. An important part of differentiation is progress monitoring: establishing, monitoring, and analyzing achievement level. However, currently progress monitoring does not properly take place for humanities and STEM-education in Dutch primary schools, which may result in education that is not optimal for every student. However, progress monitoring seems difficult to shape in these courses for several reasons. Firstly, it is unclear what ‘achievement level’ means in these subjects. Secondly, it is unclear how knowledge and skills should be established and analyzed. This research aims to make an inventory of what, according to experts, are knowledge and skills that determine achievement level in primary humanities and STEM and how these can then be established, monitored, and analyzed. In addition, we examined whether the cycle of differentiation of Prast et al. (2015) is considered applicable to primary humanities and STEM education. This was investigated through a qualitative study. Mapping the views of experts was done using a method that incorporates aspects of both the Delphi method and focus groups. The sample was 23 participants with expertise in differentiation or general didactics of primary humanities and/or STEM. The research indicates that the cycle of Prast et al. (2015) is applicable as, for example, a thinking model for developing methods. However, that it would be too cyclical or complex to be used in practice by teachers. It appears that the required knowledge is subject-dependent. For skills, a clear development path is noticeable, but here too the specific content depends on the subject. This research shows different ways to establish the achievement level in primary humanities and STEM. The research offers insight into the difficulties of conceptualizing and establishing achievement level and provides prompts for further research and practical implications.","['Zaakvakken', 'Differentiatie', 'Basisonderwijs', 'Wereldoriëntatie']"
Less is more! Sequential procedures for psychological data,"Speelman, Job","['Heyman, T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Psychological science has been plagued by a history of studies with low statistical power. The common solution for this issue has been to increase the sample sizes of studies but this also increases time and money spent. Another solution that has been mostly ignored by the scientific community is the use of sequential procedures for statistical analysis. Sequential procedures allow the researcher to analyse the data multiple times as new participants are recruited. So, several analyses are done until the null hypothesis is either accepted or rejected. In practice, this might lead to efficiency gains in the form of smaller sample sizes. The statistical properties of sequential procedures have been found to be adequate based on simulation studies. However, there is a lack of information about the efficiency gains and consistency of these procedures with actual psychological data. The current study aims to evaluate the efficiency and consistency of the group sequential (GS) procedure and the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) with real data. Efficiency is the reduction in sample sizes while consistency refers to (in)congruence between the decision based on the sequential procedure and the conventional procedure. We re-analysed an existing multi-lab registered replication report (RRR) namely the study by Verschuere et al. (2018) using the GS procedure and SPRT procedure. Using these procedures, efficiency gains ranging from 27% to 62% were found. The GS procedure outperformed the SPRT in terms of efficiency. In the labs that showed efficiency gains, the decision regarding the null hypothesis was the same compared to the decision based on the conventional procedure. Taken together, the sequential procedures yielded the same overall conclusion as Verschuere et al., but at a considerably smaller sample size. This shows the potential of these procedures for psychological science as a whole.","['Sequential testing', 'group sequential design', 'sequential probability ratio test', 'replication']"

Preliminary evidence for multisensory integration of visual and auditory sexual stimuli in attentional processes,"Zorn, Tabea Marie",['Julia van den Berg'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In real life, sexually relevant events are registered by more than one sensory modality. It is hypothesized that our brain integrates these different modalities into one multisensory percept through a process called multisensory integration (MSI). However, in research, stimulation is typically unisensory. This represents a significant gap in our knowledge of sexual stimulation processing because MSI can have behavioral effects beyond the mere addition of another type of sensory information. Specifically, products of MSI are more salient and would be expected to attract more attention than unisensory stimuli. Our experimental study attempted to model the salience of congruent sexual stimuli through MSI by simultaneously presenting sexual visual and task-irrelevant sexual auditory stimuli and by testing attention to them in a visual attentional blink task. Participants (N=55) were heterosexual male students (mean age 23.0 ± 3.1 years). We found that visual sexual stimuli produced an attentional blink, showing that visual sexual stimuli captured participants’ attention and that, consequently, a second stimulus was often not correctly identified. In contrast, task-irrelevant auditory sexual stimuli did not produce an attentional blink effect. When a task-irrelevant auditory sexual stimulus and visual sexual stimulus were presented simultaneously, an attentional blink indicated that, through MSI, the stimuli had gained more salience. However, the attentional blink occurred later than expected. Our findings show that congruent cross-modal sexual stimulation affected the attentional blink. This gives an initial insight into the MSI process that might occur when two stimuli that signal the same sexual event are registered simultaneously.","['multisensory integration, attentional blink, cross-modal, sexual stimulation, salience']"

The moderating effect of emotion regulation strategies on the association between childhood maltreatment and severity of substance use,"Geveke, Willem","['Jong de, K']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Childhood maltreatment (CM) is a worldwide problem that affects millions of lives. CM has been associated with severity of substance use (SSU) as an important determinant. However, whether the association between CM and SSU is influenced by emotion regulation strategies has not been researched. The current study examined whether the relationship between CM and SSU is moderated by two emotion regulation strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression). In a cross-sectional design, 86 dual diagnosis (DD) patients completed self-report questionnaires about experiences of childhood maltreatment, substance use and emotion regulations strategies. Bivariate correlation analysis revealed no significant results. Furthermore, the moderation analysis revealed no significant results. This could indicate that other factors played a role in this complex relationship in a DD patients group or that variables should be measured in different ways. The DD patient group is a group that is often undertreated. For this reason, it is important to study this patient group and the possible effects of emotion regulation strategies on this relationship so treatment can be improved.",

Nevertheless, too much stress can lead to negative outcomes, but – according to recent studies – moderate stress can also elicit prosocial behavior. Empathy is a core element in prosocial behavior. The current experimental study was designed to investigate the relation between acute social stress, daily hassles and emotional empathy. Healthy female students (N = 75) between the ages of 18 and 25 were recruited to participate in the current study with a between subject design. Participants were randomly assigned to a psychosocial laboratory stressor (Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)) or a well-matched control condition (Placebo-TSST). Prior to the TSST or Placebo-TSST participants completed a daily hassles questionnaire. Afterwards they participated in an empathy test measuring emotional empathy (behavioral mimicry task). The current findings provide no evidence for enhanced or decreased emotional empathy in women after being exposed to acute psychosocial stress and no evidence for moderation by daily hassles. Further research is needed to fully understand the relation between stress and empathy.",['#dagelijkse #stress #affectieve #empathie']
Visual-motor integration of children born as critically ill neonates,"Nguyen, Annie","['Schuitema, I', 'Rietman, A']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Aim: To explore the association between ball skills and the visual and motor domains in children (ages 9 to 18), that were born with a congenital anomaly or needed neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after birth. Congenital anomalies in the current study were mainly Esophagus Atresia (EA) and Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH). Methods: The current study has a cross-sectional observational design consisting of 30 patients (children who were critically ill as neonates) and 25 age-matched healthy controls. Outcome measures of the neuropsychological and motor abilities were reported in standard deviations or Z-scores. The neuropsychological assessment (NPA) consisted of IQ (WASI), visual perception (MPVT-4), visuomotor function (Beery-VMI-6), and executive motor control (ANT). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the performance of both groups on the NPA and the M-ABC. The Kruskal- Wallis was performed to find differences in ball skills between the patients (EA, CDH or neonatal- ECMO). A principal component analysis was performed to explore the relationship between the outcome measures. Results: Overall intelligence fell within the normal range for both the patient and control group. Controls were significantly better at keeping their balance than patients. Difficulties with visuospatial and visuomotor tasks can arise as the patients get older. The performance of both groups on ball skills were not associated with their performance on the NPA. No differences in ball skills was found between the groups. Also, no differences in ball skills were found between the patients (EA, CDH or ECMO). Conclusions: This study did not identify visual, motor, and visuomotor skills to be associated with performance in ball skills. A possible explanation for this could be the ratio between EA, CDH and ECMO. Therefore, a larger sample of the different diagnosis is suggested for future research, or perhaps examined separately instead of combining.","['ball skills', 'visual-motor integration', 'neonates']"

Understanding citizens’ voice and acceptance of wind farm projects: the mediating role of perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer,"Karsemeijer, Gemma","['Ter Mors, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Climate change is a growing problem and sustainable energy sources are necessary in order to reduce CO2 emissions. Wind energy is a common source of sustainable energy in the UK, but acceptance of wind farm projects varies, which can lead to delay or cancellation of a project. Previous research found support for the hypothesis that acceptance of a wind farm project is higher when participants receive voice (compared to no voice), and that this relationship is mediated by perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer. The current study aimed to replicate and extend these results. It also tested whether expectations of voice opportunity moderate this relationship. Participants were told to imagine that they were a resident of Presford, where a company named UniWind was planning to build a wind park. We then systematically varied expectations (expectations manipulation: expecting voice vs. not expecting voice vs. control group) and whether or not participants received voice (voice manipulation: genuine voice vs. no voice). The study was an experimental scenario study with a 3 x 2 between-subjects design (n = 450; UK citizens). As predicted and replicating previous results, we found a significant main effect of voice opportunity on project acceptance, and this relationship was mediated by perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer. However, against what was predicted, no significant moderating effect of expectations was found. Implications and directions for future research were discussed, and the results illustrate the importance of a voice opportunity in the acceptance of wind farm projects. Several suggestions for future research were made.","['voice procedure', 'citizen participation', 'perceived procedural fairness', 'trust', 'trust in the project developer', 'project acceptance', 'voice expectations', 'wind park', 'wind turbines', 'wind park projects', 'energy transition', 'renewable energy']"

French military interventions in Africa in the 21st century: the influence of status considerations,"Maisonny, Léopold","['Haigh, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the independence of its former colonies in the 1960s, France has launched more than 50 military interventions in Africa. When President Hollande took office in 2012, he promised to break with this military interventionism and reduce the French military presence on the African continent. A year later, French troops were deployed in Mali and the Central African Republic. What explains this dramatic turnaround? This paper intends to shed light on the drivers behind France’s military interventionism in Africa in the 21st century. Drawing on presidential speeches and a strategic document, it demonstrates that status considerations significantly influenced President Hollande’s decisions to launch military interventions in Africa. More precisely, this military interventionism constitutes a central tenet of France’s grandeur policy, which has formed the bedrock of the French foreign policy since the 1960s. It allows France to maintain its place among the great powers of this world and advance its global and regional geopolitical agenda.",

J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: modern society demands a great deal from the individual and each person's ability to plan and adapt. Cognitive functions, such as intelligence (IQ) and executive functions (EF), are involved in processing and acting on the incoming stimuli. Research question: to what extent does the biological mother's intelligence quotient (IQ), the biological mother's level of executive functioning, and the child's gender predict the executive functioning (divided into inhibition-self-control (IZ), flexibility-emotion control (FE), and metacognition (MC)) of a child at age 2.5 years. Design: the present correlational study uses data originating from a maternal intelligence test (WAIS-IV-NL) and questionnaires (BRIEF-A and BRIEF-P) completed by the mother. The sample consists of 183 mothers and their child. Results: no gender difference at age 2.5 was found in the level of inhibition-self-control, flexibility-emotion control, and metacognition. Maternal IQ and the gender of the child do not predict the child's level of executive functioning in the three domains. In contrast, mother's level of executive functioning emerges as a significant, positive, predictor. The mother's executive functioning also shows the highest explained variance within this study. This means that 8.9% of individual differences in the metacognitive skills of the child can be explained by the level of executive functioning of the biological mother. The same holds for 8.5% in flexibility-emotion control and 4.8% in inhibition-self-control. Conclusion: the results of this study do not confirm that maternal IQ and the gender of the child are predictors for the level of executive functioning of the 2.5-year-old child. This implies that executive functions should receive more attention in preschool development. In addition, the level of executive functioning can be taken into account in diagnostic research as a possible risk factor in the child's development.","['executief functioneren', 'jonge kind', 'voorschoolse ontwikkeling']"

Collateral Damages: How the EU's migration policies facilitated autocratization in Turkey,"Philipps, Annaïk","['Köhler, K']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the EU, the 2015 refugee crisis was met with the securitization of migration. In order to “protect” member states from larger waves of displaced people, several deals with EU neighboring states were concluded. Simultaneously to these migration deals, one could observe a decrease in overall political and civil liberty in a number of EU neighboring states. This paper poses the question: How does migration diplomacy affect autocratization in the EU periphery? In order to investigate this relationship, a qualitative exploratory single case study is conducted. Based on a theory by Levitsky and Way (2006), this paper hypothesizes that migration diplomacy can enhance autocratization for two reasons: (1) it reduces EU democratizing pressure and (2) provides fewer incentives for neighboring states to comply. The selected case to test this hypothesis is Turkey. An analysis of the EU and Turkey during two episodes of autocratization permits to identify substantial behavior changes after the deal. These findings confirm that, in EU periphery states which experience democratic backsliding, migration diplomacy could enhance autocratization.",

Much of the previous scholarship has focused on the structural and institutional causes of the problem, primarily focusing on factors such as immunities, data gathering mechanisms and training programs. The feminist scholarship has also been increasingly vocal on the matter, stressing the importance of gender framing in UN documents and policies. Nevertheless, the feminist theory has continuously resorted to normative studies, lacking any empirical backing to their arguments. This thesis investigates whether a condescending and victimizing way in which women are framed in a series of UN documents can serve as a possible explanation for the continued SEA perpetrated by the UN peacekeepers. A critical discourse analysis of the UN’s zero-tolerance policy, SEA pre-training manual and mission mandates demonstrated that UN’s discourse on gender can be one of the reasons why SEA is continuously committed by the peacekeepers.","['UN Peacekeepers, gender, discourse, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse']"
Can differences in interoception explain emotion recognition impairments associated with alexithymia and autistic traits?,"Fenten, Jan",['Julia Folz'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While a general emotion recognition impairment in autistic individuals has been suggested in the past, more recent findings propose that alexithymia plays a major role in this relationship. Interoception has been theorized to be a factor explaining interindividual differences in emotion recognition and possibly mediating the relationship between alexithymia and emotion recognition. Both alexithymia and autism, have been found to be negatively related to measures of interoception. Therefore, we investigated whether alexithymia, not autism, would be a significant predictor of emotion recognition performance and hypothesized that trait levels of autism and alexithymia would be negatively related to measures of interoception. Additionally, we explored whether interoception mediates the expected negative relationship between trait levels and emotion recognition. A total of 100 participants completed a naturalistic emotion recognition task, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Cambridge Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS), and the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) in an online environment. Our hypotheses regarding the relationship between trait levels and emotion recognition, as well as interoception as a mediator, were not supported. However, in line with our expectations, we did observe a marginally significant effect indicating a negative relationship between interoception and alexithymia. Overall, our findings endorse research that links interoception with alexithymia and hence, provide an indication of why alexithymia, not autism, could be a mechanism in emotion recognition impairments. However, to understand the interplay between all factors more thoroughly, further research is necessary. We discuss how an improved understanding could have important implications for the conceptualization of autism.","['Emotion recognition', 'alexithymia (hypothesis)', 'interoception', 'autism']"
The effect of lifetime musical training on the deterioration of executive functions in the elderly - A longitudinal study,"Wong Chung, Jonathan","['Schaefer, R.S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Many previous studies investigated what the effect of music has on cognition or executive functions (EF). Understanding this relation could prove to be beneficial for many, especially for aging populations or patients suffering from neurological conditions such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Major Neurocognitive Disorder (MND) by developing new treatment strategies. The existing cross-sectional literature largely points in the direction that music is positively associated with cognition and EF. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate the effect of having a history of music training and engaging in music activities on the deterioration of EF in healthy elderly people. Lifetime musical training and current activities were the hypothesized predictors; processing speed and verbal fluency were the outcome measures of EF. Age, sex, and education were included as possible confounders. With a sample of n=1185 participants, several multilevel models were estimated to observe change over a 3-year time span with two measurement points. A subsample of n=423 participants, consisting of participants that are musically active, have had previous training, and have a starting age and recency of music training was analysed subsequently. Results showed that no significant change over time was found in processing speed or verbal fluency that was related to music training and/ or current music activities when controlling for age, sex, and education. This was also the case for the subsample analyses i.e., no change over time was found. Possible explanations for this include attrition, a lack of specificity when inquiring about the extent of the music training that participants received, and a small decline in cognition to begin with. This lack of effects could imply that music simply does not influence the decline of EF in elderly people or that there is too much uncertainty in the current data.",

Past research has shown that people differ in their ability to derive momentary enjoyment from hedonic goal pursuit, a measure which is called trait hedonic capacity (THC) (Bernecker & Becker, 2020). Here, we examined within a mixed-factorial design, whether people who differ in THC differ in the extent to which they enjoy the purchase of a luxury good. Next, we investigated if discounts can reduce rumination for people lower in THC and additionally alleviate intrusive thoughts about luxury consumption. Trait hedonic capacity predicted participants’ negative emotions after the (imagined) purchase of a luxury item. Discount predicted differences in rumination and purchase intention between discount conditions. Results yielded no evidence that discounts have beneficial effects for especially people lower in THC or alleviate intrusive thoughts about luxury consumption. Specifically focusing on people lower in THC, this study provides a better understanding of the effects of discounts on individual hedonic goal pursuit (luxury consumption).","['Trait Hedonic Capacity, Luxury consumption, Discount, Hedonic goal pursuit']"

Data was collected from over 300 participants whose who performed a spatial cognitive task. Their age ranged between 16 years and 85 years old. Previous research suggests an association between high use in navigational aids and lower levels in spatial cognitive abilities.

A comparison of the impact of COVID-19 on younger and older adults with bipolar disorder,"Triebels, Margot",['Manja Koenders'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Vulnerable groups, such as people with a psychiatric disorder appear to be more severely affected by the imposed COVID-19 restricted measures compared to healthy controls. Stressful life events can induce the occurrence of depressive or (hypo)manic episodes in people with bipolar disorder. The objective of the current study is to compare the COVID-19 related concerns in terms of: perceived mental health impact, fear for COVID, positive coping, loneliness and symptom severity in younger adults with bipolar disorder (YABD) and older adults with bipolar disorder (OABD). It is hypothesized that YABD are more vulnerable to the effects of stressful life events, such as COVID-19 pandemic due to less life experience. Methods: The current study is an add-on study to two pre-existing cohort studies; in YABD and OABD. At three time points online self-fill in questionnaires in the first half a year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. Results: Results show no significant differences in the perceived mental health impact and positive coping between YABD and OABD. YABD experienced less fear for COVID-19 over time while for OABD the level of fear remained the same. Prominently, YABD experienced significantly more overall, emotional and social loneliness compared to OABD. The (re)occurrence of (hypo)mania increased significantly during COVID in both groups. Key conclusions: This study confirms that people with a severe mental health problem are more vulnerable for stressful life-events in this case COVID-19. Over time both OABD and YABD are negatively impacted by COVID-19 resulting in worse mania symptom severity, loneliness and less positive coping. YABD experiences more loneliness compared to OABD during COVID-19",

One of these countries is Zimbabwe. In 2008, Zimbabwe appeared to be on the brink of democratic change. This thesis investigates why these democratic changes did not materialize by analyzing the situation through the lens of the elite-driven theory of democratization. Using the qualitative research methods and theory building, this thesis can further develop the elite-driven theory of democratization and simultaneously investigate the puzzle of the Zimbabwean case. of within case theory building, this project develops both the elite-driven theory of democratization and investigates the puzzle of the Zimbabwean case. Conceptually, the project finds that the elite-driven theory lacks concrete empirical indicators and expectations which makes it an incomplete theory to use for investigating real-life cases. With regards to Zimbabwe, this project finds that democratization led by the elite did not occur in 2008 because the theoretical conditions did not materialize themselves as expected. Additionally, the project also finds that democratization is not a rational choice for elites and if they are given any other alternative that can protect their collective wealth and power then they will not encourage democracy.","['Democratization, Autocracy, regime change, Zimbabwe, elites, democracy, elitism.']"

Indicating social cognitive changes in the presymptomatic phase of genetic frontotemporal dementia with the Dutch Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ-NL),"Klop, Willeke","['Houdt, C.A. van', 'Jiskoot, L.C.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a heterogeneous profile. It is a highly heritable disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The three most common mutations are found in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene, progranulin (GRN) gene and hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene. Sensitive outcome measures in early stage genetic FTD are necessary for upcoming disease-modifying therapeutic trials. It is known that social cognition declines in genetic mutation carriers of FTD. The Dutch version of the Social Norms Questionnaire (SNQ-NL) measures the degree to which subjects understand and identify accepted social norms and is able to differentiate FTD patients from healthy controls. The aim of this study was to identify if the SNQ-NL can already indicate social cognitive changes in the presymptomatic phase of FTD. We examined group differences between patients with FTD (n = 34), presymptomatic mutation carriers (n = 55), prodromal mutation carriers (n = 20), and control participants (n = 51) in Total score, Break errors and Overadhere errors of the SNQ-NL, associations with other cognitive functions, and longitudinal data in a subset were further explored. Results showed that the SNQ-NL Total Score and Overadhere errors differed between patients and the other participant groups, but not between presymptomatic or prodromal mutation carriers and control participants. Differences between patients and the other participant groups were also found for the SNQ-NL Direct/indirect ratio. The SNQ-NL Total score and Overadhere scores significantly correlated with cognitive flexibility, theory of mind and confrontation naming. None of the SNQ-NL variables correlated significantly with emotion recognition. No interaction effect is found between groups over time for one of the SNQ-NL variables.

A Study on the Relationship Between Childhood Maltreatment and Inflammation: The Moderating Role of Sex,"Roche Gil, Siobhán","['Tollenaar, M.S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Childhood maltreatment (abuse and neglect) has been associated with high levels of the pro-inflammatory marker interleuken-6 (IL-6), which is a risk factor for developing chronic inflammation and poor health outcomes. How hormonal sex differences affect this relationship remains unclear. Objective: The first aim of this study was to investigate the association between experienced childhood maltreatment and inflammation, measured via salivary levels of IL-6. We then explored if this relationship was moderated by sex differences. Methods: A total of 117 participants (50.4% female, aged 22 to 65 years old) were recruited at Leiden University from a cross-sectional family study. Experienced abused and neglect were measured through self-report questionnaires (Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), and IL-6 was measured through saliva samples gathered. Data was analysed with a moderation analysis, performed with the SPSS PROCESS macro. Results: Results indicate that there was no significant relationship between childhood maltreatment and increased levels of IL-6 in saliva, and sex differences did not moderate the relationship. A significant association was found between general health problems and increased levels of IL-6. Conclusion: No conclusive statements could be made with insignificant results. Further research should focus on differences in sex hormones (testosterone, oestrogen) after experiencing childhood maltreatment, with more distinction between abuse vs. neglect. And future studies should explore the validity of collecting IL-6 in salivary samples over blood.","['childhood maltreatment, sex differences, salivary sample, IL-6 inflammation, moderation']"
The Effect of Spontaneous Eyeblink Rate and Sex Hormones on Performance Monitoring Across the Menstrual Cycle: An Event-Related Potential Study Using the Flanker Paradigm,"Kendell-Rechsteiner, Natalie","['Jansen, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Dopamine (DA) has been found to play a critical role in goal-directed behavior with estrogen, a modulator of dopamine, in particular, influencing cognitive control. However, little is known about the modulatory effects of female sex hormones on performance monitoring, an integral component of goal-pursuit, as measured by the event-related negativity (ERN), across varying hormone concentrations of the menstrual cycle. Dopamine has been found to relate to pre- frontal cortex function by way of an inverted-U curve with deficient or surplus levels resulting in impaired performance. The aim of the present study is to assess if the ERN differs between the early follicular and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle, in response to varying estrogen and progesterone concentrations, and if the direction of this effect is modulated by baseline dopamine as measured by eyeblink rate (an indirect index of dopaminergic functioning). A within-subject, counterbalanced, design was employed to assess EEG data of 41 natural- cycling women using the Flanker paradigm during the early follicular, when estradiol and progesterone are low, and midluteal, when estradiol and progesterone are high, phases of the menstrual cycle. It was hypothesized that baseline dopamine, as indexed by eyeblink rate, in the early follicular phase influenced performance monitoring, as indexed by event-related negativity (ERN), in the luteal phase. The main results analyzing the effect of correctness and menstrual phase on the ERN, using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, was nonsignificant indicating no difference in performance monitoring across varying sex hormones of the menstrual cycle. These findings contribute to a large body of research that report nonsignificant effects of female sex hormones on task-performance.","['error-related negativity', 'Flanker paradigm, performance monitoring', 'menstrual cycle', 'estradiol', 'progesterone', 'female sex hormones']"

Negative Attention Bias and Its Links to Depressive Symptoms in Children and Their Parents,"Guven, Ayse Ekin","['Aktar, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Negative Attention Bias (NAB) is suggested to have evolutionary functions; however, there is evidence that it also plays a role in the onset and maintenance of depression. Previous studies investigating NAB and its links to depression were mainly conducted with clinical and at-risk adolescent and adult samples. Results of previous studies indicated depressed or at-risk individuals present NAB specifically towards depression-congruent stimuli (e.g., sad faces). This study is the first to investigate NAB and its links to depressive symptoms in non-clinical children. Moreover, the link between parental depressive symptoms and NAB in children was also investigated. In line with the previous studies, it was hypothesized children, like adults, will show NAB towards negative over positive emotional stimuli; children who have higher levels of depression will attend longer to sad faces in specific; children whose parents have higher levels of depression will attend longer to sad faces in specific. In a cross-sectional design, 90 8–12-year-old children and 84 parents (44 mothers) were tested. Children and parents’ dwell times to positive (happy) compared to negative (angry, fearful, sad) emotional expressions were measured using an eye-tracking task. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) for children and the Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI) for parents. While only one parent contributed to the eye-tracking task, both parents were asked to fill out the BDI. Results indicated although parents compared to children attended longer to all emotional expressions, both children and their parents attended longer to negative compared to positive emotions. No link between child depressive symptoms or parental depressive symptoms with NAB specific to sad faces was found in children. We conclude that children, like adults, show a negativity bias in their attention to emotional expressions; however, suggested links between child and parent depressive symptoms with NAB may not hold in non-clinical child samples. This study adds to the growing research on emotion-processing and vulnerability to depression in children.","['attention bias, emotion-processing, depression, eye-tracking']"
Neural Correlates of Vicarious Reward Processing when Winning for Parents in Adolescent Boys and Girls,"Dilger, Lara-Sophie",['Prof. Dr. B. Güroğlu'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Vicarious joy is the pleasure you experience when witnessing someone else’s happiness or success. The brain region that is typically associated with reward processes, namely the nucleus accumbens, also responds to positive experiences for others, such as winning for them. However, it has been found that the nucleus accumbens is only active upon winning for close others, such as friends or parents, but not strangers. However, the role of gender in these neural processes has previously not been investigated. In this study, I focused on the role of the gender combination of the parent-child dyad in the neural correlates of vicarious reward processing using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). In the fMRI scanner, adolescents played a reward task where they could win money for either their mothers or fathers. They also reported how close they felt to each parent and how much they liked to win for them. Regardless of their gender, adolescents indicated feeling closer to their mother than to their father; they also reported liking winning for them better. A region-ofinterest analysis of the nucleus accumbens showed that there was no difference in neural activation between same-gender and opposite-gender parent-child dyads. Together, these findings demonstrate that regardless of behavioral gender differences in reports of closeness and liking to win, gender does not relate to the underlying neural responses to vicarious rewards for parents. Taken together, these results indicate that adolescent females and males show similar neural responses in the NAcc upon a vicarious reward task. Future research could aim to observe whether this holds true for other social brain regions as well.","['Vicarious rewards, Nucleus Accumbens, adolescence, parent-child relationships']"

This may be due to poorly understood sex differences in a number of domains, including social cognition. In order to gain more insight into gender differences in ASD, the current study investigates the extent to which autism traits and social cognition are predictors of internalizing problem behavior, taking into account the differences between boys and girls. Internalizing problem behavior of 35 boys and girls between the ages of six and sixteen was measured using the CBCL. The results showed that the degree of autism characteristics, as measured by the SRS-2, is a significant predictor for internalizing problem behavior. However, no significant difference was found between girls and boys. Also, social cognition, as measured by the MFERT, was not a significant predictor of internalizing problem behavior, and no stronger relationship was found for girls compared to boys. The results imply that a higher degree of autism traits and lower social cognition do not pose a greater risk for internalizing problem behavior in girls than in boys. Possible explanations for these results are focused on the current diagnostic criteria. Future research is desirable to gain more insight into whether genderspecific criteria for autism are necessary in the diagnosis of autism. It is therefore recommended that follow-up research be carried out into the representativeness of the female phenotype within the current diagnostic criteria for autism.","['Autismekenmerken', 'sociale cognitie', 'internaliserend probleemgedrag']"

The current study, using an online survey (N = 250), investigates whether moral conviction towards the fast fashion industry is negatively associated with fast fashion purchase behavior and intention, and whether that link is partially mediated by compassion towards the workers in the fast fashion sector. If the association between moral conviction and purchase behavior or intention depends on individuals’ general attitude regarding the fast fashion industry is also explored. Results showed that independent of individuals’ general attitude towards the fast fashion industry, a stronger moral conviction is associated with reduced fast fashion purchase behavior and intention. Compassion did not mediate these relationships. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","['moral conviction', 'purchase behavior', 'purchase intention', 'compassion', 'attitude strength', 'fast fashion']"

Resilience as a Mereological Concept: A Network Perspective on Resilience Factors,"Lipka, Renée",['Ricarda Proppert'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Psychological research has long sought to understand mental disorders from an angle of disease and dysfunction. Despite considerable efforts, this did not sufficiently improve the treatment or prevention of such disorders. Here, we integrate two alternative accounts to the study of mental health: (1) positive psychology approaches aiming to understand what makes people resilient, rather than what makes them ill, and (2) psychological network approaches that conceptualize mental phenomena as systems of interacting components. We examined 11 resilience factors, which have previously been related to resilient responding following adversity, in a sample of students in the Netherlands (N = 450). Using network analysis, we characterized the intricate relationships of resilience factors in a cross-sectional network, and tested whether this network differed between participants exposed to adversity (childhood trauma) and those who were not. Results revealed a network of relatively dense structure, with solely positive relationships. Centrality analyses indicated that self-efficacy was the resilience factor with the highest relative impact within the network. Results of the network comparison showed that the network structure did not differ between participants with and without reported childhood trauma, despite the childhood trauma group reporting significantly lower levels of wellbeing and resilience factors. While it is currently unclear whether cross-sectional networks can provide relevant information for the treatment of individuals, the current work provides a first guess at which resilience factors may be relevant for future research on resilience.","['resilience, resilience factors, network analysis']"
Legitimizing occupations: Is the UN complicit in illegal occupations?,"Brekke, Tiril",['Janina Heaphy'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) may be supporting the violation of the UN Charter and Geneva Conventions constituted by the illegal occupation of Western Sahara by accepting extraterritorial nationally determined contributions (NDC) reports. Through the use of theory-testing process-tracing, this thesis investigates why the UNFCCC’s acceptance of extraterritorial NDC reports might influence the legitimacy of occupations. By conducting a case study of Morocco, the theoretical argument of this thesis is developed: Occupying powers seek legitimacy over their occupation by partaking in international organization processes which subsequently are approved by the international organization. This approval dissuades other states from objecting to the occupation and attempts to legitimate it, thereby perpetuating the status-quo which ultimately increases the external sovereignty of the occupation. By evaluating NDC reports, reports by the Western Sahara Resource Watch, and speeches at the UNFCCC, this study has identified the presence of the causal mechanism. Hence, this thesis contributes to the scholarly literature by addressing the influence that international organizations have on the legitimacy of occupations, a field that so far has gained little attention in academia.","['occupation', 'legitimation', 'UNFCCC', 'Morocco', 'Western Sahara']"
Children's (Not So) Bright Future: Post-Conflict Juvenile Crime as a Consequence of Wartime Child Soldiering,"Gourgeon, Louise","['Haer, R. van der', 'Masullo Jimenez, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite worldwide reports of former child recruits engaging in post-conflict criminal activity, no one has sought to systematically analyze whether this turn of events was a consequence of their child soldiering past. In fact, any attempt to empirically verify this would have to address the lack of theoretical foundations on which to rest. Indeed, theories about adult post-conflict crime cannot help mapping juvenile crime in the same context, as they are bound by age-specific assumptions. This thesis therefore addresses, and contributes to filling, both these empirical and theoretical gaps. I hypothesize that wartime child soldiering increases post-conflict juvenile crime through two complementary mechanisms – the long-term effects of a full socialization into violence and relative economic grievances – and further suggest that both are mediated by gender. Running a negative binomial regression using existing datasets enables me to glean supporting evidence for this hypothesis, as well as preliminary evidence speaking to the socialization mechanism. Yet, overall, the findings remain somewhat inconclusive due to limitations in the data. I thus call for more research – including qualitative work and original data collection – to ground them.","['post-conflict', 'child soldier', 'juvenile crime']"

A constructivist approach to the Trump-NATO conflict: agency and autonomy in NATO’s discursive response to the transatlantic conflicts,"van Ette, Martijn",['Hilde van Meegdenburg'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focusses on the so far neglected role of NATO – the organisation – in the transatlantic conflicts during the Trump administration. Adopting a constructivist approach and conducting a discourse analysis, I identify agency in the discourse of NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s response to the internal frictions with the aim to draw further conclusions on how discourse contributes to the autonomy of international organisations. By doing so, I confront the current dominance in the literature on this subject which has focussed predominantly on the involved states and state power. Correcting for this one-sided misrepresentation, the empirical findings of this thesis suggests that the autonomy of NATO echoed in the Secretary General’s discourse in two ways. One, Stoltenberg was able to create topics, address them and shape its content, indicating that he possessed significant discursive agency. Two, he employed this discursive agency to defend and pursue the interests of the organisation, even at the expense of the interests of NATO’s member states. Consequentially, I argue that these signs of agency were telling echoes of NATO’s autonomy in Stoltenberg’s discursive response to its internal conflicts during the Trump administration.","['constructivist, nato, principal, agent, principal-agent, autonomy, international organisation, Trump']"

"Cities, States, Commons and collective action problems: A study on validifying, or falsifying, the viability of polycentric water governance","Hoch, Yanic",['Dr. Rutger Hagen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"State-centric, collective resource governance in a world of finite resources is an undertaking struggling with opportunistic behaviour and competitive thinking. Rapidly developing climate change makes the ability of collective action on vital resources only more difficult. Although states band together in global organisations to address shared issues such as water shortages the academic literature finds stately led collective action to be inadequate for effective, sustainable resource governance. The suggested solution to the found collective action problems is a change in governance approach, namely polycentrism. This study aims to analyse the viability of polycentric governance in global organisations by applying a comparative content analysis on two global institutions, one based on statal and one on municipal membership. These two organisations will be analysed and compared on their ability to collectively govern water resources and avoid collective action problems, which are categorized in coordination, cooperation and division problems. The comparison bases on the organisation’s membership type, being statal or municipal, the institution’s networking structure and the paradigm used for resources which is found to influence discourse and thus governance. If the global organisation based on municipal membership is able to compensate for the found collective action flaws of the state-membership based organisation and vice versa the case can be made that polycentrism is viable. If not, the realizability of polycentrism can be put into question.",['International water governance']
Empowering Sluts: The Manosphere and Feminism: An Analysis of Contemporary Movement-Countermovement Dynamics,"Giehler, Merle Jael Charlotte",['Dr. Hilde van Meegdenburg'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social movement theory and research in political science has been disproportionately focused on state movement dynamics; only recently have alternative actors such as the countermovement been considered. Yet, most approaches concerning the countermovement-movement synergy still overestimate the role of the state or are limited to its manifestation in protest mobilization. In an increasingly virtualized world with growing transnational movements, however, it is necessary to both think beyond the jurisdiction/role of states and the salience of protest dynamics. Through the example of the feminist and manosphere movement, this thesis argues for an inclusive approach on counter-movement dynamics that considers narrative exchange. Here, the argument is developed that the countermovement generates narrative affronts to the movement that are either met with retaliation or a recuperation by the movement. This is encouraged to be used as a basis for future research on social movements and countermovements.",

Yet, scant attention has been paid to the ways in which covid-19 increased the conflict intensity of pre-existing conflicts. Therefore, this is the gap that this thesis aims to fill. From the disaster-conflict literature, and the covid-19-conflict literature more specifically, I derive three possible causal mechanisms concerning 1) state capacity 2) conflict mitigation, and 3) foreign backers. Consequently, I test these mechanisms with the use of process tracing in the context of the Libyan conflict. The evidence reveals that all three mechanisms were partly present, but did not exactly function as theorized. Indeed, in contrast to the hypothesized causal mechanism, no evidence is found for the suspension of military activities by the state, suggesting that the emergence of covid-19 did not weaken state capacity. Besides, the suspension of conflict mitigating activities and the involvement of foreign backers led to an intensification of violence, despite the continued attention for the conflict during the pandemic. More research, therefore, is necessary to further explore the mechanisms linking pandemics and conflict intensity in pre-existing conflicts.","['COVID-19', 'Libya', 'Armed Conflict']"

This thesis investigates the two forerunners in the Republican Primary and how they utilised different discourses in their bid for The White House. Of particular interest are religious discourses as early commentators discounted Trump’s potential electability among ‘value-voting’ Evangelicals; and populist discourses, as both candidates utilised people’s disaffection with the contemporary system and the discourses surrounding immigrants and other non-American groups to mobilise supporters. To achieve its objectives, this thesis considers twelve speeches by Cruz and Trump that were given during the competitive leg of the 2016 Republican Primary (1st February to the 3rd May). Content and discourse analysis are used, finding that the candidates differed on their use of religious discourse; however, used similar populist discourse. Given the similarity in populist discourses and advantages Cruz had with his religious background the conclusion is drawn that it is not the content that distinguishes Trump, but perhaps his style.","['Trump, Cruz, Populism, Religion, 2016, Primary, Primaries']"

Responsibility to Protect as Epistemic/Expert Authority: a discursive analysis through Global Knowledge Networks,"Veen, David Clemente van der",['Rutger Hagen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"R2P (Responsibility to Protect) is an international norm set up by the international community to set out against mass genocide prevention. It is socially relevant given the Rohingya migration crises calling out R2P to be invoked. However recent media and academic debates have cast doubts on R2P’s application. Regardless of these doubts, R2P advocacy has grown globally with more international research partners and their own research journal. This brings forth the question: how does the organization of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) reflect epistemic/expert authority? This is an explorative thesis that makes use of a single case study of R2P employing qualitative research methods. Academic debate shows R2P as either an extension of unilateral humanitarian intervention or a replacement for it. Proponents argue it as a replacement due to its increasing popularity through its authority. This thesis adds to the authority argument with the use of Global Knowledge Networks which explains whether knowledge production of an organization has expert-legitimacy. Using the transnational discourse community and coalition approach it is shown that R2P’s knowledge production has independent force and power among experts, and simplification and impact towards nonexpert. This gives R2P’s knowledge production expert-legitimacy and therefore establishes R2P’s epistemic/expert authority.","['Responsibility to protect', 'humanitarian intervention', 'epistemic authority', 'Global Knowledge Networks', 'Mass genocide prevention']"
Asylum-Seekers as a European Collective Action Problem - Interplay of Polish Press Media and Parliamentary Discourses,"Sowinska, Joanna",['Dr. Rutger Hagen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"With the arrival of over 800.000 migrants to Europe in 2015 during the ‘migration crisis’, the debate on migration rights shifted its discourse from compassion and solidarity to more negative stances, such as systematic racist behaviors, including demoralization, dehumanization and hate speech against migrants. This thesis aims to delve into the deteriorated image of migrants in the media and determine the consequences of national decision-making at the European level. To do this, this thesis refines existing theories on the relationship between media, the public and policymakers, as these present important academic inconsistencies. By employing a combined approach including the relevance of the political orientation of media outlets and the constraints of collective action problems, this thesis aims to show that media outlets hold similar frames on asylum-seekers and EU asylum cooperation as their political affiliates. With the use of Poland as a case study, this thesis conducts a discourse analysis on Gazeta Wyborcza & Rzeczpospolita Polish press media outlets and parliamentary speeches to uncover frame patterns and the influence media has on a government. This is done by tracing the frames in a chronological manner. Ultimately, this thesis finds that there is a political affiliation between press outlets and politicians, and that the discourse on asylum-seekers significantly impacted asylum-application rejection rates, thus undermining the EU asylum cooperation.","['Asylum-seekers', 'Migration Crisis', 'Mediatization', 'Frames', 'Poland']"
The quest for a recognized home: An analysis of the framing deployed by the Somaliland government,"Bakker, Emma","['Hagen, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Somaliland is a self-declared country located in the Horn of Africa that has been struggling for international recognition for over 30 years. Nonrecognition hinders unrecognized states from participating in multilateral and bilateral trade agreements, it severely restricts their opportunity to attract foreign aid and it excludes their region from international legal frameworks. The decision to grant Somaliland recognition is a political process of negotiation and depended on the global context, and moreover, not strictly bound by international law. Discourse and framing theories exemplify that how actors frame their actions, words and perceptions has a significant influence in diplomatic relations. Hence, this thesis is intending to unravel the ways in which the Somaliland government aims to influence the stance of the international community towards recognizing its independence by using various types of framing. This will contribute to the academic debate as unrecognized states and their practices, interests and beliefs are still considered to be a ‘black box’. A qualitative content analysis was carried out and data was gathered, comprising 14 speeches and interviews given by the Somaliland President and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the period of 2012-2022. The results indicate that the government of Somaliland prioritizes prognostic framing over diagnostic framing with a specific focus on the justification for acquiring international recognition. Motivational framing is mostly deployed towards the United States as this country is seen as a powerful actor in diplomatic relations.","['Somaliland', 'International Recognition', 'Framing', 'Diagnostic Framing', 'Prognostic Framing', 'Motivational Framing']"
Political views of ethnic minorities: the case of the Russian ethnic minority of Latvia,"Jerjomina, Olga","['Hagen, R']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all ex-Soviet states had Russian ethnic minorities who migrated there before 1991. Some countries have strong connections with Russia. Others, such as the Baltic States, have preferred to follow the path of European integration. However, it is unclear how Russian ethnic communities forming a tangible diaspora within some non- Russian states would develop their political views. The Russian-speaking community of Latvia represents a quarter of the country’s population. This community is not homogenous and has a variety of political opinions. Focusing on the social identity theory, this study collects evidence of how the Russian ethnic minority includes pro-European or pro-Russian attitudes on sanctioning policies against Russia introduced in response to the Russian aggression in Ukraine. In the study, Russian speakers residing in Latvia are invited to participate in a questionnaire about their views on the European Union, Russia, and sanctions against Russia. Data collected through the questionnaire seeks to analyse how ethnic background influences political opinions. Findings of the study suggest that within one ethnic minority, people can express diametrically different views, regardless of the shared ethnic background.","['Russian ethnic minorities', 'Social identity theory', 'Sanctions against Russia']"
"For Women’s rights, Against Women’s Will: A Case Study Research on the Influence of the Framing Tactics of the Pro-Life Movement","A'mema, Fee","['Heaphy, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In 1946 the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) established the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women. The Commission holds two-week sessions every year during which UN Member States engage in a general debate and organize side-events with civil society organizations (UN Women, n.d. a). The participating civil society organizations typically hold liberal beliefs on human rights and adhere to the dominant beliefs of the CSW (Rincker et al. 2019, 3). It is therefore interesting to find that pro-life organizations have frequently hosted side-events at the CSW in the past. Especially the pro-life organization C-Fam which has hosted multiple side-events in the past decade in which they present their anti-abortion campaign (UN Women, n.d. b). Even more interesting is that pro-life organizations have actively been blocked from the CSW66 which was held in March of 2022 (Tuns 2022). This makes one wonder how pro-life organizations managed to get into the CSW and present their alternative view in the first place. Based on this puzzling observation this research aims to research the framing tactics of C-Fam. The research question is as follows: How did the Center for Family and Human Rights frame their anti-abortion campaign to align with the Commission on the Status of Women between 2014-2019? To gain better insight on the organization’s narratives, a constructivist and a rationalist approach will be embedded in the overarching model of framing theory and then traced throughout the corresponding campaigns via a thematic content-analysis.","['framing, CSW, C-Fam, pro-life movement, abortion, reproductive rights.']"

Reframing Women’s Participation in Peacemaking: Beyond Formal Negotiations: A Qualitative Case Study of Women’s Participation in the Peacemaking Process in Sudan 2018-2020,"Ebenstal Almeida, Olivia","['Dr. Hilde, M. van', 'Dr. Katharina, N.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A central challenge in peace research is the limited evidence on how women’s participation contributes to peacemaking. The Sudanese Revolution has often been dubbed “a women’s revolution” in international media outlets, although women were largely sidelined during the formal peace negotiations. Current research increasingly acknowledges the weight and gendered nature of peace agreements to achieve sustainable peace, but they fail to explain the prerequisites. At the same time, the literature overlooks the qualitative aspect of women’s involvement and influence in peacemaking. Against this background, this thesis sets out to explore women’s participation in peacemaking and the implications for gender inclusive peace outcomes. The thesis follows an inductive approach and studies the case of Sudan in-depth. The data consists of Sudan’s peace agreement, and five in-depth interviews with women active during Sudan’s peacemaking process (2018-2020). The findings revealed a mechanism of outside influence, in which women’s participation through a variety of informal channels exerted pressure on the negotiation parties to incorporate gender provisions in the peace agreement, concluding that considering women in their informal efforts is as important as advocating for more women at the formal peace table.","['Women, Peacemaking, Participation, Influence, Peace Agreement']"
“When the Market Becomes Deadly.” COVID-19 as a Critical Juncture for Neoliberal Ideology in the European Union,"Fancelli, Mattia","['Meegdenburg, H. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to investigate COVID-19 as an opportunity for change for neoliberal ideology in the European Union. Critical juncture theory frames the pandemic to determine whether and how it amounts to a critical juncture for neoliberal political rationality investigated through discourse. A theoretical spill-over effect is laid out to assess whether COVID-19 unleashed the potential for change of a critical juncture on neoliberal discourse. Discourse analysis of EU social policy debates and documents before and after March 2020 is carried out to compare the two emerging discourses and observe whether a state of discursive flux can be identified. Discursive flux is developed through the indicators of “ambiguity” and “heightened level of contestation” to operationalise the potential for change of a critical juncture. The narrative comparison shows that flux can be identified in the post-March-2020 discourse. Indeed, whereas the dogmas found in the baseline reflect the conceptualisation of neoliberal political rationality, the post-March-2020 discourse is shown to question each of them, rejecting their dogmatic character. New narratives emerge which outline the possibility for change away from neoliberal political rationality. This is how this thesis concludes that COVID19 amounts to a critical juncture for neoliberal ideology in the EU.","['Covid 19', 'critical juncture', 'neoliberalism', 'neoliberal ideology', 'European Union', 'European Parliament']"
Van primus inter pares naar primus super pares: Presidentialisme in Nederland,"Spruit, Justin","['Otjes, S.P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek probeert de mate van presidentialisme in Nederland meetbaar te maken. Er worden hiervoor negen variabelen onder de loep genomen die te maken hebben met het gebruik van parlementaire middelen, de electorale context, de media-aandacht, de context van de ervaring in de regering en de middelen van het ministerie van Algemene Zaken. De uitkomsten van de principale-componentenanalyse tonen aan dat twee componenten inzichten in dit onderwerp kunnen geven. In plaats van presidentialisme als eendimensionaal beschouwen, zoals lange tijd gangbaar was in de literatuur, toont dit onderzoek aan dat het een tweedimensionaal concept is. De twee componenten, namelijk politieke personalisatie en de ondersteuning van de minister-president, hangen sterk samen met de onderzochte variabelen en kunnen dus sterk worden verklaard hieruit. De trend van deze twee componenten wijst op een toename van presidentialisme in Nederland in de periode van 1946 tot en met 2021. Dit onderzoek toont kwantitatief aan dat de staatsrechtelijke positie van de Nederlandse minister-president als primus inter pares is ingehaald door de praktische realiteit en dat er nu sprake is van een status als primus super pares.","['presidentialisme, presidentialisering, executive politics, minister-president, Nederland, primus inter pares, personalisatie']"
"Negatief getest, positief gebleven! Onderzoek naar de positieve ervaringen van jongeren tijdens de corona-pandemie","Oomen, Lisanne","['Stoltenborgh, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het coronavirus heeft invloed gehad op het dagelijks leven van vrijwel heel Nederland. De maatregelen omtrent de lockdowns hebben geleid tot veel veranderingen in het dagelijks leven van jongeren. Naast negatieve ervaringen, bestaan ook positieve ervaringen onder jongeren over deze lockdowns. Tijdens overleg met de Gemeente Leiden en het Centrum Jeugd en Gezin (CJG) Leiden, ontstond de vraag: “Welke positieve ervaringen hadden Leidse leerlingen van het voortgezet onderwijs tijdens de lockdowns naar aanleiding van de Corona-pandemie? Hoe zijn deze ervaringen bruikbaar in het aanbod en de aanpak van basisinstellingen als het CJG en het onderwijs?”. Gekozen werd voor de uitvoering van een exploratieve, kwalitatieve onderzoeksvorm; een semi- gestructureerd interview. Naar aanleiding van literatuuronderzoek werden de onderwerpen thuisonderwijs, gezinsklimaat, sociaal-emotionele relaties en persoonlijke ontwikkeling geselecteerd. Na goedkeuring van het onderzoeksvoorstel begon de wervingsprocedure en aansluitend de dataverzameling. Zeven vrouwelijke respondenten werden geïnterviewd over hun positieve ervaringen omtrent de geselecteerde onderwerpen. Ook was ruimte voor eventuele andere positieve ervaringen. Uit de data-analyse bleken verschillende positieve ervaringen onder de jongeren. Omtrent het thuisonderwijs, werden de toename van vrije tijd en zelfstandigheid en de mogelijkheid tot online les bij bijvoorbeeld ziekte als positief ervaren. Omtrent het gezinsklimaat werd als positief ervaren dat de respondenten het fijn vonden meer contact met hun ouders en de rest van het gezin te hebben. Wanneer werd gekeken naar sociaal-emotionele relaties, werd de toename in contact met familie en vrienden als positief ervaren. Ook ervaarden respondenten dat mensen elkaar meer steunden en leerden waarderen als positief. Omtrent persoonlijke reflectie werd gezien dat de respondenten meer rust ervaarden en dat zij kleine dingen leerden waarderen. Tot slot werd als positief ervaren dat de respondenten meer tijd hadden voor hobby’s en het veranderen van hun kamer en dat zij minder geld uitgaven. Ook werden tijdens de interviews negatieve ervaringen gedeeld, waarin vooral werd benoemd dat de lockdowns te lang duurden en dat aspecten van het ´normale´ leven werden gemist. Geconcludeerd werd dat de respondenten, ondanks hun voorkeur voor fysiek onderwijs, graag de mogelijkheid tot thuisonderwijs wilden behouden. Omtrent het gezinsklimaat werd geconcludeerd dat jongeren meer contact met hun ouders en gezin waarderen. Eén vorm van meer tijdsbesteding met het gezin, was dat de jongeren meer samen met hun gezin aten, wat werd benoemd als een verandering die zij graag mee wilden nemen naar de toekomst. Verder resulteerde de lockdowns, omtrent de sociaal-emotionele relaties van de respondenten, in hechtere banden met vrienden en familie. Ook ontdekten de jongeren, door meer moeite te moeten doen om contact met vrienden en familie te behouden, aan wie zij echt wat hadden. Omtrent de persoonlijke reflectie werd geconcludeerd dat het thuisonderwijs en het wegvallen van verplichtingen zorgt voor meer rust bij jongeren. Verder lieten de uitkomsten zien dat grote veranderingen waarbij veel dingen in het dagelijks leven niet meer mogelijk zijn, zorgen voor meer waardering voor de kleine dingen bij de jongeren. Tot slot kon uit de overige ervaringen worden geconcludeerd dat een toename in vrije tijd ervoor kan zorgen dat jongeren zelfstandig hun tijd besteden aan bijvoorbeeld hobby's, wat kan worden gekoppeld aan de behoefte om autonoom te zijn. Eén van de zwakke punten van het onderzoek is de kleine en niet diverse steekproef, die een mogelijk vertekend beeld geeft in de uitkomsten. Verder zijn jongeren van het speciaal onderwijs niet in het onderwijs niet in het onderzoek betrokken, ondanks dat zij volgens eerder onderzoek juist baat lijken te hebben bij een aantal veranderingen naar aanleiding van de lockdowns. Tot slot is in de huidige onderzoeksuitkomsten geen onderscheid gemaakt tussen de eerste en tweede lockdowns, terwijl het verschil tussen deze twee wel naar voren kwam in de interviews. Hierdoor kunnen de uitkomsten mogelijk ook vertekend zijn. In vervolgonderzoek kan mogelijk wel onderscheid worden gemaakt tussen de lockdowns. Tot slot zijn drie adviezen geformuleerd en zijn suggesties gedaan voor vervolgonderzoek. Het eerste advies is gericht op Blended Learning. Zo wordt naar aanleiding van de positieve ervaringen van de respondenten geadviseerd een combinatie van fysiek en online onderwijs aan te bieden om aan de verschillende behoeften van de leerlingen te kunnen voldoen. Ten tweede werd geadviseerd om flexibelere lestijden in te zetten in het onderwijs. Op deze manier hebben de leerlingen meer vrije tijd die zij zelf in kunnen delen, wat aansluit op de positieve ervaringen van de jongeren om deze mogelijkheid te hebben. In het derde advies werd, naar aanleiding van onderzoeken naar Frequency of Family Dinners, een campagne geadviseerd die gezinnen stimuleert meer samen te eten. Dit sluit aan op de wens om het vaker samen eten met het gezin mee te nemen naar de toekomst. Tot slot werd voor vervolgonderzoek geadviseerd een grotere en meer diverse steekproef te betrekken om meer informatie te kunnen verzamelen. Verder werden een aantal suggesties gedaan voor onderwerpen die mogelijk verder kunnen worden onderzocht in vervolgonderzoek. Zo kan binnen het onderwerp thuisonderwijs meer onderzoek worden gedaan naar individuele behoeftes van leerlingen en het vergroten van hun autonomie en actieve leerstijl. Verder werd de suggestie gedaan een steekproef te onderzoeken waarin jongeren met dyslexie, ADHD of hoogbegaafdheid worden onderzocht. Tot slot kan, wanneer wordt gekeken naar de persoonlijke reflectie, meer onderzoek worden gedaan naar hoe het wegvallen van verantwoordelijkheden kan zorgen voor meer rust bij jongeren.","['Pedagogiek', 'corona', 'lockdown']"

Ondersteunende communicatie: En dan? Een exploratief onderzoek naar de continuïteit van ondersteunende communicatie bij mensen met een verstandelijke beperking en ernstige gedragsproblematiek.,"Adamse, Femke",['Y. Dijkxhoorn'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Communicatie is een vaardigheid die een kritieke rol speelt in het leren, werken, vormen van relaties en deel kunnen nemen aan sociale gemeenschappen. Wanneer problemen worden ervaren op het gebied van communicatie kan ondersteunende communicatie (OC) worden ingezet. Dit komt veel voor bij mensen met een verstandelijke beperking (VB) in combinatie met ernstige gedragsproblematiek. Desondanks is er nog niks bekend over hoe de continuïteit van OC gewaarborgd wordt. Door middel van onderhavig onderzoek wordt gepoogd meer inzicht te verkrijgen in welke factoren bijdragen aan de continuïteit van OC voor mensen met een VB in combinatie met een ZZP 6 of 7 vanuit hun ernstige gedragsproblematiek (cliënten). De volgende onderzoeksvraag is hiervoor opgesteld: ‘Welke factoren zijn onderliggend aan de continuïteit van ondersteunende communicatie?’ Deze vraag wordt onderzocht aan de hand van de volgende deelvragen: 1) ‘In hoeverre zijn er ondersteunende communicatiemiddelen beschikbaar voor de cliënten?’, 2) ‘In hoeverre zijn de cliënten in staat om hun wensen uiten aan de hand van de geboden ondersteunende communicatie?’, 3) ‘In hoeverre zijn de begeleiders in staat om ondersteunende communicatie aan de cliënten aan te bieden?’, 4) ‘In hoeverre is er sprake van continuïteit in de ondersteunende communicatie?’ en 5) ‘Welke factoren zouden de continuïteit van de ondersteunende communicatie kunnen beïnvloeden?’. Aan dit onderzoek hebben de (wettelijk) vertegenwoordigers, teamleden en persoonlijk begeleiders van 212 cliënten deelgenomen. De cliënten hadden een leeftijd tussen 13 en 74 jaar en waren verbonden aan de zorginstellingen Ipse de Bruggen, Cordaan, De Hartekamp groep of Ons Tweede Huis. In dit exploratieve onderzoek wordt gebruik gemaakt van een literatuurstudie in combinatie met een contextueel interview (CI). De resultaten uit het CI zijn door middel van frequentieverdelingen weergegeven. Dit heeft geleid tot een model van factoren die op basis van de percepties van de (wettelijk) vertegenwoordigers, teamleden en persoonlijk begeleiders invloed zouden kunnen hebben op de continuïteit van OC. Dit onderzoek is een eerste stap in het aanpakken van het gebrek aan wetenschappelijk inzicht omtrent continuïteit van OC. Vervolgonderzoek is noodzakelijk om dit onderwerp verder uit te diepen.","['Verstandelijke beperking', 'ernstige gedragsproblematiek', 'Ondersteunende communicatie', 'ZZP 6', 'ZZP 7']"

De betrouwbaarheid van kleur-emotieassociaties: In hoeverre zijn kleur-emotieassociaties van basisschoolleerlingen vanaf 7 jaar bij het herkennen van emoties van anderen betrouwbaar?,"Oosten, Tessa van","['Nefs, H.T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd in opdracht van Jeanette van Tricht, oprichtster van de methode Buts en Bofn. Buts en Bofn is ontwikkeld met als doel lastige onderwerpen bespreekbaar te maken. De methode bestaat uit gekleurde houten blokjes waarmee persoontjes kunnen worden opgebouwd. Het gebruik van deze verschillende kleuren kan iemand helpen om zijn of haar emoties uit te drukken. Een onderdeel van de methode is een legendakaart. Dit is een werkblad dat de therapeut voor de therapiesessie kan invullen met de cliënt. Op die manier kunnen er afspraken worden gemaakt over welke emotie aan welke kleur wordt toegekend door de cliënt en kan de therapeut de cliënt beter begrijpen. De legendakaart die Buts en Bofn gebruikt, is gebaseerd op het idee dat mensen kleur-emotieassociaties maken. Om te onderzoeken hoe de legendakaart het beste geïmplementeerd kan worden, is er onderzocht in hoeverre kleur-emotieassociaties van basisschoolleerlingen vanaf 7 jaar bij het herkennen van emoties van anderen betrouwbaar zijn. Om hier antwoord op te kunnen geven, hebben 58 participanten op twee meetmomenten een vragenlijst ingevuld waarbij zij kleuren aan de emoties van gezichten moesten koppelen. Uit dit onderzoek bleek dat er sprake is van een beperkte test-hertest betrouwbaarheid van kleur-emotieassociaties. Dit betekent dat kinderen niet per definitie dezelfde kleur toekennen aan een emotie op twee verschillende momenten. Op basis van dit onderzoek kan geadviseerd worden om de legendakaart voor elke therapeutische sessie opnieuw in te vullen met het kind en altijd te blijven vragen welke emotie een kind met een kleur aanduidt.","['kleur-emotieassociaties', 'betrouwbaarheid', 'basisschoolleerlingen']"
Social Networks - Paving the Way for Misinformation? A Media Systems Approach,"Moura Nunes, Diogo","['Hagen, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social networks have paved the way for news, media influence, public opinion and political participation. While the introduction of ‘new media’ in a networked participatory media environment is proven in some cases to be beneficial for democracies, the reverse side of the story shows that in social networks, political actors have found a privileged channel to spread misleading narratives at the expense of society. This thesis integrates economic, political and social theories in the growing debate about misinformation and formulates them into the framework of media systems developed by Hallin and Macini and Hardy. Four components of media systems, i.e., ‘media-party parallelism’, ‘instrumentalization of social media’, ‘government regulatory burden’ and ‘fractionalization of media outlets’, are theorized to impact the dissemination of false and/or inaccurate information. Through a panel data regression and an analysis on democracy, this thesis finds robust evidence in favor of ‘instrumentalization of social media’. For the remaining three components, some evidence is found, namely within certain democratic regimes.","['information disorders', 'misinformation', 'media systems', 'social networks']"

Hierdoor rijst de vraag wat jongeren helpt en wat hen tegenwerkt in het dagelijks leven. In dit onderzoek worden belemmerende en stimulerende factoren in het dagelijkse leven van jongeren van zestien tot en met achttien jaar onderzocht. Dit is gemeten aan de hand van de twee constructen draaglast en draagkracht. De constructen zijn onderzocht door middel van literatuuronderzoek en een vragenlijst. Het literatuuronderzoek is uitgevoerd door onderzoeken te selecteren die de doelgroep van dit onderzoek en het perspectief van de jongere meenemen. Er zijn onderzoeken geselecteerd uit westerse landen waarin werd gefocust op het welzijn van jongeren. De vragenlijst is opgedeeld in de vijf factoren ‘individu’, ‘familie’, ‘leeftijdsgenoten’, ‘school’ en ‘omgeving en tijdsbesteding’. De vragenlijst is ingevuld door 90 respondenten, waarvan 60 vrouwen, 29 mannen en 1 respondent die zich als anders identificeerde. Ten tijde van het invullen van de vragenlijst was 21% van de respondenten zestien jaar oud, 48% zeventien jaar oud en 31% achttien jaar oud. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat geen enkele stelling zorgt voor een beduidende verandering van de Cronbach’s alpha. Uit de one sample t-testen blijkt dat voor negen draagkracht stellingen en acht draaglast stellingen de gemiddelden significant boven het totale gemiddelde liggen. De meeste stellingen hiervan komen uit de factoren ‘individu’ en ‘leeftijdsgenoten’. Deze bestaan uit de persoonlijkheid van de jongeren, hun beleving van zichzelf en de wereld, hun sociale relaties met leeftijdsgenoten en de variabelen die hierop van invloed zijn. Concluderend is te stellen dat alle gevonden factoren voor jongeren van zestien tot en met achttien jaar meespelen in het definiëren van hun draagkracht en draaglast, waarbij de onderwerpen met betrekking tot het individu en de relaties met leeftijdsgenoten de belangrijkste factoren zijn.","['draagkracht, draaglast, welzijn jongeren, adolescenten']"

What affects voice patterns during a face-to-face conversation? Social anxiety and social partner’s gaze direction,"Mavroeidi, Theodora","['Chen, J.', 'Vandenbroucke, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Social anxiety has been found to influence certain characteristics of the voice during various structured speaking tasks, but its assessment in more naturalistic contexts is scarce. When directly looked at, socially anxious individuals feel more intimidated compared to when their social partner averts their eye gaze. The primary aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between social anxiety and five vocal characteristics (including mean voice intensity, mean fundamental frequency, rate, pausing, and speech duration) during a face-to-face conversation. A secondary aim was to examine the moderating effect of a social partner’s gaze direction (direct vs. averted gaze) on this relationship. Methods: Fifty-two university students (M = 21.27 years old, 86.5% female) participated in a face-to-face conversation task with a same-sex confederate. Both the participants and the confederates were given four question cards which they were asked to answer interchangeably. The confederates’ cards also included instructions about gaze direction without the participants knowing. Throughout the conversation task, participants’ voices were recorded using high-quality wearable eye-trackers. Results: The analyses revealed that neither social anxiety nor social partner gaze direction affected vocal characteristics during the conversation task. Conclusion: Increased mean fundamental frequency and degree of pausing and decreased mean voice intensity, speech rate, and duration were not identified as potential physiological indicators of social anxiety. Though translating such findings into real-life social interactions proved to be a difficult venture, future researchers could further investigate this topic with the hope of better clarifying the relationship between social anxiety and atypical voice patterns, as well as the moderating effect of confederate gaze direction on the speech patterns of more or less socially anxious individuals.","['social anxiety', 'voice', 'vocal properties', 'direct gaze', 'averted gaze']"
Changes in large scale network connectivity in auditory hallucinations due to hearing-impairment,"Vardaxoglou, Annie",['Theresa Marschall'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Auditory hallucinations, the perception of sound without any correspondent stimulus, are quite common in hearing impaired population. Two types of hallucinations can be distinguished based on their phenomenology: simple (i.e., murmuring and tinnitus) and complex hallucinations (voices and music). The number of empirical studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of these types of hallucinations and their connectivity patterns is limited. Here, we tested whether deviations in connectivity of the brain networks underlie the auditory hallucinations in hearing impairment. By applying a group Independent Component Analysis on resting-state fMRI data of 18 hearing impaired patients with complex hallucinations (voices or music; HI-C), 18 hearing impaired patients with simple hallucinations (tinnitus or murmuring; HIS), and 20 controls with normal hearing (NH), we identified the networks of brain activity in these three groups. To measure the differences in within-network connectivity between the three groups, we applied a dual regression analysis. To determine the between-network connectivity differences between the three groups, the FSL NETS analysis was implemented. Regarding within network connectivity, there was one significant cluster of voxels showing hyperconnectivity within a brain network overlapping with the visual network and areas commonly seen in the default mode network in NH compared to HI groups. The HI-S showed a unique positive connectivity pattern between an auditory network, limbic areas and the cerebellum and a negative connectivity pattern in visual and auditory areas compared to NH and the HI-C. The HI-C showed a unique positive connectivity between networks including the limbic system, auditory regions, and the temporal lobe comparing to HI-S and NH. These findings suggest that limbic and auditory areas show an increased coupling in hearing impairment with auditory hallucinations. Future studies should distinguish the role of hearing-impairment and the role of auditory hallucination in functional brain mapping, to disentangle whether the differences in hyper-and hypo-connectivity are associated with hearing-impairment or hallucinations.","['Auditory hallucinations', 'hearing impairment', 'independent component analysis', 'dual regression', 'within-network connectivity', 'between-network connectivity']"

Littlejohn'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores how moral and ethical ideas are translated into how actors are designing or contesting future spatial development of the Nieuwe Waterweg, contributing to our understanding of why it is hard to change the logics embedded in these systems. Based on recent anthropological studies and the data gathered in this research, I hypothesise that part of the reason other proposals for the Nieuwe Waterweg's future are disregarded is not only simply clashing ideas of what function actors believe the Nieuwe Waterweg should prioritise. Rather, it is the different ideologies about just relations between human and nonhuman actors that cause conflicting ideas about how environments should be organised and why (Larkin 2013; Scaramelli 2019; Star & Ruhleder 1996). Despite the disagreements over the political functions of the Nieuwe Waterweg, all actors alike praise the symbolic, poetic value it serves (Larkin 2013). Its international reputation on port activities, association with water safety and overall symbol of innovativeness could once again be the key to contest the current logics and systems and convince policy makers of ones more sustainable and suitable for the future.","['Infrastructure, moral ecology of infrastructure, ethical landscape (re)organisation, stakeholder conflict, sustainable future, inertia in policy, moral policy making']"

Frequently referred to simply as BoTu, this neighborhood in Rotterdam is often presented as having higher than average poverty rates. In this study, I will try to understand how the two mentioned sets of goals combine under the term resilience. I will do that by focusing on the implementation of the program and the way residents of BoTu experience it. The concepts of citizenship and energy ethics will be crucial for my research. I will discuss debates surrounding these concepts and try to build upon them. With this, I will try to also contribute to academic debates about policy implementation, citizenship, and energy ethics. I will also touch upon the concept of resilience and temporalities concerning policy projects. The first will help me understand resilient projects in general, while the second will be beneficial for conceptualizing findings in my field. This study is based on my fieldwork in BoTu from January 2022 to early April 2022. It was conducted as part of Port City Futures research program and in collaboration with Veld Academie.

Brotherhood in diversity: A visual ethnographic study on mutual learning and social support of refugees and students,"Moree, Loes","['Metje, M.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this case study I investigate a unit of six people in the Woondiversiteit: a community in which Dutch students and Syrian status holders are living together. This paper attempts to show how mutual social support, language learning and cultural learning have emerged within the informal context of this living community. It will be argued that this way of living creates opportunities for intergroup contact which results in positive effects of cross-cultural interaction, such as the reduction of prejudices and the development of family-like relations. These relationships being, on the one hand, ones that stimulate the willingness to contribute to supporting status-holders to integrate in Dutch society, and on the other hand to generate an understanding amongst the Dutch students of the condition that these status holders find themselves in and to learn new ways of being and interacting. This research consists partly of an observational film that shows these interactions. Visual ethnography as part of participant observation has been used as the principal method, to create a deeper understanding of relational learning within this community. I will discuss the different roles which the camera has played in these processes and as a medium of investigation.","['visual ethnography, contact theory, language learning, willingness, communal living, cultural learning, social support, status holders, integration, migration']"

This research project explores realms of migrating to the Netherlands by focussing on the perception of temporalities, documentation and communication with Dutch authorities like the IND (Immigration and Naturalization Service). Diving into the theoretical concepts of power-chronography, delaying, waiting and errance, I explore how appointments with the IND, being transferred, and having no legal residence documents and other (bureaucratic) challenges are experiences in the lived experiences of my collaborators. All four collaborators present in this thesis, as well in the audiovisual output in the form of a zine, have their own ambitions and coping strategies with caring for their time while being in documentation and bureaucratic challenges, such as waiting for the second interview with the IND. Embedded within the framework of visual ethnography, this thesis attempts to dive into methodological reflections of zine-making as process and as audio-visual product in a multimodal way (including film and soundscapes accessible via QR codes). Together with the four young male collaborators from Kenya, Guinea, Yemen and Afghanistan, we aim to show parts of the asylum procedure in an artistic manner and critically question the current Dutch migration system and distribute the zines to engage with the research in line with the zine history of anti-institutionalism and activism. This research contributes to critically unpacking what the intersections of power, documentation and temporalities mean for the four collaborators in their lived experiences, shedding light on in which forms they find agency and control while currently being in the residency acquiring in the Netherlands. Thereby this research project in form of the written thesis and the accompanying zine contribute to the discourse of temporalities and migration.","['migration', 'refugees', 'IND', 'undocumented', 'zine-making', 'collaboration', 'asylum', 'temporalities', 'power-chronography', 'visual ethnography']"

Analogue photography and the practice of unexpected waiting: Doing research about non-events at Heem,"Bosch, Jara van den","['Westmoreland, M.', 'Fogarty-Valenzuela, B. L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis foregrounds what an ethnographer can learn from unexpected waiting. In particular, it looks at the ways analogue photography can help navigate a research project that is perpetually deferred. Before entering the field, the preliminary focus of this research was on the organised Heem days. Heem is a young initiative that aspires to evoke interfaith encounter through gardening and making art on designated Heem days. The intention of this research was to research the interfaith encounter between participants through gardening together and making art. When entering the field, the Heem days were repeatedly delayed. At the end of the fieldwork period, no Heem days had taken place. This period of waiting created a space and necessity to pay attention to the slow process and everyday aspects of Heem, through the people and place. Analogue photography was an adequate method to study this waiting process. Due to the limited number of photos that can be made, it stimulates the researcher to be in the moment and preselect what is important and what not. Through the concepts of waiting, everyday and analogue photography, this study explores the purchase of waiting for ethnography. The key finding of this study is that also in the (unexpected) process of waiting for something to happen in the field, a lot of valuable information can be found. Furthermore, analogue photography can teach us to slow down and look at our field – and personal lives – with new eyes. The research has a multimodal output that consists both of a textual part and an ethnographic photobook. The first reflects on the unexpected process of waiting for the organized days of Heem to happen, using the concepts waiting, everyday and analogue photography. The ethnographic photobook expresses the process of waiting at Heem, including the place, the mundane happenings and objects and the people of and around Heem. The photobook ends with photos of an organised Heem day that I participated in after fieldwork to also show what Heem was preparing for.","['waiting, ethnography, everyday, analogue photography']"

Attributes that either support or obstruct inclusion are brought forward by sports policies and programs, the participants themselves, and literature research. While the research has given directly observable examples and tools of how inclusive practices in sports can be enabled, it has also shed light on indirect and structural issues that somehow impact sports experiences: general participation in the deaf or hearing world; the sense of belonging one has in each; the ability of sign language as an influencing and communicative tool; and the interaction or lack thereof with other deaf or hard of hearing people. Thus, a distinction is made between physical participation and social participation in team sports, where each pertains to a different side of what it means to achieve inclusion.","['deaf', 'hard of hearing', 'inclusion', 'participation', 'sports', 'football', 'communication', 'community', 'belonging', 'autoethnography']"

However, this can be a sign of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition that affects people with a uterus1, where endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. Often this tissue grows in the pelvic, the ovaries, abdominal cavities. Despite the fact that one in ten people with a uterus have endometriosis, there is little attention for or understanding of this condition. Therefore, this research, consisting of a documentary and accompanying text, explores the complexity of the everyday life experiences of four women with endometriosis living in a Dutch and Belgian context. By placing this research topic in a larger anthropological discourse about illness experiences, it allowed me to approach endometriosis as a condition that is socially constructed by people women themselves and society. Three major themes play a major role in the women's everyday illness experiences. First, there is a lack of awareness for the condition in society that often results in misunderstandings and false diagnoses. Second, the ongoing process of grief and acceptance. Finally, the desire of women for a more holistic approach to endometriosis care. The aim of the research is to create more awareness for the condition and to help us think more openly about chronic pain linked to menstruation.","['Endometriosis, menstruation, women, illness, medical anthropology, feminism, visual anthropology']"

Social participation is important in the development and the well-being of children. On the other hand, school is important for learning social skills. Previous research has shown that autistic children struggle with their social and communication skills and therefore with participating in school activities. This study investigated the extent to which autistic children’s characteristics, such as age, gender, IQ, and autistic traits, contributed to higher or lower social participation at school. This was investigated in a sample of Dutch autistic children. Methods. Caregivers of 200 autistic children filled out an online questionnaire that included several topics, such as age, gender, IQ, and autistic traits. Once we had the data, we examined the relationship between all these factors mentioned above and checked whether these were significantly contributing to the levels of social participation at school. Results. Results show that younger children participated more at school when compared to older children and that social participation was correlated in a positive way with the level of autistic traits. It was also found that out of the four factors mentioned previously, only IQ and autistic traits contributed significantly to the level of social participation at school in autistic children. Conclusion. The main findings in this study show that children with higher IQ participated less at school compared to children with lower IQ. It was also found that children with more pronounced levels of autistic traits participated less in school activities than children with less pronounces autistic traits. These findings go in line with what was found before in the literature world regarding the relationship between autistic traits and social participation in autistic children. It was also important to show that research should continue to investigate how other factors might contribute to social participation at school. Nevertheless, this study was important and revealed valuable information for many professionals and caregivers. Relevant information for the development of inclusion school settings and programs that see autistic children as unique and consider their needs beyond the ASD diagnosis alone.","['Social participation, autistic children, school participation, IQ, gender, age, autistic traits']"

Secondly, the study aimed to investigate the relationship between parental emotional suppression and children’s fear of Covid-19, as well as the role of parent’s gender in the specific relation. Two-hundred and sixteen families took part from different regions of the Netherlands. The children and one or both parents completed self-report questionnaires. Results indicated that there was a positive relation between parents’ fear of Covid-19 and children’s fear of Covid-19, while the child’s age did not play a role in the relationship. In addition, no relationship was found between parental emotional suppression and child’s fear of Covid-19, while the parent’s gender did not influence the association. The findings suggest that parental Covid-19-related fear can influence children’s fear about the disease. The results indicate the importance of further examination of the consequences of Covid-19 among families, as well as the creation of intervention programs in order to help parents and children cope more effectively with the novel Covid-19 reality.","['Covid-19', 'Parental Fear', 'Children’s Fear', 'Emotional Suppression', 'Child’s Age', 'Parent’s Gender']"

Externaliserend probleemgedrag bij kinderen in de basisschoolleeftijd: Beoordelingen van ouders versus leerkrachten en de invloed van geslacht en sociaal-cognitieve vaardigheden,"Kooij, Sophie",['P. Barneveld'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Externalizing behavioral problems refer to the extreme way in which an individual may express his or her emotions, often due to a lack of skills to control feelings. To avoid robust problematic behavior patterns in later life that are difficult to correct, it is important to be able to detect externalizing behavioral problems in primary school-aged children. However, the perception of what constitutes problematic behavior may differ depending on the type of observer. In particular, parents may view their child’s behavior differently from teachers. The purpose of this research was to examine potential differences between teachers and parents in the judgement of externalizing behavioral problems of primary school-aged children. Also, it was investigated whether differences in judgment depended on a child’s gender or social-cognitive skills. Participants were primary school children from Amsterdam between 5 and 12 years old who exhibited high levels of externalizing behavior at school and at home, and who were siblings of delinquents and/or failed to attend school on a regular basis (N = 178; 73.6% boys). Teachers and parents provided judgments of externalizing problem behaviors using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Teacher Report Form; the Social Cognitive Skills Test was used to measure social-cognitive skills. Results showed that there was a significant difference between parents and teachers: teachers more often concluded a child exhibited externalizing problem behavior. In addition, no gender differences in teacher-parent judgement of externalizing behavioral problems were found. Lastly, social-cognitive skills did not predict externalizing problem behaviors according to parents and teachers, and gender did not influence this association. It can be concluded differences between parents and teachers with regards to judging the degree of externalizing problems are already present in young children, regardless of their gender or social-cognitive skills.","['externalizing behavior', 'teacher-parent judgement', 'gender differences', 'social cognitive skills']"

Recent scientific findings suggest that the model response to threats is not, as previously thought, characterized by selfishness, but rather prosocial in nature. The current study aims to replicate a previously observed positive effect of threat on cooperation, and investigates whether the effect of threat is comparable to the cooperation-inducing effect of peer punishment. During a public goods game, participants in groups of three were exposed to the threat of an electric shock, while their heart rate and skin conductance were recorded to verify the successful induction of the neurophysiological freezing response. Additionally, half of the groups were given the option to utilize costly peer punishment to enforce cooperation. The analysis suggests that the freezing response was successfully induced and that peer punishment facilitated cooperation. However, contrary to our expectations, threat did not have a significant positive effect on cooperation.","['threat, cooperation, peer punishment, heart rate, skin conductance, freezing, affiliation, electric shocks, decision-making, public goods game']"

Adverse childhood experiences have been linked to specific choices of coping behaviors which could lead to poorer health outcomes, therefore worse well-being. Aim: Investigate whether adverse childhood experiences predict pandemic coping behaviors and if adverse childhood experiences moderate the relationship between pandemic coping behaviors and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: This study was part of the CONNECT study within the Netherlands, which is part of a larger international longitudinal collaboration from eleven countries in Europe (ADJUST study). The participants were recruited through social media platforms from July to November 2020. Sociodemographic data were gathered, along with the following questionnaires: Adverse Childhood Experiences questionnaire (ACE) to measure adverse childhood experiences, Pandemic Coping Scale (PCS) to measure pandemic coping behaviors, and WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5) to measure well-being. Descriptive analysis as well as a MANOVA and moderation analyses were performed. Results: The responses of 2,022 individuals were analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 36, females (70.4%), males (29.1%), and others (0.5%). The mean for adverse childhood experiences was 1.3 and most of the population was considered low risk (86.9%). The mean score for well-being was 13.1 and 22.4 for PCS scores, which indicate high scores in well-being and coping behaviors. The MANOVA showed a significant model equation (p = .040) and non-significant individual relationships between ACEs and each pandemic coping style (preventative actions, p = .73; healthy lifestyle, p = .929; daily structure, p = .784; joyful activities, p = .162). The moderation effect of ACE in the relationship between coping and well-being was not significant (p = .150). Conclusions: This study shows the relation between well-being, pandemic coping behaviors, and adverse childhood experiences during the current coronavirus pandemic, as well as an insight into the Dutch population's experience of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.

Using Resonance as a Therapeutic Technique. Assessing the Accuracy of Resonance and the Impact of the Identity-Oriented Psychotrauma Theory (IoPT) in an Online Setting,"Müller, Niklas",['Dr. Sanne van Lunen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The “Intention Method” of the Identity-orientated Psychotrauma Theory (IoPT) is a therapeutic method that uses the resonance phenomenon to reveal unconscious psychological processes. During a psychotherapeutic session, resonators intuitively represent suppressed psychological processes of the client. It is yet to be proven that resonance is a reliable means to accurately uncover unconscious processes of the client. Therefore, the study examined the accuracy and the emotional and psychological impact of resonances in a therapeutic setting. The sample included 43 clients from 16 different nations who are currently in psychotherapeutic treatment based on the IoPT. The researcher observed 50 therapeutic sessions and evaluated the expressed resonances as coherent or incoherent with the life experiences of the clients. Additionally, any visible psychological or emotional changes during the session were noted. These changes were then interpreted in relation to the expressed resonances. Results showed that resonance is an accurate means to uncover suppressed psychological conflicts, and improve the psychological and emotional well-being of the clients. The results implicate that the IoPT has the potential to establish a new form of psychotherapy in which unconscious inner conflicts, suppressed feelings, and false identification can be directly processed.","['psyche, trauma, resonance, Identity-orientated Psychotrauma Theory, psychotherapy']"

Currently, a few types of established interventions are integrated into most health care systems of high-income countries. However, they lack accessibility. Therefore, this meta-analysis compares the effectivity of established and less established interventions aimed at reducing symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, while investigating several factors which might influence treatment effectivity and accessibility. For each disorder, combined pre-post and post-follow-up effect sizes were calculated. Treatment factors were investigated with moderation and subgroup analyses. In total, 37 studies were included. Controlled studies for PTSD produced a medium pre-post effect (d = -0.59, 95% CI [-0.93, -0.24]), and individual therapy (d = -0.88, 95% CI [-1.72, -0.04]) was more effective than group therapy (d = -0.63, 95% CI [-1.04, -0.22]). Uncontrolled studies produced a large pre-post effect (d = -0.90, 95% CI [-1.20, -0.61]). The combined pre-post effect for controlled studies on depression was insignificant and small (d = -0.33, 95% CI [-0.71, 0.05]). Pre-post effects for uncontrolled studies on depression were medium (d = -0.61, 95% CI [-0.81, -0.41]). Less established interventions (d = -0.61, 95% CI [-0.90, -0.31]) were more effective than established interventions (d = -0.55, 95% CI [-0.85, -0.25]), and interventions including caregivers (d = -0.69, 95% CI [-1.10, -0.28]) were more effective than without caregivers (d = -0.50, 95% CI [-0.74, -0.26]). Pre-post effects for controlled (d = -0.65, 95% CI [-0.98, -0.32]) and uncontrolled studies (d = -0.54, 95% CI [-0.74, -0.34]) on anxiety were both medium. Our results indicate that less established interventions show potential for implementation into standard health care. Lay personnel delivering interventions in groups, and non-clinical settings can increase accessibility with bearable losses in effectivity.",

P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The aim of the present study is to investigate how people perceive certain purchase options in their potential to fulfill their basic social needs for assimilation and distinctiveness. It is studied how this perceived potential is influenced by the strength of their individual needs for assimilation and distinctiveness as well as by their level of Fear of Missing Out (FoMO). It was found that the seven purchase options offered to our participants are perceived as having a high potential to fulfill both basic social needs, of which the need for distinctiveness is somewhat stronger. It was hypothesized and found for some purchase options that a stronger individual need for assimilation goes together with a higher perceived potential to fulfill the need for assimilation. It was also hypothesized and found for some purchase options that a stronger individual need for distinctiveness goes together with a higher perceived potential to fulfill the need for distinctiveness. In partial support of our hypothesis, participants with a stronger individual need for assimilation experience more FoMO. Participants with a stronger need for distinctiveness, however, experience less FoMO. It was hypothesized and found that FoMO moderates the relationship between the individual needs for assimilation and distinctiveness on the one hand and the perceived potential of various purchase options to fulfill these needs on the other hand. The results suggest that marketeers should not target only one of consumers’ two basic social needs. Furthermore, the effectiveness of their marketing efforts may strongly depend on the strength of consumers’ individual needs for assimilation and distinctiveness and their levels of FoMO.","['FoMO, Basic social needs']"

This law can be understood as an attempt from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to prevent the conversion of Hindu women and to further stigmatize Muslim men. This thesis analyses how this law problematizes the lives of inter-faith couples in practice. For that purpose, seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with Hindus and Muslims from UP, who are in an inter-faith marriage, and with experts from organizations that support inter-faith couples and women with their right to choose. The interviews are supplemented with online stories from couples in UP. With these interviews and online stories, this thesis incorporates the lived experiences from inter-faith couples. Therefore, this thesis does not only contribute to studies on love jihad and Hindu nationalism, but it also provides insights in how the lives from inter-faith couples, regarding their relationship or marriage, have changed since the implementation of the UP Ordinance. The thesis concludes that the UP Ordinance has not only made it close to impossible for Hindu-Muslim couples to marry in UP. The criminalization of inter-faith marriages has also (1) caused inter-faith couples to lose protection and cooperation from the authorities, (2) it has stimulated Hindu nationalist groups and individuals to harass inter-faith couples and intensified the disturbance of marriages, and consider this as an ‘act of civic duty’, (3) and it has deepened feelings of suspicion and enmity amongst friends, family members and entire communities, as inter-faith couples can be denounced by anyone to the authorities.","['Hindu Nationlism', 'Love Jihad', 'Gender', 'India', 'Inter-faith Marriage']"

During these episodes, psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations can emerge. BP patients can experience reward learning impairments and social deficits, which have been proved to be influenced negatively by psychotic symptoms. To identify more underlying structures of BP, this study examined reward valuation (the process of evaluating and comparing rewards corresponding with different options), the influence of psychotic symptoms on reward valuation and the relationship between social reward valuation and sensitivity for positive feedback. This study was a cross-sectional, observational study with a case-control and correlational design. From the Positive Valence study, a total of 19 patients and 17 controls were included. Reward valuation was measured with two multi-armed bandit tasks (a monetary- and social reward condition). Psychotic symptoms were measured with the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History, the MINI Internationaal Neuropsychiatrisch Interview 5.0.0. and the Basis-24 questionnaire. Social deficits were explored by examining the relationship between total social bandit score and the ‘positive feedback’ score of the Positive Valence Systems Scale. We carried out Mann-Whitney U tests and linear regressions. Results showed no significant differences in total monetary bandit score (U = 138, z = .072, p = .958), and total social bandit score (U = 183, z = .682, p = .510) between patients and controls. Moreover, there was no significant difference in total monetary bandit score (U = 39, z = -1.398, p = .176) and total social bandit score (U = 80, z = -1.023, p = .982) between the participants with and without psychotic symptoms. In addition, total social bandit score was not significantly related to sensitivity for positive feedback (F(1, 32) = 1.457, p = .236). This study found no significant between-group differences in reward valuation and no relationship between social reward valuation and sensitivity for positive feedback, indicating that (social) reward valuation processes possibly differ from other reward processes in this population. Considering the limitations, this study contributed to improving our current taxonomy, highlighting the importance of taking subconstructs and personal differences into account with diagnostics and treatment.","['Reward, Bipolar Disorder']"
"Het UIL Project: De effectiviteit van een intensieve, empirisch onderbouwde en geïndividualiseerde leesinterventie","Delft, Marit van","['Espin, C.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Research has shown that the reading skills of Dutch children are deteriorating. The emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic has led to even more concerns in education. Many students have fallen behind in reading and could benefit from additional reading instruction. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an intensive, individualized reading intervention on the reading performance, reading enjoyment and reading self-perceptions of students with reading difficulties. More specifically, the effects of the UIL, an online and intensive tutoring intervention, were compared to the effects of the MLM control condition, a simpler and more typical intervention method where the tutor reads along with the student. Participants were 29 elementary-school children with reading problems (grades 5 and 6), selected from seven schools in the Netherlands. To compare the effects of the UIL and MLM, the study employed a mixed design with both within (time, pretest vs. posttest) and between subject factors (intervention, UIL vs. MLM). The results revealed that all students made substantial gains in reading and reading self-perceptions from pretest to posttest. These gains were similar for both the UIL and MLM groups with the exception of word reading. The results suggest that both the UIL and MLM might be effective for improving reading and reading self-perceptions of students with reading difficulties. Furthermore, the results indicate that it’s feasible to provide reading interventions in an online learning environment. Due to the small sample size, it is recommended to replicate the study with a larger sample and a third non-treatment control condition before drawing firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the intervention.","['reading performance', 'reading difficulties', 'intensive and individualized reading intervention', 'online reading instruction', 'reading enjoyment', 'reading self-perceptions']"
Increased smartphone use not linked to better task switching performance,"Rundberg, Brent","['Ghosh, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Task switching describes a cognitive ability required to switch quickly between different activities, which is for example used in daily life. Task switching performance has been found to decline with age, but the mechanisms behind it are still poorly understood. The current study investigates a possible relationship between smartphone use and task switching performance to generate a better understanding of task switching, which could help to figure out a way to slow down its decline or even improve performance. Smartphone data was used since it can better reflect real-world switching between activities as compared to questionnaires or lab measures of the construct. Participants with higher amounts of smartphone use were hypothesized to show higher task switching performance. This was hypothesized because previous studies investigating a possible relationship between media multitasking and task switching performance suggested that people who more often used different forms of media concurrently or in rapid succession had lower switch costs in the task switching test. The study used an online measure of task switching with 174 participants between ages 20 and 85 and measured their daily smartphone use by tracking the number of taps and apps used. Multiple linear regression models did not find smartphone measures to be related to task switching ability. However, age-related decline was found for task switching ability. We conclude that there is no indication that the amount of people’s smartphone use is related to task switching performance. Future studies looking at task switching performance and ways to slow down its decline or even improve task switching performance should consider looking at other measures than daily smartphone use. The results of this study highlight the complexity of finding ecological validity of lab-found results and finding relationships between lab-found results and real-world everyday behaviours.","['Taskswitching, smarthone, mediamultitasking']"

The response of a sample of young Syrian refugees (ages 10-18) on a dynamic test of analogical reasoning was tested in a test-training-test design with two conditions (training and practice). The Child PTSD Symptom Scale was used to measure the presence of posttraumatic stress symptoms in the participants. The participants in the training group showed more progress from pre-test to post-test, however this difference was not significant. Contrary to what was hypothesized, no relation between posttraumatic stress symptoms was found and age did not seem to play a significant role in this.

The associations of neuroticism and conscientiousness with internet addiction in Dutch adolescents: exploring the mediating role of perceived social support,"Düsterhus, Petra","['Tajioui, I.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While the Big Five personality traits of neuroticism and conscientiousness have consistently been established as risk and protective factors for internet addiction (IA), respectively, personality is rather resistant to change. As perceived social support (PSS) is more malleable, it may be an accessible intervention point for IA in adolescents with at-risk personality traits. This study investigated whether neuroticism and conscientiousness were associated with IA in Dutch adolescents specifically, and, if so, whether PSS was a mediator in these associations. We aimed to contribute to the scarce literature in the Dutch adolescent population with a new sample, identify risk and protective factors of IA, and detect possible points of intervention. To our knowledge, this was the first study to explore the mediating role of PSS in these associations. The data of 109 Dutch adolescents aged 13 to 25 years were analyzed in this cross-sectional study using mediation analyses. Conscientiousness, neuroticism, PSS, and IA were measured via self-report. Results indicate a positive association of neuroticism and IA, and a negative association of conscientiousness and IA. However, PSS was not found to be a mediator between any of the personality traits and IA. These findings suggest that high neuroticism and low conscientiousness are important indicators for IA in Dutch adolescents. As PSS was not found to be a mediator, there is a need to find alternative points of intervention for those with at-risk personalities. Future research should focus on replication with a bigger sample, and the use of multiple informants and assessment tools.","['internet addiction', 'personality', 'neuroticism', 'conscientiousness', 'perceived social support']"

Moderating Role of Perseverative Negative Cognitions in the Association Between Academic Stress and Sleep,"Monteiro Alves, Ana Catarina","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Quality sleep is paramount for the mental and physical health of university students and for their academic success. Stress was found to be a precipitator and a maintaining factor of poor sleep. Moreover, vulnerabilities in the student population may maintain and/or exacerbate a possible association between stress and sleep quality; one of which is the development or the existence of poor coping strategies to deal with stress, such as a propensity to engage in perseverative negative cognitions (PNCs). This study examined whether an increase in academic stress was related to a decrease in the sleep quality of university students. Additionally, moderation by two different PNCs (i.e., excessive worry and rumination) were expected, with high levels of PNCs associated with an exacerbation of the relationship between academic stress and sleep quality. Lastly, the unique contribution of the two PNCs to the moderation effect was explored. Cross-sectional data from 49 university students were obtained using a series of questionnaires (Mage = 19.6 years, female = 95.9%). A simple regression analysis failed to indicate that an increase in academic stress predicts a decrease in sleep quality (p = .30). In addition, a hierarchical multiple regression failed to establish that PNCs moderate the relationship between academic stress and sleep quality (p = .18), suggesting that high levels of PNCs may not be associated with an exacerbation of the relationship. Furthermore, this study did not find evidence for the individual contribution of both types of PNCs to the moderation effect of PNCs in the association between academic stress and sleep quality (p = .28 for worry as a moderator; p = .47 for rumination as a moderator). These findings inform that academic stress might not share the same link with sleep difficulties as other types of stress have demonstrated. Furthermore, there is the possibility of additional concomitant difficulties (i.e., depression and anxiety) being relevant for the associations investigated, either as subsequent outcomes or as determinants of these associations. These findings provide a basis for future research on possible resistances experienced by this population and inform interventions that could help ameliorate sleep quality in university students.","['academic stress', 'excessive worry', 'negative perseverative cognitions', 'rumination', 'sleep quality']"

The 13 participants (mean age = 13.15, 53.85% male) and their parents were recruited through language schools in the Zuid-Holland province in the Netherlands. Cognitive learning potential was measured with a new promising measure, the computerized dynamic test of analogical reasoning. The study was of an experimental pre-test-training-post-test design with two conditions, training and control. The participants completed exercises of analogical reasoning pre-test, then the experimental condition received graduated prompts training. Both groups completed exercises post-test. The effectiveness of the training was examined, but no significant results were found, although both the training and control groups significantly improved from pre-test to post-test. No significant relationship was found between PTSD symptoms and learning potential.

Routine outcome monitoring of treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder in times of corona: videoconferencing treatment compared to in person treatment,"Sagredo Aviles, Gita","['de Beurs, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The corona crisis offered a natural experiment to compare videoconferencing treatment with in person treatment. The COVID-19 epidemic requiring social distancing through its lockdown measures forced a sudden and total transition from in person to videoconferencing mode of treatment provision, irrespective of the preference of the therapist or client. Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) data allowed the comparison of three groups of treatment delivery: (1) treatments that were largely or completely performed in person, (2) treatments that started in person but suddenly switched to treatment via videoconferencing due to the corona measures, and (3) treatments that were performed entirely with video conferencing. The research question in this study is: How does treatment conducted (partially) through videoconferencing compare to in person therapy in effectiveness? It was hypothesized that full in person treatment would be more effective than (partial) videoconferencing treatment. The participants in this research were patients receiving treatment at Sinai Center, a Mental Healthcare Clinic in The Netherlands, specialized in the treatment of PTSD. The patients who were included in this study were predominantly diagnosed with PTSD and had completed their treatment in the years 2018 till 2021. ROM data were used to analyse the pre- and post-test scores of the three cohorts with repeated measures ANOVA in a two (time) by three (conditions) factorial design. Also, the proportions of recovered, improved, unchanged, and deteriorated patients were compared among the three cohorts with a chi-square test. Contrary to what was hypothesized, the results showed that there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups in outcome of therapy. Some limitations of the study may have influenced the results; incomplete background information of the patients to account for in the analyses, lack of a disorder specific questionnaire to measure outcome, the effects of the pandemic and lockdown on the patients.","['Routine outcome monitoring', 'Corona', 'Videoconferencing', 'Posttraumatic stress disorder']"

The Implicit Association Task (IAT) was completed by fathers when their second born child was 4 years old, and when the child was 10 years old. The children completed the IAT when they were 10 years old. The Child Behavior Checklist was completed by both fathers and mothers to identify problem behavior when their child was 10 years old. The sample consisted of 148 Dutch families with high educational levels. There were no relations between the implicit gender stereotypes of fathers, the implicit gender stereotypes of children, and problem behavior of children. There was also no mediation by implicit gender stereotypes of 10-year-old children of the relations between implicit gender stereotypes of fathers when their child was 4 years old and problem behavior of the 10-year-old children. Lastly, there were no differences between boys and girls in the analysis named above. Only implicit gender stereotypes of fathers when their children were 4 years old were related to implicit gender stereotypes when their children were 10 years old, which shows stability of the gender stereotypes of fathers over a period of 6 years. The relation between gender stereotypes of fathers and children, and between problem behavior is probably related to environmental factors, such as peers, other family members, or to a combination of several factors.","['Gender', 'Genderstereotypen', 'Gedragsproblemen', 'Vaders', 'Kinderen']"

Huijbregts'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Objective/Background: This study was designed to examine the self-image of children with externalizing behavioral problems and whether this was related to type of aggression they showed. Regarding type of aggression, a distinction was made between reactive and proactive aggression. Methods: For this study the data of the PIT-project were used. There were 102 participants aged 6 to 14 years (81 boys, 21 girls) with externalizing behavioral problems. The children completed the “Competentiebelevingsschaal voor Kinderen” (CBSK) and their teachers completed the “Instrument voor Reactieve en Proactieve Agressie” (IRPA). The outcomes of the CBSK were used to describe the self-image and the IRPA was used to measure pro – and reactive aggression. The participants were devided in three groups; low, average and high aggression, and a MANOVA was used to compare these groups. Sex and age were also included. Results: Regarding self-image, children with externalizing behavioral problems were somewhat more insecure about their school skills and behavioral attitude compared to average children. They were more confident about their social acceptance, sport skills and physical appearance and showed higher general self-esteem. Girls had a higher self-esteem than boys and there was no influence of age. There were no significant differences between children with high, average or low self-image in reactive or proactive aggression. Girls did not differ from boys regarding pro- or reactive aggression either. Conclusion: Children with externalizing behavioral problems are more insecure about their school skills and behavioral attitude, more confident about their social acceptance, sport skills and physical appearance and have a higher general self-esteem compared to average children.

Current scientific knowledge suggests that having a high intelligence mainly coincides with having high grandiose-manipulative traits in people with psychopathic traits. This study focusses on the potential relationship between intelligence and the three domains of psychopathy in Dutch convicted juvenile boys (N=52) between the ages of 15 and 19, diagnosed with Conduct Disorder. Participants were assessed on intelligence using the WISC-III-NL or WAIS-III-NL, depending on their age. The assessment for their psychopathic traits was done using the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory. We hypothesized a relationship between high intelligence and high interpersonal (grandiose manipulative) traits. Furthermore, a relation between lower intelligence and higher behavioral (daring-impulsive) and affective (callous-unemotional) traits was hypothesized. The potential relationships between the psychopathic traits and intelligence were explored by performing ANCOVA’s, where correction was made for age and SES. Unfortunately, not all assumptions for the ANCOVA’s were met so the results should be interpreted with caution. In our analysis we found no relationship between intelligence and each of the three psychopathic traits. This contradicts the widely held view that there is an association between the psychopathic traits and intelligence. Future research should investigate the interaction effect between the three psychopathic traits and from this view examine the relationship with intelligence.","['Psychopathic traits, intelligence']"

Using empathy and nocebo-effect information in doctor patient communication to decrease side effects in advanced breast cancer. Does anxiety play a mediating role?,"Drooger, Elrike H.J.",['Liesbeth van Vliet'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective Breast cancer patients who are undergoing treatment often experience side effects as a consequence. Because patients speak a lot with their doctor during their disease process, psychological interventions via doctor-patient communication can be used to positively influence patient outcomes, like side effect expectations. This experimental video-vignette study aimed to i) Investigate if clinician-expressed empathy and giving information about the nocebo-effect (e.g. when negative outcome expectations lead to worsening of a symptom) decreases the probability of patients’ expected side effects and ii) Determine whether a decrease in patients’ anxiety levels plays a mediating role between the effects of empathy and nocebo-effect information and side effect expectations. Methods Using a scripted video-vignette study, analogue patients (AP’s: healthy women, women with cancer and cancer survivors, N= 160) randomly watched one out of four videos. The video-vignettes differed in clinician’s communication: Absence or presence of clinician-expressed empathy and information on the nocebo-effect. Pre-video and post-video, APs’ state-anxiety levels were captured and post-video a manipulation check and side effect expectations (specific, partial and non-specific) were assessed. Data was analysed using anova, multiple regression- and mediation analysis. Results Between-group effects demonstrated that AP’s who received both clinician-expressed empathy and nocebo-information compared to no intervention at all showed the best results for expectations of specific side effects (p = .017). However this can be explained by a main effect of empathy on specific side effect expectations (β = -.254, 95% CI = -1.299 to -.324, p = .001). Exploratory analysis showed that this was specifically due to decreased expectations of hair loss (p=.003) and diarrhea (p=.009). The effects of both interventions on side-effects were in no case mediated by APs’ state anxiety levels. Conclusion The current experimental study demonstrated that clinician-expressed empathy might help to decrease APs’ specific side effects, yet this effect cannot be explained by a decrease in anxiety levels. When empathy by the doctor is combined with informing patients about the nocebo effect this might be a promising intervention to further decrease the degree of side effects for cancer patients. More research in a clinical care setting is needed to generalize the effects of the interventions to a clinical population and to gain insight into the underlying mechanism that remains unclear.","['Doctor-patient communication, Clinician-expressed empathy, Nocebo-effect information, Side effects, Anxiety, Cancer, Palliative care, Video-vignette study, Analogue patients']"
Untangling the Web: A Network Approach to the Correlates of Bullying,"Ouska, Finn",['Myrthe Veenman'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Bullying is a phenomenon that is widespread in schools and workplace but is also occurring online in the form of cyberbullying. Previous studies have indicated that bullying is negatively related to social support and self-esteem. Social support and self-esteem thus constitute protective factors in the relation to bullying. Further, it was expected that bullying will be positively related to the negative mental health outcomes loneliness, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. To investigate the relations between bullying and social support, self-esteem, loneliness, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation the present study used the network approach to integrate all the variables and visualize their relations. The data was taken from the WARN-D project, where 453 participants aged between 18 and 53 (M = 22.7, SD = 4) filled out questionnaires about various mental health aspects including the seven variables used in the present study. Results show that the hypothesized positive relationships between bullying and mental health outcomes are present in the network.

Using features derived from network analysis in a random forest model has already shown promising results in an experiment of the Netherlands Labour Inspection to predict risk scores of violating Dutch labour laws for Dutch companies. In order to see if this is the best way for the NLA to use network analysis this method has been compared with using node classification, a deep learning method that uses sampling and aggregation to label nodes of a network based on its neighbours and the network structure. In this study node classification has shown to perform better at predicting risk scores for Dutch companies than a random forest model with network features does. A simulation study was done on the node classification method to test its robustness and has shown that it is important that there are enough labels in the training set in order for the method to perform well and that the quality of these labels influences the extent to which the model overfits. If the data scientist of the NLA choose to use node classification in future projects it is important that they make an ethical selection of the variables to use for prediction and that they ensure that there are enough labels in the dataset for the node classification model to perform well.","['Node Classification', 'Network Analysis', 'Random Forest', 'Fraudulent', 'Government', 'Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning']"

Narcissistic Traits and Social Decision-making behaviours; an Exploration through the Information Sampling Trust Game,"Markey, Oscar","['Ma, I', 'Vogelaar, B']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The Information Sampling Trust Game (ISTG) is an updated model of the classic trust game – a paradigm originally designed to assess the perceived benefit of information acquisition prior to making a decision in comparison to the potential cost; financial, social, or otherwise. Previous studies have suggested that narcissistic traits may also influence the decision to invest socially in another individual; that is, whether or not to place one’s trust in another person (Franken, 2016). In addition, previous studies have suggested that both narcissistic traits and information sampling behaviours develop throughout adolescence (Jenkins, 2019; Ma, Westhoff, et al., 2020). Results from the ISTG - in terms of information sampled and proportion of investments - in a group of 157 adolescent participants (10-24) were investigated in relation to the narcissistic traits of the participants; the effects of age on this relationship were also investigated. A significant relationship was found between N-R trait scores and proportion of investments. Results also suggested that this relationship varied between age groups; with younger age groups (10-14 and 15-18 year olds) showing a positive relationship between N-R traits and proportion of investments, while adults (19-24 year olds) showed an inverse relationship. Neither a significant relationship between N-A and trust decisions nor significant effects on sampling were found. These findings indicate that N-R traits in particular have a relationship with social decision-making behaviours, and that this relationship between narcissism and social behaviour may change throughout adolescent development.",

The effect of genetic relatedness and environment on human emotions and empathy while watching animals: differences between online and offline zoo visits,"Eijdems, Juul",['Prof. dr. Karline Janmaat'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objectives: In this study the effect of the participants’ environment (offline versus online) and genetic divergence (to the animal) on emotional speech was investigated. The effect of genetic divergence on the empathy ratings participant gave to the different animal species were also examined. It was hypothesised that an offline environment with live animals elicited more emotional speech than the online environment and that animals that are closer to humans in genetic divergence time elicited more emotional speech as well as more empathy in the participants. Methods: The healthy participants (N = 157; 113 women, 42 men, 2 ‘X’) participated in one of the three conditions (live, online or 360-live). In this study this two groups of participants were analysed: offline and online. The participants had to voice their thoughts, feelings and observations while watching ARTIS zoo animals and while filming either themselves, the animal or both. The emotional component of their speech was used to investigate the emotions that were evoked by watching the animals. Results: There was significantly more emotional speech in the online condition. In addition, I found that the more genetically distant the observed animal was to the human, the higher the probability that the animal elicited emotional speech. In contrast a very significant negative correlation between genetic divergence time and empathy ratings was found. Conclusion: In contrast to my expectations significantly more emotional speech occurred when participants observed animals online compared to offline. This indicates that the online participants had a more emotionally dense narrative when viewing the animals. In addition, animals that were further away in genetic divergence time seemed to elicit more emotional speech, compared to the animals close in divergence time. Nonetheless, the closer the animal was to the participant in genetic divergence time, the more empathy the participants felt for that animal. These results can be used to optimise animal-based therapies.","['Emotion, speech, animals, online, offline, genetic divergence time, zoo']"

Lastly, an examination of the effect of feedback on therapists’ predicting treatment success, was evaluated, with an expectation that complex feedback would help therapists have a better prediction accuracy than simple feedback. To explore these hypotheses, therapists (N = 68) answered a few questions regarding their outcome expectations at sessions 1, 5, 10, and 15 while patients (N = 437) had to complete the Outcome Questionnaire-45 item prior to each session, for a maximum of 15 sessions. Results suggest that therapists’ expectations were not affected when they received feedback, neither the effect of feedback on therapists’ outcome expectations was moderated by patients’ progression. Additionally, it showed that feedback in general, led to better therapists' prediction accuracy than not receiving feedback. When a distinction between complex feedback and simple feedback was made, the results showed that therapists seem to benefit more from complex feedback. To conclude, feedback does not affect therapists’ treatment expectations over time. Moreover, feedback in general does affect therapists' prediction accuracy, and more specifically, complex feedback makes therapists’ have a more accurate prediction.","['Feedback, therapists’ expectation, prediction accuracy, on track/Not on track']"
The effect of parental verbal information of threat/anxiety vs. safety on child avoidance behaviour towards strangers: The moderating role of child behavioural inhibition,"Strengers, J.G.C.",['Evin Aktar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The development of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a complex aetiological pathway. Recent studies revealed that the verbal informational pathway influences children’s anxiety beliefs and behaviours towards novel animals. This study incorporated this to a social context by investigating the effect of parental verbal expression of threat/anxiety (versus safety) on the avoidance behaviour towards strangers in children. In addition, this study investigated if the temperamental construct behavioural inhibition (BI) moderated this effect. Methods: A community sample of 71 children aged between 9-to-14 participated with their primary caregiver by visiting the lab. Both parents had to fill in online questionnaires about their personal anxiety levels and child’s anxiety and temperamental levels. Whilst the child filled in questionnaires about their anxiety and temperamental levels. During the lab visit the caregiver provided verbal threat/anxiety (versus safety) information to their child about two strangers that would watch their child perform social tasks. The effect of this verbal manipulation was tested by observing the child’s avoidance behaviour during these social tasks. Results: The child’s avoidance behaviour did not significantly differ during the social tasks between the stranger paired with the threat/anxiety versus safe condition. However, children who reported more BI sensitivity showed more avoidance behaviour independent of the verbal manipulation. Conclusions: The type of verbal information transmitted by parents did not influence the child’s avoidance behaviour towards strangers. In addition, this study confirmed the existing evidence that BI is a risk factor for developing SAD behaviour.","['verbal information pathway', 'parents', 'strangers', 'avoidance behaviour', 'behavioural inhibition']"

"The Relationship Between Attention to Bodily Symptoms, Cortisol, and Nocebo Hyperalgesia","van Beers, Ella C",['Judy Veldhuijzen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Attention to bodily symptoms (ABS) is adaptive, as it allows for the detection of sensations, injuries, or bodily problems that require attention. Although ABS is generally beneficial, increased ABS can result in increased pain and anxiety. The purpose of this study was to first investigate whether increased ABS leads to increased nocebo hyperalgesia, defined as experiencing pain in the absence of a painful stimulus. The second aim was to investigate whether cortisol mediated the relationship between ABS and nocebo hyperalgesia. It was hypothesized that increased ABS would result in greater nocebo hyperalgesia and that cortisol would mediate this relationship. Fifty-two healthy adult participants completed a questionnaire examining their body ignorance, body attention, and body awareness and participated in a nocebo hyperalgesia task. In the nocebo task, participants received visual and verbal suggestions that they would experience high levels of pain while experiencing low levels of heat stimulation. Five salivary samples were taken throughout the testing session to measure cortisol levels. Simple linear regressions were used to examine whether increased ABS predicted increased nocebo hyperalgesia, and a mediation analysis was conducted to examine whether cortisol mediated the relationship between ABS and nocebo hyperalgesia. The findings from this study firstly suggest that neither body ignorance (p = 0.078), body attention (p = 0.784), nor body awareness (p = 0.998) significantly predict nocebo hyperalgesia. Secondly, cortisol did not mediate the relationship between any of these factors. This was the first study to explore the influence of these factors on nocebo hyperalgesia. Because ABS did not predict nocebo hyperalgesia, and cortisol did not mediate this relationship, these findings challenge our current understanding of the role of ABS and the factors that lead to a nocebo effect. The present study challenges the current understanding of the relationship between ABS and nocebo hyperalgesia and pain. These findings can be used to support the development of interventions for pain disorders, including mind-body interventions. Future work should manipulate ABS and add a secondary measure of ABS to further examine these relationships. Stress can be further examined in the context of ABS through subjective and physiological measures.","['cortisol, nocebo, hyperalgesia, pain, bodily symptoms']"
The Relationship Between the General Practitioner!s Experience of the Doctor-Patient Relationship and Schooling for Medically Unexplained Symptoms,"Achouitar, Layla",['Dr. W. Kitselaar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The aim of the present study is to answer the questions “Whether a poorer doctor-patient relationship predicts a greater need for further training in Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS)?” and “Whether previous MUS training (either during the medical degree or afterwards) is associated with a better doctor-patient relationship?”. This quantitative study was based on a national cross-sectional online survey of Dutch GPs in 2018. Participants were GPs who consented to take part in the survey and completed all 10 items of the DDPRQ-10 and the MUS schooling questions (N=248). Binary logistic regression analysis and point-biserial correlations were used to investigate the relationship between the GPs’ experience of the doctor-patient relationship and schooling for MUS. The results showed that firstly, while MUS schooling after the medical degree was linked with a better doctor-patient relationship, MUS training during the medical degree was not. Secondly, the doctor-patient relationship did not predict the GPs’""self-reported need for additional MUS schooling. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that GPs would benefit from receiving further MUS training after completing the medical degree as this is associated with a better doctor-patient relationship. Furthermore, this study highlights the need for further research looking at the variables that predict the need for further MUS schooling as this could help inform MUS training programs for GPs and improve the care of patients with MUS.",

There are various mediation styles, but the focus of this thesis is on facilitative and directive mediation style. Specifically, this quantitative study used the context of the workplace and examined the role of personality, cultural values and gender on influencing the employee’s preferred mediation style. Recruited participants voluntarily filled out a set of questionnaires in exchange for the results of their personality test and the possibility to win €25. Multiple linear regressions and an independent t-test were conducted to analyse the data from sixty-two participants. The results showed that employees who rated themselves high on extraversion showed a preference for directive mediation style, while employees who rated themselves high on neuroticism showed a preference for facilitative mediation style. Further on, male employees who rated themselves as higher in neuroticism were more likely to prefer facilitative mediation style, while male employees who rated themselves as lower in neuroticism were more likely to prefer directive mediation style. However, on its own, both gender and cultural values did not significantly predict employees’ preferred mediation style.","['Mediation, Facilitative, Directive, Personality, Culture, Gender']"
The Prevalence of Replications in Psychology: A conceptual replication in a new decade,"Veringa, Amarins","[""Van 't Veer, A.""]",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Replication is a vital aspect of the scientific process. Yet, research by Makel et al. (2012) found that only 1.57% of psychology articles published between 1945-2011 contained the term “replicat*” and only 68.4% thereof were actual replications, resulting in a prevalence estimate of 1.07%. The recent reforms in psychology raise the question whether this has improved. The current study thus aims to replicate Makel et al. (2012) in a new decade. Study 1 showed that the use of “replicat*” almost doubled between 1945-2010 and 2011-2020. In addition, we investigated whether focussing on articles from the top 100 journals based on journal impact factor accurately reflects the prevalence in all journals. We found that “replicat*” use was higher in the top 100 than in all psychology journals. This suggests that restricting the search to the top 100 does not provide the most accurate representation of the field. Thus, in study 2, we manually coded a sample of 343 articles that contained the term “replicat*” from all psychological journals. This showed that 72.60% of the coded articles were actual replications, resulting in an estimate for the prevalence of replications in psychology between 2011 and 2020 of 2.55%. Furthermore,“replicat*” was used to state that replication was needed (20.67%), results were in line with previous findings (8.45%) or to discuss the topic in a theoretical manner (2.62%). Like Makel et al. (2012), we found that conceptual replications are five times more prevalent than direct replications. Further characteristics of the replication studies are discussed. Taken together, the prevalence of replications in psychology has increased. Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed.","['replications', 'psychology']"

Motiveren kun je leren! Een studie vanuit het perspectief van het kind naar verschillen tussen gecontroleerde en autonome motivatie en de voorkeur die bij deze groepen bestaat voor bepaalde leesactiviteiten.,"Horsten, Kitty","['Mol, S.E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Een goede leesvaardigheid is een belangrijke voorspeller van succes op school en in de maatschappij. De achteruitgang in leesvaardigheid van leerlingen loopt parallel met een afname van leesmotivatie (Feskens et al., 2016; Inspectie van het Onderwijs, 2018). Om de achteruitgang in de leesvaardigheid van leerlingen te voorkomen, is het van belang dat de leesmotivatie verhoogd wordt. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen welke leesactiviteiten in de bovenbouw van de basisschool leerlingen aanspreken en zo de leesmotivatie verhogen. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Welke evidence-based leesactiviteiten in de klas, gebaseerd op de drie componenten van de Zelfdeterminatietheorie, spreken leerlingen aan en in hoeverre speelt hun leesmotivatie daarin een rol?. Bij de Zelfdeterminatietheorie worden er twee soorten lezers onderscheiden: kinderen die uit zichzelf graag lezen (autonomer gemotiveerde lezers) en de kinderen die externe aansporing nodig hebben om te lezen (gecontroleerder gemotiveerde lezers). Volgens ZDT kan de autonome motivatie van leerlingen worden gestimuleerd als leerkrachten voldoen aan de aangeboren psychologische behoeften van leerlingen; autonomie, competentie en relatie (De Naeghel et al., 2016). Om een antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag is een online vragenlijst verspreid en ingevuld. Uit de antwoorden op de vragenlijst bleek dat de twee groepen lezers beide een voorkeur hadden voor leesactiviteiten die autonomie stimuleren en hierin niet onderling van elkaar verschillen. Voor vervolgonderzoek is het van belang dat er meer onderzoek naar evidence based leesactiviteiten wordt gedaan om te bepalen in hoeverre de leesmotivatie van lezers daadwerkelijk wordt bevorderd.","['Leesmotivatie', 'Zelfdeterminatietheorie', 'psychologische basisbehoeften', 'online vragenlijst', 'bovenbouwleerlingen']"

De belangrijke aspecten betreffen: technisch lezen, woordenschat, begrijpen, evalueren en reflecteren, informatie opzoeken en leesplezier. Uit de analyse van de vragenlijst blijkt dat de leerkrachten significant minder kennis zeggen te hebben van het aspect evalueren en reflecteren dan van het aspect woordenschat en begrijpen. Leerkrachten zeggen significant meer tijd te besteden aan de aspecten woordenschat en begrijpen, terwijl er significant minder tijd besteed wordt aan technisch lezen. Verder lijkt het aantal jaar ervaring de zelf gerapporteerde kennis van de aspecten niet te voorspellen. Leerkrachten met een aanvullende taalcursus geven gemiddeld aan meer kennis te hebben over alle aspect dan leerkrachten zonder taalcursus. Voor het aspect woordenschat is dit significant.

Rational Neural Gain Modulation to Demands for Cognitive Stability and Flexibility,"Schneider, Carolin","['Jongkees, B.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Cognitive stability and flexibility are a continuous trade-off. To exert stable task focus, humans need deeper attractor states and higher neural gain to shield distractors. For cognitive flexibility, shallower attractor states and lower gain are beneficial to switch tasks quicker. Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) seem to have problems adjusting stability and flexibility. This study examined the influence of two contextual demands on a computational estimate of neural gain. First, we expected people to increase neural gain with a higher proportion of incongruent stimuli to facilitate focus on the task relevant stimulus dimension. Second, we hypothesised that participants decrease neural gain when presented a short versus long cue to stimulus interval (CSI) to allow faster switching. Generally, we expected individuals with higher levels of ADHD to have lower gain and more difficulties adjusting it. These hypotheses were tested separately with a cued task-switch paradigm online. First, the proportion of incongruent stimuli was manipulated (75% versus 25%). With a high proportion incongruency, participants lowered their incongruency cost and increased switch cost. However, they did not change gain. Second, the CSI length was varied (300ms versus 1000ms). With a short CSI, people lowered gain and made more errors on incongruent switch trials. We found partial support that individuals with self-reported ADHD have less optimal gain. We recommend that individuals work in environments matching their demands. If a task demands focus, one should not work in a flexibility demanding space. When focus and accuracy are required, sufficient time must be given.","['Cognitive Control', 'Stability and Flexibility Trade-Off', 'Gain Modulation', 'Proportion Incongruency', 'Task Preparation Time']"
Cognitive decline in brain metastasis patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy.,"Mafait, Yentl",['Dr. M. De Ruiter'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Brain metastases are the spread of primary cancer elsewhere in the body to the brain, that are typically treated with a technique called stereotactic radiotherapy. Whereas the short-term changes within cognition after stereotactic radiotherapy are widely studied, the long-term effects are still relatively unknown. This longitudinalstudy aimed to assess the late effects of stereotactic radiotherapy on cognitive functioning in patients with brain metastases, emphasizing cognitive decline. In addition, this study compared different methodological approaches to measure cognitive changes and examined possible risk factors of cognitive decline. Forty-two brain metastasis patients completed a validated neuropsychological test battery assessing their cognitive functioning at baseline and nine-months follow-up. The battery yielded ten cognitive outcomes, and we defined cognitive decline as impairment on ≥2 outcomes. We used three approaches to calculate the cognitive decline, namely a Reliable Change Index not correcting for practice effects (RCI), a RCI correcting for practice effects (RCI+PE), change and Z-scores. We tested the three measures of cognitive decline for significant differences, providing insight into the sensitivity of the approaches to measure cognition over time. Lastly, we did determine whether age, the baseline level of cognitive functioning, volume and number of brain metastases were predictive of cognitive decline using a binary logistic regression. Our results revealed a cognitive decline in 31% of brain metastasis patients (p < .001). Most decline was found in verbal memory. In addition, the percentage of patients who showed cognitive decline as measured with the RCI+PE was significantly higher than found with a change in Z-scores (p = .014). No significant predictors of cognitive decline were found (p = .213). In addition to the known immediate cognitive effects (< 6 months after treatment), we demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients with brain metastases still shows cognitive decline nine months after stereotactic radiotherapy. Consequently, clinical decision-making about treatment options and psycho-education should include those late effects. Furthermore, we found that the RCI+PE can significantly detect more cognitive decline than the difference in Z-scores, providing a recommendation for future research to use an RCI+PE as a measure of change in cognition over time.","['Stereotactic radiotherapy', 'Brainmetastases', 'late cognitive changes', 'cognition']"

The topic of play is highly important, given that children develop crucial social, cognitive and emotional skills when playing. We aimed to investigate the relationships between type of play (playing cooperative, solitarily or in parallel with other children) and peer acceptance and rejection. Given that social play is associated with better social skills and better-quality friendships, it was hypothesized that autistic children who spent more time playing cooperatively would be better accepted and less rejected by their peers. On the contrary, solitary and parallel plays have been associated with negative social consequences, and it was therefore expected that children who spent more time playing by themselves or in parallel would be less accepted and more rejected. These associations were not found. Further research is needed into the play behaviors of autistic children, so that we can design better interventions for their inclusivity.",
The effect of pupil size on honesty when facing embodied and online agents,"Barkoczi, Istvan Daniel",['Fabiola Diana'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social robots have emerged in various areas of human endeavor, such as healthcare, education and commerce. Consequently, there has been a surge of research interest on attributes of artificial agents leading to trust and cooperation. It was found that honesty has been a crucial quality in trust and establishing constructive teamwork among humans throughout history. Therefore, In the current paper we examined if honesty towards social robots compared to a human and an on-screen avatar interaction partners is impacted by the manipulation of the pupil size. The pupil size is a subtle but powerful autonomic cue which is implicated in trust and honesty by reflecting the internal states of people. Participants (N=26) played the coin toss game against an avatar on screen, a small embodied robot, and a human confederate, with manipulated pupil sizes (dilated vs. constricted) while we examined the dependent variables of honesty. Subjects earned rewards by reporting a private coin-toss guess to the researcher. We hypothesized that subjects will be most honest when facing agents with dilated pupils, and when playing with the human and embodied artificial agents as opposed to the avatar on screen. In order to test these dependent variables, we carried out a counterbalanced 3x2 Mixed-factor design, where the two factors were the type of agent and the pupil size. By conducting a two-way ANOVA found that participants were most honest in the company of the human interaction partner (F (5, 72) = 5.698; p= 0.005, ω2= 0.110), and accrued the highest both when faced the online avatar (m= 0.996, sd= 0.218) and the embodied robot (m= 1,023, sd= 0.212). On the other hand, our results didn’t support the effect of pupil size on honesty (F (1)=0.871; p=.354, ω2=0.000). We concluded that a small sample size, the features of the robot, and small rewards for dishonesty were limitations of our results. For future research we recommended an incremental or more robust reward scheme and employing robots with varied features while testing the effect of pupil size on honesty.",

The participants consisted of 70 mothers between 25 and 44 years old (M = 32.9 years, SD = 3.9) and their babies who where around 12 months old (M = 378.9 days, SD = 12.8). Based on earlier research, it was predicted that fewer hours of day care would be associated with a more secure attachment relationship. In addition, it was predicted that this relationship would be moderated by the temperament and the gender of the child. Mothers where invited to participate in the Babylab at the Leiden University. The Strange Situation Procedure (Ainsworth, 1978) was used to assess attachment quality and temperament was measured by the Dutch version of the Infant Characteristic Questionnaire (Kohnstam, 1984). Contrary to our hypothesis, it was found that infants who spent more than 20 hours of day care were more securely attached than infants who had less than 20 hours of day care. This difference was found not to be moderated by the level of temperamental difficultness or the gender of the infant. In conclusion, the current study takes a more positive view on more hours of day care for babies around 12 months old. Future research should include factors, such as quality of daycare and caregiver sensitivity, to further clarify the relationship between attachment quality and amount of daycare usage.","['Dagopvang', 'temperament', 'gender']"

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between visual attention and SA in a face-to-face situation. The participants, female university students (n=54), were divided into the high or low SA group (HSA and LSA) based on their LSAS scores. During a conversational task the visual attention to eyes (duration and count of fixations) was recorded by eye-tracking glasses. The HSA group was expected to score lower on visual attention than the LSA group. Furthermore, the level of visual attention was expected to be lower when participants were speaking compared to listening (conversational event), and when discussing an intimate topic compared to less intimate topics (conversational topic). Finally, the effects of event and topic on visual attention were expected to be higher for the LSA group compared to the HSA group. As expected, the HSA group scored significantly lower on duration and count of fixations on eyes than the LSA group. Thus, indicating the level of SA affects the level of visual attention to eyes in a face-to-face situation. Additionally, results showed that when a person is speaking, the level of visual attention to eyes is significantly lower than when they are listening. Furthermore, results indicated that the level of visual attention is not affected by the intimacy of the topic when a person is listening. However, when speaking about a highly intimate topic, there is significantly less visual attention to eyes than when they speak about a less intimate topic. No indications were found that suggest the effect of Event and Topic on visual attention is stronger for LSA compared to HSA. These findings should be compared to future studies, where the COVID-19 pandemic is not affecting the data. Furthermore, future research should consider the role of gender on the relationship between visual attention and SA.","['Visual attention, eye gaze behaviour, eye-contact, social anxiety, event, topic']"

The Curriculum-Based Measurement maze test can be used to monitor the progress of students’ reading performance. This can help teachers in adjusting instructional programs, which can lead to improvement in students’ reading skills. Although most of the previous research showed that maze test scores measure reading skills, one study showed that the scores measure decoding, not text level reading comprehension. The current study investigated whether the maze test also measures text level reading comprehension, through comparing the scores on maze tests with a standard and a scrambled format. The standard maze test was comprehensible on text level, but the scrambled maze test was not: the text was incoherent, because the sentences were placed in a random order. This study also investigated the relations among reading comprehension level, reading motivation level and maze test scores. Two standard and two scrambled maze tests and the Standards of Coherence questionnaire were completed by 140 fifth grade students. Their reading comprehension Cito-scores were also collected. Results showed that students scored higher on the standard than on the scrambled maze test. This suggests that the scores also reflect reading comprehension on text level, which supports the fact that maze tests measure reading skills. The main effects of reading comprehension level and reading motivation level on maze test scores were significant. Both factors seem to be related to reading performance. The interaction-effect of reading motivation level and reading comprehension level was not significant. The relation between reading motivation level and reading scores appears to be the same for weak, average and strong readers. More research is needed to find out if the maze test scores are sensitive for change when interventions are carried out to increase reading skills.","['Curriculum-Based Measurement', 'maze test', 'maze-taak', 'reading comprehension', 'begrijpend lezen', 'reading motivation', 'leesmotivatie']"

Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Hoe ervaren de bovenbouwleerlingen op basisschool Paschalis hun betrokkenheid tijdens de lessen waarbij expliciete directe instructie wordt gegeven? En hoe kan de betrokkenheid vergroot worden? Betrokkenheid wordt gedefinieerd als de mate waarin een leerling actief verbonden is met de leeractiviteit (Fredricks et al., 2004). Om de betrokkenheid van de leerlingen in kaart te brengen zijn vragenlijsten ontwikkeld. 101 participanten hebben de vragenlijst ingevuld. De vragenlijsten bevatten algemene vragen, gesloten vragen die betrekking hebben op de vier dimensies van betrokkenheid - agentic betrokkenheid, gedragsmatige betrokkenheid, emotionele betrokkenheid en cognitieve betrokkenheid - en open vragen. Uit de analyse is gebleken dat de leerlingen significant lager scoren op agentic betrokkenheid in vergelijking tot de andere drie dimensies. Keuzevrijheid en eigen leerdoelen opstellen zouden de agentic betrokkenheid kunnen vergroten. Verder is gebleken dat leerlingen met een hoge of lage vaardigheidsscore bij rekenen niet significant van elkaar verschillen in mate van betrokkenheid. Leerlingen met een hoge vaardigheidsscore voor taal scoren wel hoger op betrokkenheid dan leerlingen met een lage vaardigheidsscore. Verder verschillen leerlingen die rekenen leuk vinden significant in betrokkenheid met leerlingen die rekenen niet leuk vinden. Deze resultaten zijn ook gevonden kijkend naar taal. Leerlingen die rekenen en/of taal leuk vinden scoren dus hoger op betrokkenheid dan leerlingen die rekenen en/of taal niet leuk vinden.

Predicted was that low-power negotiators initiated more optional topics compared to high-power negotiators and that this would lead to a higher negotiation quality and a higher joint outcome. Furthermore, predicted was that high-power negotiators would only initiate the optional topics that were beneficial for them, and that low-power negotiators would initiate all the optional topics. The participants (N=88 dyads) were introduced to a newly developed dyad face-to-face negotiation task, where participants had the option to initiate optional topics beside the mandatory topics, with the goal to expand the pie and reach an optimal outcome. Results show that, against expectations, high-power and low-power negotiators do not differ in the frequency they initiate the optional topics, and power does not have an effect on negotiation quality and joint outcome. Furthermore, not only high-power negotiators initiate optional topics that are beneficial for them, but low-power negotiators do this as well. Suggested is that negotiators are influenced by the way the task is framed and develop an individualistic motivation which stands in the way of creating an integrative and optimal agreement. The effects of unequal power, implications and limitations of the study and future research are further discussed.","['Negotiation', 'Power', 'Unequal power', 'Initiative', 'Expanding the pie']"

Reward Valuation in Bipolar Disorder,"van Koten, Annoek","['Klaassens, B.', 'Vreeker, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Bipolar disorder (BP) is characterized by altering states of depression and mania. During these episodes, psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations can emerge. BP patients can experience reward learning impairments and social deficits, which have been proved to be influenced negatively by psychotic symptoms. To identify more underlying structures of BP, this study examined reward valuation (the process of evaluating and comparing rewards corresponding with different options), the influence of psychotic symptoms on reward valuation and the relationship between social reward valuation and sensitivity for positive feedback. This study was a cross-sectional, observational study with a case-control and correlational design. From the Positive Valence study, a total of 19 patients and 17 controls were included. Reward valuation was measured with two multi-armed bandit tasks (a monetary- and social reward condition). Psychotic symptoms were measured with the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History, the MINI Internationaal Neuropsychiatrisch Interview 5.0.0. and the Basis-24 questionnaire. Social deficits were explored by examining the relationship between total social bandit score and the ‘positive feedback’ score of the Positive Valence Systems Scale. We carried out Mann-Whitney U tests and linear regressions. Results showed no significant differences in total monetary bandit score (U = 138, z = .072, p = .958), and total social bandit score (U = 183, z = .682, p = .510) between patients and controls. Moreover, there was no significant difference in total monetary bandit score (U = 39, z = -1.398, p = .176) and total social bandit score (U = 80, z = -1.023, p = .982) between the participants with and without psychotic symptoms. In addition, total social bandit score was not significantly related to sensitivity for positive feedback (F(1, 32) = 1.457, p = .236). This study found no significant between-group differences in reward valuation and no relationship between social reward valuation and sensitivity for positive feedback, indicating that (social) reward valuation processes possibly differ from other reward processes in this population. Considering the limitations, this study contributed to improving our current taxonomy, highlighting the importance of taking subconstructs and personal differences into account with diagnostics and treatment.","['Reward', 'Bipolar Disorder']"

The results showed that adaptive developmental level, gender, and the proximity of the caretakers do not significantly correlate with the relationship between consensus and challenging behaviour. However, a Mann-Whitney U analysis showed a significant relationship between more consensus and less anti-social behaviour.

The aim of the current study is to investigate if non-adaptive emotion regulation strategies (self-blame, blaming another, catastrophizing and rumination) explain the relationship between experienced child maltreatment and perpetrated child maltreatment. Having non-adaptive emotion regulation strategies are being examined as a mechanism because they have been associated with both experienced child maltreatment and perpetrated child maltreatment. Multiple sources were used to obtain information on child maltreatment: mothers, fathers and children. A total of 234 individuals reported on maltreatment and emotion regulation strategies. Four separate mediation analyses were performed to answer the research question. The results showed that that the relationship between experienced child maltreatment and perpetrated child maltreatment was not mediated by non-adaptive emotion regulation strategies. This applies to all four strategies. In conclusion, having non-adaptive emotion regulation strategies does not explain ITCM. The findings contribute to the knowledge about the cycle of child maltreatment and indicate that ITCM might be explained by other mechanisms. An important goal for future research is to explore an interplay of multiple factors, such as emotional dysregulation and psychopathology.

Ouderlijk gedrag en depressieve symptomen van moeders in relatie tot internaliserend en externaliserend probleemgedrag bij kinderen in de leeftijd van 20 maanden,"Toran, Aylin",['Dr. S.C.J. Huijbregts'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Abstract The purpose of the current study was to shed more light on the relationship between maternal psychopathology and parenting behaviour and problem behaviour in very young children. Previous research has shown that young children's risk factors for developing behavioural problems may be maternal mental health and sensitive parenting behaviour. Children of mothers with psychopathology and poor parental behaviour are more likely to develop behaviour problems, such as internalising and externalising problems. In addition, early behavioural problems confer an increased risk of problem behaviour later. To what extent maternal depression and parenting behaviour are related to each other and both to the problem behaviour in the children has not yet been well studied. In addition, it is also unclear whether the mother's deteriorating parenting behaviour and mental problems might be due to the difficulty in the handling of the child's behavioural problems. The current study examined data retrieved from the longitudinal study Een Nieuw Begin, the fourth wave when children were 20 months old. Two hundred seven mother-child pairs provided information regarding maternal depression symptoms (BDI) and three parental behavioural tendencies (PACOTIS). In the children, internalizing and externalizing behavioural problems (CBCL) were determined. To test the hypotheses, several multiple regression analyses were conducted. On the one hand, it appears that the relationship between maternal depression symptoms is entirely through the overprotective maternal behaviour to the internalizing problems in the child. For the externalizing problem behaviour, it is a partial mediation, i.e., direct and through the overprotective parent behaviour. However, a reciprocate relationship also is apparent. Externalizing problem behaviour predicts the mother's depressive symptoms and internalizing behaviour seems to predict the degree of the overprotective parenting behaviour. These results show linkages between the mother to the young child and from the young child to the mother. Both indices negatively relate to the other, that of the mother and the 20-month-old child. With these insights, it is essential to identify early-onset problems in both mother and child so that with the right interventions, the further development of negative child outcomes can be minimized, together with adverse maternal effects.",
De invloed van gedragsstoornis met psychopathische trekken op empathie en agressie onder jeugdige delinquentien,"Kon, Wei Min","['Aghajani, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Research has shown that empathy and aggression are important components of Conduct Disorder (CD). The correlations between psychopathic traits and empathy and aggression have also been extensively investigated, but existing literature shows that more insight is needed into the distinction between cognitive and affective empathy and proactive and reactive aggression and the specific role of psychopathic traits. In the present study of 78 Dutch boys aged 15 to 19 years, the specific influence of CD with psychopathic traits on cognitive and affective empathy and proactive and reactive aggression was investigated. The sample was subdivided into boys with CD and psychopathic traits (CD/Psy+) (n= 27) and boys with CD without psychopathic traits (CD/Psy-) (n = 25). These boys all came from forensic institutions. In addition, a control group was also included (CON) (n = 26) and all of the participants completed self-reports. Results showed that CD/Psy+ youngsters scored significantly lower on affective empathy compared to CON youngsters and significantly higher on proactive and reactive aggression compared to CD/Psy- and CON youngsters. However, no significant differences were found between the groups in terms of cognitive empathy. These findings are important for understanding the development of conduct disorder and psychopathic traits and suggest that affective empathy and proactive and reactive aggression should be considered especially in the diagnosis and treatment of boys with delinquent behavior.","['gedragsstoornis', 'psychopathische trekken', 'empathie', 'agressie', 'jeugdigen', 'delinquenten']"
Set from birth or acquired through life? An explorative pupillometric study on homeostatic regulation,"Schuurman, Paul P.G.H.","['Verschoor, S.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Modern research in cognitive neuroscience aims to understand the persistent human experience of selfhood. In extension to this, recent research proposed a fundamental difference between homeostatic regulation and goal-directed behaviour. Our approach suggests that these two may be prone to the very same learning principles of action-effect learning, and therefore share a cognitive overlap. This study investigated this overlap by applying action-effect learning to pupillometric data. The design consisted of three phases, during which subjects looked at a LED screen whilst the eye tracker collected data. In the first phase, an average pupil size of subjects was established in three different light conditions (neutral, high and low luminance). In the second phase pupillometric adjustment to high and low luminance was paired to two different tones, establishing action-effect bindings. In the third phase, these tones were presented again to the subject, to check whether they still made corresponding pupil adjustments. 53 healthy adults completed the experiment. Results indicate no significant difference in pupillometric adjustment between the two sounds presented in the last phase. Although these results present no evidence for a cognitive overlap between goal-directed behaviour and homeostasis, conclusions should be drawn with caution. Potential factors of noise in the pupillometric data are discussed, along with recommendations for future research. Finally, we argue that the design of this study could be applied to a younger group of subjects, as these are more likely to achieve cognitive control over homeostasis.","['Action-effect Bindings, Associations, Body Ownership, Cognition, Eye Tracking, Goal-directed Behaviour, Homeostasis, Ideomotor, Learning, Pupillometry, Pupil Size, Selfhood']"
Het sociale welbevinden van kinderen en adolescenten met een autismespectrumstoornis en de rol van sekse: -,"Scherpenzeel, Sophie van","['Pieterse, K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Objective Social communication is an important part of our daily life. For children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) this can be a problem, because lower social communication competence is one of the main characteristics of ASD. Problems in social communication can lead to fewer friendships, social isolation and loneliness. Consequently children and adolescents with ASD might be at risk for a lower social wellbeing. Therefore the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between social communication and social wellbeing among children and adolescents with ASD. Additionally, the influence of gender on this relationship was examined. Girls with ASD seem to have more social motivation and therefore their problems in social communication might have a more negative effect on their social wellbeing. Method The current quantitative correlational study included 45 participants with ASD between the ages of 8 and 18 from the Netherlands. To measure social wellbeing the participants filled in the Dutch Personality Questionnaire and to measure social communication the Social Responsiveness Scale was filled in by their parents. Results A linear regression analysis showed no significant relationship between social communication and social wellbeing. A T-test showed no significant difference in social wellbeing between boys and girls with ASD. A moderation analysis showed no significant interaction effect of gender and social communication on social wellbeing. Therefore all hypotheses are rejected. Conclusion The findings of this study are in conflict with earlier research. This can possibly be explained by the small sample size, the uneven distribution of gender and the chosen method for measuring social wellbeing. Therefore the findings of this study should be interpreted cautiously. More research on the effect of ASD on social wellbeing and on girls with ASD is necessary to improve the wellbeing of children and adolescents with ASD.",['Autisme Welbevinden Sekse Jeugdigen']

In order to be able to prevent negative long-term effects of externalizing problem behavior and offer these children appropriate help, it is important to examine what could be the cause of this behavior. The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between social-cognitive skills, facial emotion recognition and externalizing behavior problems in primary school-aged children. The current study focused on the differences between boys and girls and the influence of sex on these relationships. This study is part of the Preventive Intervention Trajectory; an ongoing identification and intervention project of the city of Amsterdam and the University of Leiden which focuses on children at high risk of developing criminal behavior. Participants in the current study were 6-to-12-year-old children with externalizing problem behavior (N =179) (M = 9.9; SD = 1.77). The sample consisted of 144 boys (80.4%) and 35 girls (19.6%). Facial emotion recognition was measured with the Facial Emotion Recognition test, social-cognitive skills were measured by the Sociaal-Cognitieve Vaardigheden Test and externalizing behavioral problems were measured using the Externalizing Problem Score of the Teacher’s Report Form. The results on the independent samples t-tests showed no significant difference between boys and girls on the social-cognitive skills and facial emotion recognition skills. The results on the multiple regression analysis showed that social cognition and facial emotion recognition do not appear to be predictors of externalizing behavior problems in which the moderation analysis showed that sex does not significantly influence this relationship. Social-cognitive skills, facial emotion recognition and sex do not seem to be explanatory factors for externalizing problem behavior in primary school-aged children. Longitudinal studies are recommended to examine whether these results will change as children get older.","['Externaliserend probleemgedrag, sociaal-cognitieve vaardigheden, visuele emotieherkenningsvaardigheden']"
Promoting empathetic abilities of Dutch police officers through VR perspective-taking: a proof of concept,"Bakema, Abel","['Prochazkova, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Contemporary police officers often lack a proper understanding of civilian’s mental states required to deliver an appropriate empathic response. Recently, virtual reality (VR) emerged as a promising medium to promote empathy, offering several crucial advantages over traditional methods. However, as research is limited on VR empathy training, its effectiveness and practical utility for the police remains unclear. This study investigated the effectivity and utility of two VR empathy tools for the Dutch police force. In this study, 11 Dutch police officers were immersed in two simulations of the perspectives of a child victim of domestic violence (DV) and a person living with a mild intellectual disability (MID), in counterbalanced order. Results showed that, in line with the hypotheses, for the DV simulation, participants’ illusionary feeling of presence in the virtual world predicted their emotional involvement with the experience, and in turn, this emotional involvement predicted empathy towards victims of domestic violence. Contrary to the hypotheses, for the MID simulation, presence did not predict emotional involvement. Yet, in line with the hypotheses, emotional involvement did predict empathy towards people living with a mild intellectual disability. Combined with insights from post-simulation interviews, both VR empathy tools are concluded to be effective and useful for Dutch police empathy training. These findings highlight VR’s potential to shape scalable and standardardized training opportunities to support the complex role of contemporary policing. Future research could extend our approach by including a control group and by making a direct comparison between VR, traditional perspective-taking tasks, and roleplay empathy training.","['Virtual reality', 'perspective-taking', 'presence', 'immersion', 'empathy', 'emotional involvement', 'cybersickness', 'police officers', 'training', 'social skills', 'domestic violence', 'mild intellectual disability.']"

There is found a significant link between alexithymia and problematic internet use, problematic social media behavior and game addiction. The literature is not clear in which direction the relationship is headed and there are doubts about the quality of the consulted studies. Lack of a longitudinal study ensures that there is no causal relationship between the variables.

The current study also analyzes children’s offline comprehension after reading the story. The 83 participants each read, listened to, and watched a story and were asked to think aloud in between reading, hearing or watching parts of the story. The thinking aloud showed the number of inferences they made. Also the participants were asked to answer some questions about the story after they read, heard or watched it fully. These questions showed the degree of comprehension. The results indicated that there was no difference in the number of bridging inferences children make while reading, hearing or watching a story. The results also indicated that there was no difference within the different kinds of bridging inferences; the connecting and reinstatement inferences. Concerning the offline comprehension after reading the story, the results indicated that children showed more comprehension of the story when it was presented in video format compared to the text format. No other significant differences were found between the different formats. These results can help to present new information to kids in a way that will make them understand best.

De invloed van persoonlijke interesse op het begrijpen van teksten bij lezers,"Eversdijk, Laura",['Mw. Dr. A. Helder'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Results from a large-scale reading research literature study show that Dutch students are less able to read and that they enjoy reading less than they did before. To improve the reading level and increase the reading pleasure, it is important to know which factors influence reading comprehension. The current research investigates the influence of the reader's personal interest in a text and whether this applies to both literal questions and inferential questions. The original plan was to collect data from primary school students, but this has not been possible due to the closure of primary schools as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. That is why data has been collected from adults from family and friends. The participants (N = 18) were asked to read three texts in which they were highly interested and three texts in which they were not very interested. They then answered three literal and three inferential questions after reading each text. The question type refers to whether the reader answers literal questions, questions for which the answer is literally stated in the text, or inferential questions. Inferential questions are questions that require the reader to link parts of information from the text to each other. The results show that many participants achieved high scores and that personal interest has no effect on the reader’s reading comprehension. Furthermore, there’s no significant difference between literal or inferential questions and the level of interest and question type do not interact with each other on how well the text is understood. Therefore, it seems from this research that the personal interest of the reader in a text does not influence the reader’s reading comprehension and that literal questions are not easier to answer than inferential questions. For children, the results may be different.","['reading comprehension, personal interest, standard of coherence']"

Secondly, externalizing behavior is likely to be influenced by the moral competence. Previous research indicates that morality and flexibility are individually related to externalizing problem behavior, but the combined influence has not yet been studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there were associations between morality, flexibility and externalizing problem behavior. Participants were 331 children at risk of developing problem behavior, aged between 8 to 14 years (M=10,7; SD=1.53) with 77% children identified as male and 23% as female. Participants were originally recruited for the Preventief Interventie Team (PIT)-study. Externalizing problem behavior was measured with the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1997), cognitive flexibility with Amsterdamse Neuropspychologische Taken (De Sonneville, 1996) and morality with Turiel questionnaire (Turiel, 1966). Results indicated that participants with poorer moral and flexibility skills, unexpectedly did not show more problem behavior than children with better moral and flexibility skills. Additional research is needed to help further understand these associations, where it should be taken into account that the choice for certain instruments and measures to represent specific constructs may have to be refined. Also, when questionnaires are used, it may be preferable to have multiple informants. And finally, specific constructs of interest may best be measured in different ways.",

"The Influence of Catastrophizing, Neuroticism and Anxiety on Attentional Bias Towards Itch","Sanchez Saura, Ines","['Becker, J.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Itch is a common unpleasant sensation that comes with the urge to scratch. Itch draws our attention and can be adaptive to humans in order to alert individuals to potential threats. At the same time, itch can impair daily functioning and strongly disrupt an individual’s quality of life when it becomes chronic. Even though itch is a prevalent symptom, research investigating an attentional bias towards itch, the tendency to pay attention towards itch-related stimuli over other stimuli, is scarce. Findings in this field are mixed and the divergent results might be explained by individual characteristics. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of individual characteristics; namely neuroticism, catastrophizing and anxiety, on attentional bias towards itch by conducting a secondary analysis. Results from seven similar studies examining an attentional bias towards itch and individual characteristics were analyzed using a multilevel modeling analysis. All these studies used the dot-probe task to measure an attentional bias towards itch-related information (words or pictures). Additionally, several self-report questionnaires were administered, which were related to the individual characteristics. A total of 577 healthy participants were included. Results did not indicate an attentional bias towards itch-related words or pictures. Also, the individual characteristics, neuroticism, catastrophizing and anxiety, did not influence one’s attentional bias towards itch. This secondary analysis was a first step in combining findings on attentional bias towards itch and exploring its relationship with individual characteristics. Further research is warranted to optimize attentional bias measures and conduct more studies that focus on the influence of individual characteristics and attentional bias towards itch.","['attention', 'attentional bias', 'itch', 'dot-probe task', 'individual characteristics', 'catastrophizing', 'neuroticism', 'anxiety']"

The Sexual Double Standard (SDS) entails that women are evaluated more negatively than men for engaging in similar sexual behavior. Gender stereotypes are perpetuated through the language used by parents in conversation with their children. In this study, SDS-related gender messages parents pass on toward their children will be investigated. Methods. This research was conducted with 99 families consisting of a father, a mother and their fifteen-year-old child. Parent’s gender messages were measured through gender vignettes. During an interview, children read vignettes to their parents, regarding adolescents’ promiscuous behavior, which parents had to respond to. Positive and negative evaluations were coded. Associations between the parent’s sex, the child’s sex and the sex of the child in the vignette in relation to parent’s gender messages are being measured through three-way ANOVA’s. Results. A significant main effect was found for the sex of the child in the vignette on parent’s gender messages. Overall, more positive evaluations are given about boys than about girls. Fathers with a son give more positive evaluations about boys than fathers with a daughter. Fathers with a son give more positive evaluations about boys than about girls. Discussion. These findings suggest that parents pass on implicit gender stereotypes that are in line with the SDS by being less positive about girls than about boys. Especially fathers with a son pass on implicit gender stereotypes to their child that are in line with the SDS. These findings provide insights in the subtle gender messages through which parents pass on implicit gender stereotypes.","['seksuele dubbele standaard', 'genderstereotypen', 'ouder-kind interactie']"

The questionnaire, Developmental Behaviour ChecklistAdults (DBCA), was completed for the degree of problem behaviour in clients. The data on absenteeism due to illness was requested from the healthcare institution via HRM. The collected data were analysed using a single and multiple regression analysis. The results show that absenteeism is related to both the experienced support needs of counsellors and the degree of behavioural problems of the client. The experienced support need of supervisors is a greater predictor of absenteeism due to illness. The conclusion is that when counsellors experience less meeting the support needs of the client, there is a higher absenteeism in the workplace. In addition, the degree of behavioural problems plays a role. The higher the degree of the behavioural problem, the more absenteeism there is. The degree of behavioural problems and the experienced support needs of counsellors do not appear to be related to each other.","['ondersteuningsbehoefte, verstandelijke beperking, probleemgedrag, VG ZZP 6, VG ZZP 7, ziekteverzuim']"

Of the two most important immune markers, IL-6 has repeatedly been confirmed to be involved in the association between CA and depressive symptoms. Yet studies investigating the potential role of TNF-α are limited and show inconsistent results. This master thesis investigated the relationship between CA and depressive symptoms, along with the potential moderating effect of TNF-α on this relationship. The study used a cross-sectional design and included an online assessment (session 1) and an in-unit assessment at Addenbrooke’s hospital (Cambridge, UK) (session 2). Severity of CA and depressive symptoms were assessed during session 1 with the use of self-report questionnaires. Baseline TNF-α levels were assessed during session 2 through blood venepunctures. As expected, results revealed that the severity of CA significantly predicts depressive symptoms in adolescence (r2 = .07, p = .02). However, TNF-α levels did not predict depressive symptoms, and TNF-α levels did not moderate the relationship between severity of CA and depressive symptoms in adolescence and young adulthood.","['immune system', 'childhood adversity', 'depressive symptoms']"
Risico op criminaliteit bij kinderen met externaliserend probleemgedrag verkleinen: De rol van leeftijd en sociale cognitie op externaliserende gedragsproblematiek,"Engels, Frederike","['Urbanus, E. L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"According to the social cognitive theory, children go trough a six-step plan when faced with a social situation. After the interaction, the steps taken and the outcome of the social situation are evaluated. This evaluation now becomes part of the child’s so called social schemas, which can be used when facing a novel social situation in the future. However, children with externalizing problem behaviour inadequately use this six-step plan, resulting in the use of unfavourable schemas, leading to a wrong reaction in a social situation. For example, they misread the intentions of the other as hostile and react with an aggressive reaction. The aim of this study is to investigate which social cognitive skills children with externalizing behavioural problems use, how age plays a role in this, and whether social cognitive skills are predictive of behavioural problems. In total, 174 children with externalizing behavioural problems were included in this study; 84 children aged 6-10 years and 90 children aged 10-12 years. Results showed that older children have better control of social cognition than younger children (p<.001). Social cognition however, was not a significant predictor for externalizing behaviour problems in either the younger (p = .920) or older children (p = .778). In conclusion, our results were not in line with the social cognitive theory. However, in order to reduce the risks for adverse outcome in children with externalizing problem behaviour, such as the risk of criminal behaviour, it is important to investigate whether young children with externalizing behaviour problems lag behind on children without these problems. In addition, it is important to investigate which mechanisms underlie externalizing problem behaviour in order to optimally adapt early interventions to the needs of children.","['externalizing behaviour problems', 'social cognition', 'social cognitive theory', 'social cognitive skills']"

The Impact of Openness as a Personality Trait on the Controllability of Voluntary Musical Imagery,"Haring, Annelou",['Dr R . Schaefer'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"English The purposeful experience of voluntary musical imagery is common in daily life, yet, little is known about the influence of fundamental individual characteristics on the ability to control this experience. According to a recent model, two aspects of mental control can be distinguished: initiation, which previously has been linked to the personality trait openness, and a management component, referring to changing, modifying or sustaining musical imagery. The current online study examined whether openness can predict musical imagery's controllability using self-report measures. Participants (n = 136) were instructed to fill in a personality questionnaire and perform manipulations on musical imagery. No significant association between openness and voluntary imagery control was found. This can be explained by the distinction between the mentioned types of cognitive control and their connection with the characteristics of an open personality. As open people constantly seek new experiences, openness is positively linked to action initiation. Although the findings show no positive association between openness and the management component of control, the results contribute to the preliminary insight that the controllability of musical imagery may not be tied to a deep-rooted characteristic such as openness. Further research on personality and voluntary musical imagery control is needed to determine whether this suggestion could indicate that one’s controllability is flexible and subject to musical training.",
Zijn mensen die muziek als coping stijl gebruiken veerkrachtiger?,"Bruijns, Iris",['Dr. J. M. Hall'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Abstract Coping kan veerkracht in mensen vergroten. Muziek kan een vorm zijn van coping. Mensen kunnen muziek gebruiken om emoties te reguleren of hun perspectief te verbreden. Op basis van deze informatie wordt in dit onderzoek getest of mensen die muziek als copingstijl gebruiken veerkrachtiger zijn. Uit de literatuur blijken optimisme en veerkracht gecorreleerd. Daarom wordt rekening gehouden met de invloed van optimisme als covariaat. Aan het onderzoek worden resultaten van 127 respondenten tussen de 18 en 65 jaar meegenomen, die geen last hebben van onoplosbare gehoor- en/of zichtschade. Om de invloed van muziek als copingstijl op veerkracht te testen, wordt een multipele regressieanalyse met optimisme als covariaat uitgevoerd. Uit de multipele regressieanalyse blijkt dat muziek als copingstijl geen significante voorspeller is op de mate van veerkracht. Wat wel wordt bevestigd is dat optimisme een significante voorspellende waarde heeft op de mate van veerkracht. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dus niet dat mensen die muziek als copingstijl gebruiken een grotere veerkracht hebben. Wel blijkt optimisme een sterke voorspeller voor veerkracht en dus is het belangrijk hier rekening mee te houden in onderzoek naar veerkracht. Coping can increase resilience. Music can rule as coping for people. They can use music to regulate their emotions or to expand their thoughts and behaviors. Based on this information, this study tests whether people that use music as copingstyle are more resilient against stressors. Literature states a correlation between optimism and resilience, for this reason the study will add optimism as a covariate. Results of 127 people between the age of 18 and 65 are taken into account for the study, with an inclusion criterium that respondents cannot have problems in hearing and/or sight that cannot be fixed. To test the influence of music as copingstyle on resilience, a multiple regression analysis will be performed, with optimism as a covariate. The multiple regression analysis does not reveal music as copingstyle as predictor for resilience. So apparently from this study we cannot conclude that people that use music as a copingstyle are more resilient. Though what does appear is that optimism is a strong predictor for resilience, which means it is important to take the influence of optimism in account when doing research to resilience.",
De prijs van het hedonisme: De invloed van financiële stress op het genot,"Rademakers, Suze",['M. L. W. Vliek'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Financiële stress kom steeds vaker voor in de huidige maatschappij met de huidige inflatie-piek, stijgende energieprijzen. Steeds meer huishoudens hebben hier last van en staan voor moeilijke financiële keuzes. Aan de ene kant is een hedonistische levensstijl aantrekkelijk en ontspannend, zeker na de corona-jaren, maar het moet ook bekostigd worden. Dit zorgt conflicterende gedachten tussen financiële stress en het mentaal welbevinden. Daarbij kan de prijs van het hedonisme ook het genot beïnvloeden omdat duurder vaak als beter wordt beoordeeld. Het doel van dit onderzoek is ontdekken wat de invloed van financiële stress op het ervaren genot is. Via een online vragenlijst hebben 137 respondenten antwoord gegeven op hun ervaren financiële stress (PIFS), vermogen om te genieten (THC) en het verwachtte genot van vier hedonistische activiteiten met twee prijzenklassen, duur en goedkoop (COH). De analyse is gedaan met een herhaalde meting ANOVA met de PIFS, THC en Prijs als voorspellende waarde voor het ervaren genot (COH). Het hoofdeffect van de PIFS was significant en een positief significant resultaat werd gevonden tussen de goedkope activiteit en het genot ervan. De voorkeur voor de dure activiteit bleef (deels) uit. Ook zijn er significante resultaten gevonden tussen PIFS en COH en dit wijst er op dat mensen met financiële stress minder genieten van dure hedonistische activiteiten. De hypotheses betreft THC zijn niet significant gebleken, wél is er exploratief een significant effect gevonden tussen THC en de hoogte van het maandelijkse spaarbedrag wat men opzij zet voor hedonistische activiteiten, wat reden geeft voor vervolgonderzoek.",
De Prijs van Hedonisme: Een onderzoek naar de invloed van financiële stress op de hoeveelheid plezier uit hedonistische activiteiten,"Glind, Naomi van de",['M. L. W. Vliek'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd om meer te weten te komen over de invloed van financiële stress op het genot bij hedonistische activiteiten. Uit onderzoek van Bernecker en Becker (2021) blijkt dat het genot bij hedonistische activiteiten verstoord kan worden door indringende gedachten over conflicterende lange-termijn doelen. In dit onderzoek zijn deze indringende gedachten gerelateerd aan financiële stress. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd onder Nederlandse volwassenen (N = 137) die een enquête hebben ingevuld via Qualtrics. Deze enquête bestond uit verschillende vragenlijsten, namelijk de Psychological Inventory of Financial Scarcity (PIFS), de Trait Hedonic Capacity (THC) en een eigen opgestelde vragenlijst: de Cost Of Hedonism (COH). De PIFS meet de financiële stress die iemand ervaart en de THC meet de hedonistische capaciteit, met andere woorden: het vermogen om te genieten. De COH meet de verwachte hoeveelheid genot bij vier hedonistische activiteiten, opgedeeld in een goedkoop- en een duur scenario. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat er over het algemeen meer wordt genoten van goedkope, dan van dure activiteiten. Daarnaast is er bewijs voor het effect van financiële stress op genot, waarbij er minder wordt genoten van duurdere activiteiten wanneer er financiële stress wordt ervaren. Echter is er geen significant effect gevonden van de hedonistische capaciteit op de mate van genot bij financiële stress. In dit onderzoek is er gebruik gemaakt van denkbeeldige scenario’s, waarbij vervolgonderzoek zich zou kunnen richten op de uitvoering van deze scenario’s. Dit zal extra informatie opleveren over de hoeveelheid ervaren genot na afloop van een hedonistische activiteit.",

Het kunnen genieten van hedonistische activiteiten is positief gerelateerd aan het mentale welbevinden, dat mensen in staat stelt een zinvol, betrokken en productief leven te leiden. Factoren die deze mate van genot beïnvloeden, hebben dus indirect invloed op het mentale welbevinden. Om de invloed van deze factoren te onderzoeken is er een digitale vragenlijst afgenomen onder een sample Nederlanders van 18 jaar of ouder (N = 137). De vragenlijst bestaat uit drie schalen: de PIFS (financiële stress), de THC-schaal (THC) en vragen over het kunnen genieten van dure vs. goedkope hedonistische activiteiten (prijs en genot). Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat mensen meer kunnen genieten van goedkope hedonistische activiteiten en dat mensen die meer financiële stress ervaren minder kunnen genieten van de dure dan van goedkope hedonistische activiteiten. Er is geen relatie gevonden tussen de mate van genot en de persoonlijkheidseigenschap THC. Ook is er geen sprake van een interactie-effect tussen THC en financiële stress vs. de mate van genot. Deze bevindingen kunnen ingezet worden om het mentale welbevinden te bevorderen door het ondernemen van hedonistische activiteiten. Het verschaft daarnaast kennis omtrent de gevolgen van financiële stress, wat ingezet kan worden om mensen met financiële stress te ondersteunen bij het nastreven van hedonistische doelen, wederom ter bevordering van het welbevinden.",
Het zelfvertrouwen van een Mishandeld Kind: De Relatie tussen Kindermishandeling en Zelfvertrouwen en de Rol van Sekse,"Kwaadsteniet, Marloes de",['M.S. Tollenaar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Background Many children are being maltreated; this causes a lot of psychological problems, such as low self-esteem. A low self-esteem can cause lifelong negative consequences. Goal This study examined the relation between different types of child maltreatment and self-esteem in adolescence and the effect of gender. Methods The data is acquired from a Dutch multi-method two-generation research called RE-PAIR (Janssen et al., 2021). The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form (Bernstein & Fink, 1997) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Avison & Rosenberg, 1981) are completed by 115 respondents (78 girls and 37 boys), of which 80 non-clinical adolescents and 35 adolescents with depression. The relations and moderation are researched via regression analyses. Results Child maltreatment accounts a significant part of the variance in self-esteem (R2=.130; p < .05). Emotional abuse is the strongest negative predictor of self-esteem (β = -.293; t(86) = -2,287; p < .05). In addition, there was an interaction-effect of gender (t(88) = - 2,554; p < .05). In girls, emotional maltreatment is significant negative related to self-esteem (β = -.443; t(61) = -3.856; p = < .001), but not in boys (β = .048; t(27) = .249; p = .805). Discussion Child maltreatment has a negative relation with self-esteem, in which emotional maltreatment in particular plays a key role. Girls’ self-esteem decreases when they have experienced maltreatment. As a next step, we should try to reduce or prevent low self-esteem in maltreated populations.","['child maltreatment', 'self-esteem', 'emotional maltreatment']"
"De ontwikkeling van depressieve symptomen door een verstoord ouder-kindrelatie: De samenhang tussen de band met ouders, zelfvertrouwen en depressieve symptomen","Entezar, Yalda",['M.S. Tollenaar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Depressie onder adolescenten leidt vaak tot ernstige gevolgen op verschillende gebieden, zoals een groter risico op alcohol- en drugsgebruik en suïcide. Hierom is het belangrijk om aspecten die depressie veroorzaken te onderzoeken, zodat deze aanknopingspunten kunnen geven voor interventies die gericht zijn op zowel de preventie als behandeling van depressie onder jongeren. Zelfvertrouwen en een verstoorde band met ouders lijken risicofactoren voor het ontwikkelen van depressieve symptomen of zelfs een depressie. Tegelijkertijd kan de band met ouders, met name de zorg- en warmte die ouders aan hun kinderen geven, invloed hebben op het zelfvertrouwen van het kind. In dit onderzoek toetsen wij of het verband tussen de band met ouders en depressieve symptomen bij het kind gemedieerd wordt door een laag zelfvertrouwen van het kind. Deze relaties zijn onderzocht met behulp van vragenlijstdata van 80 gezonde en 35 met depressie gediagnostiseerde adolescenten tussen de 11 en 17 jaar oud. Uit de regressieanalysen, is gebleken dat adolescenten die minder zorg en warmte krijgen van hun ouders een lager zelfvertrouwen hebben én dat zij vaker depressieve symptomen hebben. Ook is er gebleken dat een laag zelfvertrouwen het verband tussen de band met ouders en depressieve klachten partieel medieert, wat betekent dat kinderen die minder zorg en warmte hebben gehad van hun ouders, meer depressieve symptomen hebben door hun lage zelfvertrouwen. Hiermee kan geconcludeerd worden dat het verband tussen de band met ouders en depressieve symptomen bij het kind partieel gemedieerd wordt door het lage zelfvertrouwen van het kind. De uitkomsten van dit onderzoek kunnen aanknopingspunten geven voor professionals in het diagnosticeren en verminderen van depressie onder adolescenten.","['Parental Bonding, ouder-kind relatie, depressie, zelfvertrouwen, adolescentie']"
COVID-19 gerelateerde angst- en stemmingsproblemen en kwaliteit van leven bij studenten,"Kerkhoff, Rebecca van den",['M.L. Molendijk'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Nadat begin 2020 het coronavirus uitbrak, volgde een, voor veel mensen, moeilijke periode waarin scholen, winkels en andere faciliteiten gesloten werden en er strenge regels waren voor sociale contacten. Onder andere hierdoor heeft de pandemie niet alleen fysieke maar ook mentale gevolgen gehad voor een groot deel van de studenten. In dit onderzoek wordt het verband tussen angst- en stemmingsproblemen en kwaliteit van leven onder studenten biologie en psychologie van de Universiteit Leiden, en een aantal studenten van de campus Den Haag tijdens de Covid-19 pandemie onderzocht. Daarnaast hebben we gekeken naar genderverschillen in angst- en stemmingsproblemen en kwaliteit van leven en de verbanden hiertussen. De data is verzameld door middel van een vragenlijst. Uiteindelijk waren er 478 participanten met een gemiddelde leeftijd van 22.3. Hiervan was 55.6 procent vrouw. Er is een correlatie tussen angst- en stemmingsproblemen en (verminderde) kwaliteit van leven onder deze studenten tijdens de coronaperiode (τb = 0.197; p < 0.001 en τb = 0.074; p = 0.040). Er zijn geen significante verschillen tussen mannelijke en vrouwelijke studenten gevonden. We kunnen hieruit concluderen dat studenten met angst- en stemmingsproblemen tijdens de Covid-19 pandemie een slechtere kwaliteit van leven rapporteren (en andersom) en dat hierin geen verschil is tussen mannen en vrouwen. Dat we geen genderverschillen gevonden hebben, is op verschillende manieren te verklaren. Mogelijk ligt het aan het type man wat zich in onze populatie bevond. In verder onderzoek kunnen onder andere blijvende gevolgen, andere bevolkingsgroepen en de effecten van strenge maatregelen worden onderzocht. After the coronavirus broke out in the beginning of 2020, for most people, a difficult time followed; schools, shops and other facilities closed down and there were strict rules for social contacts. Partly because of this, the pandemic had, not only physical, but also mental consequences for a lot of students. In this research we examine the correlation between anxiety and mood problems and quality of life among biology and psychology students of Leiden University, and some students from Campus The Hague during the pandemic. We also looked at gender differences in anxiety and mood problems and quality of life and the correlations between them. We collected the data through a questionnaire. We ended up with 478 participants with an average age of 22.3. 55.6 percent of participants were female. We found a significant correlation between anxiety and mood problems and (worsened) quality of life among these students during the pandemic (τb = 0.197; p < 0.001 en τb = 0.074; p = 0.040). No significant gender differences were found. Our conclusion is that students with anxiety and mood problems during the pandemic report a lower quality of life (and the other way around) and that there is no difference between male and female students. Not finding any gender differences can be explained in different ways. Possibly our population included a specific type of man that is more prone to depression and/or anxiety. In further research lasting effects, other populations and the effects of strict regulations can be examined.",
"Gedragsinhibitie, Slaapproblemen, en geslacht: Ervaren extreem verlegen Nederlandse kinderen slaapproblemen?","Bernadina, Vyviana",['L.J. Vreeke'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Achtergrondinformatie: er is een grote variabiliteit bij kinderen waargenomen in de normatieve ontwikkeling van slaap, wat suggereert dat diverse factoren individuele verschillen in slaappatronen beïnvloeden en bijdragen aan het ontstaan van slaapproblemen. Een van de sleutelfactoren die invloed heeft is het temperament van het kind. Uit onderzoek buiten Nederland blijkt dat kinderen bij wie hun temperament gekenmerkt wordt door een negatieve stemming, een hoge mate teruggetrokkenheid en een slecht zelfregulerend vermogen ‘s nachts meer last hebben van slaapproblemen. Dit gedragskenmerk wordt ook wel gedragsinhibitie genoemd en zegt iets over de sociabiliteit dimensie van temperament. Ongeacht deze bevindingen, is er geen studie gedaan die deze relatie heeft onderzocht onder Nederlandse kinderen. Doel: dit exploratief onderzoek zal de relatie tussen gedragsinhibitie en slaapproblemen opnieuw bestuderen onder Nederlandse kinderen. Ook wordt er gekeken naar verschillen op geslacht. Methode: de Behavioral Inhibition Questionnaire – Short Form (BIQ-SF vragenlijst) en de Kinder Slaap Diagnose Lijst (KDSL-vragenlijst) is ingevuld door 5003 ouders van kinderen tussen 4 en 7 jaar. Data van deze twee vragenlijsten werden gebruikt om diverse analyses uit te voeren in IBM SPSS Statistics 28. Resultaten: er is een significante samenhangt tussen gedragsinhibitie en de mate van slaapproblemen. Er is ook een significant verschil tussen Nederlandse jongens en meisjes en hun mate van slaapproblemen. Discussie: van dit onderzoek kunnen we concluderen dat er een positieve relatie aanwezig is tussen gedragsinhibitie en slaapproblemen en dat er een verschil is tussen Nederlandse jongens en meisjes in hun mate van ervaarde slaapproblemen, maar niet hun niveau van gedragsinhibitie.","['gedragsinhibitie, slaapproblemen, geslacht']"

Het ontwikkelen van een classificatiemodel aan de hand van vroeg detecteerbare biomarkers kan bijdragen aan vroegdiagnostiek. Een predictiemodel met een beperkt aantal predictoren is beter interpreteer- en toepasbaar in de klinische setting. Structurele MRI is een kosteneffectieve, niet-invasieve methode om biomarkers te detecteren. In dit onderzoek zijn de structurele MRI-data van 173 cognitief gezonde controles en 76 individuen met de Ziekte van Alzheimer gebruikt in een LASSO-regressieanalyse. Een lage lambda penalty wordt gebruikt voor het verkrijgen van een predictiemodel met meer predictoren en een hoge lambda penalty om een predictiemodel met een beperkt aantal predictoren te verkrijgen. Kruisvalidatie wordt toegepast om de lambda waardes vast te stellen en de accuratesse van de modellen te schatten. Het predictiemodel met een beperkt aantal predictoren leverde een uitstekende accuratesse van de classificatie van de Ziekte van Alzheimer op ten opzichte van cognitief gezonde controles (AUC = .929). Vervolgonderzoek zal moeten uitwijzen of een predictiemodel met een beperkt aantal predictoren ook accuraat is in het classificeren van de Ziekte van Alzheimer ten opzichte van andere ziektebeelden in de klinische setting.",

In deze studie worden de verschillen in kaart gebracht tussen de attitude van ouders en zorgverleners ten aanzien van acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit van verschillende placebotoepassingen die ingezet kunnen worden als aanvulling op een reguliere ziekenhuisbehandeling voor kinderen. Nederlandse ouders van kinderen onder de 18 jaar die recent een ziekenhuisbehandeling hebben ondergaan en pediatrische zorgverleners hebben een online vragenlijst ingevuld. Ouders (n=22) scoorden lager op acceptabiliteit (p-waarden tussen .025 en .563) en verwachte effectiviteit (p-waarden tussen .003 en .389) van zeven placebotoepassingen dan zorgverleners (n=143). Minder transparante placebotoepassingen (bijvoorbeeld crème zonder actieve stoffen) kregen lagere scores van zowel ouders als zorgverleners dan andere toepassingen (bijvoorbeeld naar muziek luisteren). De scores op acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit hingen grotendeels met elkaar samen (p-waarden ≤ .093), waarbij bij bepaalde placebotoepassingen grote verschillen werden gezien in de mate van samenhang tussen acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit tussen ouders en zorgverleners. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat zorgverleners placebotoepassingen in de ziekenhuiszorg voor kinderen meer acceptabel en effectief vinden dan ouders. Ouders en zorgverleners komen wel overeen in welke placebotoepassingen zij het meest acceptabel en effectief vinden. De scores van ouders op acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit hingen meer met elkaar samen bij bepaalde placebotoepassingen dan bij zorgverleners. Deze studie suggereert de noodzaak om verder onderzoek te doen naar de achterliggende redenen van de verschillen tussen ouders en zorgverleners en tussen placebotoepassingen.",

Bystanders, or from now revered as guardians, have seemed to help prevent crime according to different studies (Cohen & Felson, 1979; Reynald, 2009; Van Sintemaartensdijk et al., 2022; Wortley, 2008). But this has not been researched more broadly, especially with the knowledge that the impact of the role a guardian conducts can have an influence. Our behaviour is also created by social norms, so what is socially accepted or not, which can also have an influence on criminals, but this has not been studied much yet (Clapp & McDonnel, 2000). Therefore, in this study I will not only look at the effect of guardians, but also at the effect of the different roles a guardian has. I conducted an experiment where participants had to steal a crate from a bike in a bike shed. The participants were placed in one of three conditions, active guardians, passive guardians, and no guardians. During the experiment the time was measured to see how long each participant needed to steal the crate. Afterwards they had to fill in a questionnaire about anonymity and personality traits. The data was then analysed with SPSS. After a manipulation check the data showed that the participants in the passive guardian conditions took the longest amount of time to steal a crate, and the no guardian condition the least amount. But when comparing the effect between guardians (active and passive together) and no guardians the data showed that the participants in the no guardian condition took the least amount of time to steal. The main question could not be answered clearly, but the data showed other important information which could still be very useful for crime prevention and other studies on this subject.",

Molendijk'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The Covid-19 (C19) pandemic has had mentionable impact on the global mental health. During this time, especially young adults have been at risk for developing mood and anxiety issues. This risk may be related to undesirable changes in health behaviours such as alcohol use (AU), eating behaviour (EB) and physical activity (PA). This thesis aimed to investigate whether changes in health behaviours are related to mental health. Data was collected via questionnaires. Students in the Netherlands (N = 481) filled out questions concerning changes in health behaviours, mood and anxiety levels, during the first half year of the C19 pandemic. Regarding both mood and anxiety levels, more participants reported an undesirable effect than a neutral effect, and more participants reported a neutral effect than a positive effect, due to the pandemic. For all examined health behaviours, desirable changes as well as undesirable changes were reported. No significant association was found between AU and mood (F(1, 212) = .36, p > .30) or anxiety levels (F(1, 212) = .03, p > .30). Nor between EB and mood (U = 767.00, p > .10) or anxiety levels (U = 611.50, p > .30). Nor between PA and mood (U = 603.50, p > .30) or anxiety levels (U = 580.50, p > .25). It can be concluded that there is no proof for an association between changes in health behaviours and mental health, in young adults during the C19 pandemic. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed, along with suggestions for future research.","['Covid-19, health behaviour, mood, anxiety']"

Emotional maltreatment in childhood has been found to be associated with the development of depressive disorder later in life. Mental health problems often originate during adolescence, which is a period when important perceptions of the self are developing, including a person's various self-aspects. The purpose of this study was to examine whether emotional child maltreatment is related to the degree of adolescent self-expression toward others. We also examined a possible mediation effect of the degree of expression between emotional maltreatment and the degree of depressive symptoms. Adolescents (n = 115) were required to complete self-report questionnaires related to the extent of depressive symptoms (PHQ) and emotional childhood maltreatment (JTV). Current study looked at the relation between the questionnaires and the number of characters used to describe themselves towards others (Profieltaak). The study found that emotional childhood maltreatment was positively associated with the degree of depressive symptoms. However, it also showed that there was no association between self-descriptions and the degree of depressive symptoms or self-descriptions and emotional child maltreatment and hence no mediation effect of a person's self-aspect. The current research partly shows results that are inconsistent with previous studies, this can be possibly explained by the fact that the concept of self-aspects has not been examined this way before. The current study only looked at the correlation crossectionally, future research could focus on the causal relationship between depressive symptoms and self-aspects, which may be useful developing treatments.","['Adolescence, Depression, self-aspect, Emotional childhood maltreatment, self-concept']"
The digital punishment puzzle: The prevention and escalation effect of digital repression,"Medek, Paulina","['Köhler, K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The digitalisation of political expression impacted social movement organisation. The global proliferation of information and communication technology (ICT) digitalised social movements towards networked collective action. This fuelled the optimism about ICTs as liberalisation tool. Yet, authoritarian regimes showed increasing sophistication in digital repression which urges to investigate the link between digital repression (DR) and mobilisation. I use complementary insights from connective action theory and disconnective action theory to address the research question: What is the effect of DR on mobilisation? By arguing DR is multi-dimensional, the goal of this analysis is to establish the relationship between DR and mobilisation in authoritarian regimes. To this end, I conduct a systematic, global analysis. With an OLS regression, my large-N study analyses authoritarian regimes from 2000 until 2021. The findings are qualitatively supported with two case studies to address endogeneity concerns. On the one hand, I expect a prevention effect on mobilisation if DR is performed as long-term information manipulation. On the other hand, I hypothesise an escalation effect on mobilisation if DR is executed in form of a short-term information vacuum. Though the results are mixed, I conclude that there is initial support for both prevention and escalation effect of DR. I derive that DR is multi-dimensional and can prevent, but also escalate mobilisation.","['digital repression', 'digitalisation', 'connective action', 'mobilisation', 'punishment puzzle', 'repression mobilisation nexus']"

Discourse analysis on collective action and rebel movements in Europe; Analysing collective action in the Irish Republican Army and Euskadi Ta Askatasuna: How can collective action explain the success or failure of a rebellion?,"Gorter, Maximilian",['Rutger Hagen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Most studies that examine the relationship between rebel movements and collective action often only tackle a certain dimension of the rebel movement. This being either the creation of a rebellion, the methods that are used to reach the set-out goal by a rebellion, or the way in which collective action can explain the resolution to the conflict. This thesis attempts to provide a clear explanation that is grounded in the study of collective action and is applicable to all the above-mentioned dimensions of a rebel movement. The goal of this thesis is to expose how collective action can explain the success or failure of a rebellion. In this thesis, a discourse analysis on the relationship between the rebel experience, which encompasses the creation, mobilisation, used tactics and behaviour during attempts at peace by the movement, and the solving of collective action problems which are associated with rebel movements was carried out. This relationship was further assessed by examining two examples of rebel movements who were active in Europe. These cases are the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA). The analysis provided insight into the importance of leaders within a rebel movement. From assessing the cases, it was established that leaders utilised certain collective action solutions, to overcome the associated collective action problems a rebellion deals with. Further assessment into the cases of both the IRA and ETA established that the willingness and capability of leaders to form peace, is instrumental in the ultimate success or failure of a rebel movement. ultimately, the relevance of leaders in solving collective action problems in a rebellion requires more research to explain where and why rebellions fail or succeed.","['Collective Action', 'Rebellions', 'ETA', 'IRA', 'Ostrom']"

My End is my Beginning: Adverse Childhood Experiences as a Predictor for Suicidal Ideation in Leiden University Students,"Hafkemeyer, Svea","['Bahamondes-Álvarez, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The prevalence rate of suicidal ideation among university students is high. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), as a social determinant of mental health, are amongst many predictive factors that influence suicidal ideation. This research paper aimed to investigate the effect that different childhood maltreatment types (physical abuse/ neglect, emotional abuse/ neglect, and sexual abuse) have on adolescents’ suicidal ideation (aged 17-26). To investigate those effects in a non-clinical population, a cross-sectional study was conducted amongst Leiden University students (N = 133). The data was collected via two online Self-Report Questionnaires (the Suicidal Ideation Attribution Scale and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form). While adverse childhood experiences were reported in 35,3 percent of respondents, suicidal ideation was present in 51,9 percent of the respondents. Overall, the simple linear regression model provided clear results on the predictive effect ACEs have on adolescents’ suicidal ideation (F(1, 131) = 17.419, p < .001, R² = 0.117). According to the multiple linear regression model, only emotional abuse proved to be a significant maltreatment predictor of suicidal ideation (t(127) = 3.989, p < .001, f ² = .27). The obtained results can serve as a justification for the inclusion of social determinants as a direct predictor of suicidal ideation in existing theories and models. Further, the findings can provide vindication for policy changes and the execution of better suicide prevention work on multiple levels of society. If the findings are implemented successfully, then “one’s Beginning no longer has to be one’s End”.","['mental health', 'social determinants', 'adverse childhood experiences', 'suicidal ideation', 'adolescence', 'university students']"
The Role of Neurocognitive Networks in Rumination in Healthy Volunteers – an fMRI Study,"Seherr-Thoß, Alia-Jody Freiin von",['Mischa de Rover'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"High levels of trait rumination put people at risk for developing multiple forms of psychopathology. Therefore, to be able to develop prevention programmes, it is essential to investigate the mechanism underlying rumination. Although the connection between rumination and psychopathology has been investigated and neurocognitive networks involved in rumination have been identified, most of the studies focus on the neural correlates of rumination in individuals with a mental disorder, predominantly depression. Little is known about the relationship between trait rumination and the functioning of neurocognitive networks in healthy people. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between level of trait rumination and functional connectivity within three core neurocognitive networks: Default Mode Network (DMN), Salience Network (SN), and Central Executive Network (CEN), in healthy volunteers with high or low trait rumination scores. It was hypothesised that the high-trait rumination group would show significantly stronger functional connectivity within the DMN, and within the SN compared to the low-trait rumination group and that the opposite pattern would emerge for the CEN. The results show that there are no significant differences between high- and low-trait ruminators in relation to functional connectivity strength within the three networks of interest. These findings indicate that the association between rumination and aberrant functional connectivity within the networks of interest may be unique to clinical populations. Therefore, aberrant functional connectivity within the DMN, SN, and CEN in relation to rumination may serve as a marker for psychopathology, rather than as a risk factor, in the future.","['default mode network, executive control network, fMRI, rumination, salience network']"

"The Role of Stereotypes, Social Motive and Power Distribution Within Mixed-gender Group Negotiations","Grijs, Tristan de","['Steinel, W.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Negotiating is an intricate process and crucial to finding success in all facets of life. Constructs such as stereotype endorsement and threat, social motives and power distributions play an important role in negotiations. Negotiations are not limited to dyads; often they take place in a group setting. Whilst both men and women negotiate, there appear to be differences in performance between the two. The question that this paper looks to address is what the influence of stereotype endorsement and stereotype threat is on the outcome of both pro-self and pro-socially motivated, mixed gender groups, where power is dispersed unequally. The two main hypotheses that follow are that men in the leadership position will outperform women in the leadership position in the pro-self motivated condition. Furthermore, groups with a female leader will outperform groups with a male leader in the pro-socially motivated condition. To investigate this, 204 participants were recruited into 68 three person groups, comprising 105 men and 99 women. They played a negotiation game, emulating the owners of a beach club. Their scores and answers on a questionnaire following the game were brought into analysis. Results show that men and women perform better or worse depending on the social motive and the power distribution of the negotiation. Also, the leader is especially impacted by stereotypes surrounding their gender. The differences between men and women might be explained by the effects of gender stereotypes. Being aware of the influence of gender stereotypes on negotiation performance might serve individuals well in order to increase their performance in negotiations.","['group negotiations', 'gender', 'stereotypes', 'social motive', 'power distribution']"

Poelenburg and Oude Westen, two ‘deprived’ neighborhoods in the Netherlands, are the stage of this research. The article follows the analysis of social stratification as a structure in which people are hierarchized along the lines of their social role in that structure. This hierarchy causes for unequal resource allocation, spatial segregation and stigmatization. This is shown in a lack of cultural, social, economic and symbolic capital by the residents in both neighborhoods. However, the findings of this research show how institutional actors in each neighborhood are creating a framework of opportunities for the youth. Consequently, the youth become active agents in accumulating capital by countering the assumed habitus of the fields they engage in. The research concludes with four examples of how the youth in Poelenburg and Oude Westen are claiming power by accumulating capital. This poses an answer to the main research question: How do youth and institutional actors in Oude Westen and Poelenburg co-create opportunities wherein the youth can accumulate capital by countering the assumed habitus of their social fields and thereby claiming power to, power with and power from within?","['youth', 'migration', 'neighborhood']"
"Emotional neglect and empathy: Does childhood emotional neglect predict lower empathy, when controlling for the other types of abuse?","Sopala, Laura","['Hoogenboom, A.W.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction: Childhood maltreatment (CM) is an increasing phenomenon, with lifelong consequences. Specifically emotional neglect (EN) still often goes unnoticed, while its devastating consequences are becoming more clear. One of them seems to be lowered empathy in adulthood, which affects people’s relationships, quality of life and can lead to antisocial or criminal behavior. Unfortunately there are not a lot of studies differentiating between the different types of CM and empathy. EN is also the least studied form of CM. Since the unique contribution of EN is not well researched, this study investigated the role of EN on empathy. Method: Online self-report questionnaires were used, measuring childhood maltreatment and empathy (cognitive and affective) in general population (N = 187). Multiple linear regression was applied to test the effects. Results: Emotional and physical neglect predicted lower empathy scores (total). EN also predicted lowered affective empathy. Furthermore emotional abuse predicted higher (total, cognitive and affective) empathy scores. Discussion: Neglect seems to play a role in reducing empathetic abilities, while emotional abuse increases them. These results need to be taken with caution as there are several limitations of this study, such as the self-report, retrospective method in a not representative sample. There is also not a lot of other studies to either confirm or challenge these findings. Future studies should differentiate between all types of CM and empathy. They should also be done in a representative sample, with a multi-method approach.","['childhood maltreatment, emotional neglect, empathy, cognitive empathy, affective empathy']"

Global Climate Governance: The realisation of the Paris Agreement in China and its changed perspective on the implementation of environmental policy,"Treuren, Ilja","['Heaphy, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"During the last decades, climate change appeared at the centre of the academic, political, and societal debate as it is a phenomenon that occurs to be increasingly urgent, given the existence of environmental degradation and extreme weather events. Although developed states from the global north have contributed to climate change significantly, emerging economies that previously were part of the global south, cause rising greenhouse gas emissions as well. The problem requires a collective approach in terms of shared responsibility and multilateral cooperation; however, the architecture of global climate governance portrays to be fragmented. Resulting from the fact that the topic has not received much scholarly attention, this research seeks – by means of a thematic content analysis – to investigate how the trend towards centralised global climate governance through the Paris Agreement has changed the perspective on environmental policy. The research builds on the theoretical approach of liberalism, as well as the spectrum model that explains the degree of centralisation in climate cooperation. Based on the case of China as the world’s largest carbon dioxide emitter, it can be concluded that after the Paris Agreement entered into force, the nation’s perspective on environmental policy shifted politically/strategically and ideologically/socially.","['Global Climate Governance', 'Paris Agreement', 'China', 'environmental policy']"

A transitional rather than permanent strategy against climate change: The impact of green growth on carbon emissions in the European Union,"Hagendorn, Janic","['Ploof, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The green growth paradigm has been the dominant approach to climate policymaking in recent decades, such as in the European Green Deal. This research analyzes green growth using mixed methods by examining the impact of green growth policies on carbon emissions in the EU for the period of 2000-2019 and evaluating the design of current green growth policies in the European Green Deal. The corresponding results show that green growth has led to a decoupling of economic growth from carbon emissions, but not sufficiently to achieve the European Green Deal goal of carbon-neutrality by 2050. Green growth policies under the European Green Deal represent to some extent an evolvement of past policies, but at the same time a continuation of past shortcomings. Following the results, it is concluded that green growth is necessary but can only be a transitional strategy to achieve carbon-neutrality in the EU by 2050. Furthermore, implications are drawn for improving current green growth policies under the European Green Deal in terms of their impact on decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions.",

If the underlying causes of low social acceptance and low self-esteem are known, children with these problems can be helped with specific intervention programs. Executive functions, like inhibition, could be part of the possible underlying causes. The current study focuses on the relation between inhibition and self-esteem and whether either objective or subjective social acceptance influence this relation. This study will also assess whether there is a difference between objective social acceptance (OSA) and subjective social acceptance (SSA) and whether there is a relation between inhibition and either objective social acceptance or subjective social acceptance. The measures inhibition speed, inhibition accuracy, SSA, OSA and self-esteem measured for 130 children and adolescents (6 – 18 years) at risk for externalising problems were used to analyse these questions. The results showed that inhibition is not significantly related to self-esteem or SSA, but was related to lower OSA (p = .02). OSA does not moderate the relation between inhibition and self-esteem. However, SSA shows a trend of strengthening the relation between inhibition and self-esteem. Children with average SSA and better inhibition speed had lower self-esteem, similar to children with low SSA, children with worse inhibition speed had higher self- esteem, similar to children with high SSA (p = .08). For inhibition accuracy, children with a lower SSA had lower self-esteem when their inhibition was worse, while children with a high SSA had higher self-esteem when they had worse inhibition (p = .07). These results suggest that future social acceptance or self-esteem interventions should not focus on inhibition for children with externalising problems.",

People are coerced to migrate to seek safety since they are often at the risk of their life. The issue of forced migration is generally tackled through institutions and international legal systems through top-down approaches, especially because forced migrants often have to cross international borders. While some forced migrants have improved living conditions in comparison to their pre-migration situation, a lot of forced migrants end up in refugee camps, where they experience poor living conditions. There, they are often excluded from their host community and their humanitarian needs are not always met. A more collaborative and communal approach through human agency has been neglected in comparison to the top-down approaches. For voluntary migrants, interactions and relationships with the host community have been shown to benefit their well-being. This thesis aims to examine how the sense of community affects the quality of life of forced migrants, especially when they arrive in their host community, because forced migrants often have to leave their home community and family network behind.","['forced migration', 'quality of life', 'refugees', 'citizenship', 'health', 'internally displaced persons', 'asylum seekers']"

Het is daarom van belang om meer over correlaten van intrinsieke leesmotivatie te weten te komen, zodat verder kan worden onderzocht hoe intrinsieke leesmotivatie in deze groepen verhoogd kan worden. In het huidige onderzoek worden boekgenre en structuur in de thuisomgeving onderzocht als mogelijke correlaten van intrinsieke leesmotivatie. De steekproef bestond uit 116 kinderen uit groep 6, 7 of 8, die een vragenlijst invulden van ongeveer tien minuten. Uit de resultaten bleek dat meisjes meer intrinsiek gemotiveerd waren om te lezen dan jongens, mits binnen de ANOVA was gecorrigeerd voor de variabele boekgenre. Daarnaast bleek dat kinderen met een voorkeur voor non-fictieboeken meer intrinsiek gemotiveerd waren om te lezen dan kinderen met een voorkeur voor fictieboeken.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the relationship between parents experienced maltreatment and externalizing problems of children is mediated by positive parenting. Participants were 127 mothers, 92 fathers, and 141 children. The age of mothers ranged from 29 to 88 years, father’s age ranged from 27 to 82 years, and children’s age ranged from 8 to 63 years old. Parents completed a questionnaire about experienced maltreatment and their parents completed a version of this questionnaire about committed maltreatment towards them. This questionnaire exists of a combination of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS-PC) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). For the measurement of externalizing problems children completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Youth Self Report (YSR), or the Adult Self Report (ASR). Positive parenting was measured through observations of parent-child interactions in a lab. Results indicated that parents experienced maltreatment was not significantly associated with externalizing problems of their children. Additionally, the results showed that none, except one, of the paths in the mediation model were significant. The path from father’s positive parenting to externalizing problems of children was significant and negative, meaning that children of fathers with a high score on positive parenting show less externalizing problems. These findings highlight the importance of further research, and these findings should be used during the development of prevention- and intervention programs.","['externaliserende problemen', 'mishandeling', 'positief ouderschap']"

Despite a high level of heterogeneity in the presentation of BPD, many of its defining features may stem from a poorly integrated sense of self. Early maladaptive schemas are self-defeating beliefs representing important pathways through which BPD features are caused and maintained. While literature suggests that most schemas are correlated with BPD as a whole, research on specific BPD features and specific schemas is needed to map out unique associations. The current self-report study examined the relationship between the BPD core feature of identity disturbance measured by the Personality Assessment Inventory-Borderline Feature Scale (PAI-BOR) and the enmeshment schema measured by the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-S3) in a non-clinical sample (N=398), while controlling for the remaining core BPD features (i.e., affective instability, negative relationships, and self-harm). There were significant unique effects found for identity disturbance and negative relationships, with higher levels on these constructs predicting more enmeshment. A significant unique effect was also found for nationality as a covariate. The findings may explain how individuals with elevated levels of identity disturbance as a BPD feature become overly dependent and enmeshed in relationships to compensate for an unstable sense-of-self and -direction. This indicates potential pathways between specific BPD features and cognitive schemas that could be targeted to foster a stronger self-identity and, consequently more stability in relationships. Future longitudinal and prospective studies are needed to follow the course and direction of the relationship for further understanding of its dynamics.","['BPD', 'identity disturbance', 'cognitive schemas', 'enmeshment']"

In this thesis, it is tried to answer whether self-confidence mediates the relationship between the onset of puberty development and substance use and what differences are visible for boys and girls (N = 186). All participants were between 14 and 18 years old and came from the west of the Netherlands. The data used in this research was collected through home visits and questionnaires. To answer the research question, a mediation analysis by Baron & Kenny (1986) was used. The mediation analysis investigated the relation between the onset of puberty development and substance use, the onset of puberty development and self-confidence and self-confidence and substance use. These analyses are done for both boys and girls. The results show that boys have significantly higher scores on self-confidence and substance use than girls. There is a significant relationship between confidence and substance use for boys, but not for girls. The significant relationship found for boys is different in nature than for girls. There is no mediation effect of self-confidence on the relation between the onset of puberty development and substance use. It is important for future research to further investigate the relation between self-confidence and substance use in boys. In addition, it is essential to investigate whether an unequivocal answer can be found whether the onset of puberty development influences substance use. In this way, interventions against substance use can be used effectively.","['puberteitsontwikkeling', 'middelengebruik', 'zelfvertrouwen']"

"Understanding Relaxation and the Female Sexual Response: An experimental study investigating the effects of a relaxation exercise on pelvic floor and mental relaxation and the experience of tactile stimulation, and exploring the associations between relaxation and female sexual arousal.","Bloem, Lisette","['dr. S. Both', 'Prof. dr. B.M. Elzinga']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Female sexual dysfunction is a common problem. Problems with relaxation are often perceived as the cause for why these sexual difficulties occur. However, little is known about how relaxation influences the sexual response. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate how relaxation is associated with the female sexual response. This was investigated by an experimental design in which 50 healthy women (age 18-45 years) performed a relaxation exercise with the help of a relaxation instrument. As a control condition, they had to quietly lay down. Pelvic floor and self-reported mental relaxation, pleasurableness of tactile non-genital stimulation in response to a tactile stimulation exercise, and genital and subjective sexual arousal in response to an erotic film were measured as dependent variables. It also exploratively examined whether having a history of sexual abuse influences the relationship between relaxation and the sexual response. Performing the relaxation exercise with the relaxation instrument did not induce more pelvic floor or mental relaxation compared to quietly lying down. Similarly, the relaxation exercise did not facilitate pleasurableness of tactile non-genital stimulation. Levels of pelvic floor or mental relaxation were not associated with genital sexual arousal in response to an erotic film, but were associated with subjective sexual arousal. Having a history of sexual abuse did not influence pelvic floor and mental relaxation and pleasurableness of tactile non-genital stimulation, and it was not associated with genital and subjective sexual arousal in response to an erotic film. These results show that the relaxation exercise was not effective in increasing pelvic floor or mental relaxation and that it does not lead to more pleasurableness of tactile stimulation when compared to quietly lying down. However, the findings might indicate that relaxation could indeed facilitate feelings of sexual arousal, but does perhaps not facilitate the physical sexual response. Nevertheless, more research is needed with a more effective relaxation exercise in order to get a greater understanding in the facilitating effects of relaxation on the female sexual response.","['Sexology, Relaxation, Female Sexuality, Clinical Psychology, Clinical experiment']"

To identify the text-level comprehension demands of the CBM-Maze task, this study used an altered version: the scrambled Maze task. Within the scrambled version of the Maze task, sentence order was randomized to affect the readers ability to make inferences. All 138 participants completed four Maze tasks, two standard and two scrambled versions, consisting of either four narrative or four expository texts. Scores on the scrambled version of the Maze task were compared to scores on the standard version and scores on Maze tasks consisting of narrative texts were compared to scores on Maze tasks consisting of expository texts. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare the score on the CBM-Maze tasks to scores of Dutch reading assessments, the CITO Begrijpend Lezen and the CITO Drie-Minuten-Toets. The results show that the CBM-Maze task demands the reader to use higher-level comprehension skills. This adds to the results of previous research that identified the sentence-level comprehension demands of the CBM-Maze task. These results suggest that the CBM-Maze task can be used by teachers to establish the readers current level and development of reading comprehension. Although participants were expected to score lower on CBM-Maze tasks consisting of expository texts, no effects of text type were found. Limitations of the study and implications of the CBM-Maze task in education are discussed.","['CBM-Maze', 'Meetinstrument', 'Begrijpend Lezen', 'Tekstbegrip', 'Teksttypes']"
"Depersonalization and Derealization predicted by Stress, Substance Use and Sleeping Problems in Dutch GP Patients","Weerts, Sjoerd",['Prof. dr. P. Spinhoven'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Depersonalization and derealization (DP & DR) are more prevalent amongst persons with anxiety, depressive, and personality disorders, as well as those experiencing negative factors in their daily life (such as sleep deprivation, exhaustion, drug and alcohol abuse, and stress). As these negative factors are also more prevalent in the aforementioned disorders, this study examines whether these factors account for the relationship of these disorders and their corresponding symptoms with DP & DR. Method: A dataset of mental help seeking individuals (N=1008), gathered through a screener questionnaire by GPs in the west of the Netherlands, was used to assess the hypothesis from both a traditional nosological approach (using disorder indications) and a dimensional/symptom-oriented approach (using symptom severity). From a nosological perspective, AN(C)OVAs were performed where DP&DR in disorder groups was compared to a control group also after controlling for the following factors of impact (FOI): sleep deprivation, exhaustion, drug and alcohol abuse, and stress. From a dimensional perspective, multiple stepwise regression analyses were performed in which DP&DR was predicted by symptom severity, also after controlling for the FOI. Results: We found that DP&DR was elevated in depressive, anxiety and comorbid disorders (but not in personality disorder) and also that anxiety, depressive, and personality disorder symptom severity was associated with DP&DR. The unique associations between disorder groups and symptom severity was greatly attenuated by controlling for the FOI. Conclusions: The results yield support for FOI being partly responsible for the association between common mental disorders and symptom severity with DP & DR.","['Depersonalisation', 'derealisation', 'dimensional']"
Some hearts brake more easily: The link between prolonged transient cardiac slowing and resting heart rate variability in a social feedback learning task,"Kölgen, Clarissa","['Molen, M.J.W. van der', 'Jakobsson Mansson, S.L.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social anxiety is associated with expecting and experiencing more rejection. However, much is still unknown about learning to expect social feedback. 68 female participants engaged in the Social Evaluative Learning through Feedback Profile task, based on which we mapped out cardiac and expectation markers of social anxiety. In this task, four peers differed in their probability of giving rejecting feedback (i.e., 85, 70, 30, and 15 %) on statements about the participant, and participants predict whether the peer will accept or reject them. To estimate learning, participants’ predictions are grouped based on the peer’s dominant response. Heart rate (HR) slowing is measured for each stimulus using interbeat intervals. We calculated high-frequency resting heart rate variability (HRV), and the Liebowitz social anxiety scale was used as a screener. Multilevel models predicted HR slowing, and learning to predict peer feedback. Our analysis shows that HR slowing after unexpected rejection decreases over the course of the experiment. For the most accepting peer, higher social anxiety is associated with more HR slowing for unexpected rejection, and less HR slowing for expected rejection. For the most rejecting peer, there seems to be an opposite effect. Classification of all peers became more accurate over time. We found a weak negative correlation between resting HRV and social anxiety. We conclude that there are slight differences in HR slowing associated with higher social anxiety. The current findings help practitioners understand cardiac and emotional responses to social learning based on feedback and can aid researchers’ understanding of social anxiety.","['expectancy bias', 'heart rate variability', 'neurovisceral integration model', 'social anxiety', 'transient cardiac slowing']"
In search of happiness: The importance of social capital in the era of social distancing and digitalisation,"Roulias, Theodoros","['Hagen, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Despite the great popularity of the concept, the literature between social capital and subjective well-being has suffered from analytical vagueness and conflicting empirical findings. The pandemic of COVID-19 and the subsequent digitalisation of traditional spaces of social participation have deemed the study of social capital more relevant than ever before. Using theory of public goods, this research divides social capital into cognitive and structural dimensions and investigates their relationship with subjective happiness in Europe. The analysis employs suitable indicators for social capital with the use of Special Eurobarometer 62.2. The findings reveal that all investigated forms of social capital correlate significantly with increased levels of self-reported life-satisfaction. Furthermore, the study translates the empirical results into concrete social implications for modern challenges. More specifically, it suggests that measures of social isolation as well as stigmatisation of certain social groups can reduce the accumulation of social capital at the structural and cognitive level respectively. This might compromise the capacity of communities to engage in mutually beneficial collective action and reduce total well-being. Lastly, a warning is raised towards a potential overemphasis on digital communication, as the properties real-life social interactions have not been found to be transferable in virtual settings.","['Social capital', 'Subjective well-being', 'Happiness', 'Life-satisfaction', 'Collective action problems', 'Public goods']"

Are Women More Responsible Leaders Than Men? A Study on Gender and Effects on Power Construed as Opportunity or Responsibility,"Weltevreden, Guido","['Scheepers, D.T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A recent line of research suggests that power might have different meanings to people. More in particular, researchers distinguish between power construed as responsibility and power construed as an opportunity. Correlational research indicated that gender (identity) and, to a somewhat lesser extent, sex predict people’s power construal. The current study took an experimental approach to focus on gender differences in power construal, testing the hypotheses that a feminine gender identity is related to power construed as a responsibility and a masculine gender identity is related to power construed as an opportunity. First, participants described a situation in which they felt powerful (high power condition) or powerless (low power condition). Subsequently, we measured power construals and gender identity (TMF). This scale was a more modern and explicit measure of gender identity than similar assessments in prior research. Results indicated that femininity significantly predicted power construed as a responsibility, regardless of participants experiencing high- or low power. We found no evidence of biological sex or masculinity as predictor for power construal. Additionally, we controlled for possible confounding factors like power domain, stability of power and working field. However, the (combined) effect of sex and condition on power construal remained non-significant. Thus, the current research, making use of an experimental design, and different gender measure, found only weak evidence for a relation between gender and power construal. In conclusion, there might be stronger determinants of power construal than gender. This study discusses possible explanations and suggests alternatives for future research.",
Fueling Food Insecurity? The Impact of Biofuel Production on Food Access and Food Availability in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Reinstorf, Nelly",['Dr. Rutger Hagen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The complexities around global food security and biofuel production are at the intersection of some crucial global challenges: hunger, energy security, resource governance and development. Although biofuels have received attention as a means to sustainably solve international energy concerns and promote rural development, the impacts of biofuel expansion in developing countries have set in motion a considerable debate about their impact on food security. In response to a lack of integrated scientific analysis, this thesis applies the theory of economic externalities to biofuel production and explores whether there is a general, negative effect on food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. The results of a multiple linear regression analysis confirm a negative impact of biofuel production on food security, although the effect is small in comparison to other food security determinants. Interestingly, the study reveals an important moderating role of regime types in the biofuel-food security nexus, showing that the negative effect is particularly the case in non-democratic regimes. In view of rising demand for renewable energy sources and increasing food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa, this study calls for more in-depth analysis of the interactions between these dynamics.","['Food security', 'biofuels', 'externalities', 'governance', 'rural development', 'Sub-Saharan Africa']"
The International Finance Corporation: Accountability or Immunity: Accountability mechanisms at the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman,"Walen, Lisa","['Heaphy, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the years, large multilateral banking institutions like the World Bank have attracted substantial criticism regarding their private sector investments. However, the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) branch, the largest private sector focused global development institution, and the IFC’s independent accountability body, the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO), have not received much scholarly attention. By means of a thematic content analysis, this research seeks to investigate the following research question: How do different accountability mechanisms shape the Dispute Resolution and Compliance role of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman? The theoretical foundations of this research build on agent-centric constructivism and the forum-based accountability model. Based on the Wilmar Jambi case in Indonesia and the operational policies of the CAO and IFC, it can be concluded that social accountability is integrated to different extents, depending on which role the CAO performs. Furthermore, the analysis finds that the CAO’s authority as an administrative accountability body ultimately depends on the IFC’s voluntary compliance.","['World Bank', 'International Finance Corporation (IFC)', 'Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)', 'Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO)', 'agent-centric constructivism', 'forum-based accountability', 'accountability', 'private sector', 'investment']"

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between four types of childhood maltreatment and maladaptive emotion regulation. The sample consisted of 63 adolescents and young adults (Mage = 18.31, range 13-26). Several questionnaires were used to identify the adolescents' experienced child abuse and their maladaptive emotion regulation. Results showed a significant positive correlation between all types of maltreatment. Multiple regression analyses controlling for age and gender showed no significant relationship between any of the types of childhood maltreatment and emotion regulation. Thus, in contrast to the hypothesis experienced childhood maltreatment was not a predictor for maladaptieve emotion regulation. In conclusion, this study shows that the different types of childhood maltreatment are interrelated but do not uniquely predict emotion regulation. Future research can use this study as a starting point for more research into the unique effects of child maltreatment on maladaptive emotion regulation.","['physical abuse', 'physical neglect', 'emotional abuse', 'emotional neglect', 'maladaptive emotion regulation']"
