Gender Differences in Self-Regulation and Their Implications for Academic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis,"Podbylska, Maria","['Wierenga, L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The academic gender gap resulting from the underperformance of males in educational settings negatively impacts individuals and society at large (Wobbekind, 2012). Since research has shown an association between self-regulation and school achievement (Robson et al., 2020; Skibbe et al., 2019; van Tetering et al., 2020), investigating this cognitive measure in the academic context is highly relevant. For this reason, a quantitative meta-analysis was conducted to examine whether school-age males possess inferior self-regulation skills compared to females. A literature search identified 22 relevant studies based on the inclusion criteria. The statistical analysis with a random-effect model showed that there are significant differences in self-regulation between males and females (SMD = -0.15; 95% CI [-0.25, -0.04], p = 0.006, 95% PI [-0.95, 0.66]). Additionally, the present study examined self-regulation before and after puberty, as research suggests that gender differences in this cognitive measure are the most prominent in childhood and decrease in youth (Coyne et al., 2015; Lenroot & Giedd, 2010). The analysis with age as a grouping variable included 19 publications. Results of a random-effect model analysis showed significant differences in self-regulation between the groups, with χ2 (1) = 5.56, p = 0.02. Overall, findings from the present study imply that interventions aimed at improving self-regulation in males before they finish puberty are a promising way of tackling the academic gender gap, which could lead to numerous benefits associated with better educational outcomes (Bell et al., 2022; Breton, 2013; Brunello et al., 2017; Ross & Wu, 1995).","['Self-regulation', 'gender differences', 'academic achievement', 'school performance']"

How Impulsive Are Your Shopping Habits? An Investigation into the Moderating Effects of Neuroticism and Conscientiousness on the Relationship Between Distraction and Impulse Purchasing Behavior Within an Online Environment,"Allgeier, Emma",['Anouk van der Weiden'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"With the rapid increase in consumption, impulse purchasing behaviour is skyrocketing, especially online. Previous research suggests that both distraction as well as personality types influence consumption but as of yet, this relationship has not been investigated together. This research examines the moderating effects of the personality types of neuroticism and conscientiousness on the relationship between distraction and impulse purchasing behavior. Participants’ impulsivity was tested in an online shopping task under either high or low levels of distraction, which was followed by a Big-5 questionnaire testing individuals’ personality types. Results showed that while not significant, distraction increased impulse purchasing behaviour overall, as well as significantly increasing impulse purchasing for neurotic individuals. Low levels of conscientiousness were found to have significantly more of an effect on impulse purchasing compared to higher levels of conscientiousness when under high levels of distraction, however, no effect was found in the low distraction condition. These findings offer up new directions for future research.","['Consumption', 'Distraction', 'Impulse Purchasing Behaviour', 'Personality', 'Neuroticism', 'Conscientiousness']"
"Perceived Academic Stress, Mental Health & Coping Strategies: A Cross-Cultural Study with American, Chinese & Dutch Students","Henkel, Charlotta","['Dr. Garnefski, N.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, more attention has been paid to the importance that coping strategies play in the development of psychopathology. This attention is well needed in the academic sector with high numbers of students going through mental health crises during their studies. The present study focused on the effects of using different cognitive and behavioral coping strategies on mental health and academic stress. We extended the investigation to examine cross-cultural differences within these effects. The relation of cognitive and behavioral coping strategies to anxious and depressive symptoms as well as academic stress was studied among university students from three different countries (N = 521, the United States; N = 279, China; N = 175, the Netherlands). All of the students filled in self-report questionnaires on perceived academic stress (LSPSS), anxious symptoms (GAD-7), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), cognitive coping strategies (CERQ), behavioral coping strategies (BERQ), and self-compassion (SCCM). The results of univariate and multivariate analyses showed significant differences on perceived academic stress, and anxious and depressive symptoms with American students scoring significantly higher on all three scales than Chinese and Dutch students. Remarkable differences between the samples were also found on most of the subscales of behavioral and cognitive coping strategies. Furthermore, regression analyses demonstrated consistencies and discrepancies in the relationships between mental health, academic stress and coping strategies across countries. Most notably, consistencies across samples were found for self-blame and withdrawal predicting anxious and depressive symptoms, and rumination and withdrawal predicting academic stress. Discrepancies were mainly found in how the strategies ignoring, rumination, catastrophizing, seeking social support and low self-compassion predicted anxious and/or depressive symptoms and/or academic stress. This suggests cultural variations in the efficacy of coping strategies to alleviate mental health problems and academic stress and provides useful directions for the development of interventions for students.","['academic stress', 'cognitive/behavioral coping strategies', 'students', 'mental health']"

How distractions affect the relationship between attentional focus and online buying behaviour,"Franke, Emma",['Anouk van der Weiden'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This paper aims to extend knowledge of the effect that attentional focus and distraction have on shopping behaviour by researching how distraction affects the relationship between attentional focus and buying behaviour. Broad attentional focused consumers and distracted consumers tend to purchase more impulsively. Broad attentional focused participants are also less able to suppress their reactions when they are distracted in comparison to narrow attentional focused participants. This led to the hypothesis that attentional focus, distraction and the interaction between these variables positively affects buying behaviour. To test this, the researcher primed the participants with either a broad or narrow attentional focus and a high or low load task to distract them. Both manipulations worked. The results demonstrate that distraction has an almost significant effect on shopping behaviour. Attentional focus and the interaction between attentional focus and distraction did not appear to affect shopping behaviour. Directions for future research are mentioned to extend findings on this subject.",

Therapeutic Hypothermia effects on cognition in children with Perinatal Asphyxia: A possible interaction with birthweight and long-term effects exploration,"Hendriksen, Jiska","['Houdt, C.A. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Children who are born with perinatal asphyxia (PA) in the Netherlands, have been treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) since 2018. So far, little is known about the cognitive outcome of these children. This study explores a possible interaction effect between birthweight and TH on Total IQ and Processing Speed in children 10 years of age known with PA. Some of the children treated with TH were also cognitive assessed at the age of 5 year. For these children, we looked at the course of cognitive development between 5 and 10 years of age. Fifty children were assessed at the age of 10 years with the Wechsler intelligence scale (WISC-III-NL). Fifteen of these children were also assessed at the age of 5 years with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of intelligence (WPPSI-III-NL). There was no interaction effect found between TH and birthweight on Total IQ and processing speed scores assessed at the age of 10 years. Furthermore, there were no significant differences found between Total IQ and processing speed scores assessed at 5 and 10 years of age. Since this was only exploratory research more research is needed to draw more reliable conclusions.","['Therapeutic Hypothermia', 'cognition', 'children', 'birthweight', 'Perinatal Asphyxia']"
Alarming remedies: A Comparative research regarding differences in perceived risk of medication side-effects among sexes,"Agha Mohammad Taghi Sarraf, Shyla","['Willems, S.J.W']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Risk-perception emerges when the brain interprets and memorizes certain stimuli as dangerous for one’s body and life. Even in objectively safe situations people perceive risks and dangers. When it comes to medicine, risk-perception can withhold people from staying true to their medical treatment which is why it is important to pay attention to this phenomenon. The current studies about the perceived risks of medicine are mainly focused on male subjects which is why this study examined whether the perceived risk of medication differs among sexes. Methods: Literature research gave reason to hypothesize that females perceive higher risk of medication compared to males. To investigate this, this study made use of an online survey containing two standardized risk-perception scales. The survey was built around a fictional medication named Aratrine of which the side-effects were described, after which seven questions/statements were presented to the respondents aiming to measure their perceived risk of Aratrine. The generated convenience sample eventually included 221 respondents (178 females 43 males). The data collected by the survey was integrated in a sum score which represented the overall perceived risk of Aratrine. The means of the female- and male sum scores were analyzed and compared with use of an independent sample t-test. Results & Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the overall sum risk-perception score did not differ among different sexes (t (2,219) = -.597, p = 0.551). This seems to imply that there is no difference in perceived risk of medication side-effect between males and females, which does not correspond with the expectation that raised from the literature review. This can be explained due to the validity and sample problems that occurred in this study. The post hoc analysis of the individual scale-items did show a significant difference among sexes for two items regarding the estimated risk of Aratrine (p<0.01) and the severity of potential bad consequences (p<0.01).","['Risk-perception', 'medication', 'side-effects', 'sex-differences']"
The Predictive Value of Peritraumatic Dissociation in Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: a Continuous-based Approach versus a Trajectory-based Approach,"Uittenbogaard, Roos",['J. Mouthaan'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Peritraumatic dissociation is suspected to be a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous research into the predictive value of peritraumatic dissociation in PTSD is contradictory. In addition, no previous study has examined the predictive value of peritraumatic dissociation in acute PTSD symptom trajectories. Moreover, the possible moderating effect of gender remains unclear. In this study we explored the predictive value of peritraumatic dissociation in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. Methods: In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we examined whether peritraumatic dissociation predicted PTSD symptoms at 6 weeks and 12 months post trauma (continuous-based approach) and a chronic vs. recovery symptom trajectory (trajectory-based approach). Data was collected from N = 348 (continuous-based approach) and N = 73 (trajectory-based approach) acutely injured trauma victims. PTSD symptoms were assessed with the Clinical Administered PTSD Scale at 6 weeks and 12 months post trauma. Peritraumatic dissociation was measured preferably at 1 week post trauma with the Peritraumatic Dissociation Experience Questionnaire. Results: Two multiple regression analyses and a binary logistic regression analysis showed that peritraumatic dissociation significantly predicted PTSD symptoms at 6 weeks post trauma, but not at 12 months post trauma, nor did it differentiate a chronic symptom trajectory from a recovery symptom trajectory. Gender did not significantly moderate any of the relationships. Conclusion: Our study found that peritraumatic dissociation predicts acute PTSD symptoms but cannot be used to distinguish between chronicity and recovery of PTSD symptoms. Therefore, other risk factors may be better predictors for chronic PTSD symptoms.","['PTSD symptom severity, peritraumatic dissociation, trajectory-based approach, continuous-based approach, moderation, gender']"

Kleuterplaat met prentenboeken: Een onderzoek naar de invloed van klassikaal en interactief voorlezen met e-Prent&ABC+ op de woordenschat en het leergedrag van kleuters met probleemgedrag in het onderwijs,"Zwaneveld, Marije","['Espin, C. A.', 'Dijken, M. J. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The development of vocabulary in primary school is of high importance. A foundation for toddlers’ school career can be laid by teaching new words in an efficient way. By doing so, all toddlers can proceed school with the same level of reading and writing. Reading storybooks aloud in an interactive way is crucial when stimulating vocabulary development. Within the reading intervention program, e-Prent&ABC, the interactive reading of animated storybooks with a smartboard is combined with the 4-cycle word development model to learn new words in an effective way. A previous study stated that e-Prent&ABC has a positive effect on the vocabulary and language development of toddlers. This positive effect did not occur for toddlers who show inattentive-withdrawn or disruptive behavior. In the current study, e-Prent&ABC is extended to e-Prent&ABC+ by adding behavior regulating elements. Within e-Prent&ABC+, specific attention is paid to toddlers with problematic behavior. The purpose of the current study is to assess whether the learning behavior and vocabulary of toddlers with problematic behavior can be improved by e-Prent&ABC+, compared with e-Prent&ABC and the control condition (electronic Living Books). The influence of working memory on learning behavior and vocabulary is also examined. A total of 60 toddlers participated in this study, in which 30 toddlers showed inattentive-withdrawn or disruptive behavior, followed by 30 control children. Nine classes from three primary schools in Leiden completed three intervention weeks. The results of the current study showed that e-Prent&ABC is effective in increasing the vocabulary of toddlers. However, the behavior regulating elements of e-Prent&ABC+ were found to be ineffective. In future research, it is important to replicate e-Prent&ABC+ with a larger and more reliable sample. Due to its effectiveness within education, it is recommended to add the 4-cycle model and animated storybooks to current reading methods.","['Beginnende geletterdheid', 'digitaal lezen', 'executieve functies', 'leergedrag', 'woordenschat', 'e-Prent&ABC']"
A Linguistic Demos: An argument for linguistic unity as a necessary condition for a democratic demos,"Pieffers, Rianne","['Ploof, R. A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"What should the foundations of a legitimately demarcated demos be? How can we enable the demarcation of a demos around these values? These questions about the boundary problem have been central to the discussion. Thusfar, the focus has been on the inclusion of the people who have a right to participate in the decision-making process of a demos. However, this is not without concern. This thesis explores existing theories and the concerns with these theories from a deliberative democrat’s perspective. I conclude that there is a problem with the democratic foundations of these theories. Therefore, rather than focussing primarily on inclusion, I prioritise the democratic values that are the foundation of a legitimately demarcated demos. I then proceed to suggest a language-centred approach, the principle of Linguistic Unity. The linguistic dimension has yet been overlooked in solutions to the boundary problem. Whereas it does serve a purpose in the protection and realisation of democratic values. Language ultimately brings individuals together in a political community. Agreeing on a common language upon entering a demos might thus be a reasonable condition to add to the discussion on the boundary problem.","['boundary problem', 'linguistic unity', 'democracy', 'demos']"
Source Credibility’s Positive Effect on Purchase Intentions Replicated in Influencer Marketing Context: A study on Social Media Influencers’ Functioning as Opinion Leaders and the relationship with Need For Closure,"Bosch, Kenny van den","['Brizi, A.', 'Prasastyoga, B.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Greatly inspired by Pierro et al.’s (2013) study on need for closure, the current study investigated whether high need for closure individuals outsource economic decisions in an influencer marketing context, similar to how Pierro et al.’s (2013) found high need for closure individuals to outsource organizational decisions to opinion leaders. Based on previous scientific literature a research model was developed to test the following two hypotheses: social media influencer credibility has a positive effect on purchase intentions towards influencer-promoted products, and the positive relation between social media influencer credibility and purchase intentions is moderated by need for closure, in a way that high NFC individuals have greater purchase intentions compared to low NFC individuals. A simple linear regression and a process model 1 moderation analysis were performed to test the hypotheses. Social media influencer credibility was found to have a significant positive effect on purchase intentions. Need for closure was not found to moderate this positive relation. The former finding replicated, strengthened, and extended findings from previous research to an influencer marketing context. Limitations, theoretical and practical implications, and suggestions for future research are discussed as well.","['need for closure', 'social media influencers', 'source credibility', 'influencer marketing', 'purchase intentions']"
Wat bevordert de leesmotivatie bij bovenbouwleerlingen? Een perspectief vanuit de Zelf-Determinatie Theorie,"Moseman, Marouscha",['Suzanne Mol'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het lijkt een goed idee om de leesmotivatie te bevorderen bij bovenbouwleerlingen, omdat dit invloed heeft op de leesprestaties. In deze bachelorscriptie is gepoogd een antwoord te krijgen op de vraag welke evidence-based leesactiviteiten op school samenhangen met leesmotivatie bij deze leerlingen. Er is een vragenlijst afgenomen bij uiteindelijk 178 bovenbouwleerlingen met verschillende onderdelen (gesloten vragen, SRQ-leesmotivatie en rankingvragen). Eerst werd er gekeken of er significante verschillen te vinden waren in de achtergrondkenmerken van de leerlingen. Dit bleek het geval bij geslacht en het leerjaar. Er bleken significant meer meisjes in de meer autonoom gemotiveerde groep te zitten. Er is een significant verschil gevonden in de gecontroleerde motivatie van groep 6 ten opzichte van die van groep 7 en 8. Groep 6 leerlingen bleken meer gecontroleerd gemotiveerd. Er werden vervolgens daadwerkelijk twee groepen gemaakt: de meer autonoom gemotiveerde leerlingen (A>G) en de meer gecontroleerd gemotiveerde leerlingen (G>A) met significante verschillen. Dit sluit goed aan bij de Zelf-Determinatietheorie van Deci & Ryan (2000) met zijn componenten: autonomie, relatie en competentie. Er werd verwacht dat de twee verschillende groepen (A>G en G>A) verschilden in behoeften en dat er andere activiteiten als populairst gevonden werden. Dit bleek niet het geval. De drie populairste activiteiten bleken “Kiezen wat ik lees”, “Kiezen waar of wanneer ik lees” en “Zelf het boekniveau kiezen”. Mogelijke kanttekeningen aan het onderzoek zijn onder andere de COVID-19 maatregelen die de dataverzamelingsperiode anders deed inrichten, maar ook meer inhoudelijke discussiepunten zoals uitkomsten uit dit onderzoek die niet overeen kwamen met de literatuur. Relatie bleek in de literatuur de sterke voorspeller te zijn van leesmotivatie, maar autonomie bleek in dit onderzoek het populairst. Tenslotte worden er adviezen gegeven voor in de praktijk, aansluitend bij het onderzoek, onderbouwd door de literatuur.","['leesmotivatie', 'zelf-determinatietheorie']"
MSc,"Hartmann, Lea",['Willeke Kistelaar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: Research has identified psychological factors as important predictors of highly prevelant persistent somatic symptoms (PSS). However, this research is generally not based on primary care data and general practitioners (GPs) experience difficulties identifying PSS in their patients. Awareness of the psychological risk factors noted in readily accessible electronic medical records (EMRs) might aid GPs with earlier discovery and treatment. Aim: The objective was to examine the predictive value of psychological registrations in primary care for PSS onset. Method: We employed a retrospective longitudinal cohort design. EMR data of Dutch primary care patients were allocated into different subsamples according to registrations of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia (FM), and a combination of these registrations (COMBI) with age and sex-matched non-PSS cohorts. Candidate predictors were registered psychological symptoms, mental health referrals, and psycho-pharmaceuticals registered prior to PSS onset. The relevance of each candidate predictor was determined via L1 regularization in a logistic Lasso regression. The resulting prediction models’ performance was assessed via area under the curve (AUC). Results: The AUC indicated a fair classification performance for IBS (AUC IBS = .77), and good classification performances for CFS, FM, and COMBI (AUC CFS = .82, AUC FM = .88, and AUC COMBI= .87). The IBS-, CFS-, FM-, and COMBI-models, retained a total of 27, 12, 22, and 15 predictors, respectively. The strongest predictor per model was registration of sexual dysfunction for IBS (OR = 4.0), concentration disorder for CFS (OR = 2.4), neurasthenia for FM (OR = 3.0), and concentration disorder for COMBI (OR = 3.8). Neither of these predictors was unique to one specific model. Each final model retained mental health referrals, psycho-pharmaceuticals, and certain psychological symptom registrations as valuable predictors. Based on shared predictors IBS and FM had the closest models while IBS and CFS models were the most dissimilar. Discussion: These findings indicate that several psychological registrations are valuable predictors for onset of IBS, CFS, and/or FM. Therefore, GPs should consider the according predictors when screening for PSS. Future research could examine the comparatively low classification performce for IBS and psychological factors outside of primary care across PSS subtypes.","['Primary Care', 'Persistent Somatic Symptoms', 'Psychological Symptoms', 'Predictive Modeling']"
"De relatie tussen de intrinsieke rekenmotivatie en autonomie, sekse en leeftijd van bovenbouwleerlingen","Visser, Anne","['Leijenhorst, L. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het doel van dit onderzoek was om te onderzoeken of er een relatie is tussen de intrinsieke rekenmotivatie van leerlingen uit groep 6, 7 en 8 op twee Leidse basisscholen en de ervaren autonomie, leeftijd en sekse. Om een antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag is een aangepaste, online versie van de Intrinsieke Motivatie Inventaris (IMI) van Ryan en Deci (2000) afgenomen bij 41 leerlingen uit groep 6, 7 en 8 op twee Leidse basisscholen. De verwachting was dat leerlingen die meer autonomie ervaren tijdens de rekenles, meer intrinsiek gemotiveerd zijn voor rekenen (H1), intrinsieke motivatie afneemt met leeftijd (H2) en dit eerder gebeurt bij meisjes dan bij jongens (H3). Uit de resultaten bleek dat er een significant, positief verband bestaat tussen de intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen en de ervaren autonomie, r(40) = .382, p = .014. Er is geen significant verband gevonden tussen de intrinsieke rekenmotivatie en leeftijd, r(40) = -.018; p = .913. Dit verschilde ook niet significant tussen jongens, r(20) = .077; p = .741, en meisjes, r(18) = -.123; p = .615. Dit duidt erop dat enkel de eerste hypothese is bevestigd: leerlingen die meer autonomie ervaren tijdens de rekenles, zijn meer intrinsiek gemotiveerd voor rekenen. Op basis hiervan wordt aanbevolen om autonomiestimulerend les te geven. Het advies voor vervolgonderzoek is om een soortgelijk onderzoek uit te voeren met een grotere steekproef en hierbij ook te richten op middelbare scholieren.",

Change of Power and Alliance Commitment: The Impact of the Time-Inconsistency Problem on Alliance Reliability,"Kim, Wonjung",['Juan Masullo Jimenez'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite the common belief that alliances are reliable, states abrogate their alliance commitments frequently. Previous studies reveal that various factors motivate states to take opportunistic behaviors, and the change in an alliance member’s military power is the most influential cause. Nevertheless, existing literature provides insufficient delineation on how the power change leads states to violate their alliance commitments. In this paper, I unravel the causal process of the abrogation of alliance commitment by analyzing the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and the French-Czechoslovak Alliance using process-tracing. I provide evidence that the change of power reshapes states' preferences by creating a time-inconsistency problem, leading them to pursue the new preference of violating the alliance commitment. Although other minor elements contribute to states’ cost-benefit calculations, results show that the change in military capability affects the cost of honoring the commitment. When an alliance member’s power increases, the cost of self-defense reduces, while a decrease in power raises the cost of assisting an ally. An analysis of the aforementioned cases supports the time-inconsistency problem model in alliance politics. The time-inconsistency problem model contributes to sharpening the existing knowledge of alliance politics.","['International relations', 'alliance politics', 'time-inconsistency problem']"
Parental knowledge and opinions about acceptability and effectivity of placebo applications in paediatric hospital care,"Kloens, Thirza Elisa Ruth",['Henriët van Middendorp'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The use of placebo applications in hospital care for children could have beneficial effects on several aspects of treatments and hospital experiences. The implementation of placebo applications in hospital care for children is not feasible without parental consent, in which knowledge and opinions about placebo applications could play a varying role. Previous research has shown that insufficient knowledge about placebo effects is associated with a lower degree of acceptability and expected effectivity. Parental opinions about placebo applications may be accompanied by misconceptions due to a lack of knowledge. This study investigated whether subjective and objective knowledge play a role in how parents assess the effectivity of using placebo applications in hospital care for children. Secondly, this study investigated whether parents considered the different placebo applications, varying in being more treatment-supportive or treatment-replacing, as similar or different in terms of acceptability and expected effectivity. Thirdly, this study investigated whether reading about different placebo applications increased acceptability. This cross-sectional study analysed data from 17 participants using questionnaires. Results of the univariate regression analyses showed that only objective knowledge served as a predictor for higher scores on the overall expected effectivity (p = .31). Moreover, results of repeated measures analyses of covariance showed several significant differences between different placebo applications in terms of acceptability and expected effectivity. Parents did not necessarily perceive treatment-supporting placebo applications as more acceptable and effective than treatment-replacing applications. The extent of deception used in placebo applications appear to be related to differences in the degree of acceptability and expected effectivity. Furthermore, results indicated that participants had sufficient subjective (M = 70.2, SD = 15.5) and objective (M = 81.5, SD = 12.1) knowledge. Still, paired-samples t-test results showed that reading about placebo applications increased acceptability (p = .010). This indicates that providing information on placebo applications could increase acceptability, which may be due to an increase in knowledge. This study indicated that parents had a more positive attitude towards certain placebo applications and that knowledge played an important role in these attitudes. Future research could further investigate the possible implementation of such placebo applications and address placebo knowledge.","['placebo effects', 'children', 'knowledge', 'parental opinions', 'hospital care', 'acceptability', 'effectivity']"

Between Solidarity and Punishment: The Motives Behind Sports Boycotts,"Smallenbroek, Bert",['Dr. R. Hagen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Sports events are increasingly held in countries without a significant sports tradition and a questionable human rights track record. This ‘sportswashing’ enables regimes to show their soft side and improve their image. Recently, it led to a countermovement in which domestic and international calls for boycotts are heard more frequently. This thesis examines the motives of athletes, civil actors, international sporting organisations, international organisations and countries behind these calls. Political scientists often use Doxey’s approach to find the underlying rationale for boycotts. She describes eight different motives to call for a boycott. Only a limited number of scholars have studied sports boycotts in general since they mainly focus on a specific case and link this to a general theory (inductive reasoning). Studying the motives behind a call for a boycott deductively by applying Doxey’s model has not been done before. The study modifies economic models by differentiating six possible motives to call for a boycott, namely punishment, destabilisation, solidarity, symbolism, delegitimisation and signalling. All cases are studied via a discourse analysis in which the language of articles comes from six English-speaking news platforms with a global reach is checked for keywords and context. This thesis finds that although there is no single motive for all boycotts, ‘easy’ boycotts without a political layer are likely to be driven by policy change or punishment, whereas more political boycotts are in most cases motivated by solidarity and delegitimising. However, sports boycotts have an intermediate effect and are therefore very effective as a response to unexpected events.","['Sports boycott', 'Motives', 'Economic theory', 'Doxey', 'Discourse', 'Deduction']"
Empathie en Agressie bij Jongens met een Gedragsstoornis en een Autisme Spectrum Stoornis,"Wijtsma, Kimberley","['Aghajani, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Conduct disorder (CD) have somewhat similar symptoms. Both are characterized by problems with cognitive empathy, but CD is also characterized by problems with affective empathy. Research has shown that problems with affective empathy can be linked to aggression. CD is characterized by aggression, both proactive and reactive, but this is not clear for ASD. Current research was conducted to answer the question: On what aspects do ASD and CD differ from each other and from a control (CON) group, considering empath and aggression? A sample of 112 boys participated in the study. They were divided into three groups based on the diagnosis of CD, ASD or no diagnosis (CON). They were asked to fill in the Basic Empathy Scale (BES) and the Reactive-Proactive Agression Questionaire (RPQ). A distinction was made between affective and cognitive empathy and a total empathy score, and between proactive and reactive aggression and a total aggression score. The results showed that CD had more problems with empathy, specifically affective empathy, than ASD compared to CON. CD showed a higher score on aggression, on both subscales and the total score, than both ASD and CON. ASD did not differ from CON on any of the variables. These results support previous research in which it was stated that there is an association between problems with affective empathy and aggression in children with CD. This association was not found for ASD. It is suggested that future research should investigate possible factors that could be of influence on the absence of this relation between empathy and aggression for ASD.","['Conduct disorder', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Empathy', 'Cognitive Empathy', 'Affective Empathy', 'Aggression', 'Proactive Aggression', 'Reactive Aggression']"
De invloed van de omgeving in een videogame op het werkgeheugen.,"Roskam, Britt","['Brinkman, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De Attention Restoration Theory stelt dat een natuurlijke omgeving een herstellende werking heeft op gerichte aandacht. Eerder onderzoek heeft, in overeenstemming met de Attention Restoration Theory, aangetoond dat blootstelling aan natuurlijke stimuli een positief effect heeft op verschillende cognitieve functies, waaronder het werkgeheugen. In de huidige studie is onderzocht of dit effect zich vertaalt naar een videogame-omgeving. Er werd verwacht dat de omgeving in een videogame een effect heeft op het werkgeheugen. Hierbij werd verwacht dat een natuurlijke omgeving een positief effect heeft op het werkgeheugen en dat een stedelijke omgeving een negatief effect heeft op het werkgeheugen. Om dit te onderzoeken speelden participanten omstreeks 10 minuten een videogame in ofwel een natuurlijke omgeving, ofwel een stedelijke omgeving. Een voor- en nameting van het werkgeheugen werd gedaan aan de hand van de Corsi Block-Tapping Task. De resultaten laten geen significant verschil zien tussen de voor- en nameting van het werkgeheugen en voor de verschillende condities (natuurlijk en stedelijk). Daarmee levert dit onderzoek geen bewijs voor het optreden van een herstellend effect van de natuur in een videogame omgeving. Vervolgonderzoek is nodig om het effect van een videogame-omgeving op het werkgeheugen en bijdragende factoren, zoals cognitieve lading en blootstellingsduur, verder te onderzoeken.",

"Musical training, cognitive reserve, and their effects on procedural learning ability","Marrero Polegre, Marina","['Beugen, S. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research has demonstrated that musicians have a higher level of motor skills and motor learning abilities than people without musical training. In addition, cognitive reserve has proven to influence several cognitive functions and to prevent age-related cognitive decline. However, little research has been done in relation to the effect these variables have on procedural learning ability in an untrained motor task in older adults. This could contribute to explore which of these predictors, whose beneficial effects have been extensively studied in relation to several other variables, is more relevant for predicting procedural learning ability specifically, with implications in movement rehabilitation. In the current study, the level of musical training and cognitive reserve, controlling for age, was expected to predict procedural learning ability in a new complex motor task. Additionally, the level of musical training was hypothesized to be more predictive than cognitive reserve in the outcome procedural learning ability. To test these hypotheses, a within-subjects experimental design was used where N = 16 participants performed a computerized pursuit-rotor task and a serial reaction time task, in addition to answering various questionnaires that measured their level of musical training and cognitive reserve. Furthermore, a multiple linear regression model was conducted. The results indicate that the level of musical training and cognitive reserve, controlling for age, did not significantly predict procedural learning ability. Possible explanations for the current lack of significant findings may relate to the small sample size included in the study and its low heterogeneity, as well as to the design of the experiment in relation to the self-reported measures that were included, and the difficulty of the pursuit-rotor task. Thus, future research should replicate this study including more heterogeneous and larger samples, as well as by overcoming the mentioned limitations, and by following the proposed suggestions for further research. Finally, if musical training proves to be a relevant predictor of procedural learning ability, it could have implications for triage in movement rehabilitation in health settings and for healthy lifestyles recommended to the population.","['procedural learning ability', 'musical training', 'cognitive reserve', 'aging']"
"Association of the “Big” Personality Factors Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion with Anxiety-Related Attentional Bias: A Transdiagnostic Approach to Studying the Personality-Psychopathology Theory","Saygin, Melisa","['Putman, P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The personality factors neuroticism, conscientiousness, and extraversion, as well as threat-related attentional bias are significantly associated with anxiety disorders, transdiagnostically. Hypothesis: These personality constructs are correlated with attentional bias, and it might be through this that they create vulnerability for anxiety. Methods: The cross-sectional experimental study (N = 40) administered a dual-probe-task with neutral, mildly-threatening, and highly-threatening images. Results: Significant negative associations with big effect sizes were found between conscientiousness and attending towards threat. More conscientious individuals automatically attended away from mild-threats. Conclusion and Implications: A pathway through which conscientiousness may be acting to create vulnerability for anxiety was proposed. The goal engagement system, as hypothesized in the cognitive- motivational model by Mogg & Bradley, keeps the attention automatically on goal-related stimuli in the absence of a perceived true threat in the environment. The current study adds a new layer to this model, illustrating how intact one’s goal engagement system, even in the absence of pathologic anxiety, is on a spectrum, and can be operationalized by one’s conscientiousness level. Individuals with lower levels of conscientiousness would not have a strong goal engagement system, not resulting in an automatic avoidance of mild-threats, leading overtime to an accumulation of evidence for negative cues, making it easier to form cognitive distortions, predisposing one to anxiety. Increasing conscientiousness might be a promising psychotherapeutic target. Crucial for the anxiety-related attentional bias research field, exploratory analyses showed conscientiousness to be a more important predictor of attentional bias, compared to attentional control. Future attentional bias studies should assess conscientiousness.","['attentional bias', 'Big Five', 'conscientiousness', 'attentional control', 'anxiety', 'neuroticism', 'extraversion', 'five-factor model', 'personality-psychopathology']"

Toename Werkbereidheid bij een Universeel Basisinkomen: Experimenteel Gedragsonderzoek naar de Werkbereidheid bij een Onvoorwaardelijk Universeel Basisinkomen,"Houwaart, Kim",['B.B. Vuyk'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het onvoorwaardelijk universeel basisinkomen (UBI) is een concept dat regelmatig naar voren komt in het publieke debat. Een UBI heeft meerdere potentiële voor- en nadelen, waaronder een mogelijke invloed op de werkbereidheid. Een afname van de werkbereidheid zou mogelijk ongunstige maatschappelijke gevolgen met zich mee kunnen brengen. Voor deze scriptie is daarom de werkbereidheid bij een UBI onderzocht door middel van een experimenteel gedragsonderzoek. De verwachting was dat de voorwaardelijkheid en de framing van het basisinkomen en de persoonlijke mate van zelfeffectiviteit invloed hebben op de keuze om wel of niet te gaan werken. Het onderzoek vond online plaats onder 146 participanten. De werkbereidheid is gemeten door middel van een real effort slider task en de zelfeffectiviteit is gemeten met de Dutch General Self-Efficacy Scale. Participanten zijn willekeurig verdeeld over drie condities: een UBI conditie met winst frame, een conditioneel basisinkomen (CBI) conditie met winst frame en een CBI conditie met verlies frame. In het onderzoek is geen relatie gevonden tussen de werkbereidheid en de persoonlijke mate van zelfeffectiviteit. Daarnaast is er geen verschil gevonden in de werkbereidheid tussen winst of verlies framing van een basisinkomen. Wel bleek de werkbereidheid significant groter bij een voorwaardelijk basisinkomen (UBI) dan bij een onvoorwaardelijke basisinkomen (CBI). Dit wijst op een effect van voorwaardelijkheid van een basisinkomen op de werkbereidheid. De resultaten suggereren dat een UBI niet hoeft te leiden tot een afname van de werkbereidheid en mogelijk zelfs kan leiden tot een toename hiervan. An unconditional universal basic income (UBI) is a concept that is often subject to public debate. A UBI is debated to have multiple potential advantages and disadvantages, including a possible influence on people’s willingness to work. A decrease in the willingness to work could potentially have unfavorable effects on society. Therefore this thesis researched the effects of a UBI on the willingness to work by means of a behavioral experiment. The expectation was that not only the conditionality but also the framing of a basic income and the personal degree of self-efficacy influence people’s willingness to work. The experiment took place online, among 146 participants. The willingness to work was measured using a real effort slider task. Self-efficacy was measured using the Dutch General Self-Efficacy Scale. Participants were randomly divided into three conditions: a UBI condition with a gain frame, a conditional basic income (CBI) condition with a gain frame and a CBI condition with a loss frame. The experiment found no relationship between people’s willingness to work and the personal degree of self-efficacy. In addition, no difference was found in the willingness to work between gain and loss framing of a basic income. However, the willingness to work when receiving an unconditional basic income (UBI) turned out to be significantly higher compared to a conditional basic income (CBI). These results point to an effect of the conditionality of a basic income on the willingness to work. This suggests that a UBI does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the willingness to work and may even lead to an increase.","['basisinkomen', 'universeel basisinkomen', 'onvoorwaardelijk basisinkomen', 'werkbereidheid', 'zelfeffectiviteit', 'framing']"

The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, like lockdowns, have resulted in changes in the lives of adolescents. Not much was known about the effect of lockdowns on social anxiety in adolescents. Aim. This study aimed to gain insight into changes in social anxiety before and after a school closure associated with COVID-19 lockdown and its relation to the experience of the lockdown in Dutch adolescents aged 12-15 years. Methods. A total of 188 adolescents (M = 13.48, SD = 0.81) completed self-report measures of social anxiety on March 2020 (T1). In September 2020 (T2) they completed the same self-report measures of social anxiety, enjoyment of the lockdown, and Worries about COVID-19. Results. Adolescents with average or high symptoms of social anxiety before the first school closure showed a significant reduction in social anxiety symptoms after the first school closure. The expected positive association between social anxiety before and after school closure was moderated by Enjoying the lockdown but not gender. Furthermore, higher symptoms of social anxiety before the first school closure were associated with higher levels of enjoying the lockdown. Conclusion. Results indicated that adolescents with moderate to high social anxiety symptoms and who enjoyed the lockdown and associated consequences such as less face-to-face interaction were most at-risk of reporting higher symptoms of social anxiety once the schools had reopened.","['Adolescents, COVID-19, Enjoying the lockdown, Gender, Lockdown, School closure, Social anxiety, Worries about COVID-19']"
Exploring novel environments to enhance memory: The role of novelty seeking,"Kraaijenbrink, Joyce","['Schomaker, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Animal studies have shown that the exploration of novel environments has a positive effect on memory. As shown in virtual reality studies, this positive effect of novelty on memory also seems to hold for humans. However, one study failed to find such a positive effect. It is possible that this is due to individual differences in the novelty seeking personality trait. Therefore, in this master thesis the effect of novelty on recall and recognition memory is identified and the role of novelty seeking in these relationships is addressed. Since novelty processing is associated with dopaminergic neuromodulation in the hippocampus and novelty seeking is related to dopamine sensitivity, it was hypothesized that novelty affects hippocampus-dependent memory (recall) and that this effect is moderated by novelty seeking. No effect was expected on hippocampus-independent memory (recognition memory). Participants in the study were familiarized with a virtual environment and later explored the same (familiar) environment again or a novel one. After this exposure, the participants performed a word-learning task, a visuomotor adaptation task and a landmark test. They also filled out questionnaires regarding their mood and the novelty seeking personality trait. Hierarchical regression analyses suggested that novelty exposure has no effect on memory performance. No moderating effect of novelty seeking was found. Bayesian statistics support this null finding. Future studies need to investigate the influence of individual differences further with a wider range of novelty seekers and the inclusion of the variables age and depth of processing.","['Novelty', 'novelty seeking', 'recall', 'recognition memory']"

The potential moderating effect of the child's age, family socioeconomic status, and school physical environment on the relationship were also examined. Parents of a total of 200 autistic children participated in the study, who filled in information of their child on an online survey. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to examine the link between school participation and psychosocial functioning and the moderating role of child’s age, family socioeconomic status, and school physical environment. The results showed that autistic children’s school participation was negatively associated with psychosocial problems. However, no moderating effect of child’s age, parental education, or school physical environment was found. This study was among the first to provide empirical evidence on the contributing role of school participation in psychosocial development of autistic pupils. Despite its limitations, it serves as a preliminary investigation into the relationship, and it provides methodological recommendations for future research to yield more accurate findings.","['school participation', 'psychosocial problems', 'social participation', 'well-being', 'autistic pupils', 'school physical environment', 'socioeconomic status', 'age']"

Interest group failure or strategic decision? An explanation on why there are gender-blind SDGs,"Timmermans, Ozra",['Janina Heaphy'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This paper analyses the relationship between interest groups and multilateral institutions by using the theory of population ecology (PE). This will be done by analysing the power of feminist lobbyist versus other lobbyist representatives in the negotiation process of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite strong advocative power of these feminist lobbyists and their desire to incorporate gender in all goals, six goals have no mention of gender. These gender-blind goals have been assumed by political academia to be a failure of the feminists’ mobilization power. By using a qualitative case study method with explaining-outcome process-tracing this paper shows that it was in fact a strategic choice of the WMG to focus on certain core issues and less on environmental issues. This mechanism is because of the high involvement of civil society in the creation of the SDGs, which forced the WMG to specialize on crucial issues. Because the theory of PE was studied only on democracies before, this paper extends the theory to also fit for multilateral institutions. While the United Nations applaud the introduction of more interest groups to increase their inclusivity, this paper shows why this increase in civil society can also be considered a disadvantage.","['population ecology, interest group, SDG, lobby, multilateral institution,']"

In this study we examine the role of sympathetic activity, as research shows depression is related to higher heart rate (HR) and lower heart rate variability (HRV) and ketamine may lead to a reset of sympathetic activation. Additionally, we investigate the role of ketamine’s psychedelic effects as some studies have shown a correlation between psychedelics effects and ketamine antidepressant response. This randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial aimed to examine the relationship between sympathetic activity and antidepressant effects after intravenous S-ketamine infusion compared to placebo. Secondly, the study aimed to examine if psychedelic effects affect ketamine’s antidepressant response. In 17 healthy women HR and HRV were assessed at baseline, during ketamine infusion and post-infusion. Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) were used to assess depression and ketamine induced psychedelic effects (VAS Bowdle) at baseline, infusion and post-infusion. We used repeated measures ANOVA’s, correlations and mediation analysis using mixed linear regression. There was no evidence for an antidepressant effect of ketamine compared to placebo across time points. There was evidence for the effect of ketamine in sympathetic activity as an increase of HR and a decrease of HRV was observed, but not linked to depression. Lastly, there was no evidence that psychedelic experiences induced by ketamine affect the antidepressant response. The absence of a clinical sample could play a role in the above results as ketamine may act differently in healthy individuals while the psychedelic effects of ketamine, usually dissociative, may act differently in comparison to classic hallucinogens-psychedelics especially in a healthy sample.",

With the transition from childhood into adolescence, problems such as fear of failure, maladaptive perfectionism and anxiety become increasingly common and prominent. To some degree, these are part of the normal development. However, even subclinical anxiety symptoms negatively affect the lives of many children and adolescents. To improve this, more knowledge is needed on the mechanisms underlying generalised anxiety. This study was the first to investigate the relation between fear of failure, maladaptive perfectionism, and generalised anxiety in early adolescents (aged 9-12 years). These concepts were measured using the short-form Performance Failure Appraisal Inventory, the short-form Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale and the Youth Anxiety Measure, respectively. We demonstrated that maladaptive perfectionism partially mediates the relation between fear of failure and generalised anxiety. Fear of failure most likely motivates maladaptive perfectionism, which is in turn a risk factor for generalised anxiety symptoms in early adolescents. The current findings therefore highlight the importance of prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing fear of failure and maladaptive perfectionism in early adolescents. This would serve to prevent and/or reduce generalised anxiety and its detrimental consequences both in early adolescence itself and possibly later in life as well.","['Fear of failure', 'maladaptive perfectionism', 'generalised anxiety', 'early adolescence']"
Comparing model selection methods using NHST and Cross validation,"Wagg, India","['Wouter, W.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has been debated on for over 40 years due to misuse and misinterpretation.

We compare cross validation to NHST for model selection in linear regression on a data set with N=500 from the Race Implicit association test. To support these findings the comparison was repeated using data from a questionnaire transformed by a PCA. Results show no difference in model selection results between NHST and cross validation when using a dataset with a large sample size and few parameters in both tests. Further research on the use of cross validation as model selection alternative to NHST is needed for datasets with a small sample size or many parameters. Additionally, an ANOVA is used to test a hierarchy of complex models in cross validation. Results showed that by providing interaction terms significantly correlated with the dependent variable, one could replace cross validation models with many parameters for models with fewer parameters consisting of interaction terms whilst improving explanation and prediction of the dataset done by the model.",

Evidence that support this matter is growing, especially the effect social determinants have on suicidality. Although research and clinical practices try to include this aspect, they fail to properly address the importance of the said social determinants in regard to mental health and suicide. Pre-existing literature considers social connectedness as nothing more than an indirect factor regarding mental health and suicidality, and only a small amount of research has focused on this aspect. Additionally, evidence shows that international students are at risk of developing mental health problems and suicidal ideation. Objective: This study aims to investigate the relationship between perceived social connectedness and suicidal ideation in international students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted through Qualtrics, recruiting Leiden University students (n = 139). In order to test suicidal ideation, the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS) was used. To test perceived social connectedness, Social Connectedness Scale - Revised (SCS-R) was used. Respondents were also asked about their nationality in order to determine whether or not they were domestic or international students. The final sample included in order to perform simple linear regression was n = 55. Results: The results showed that higher perceived social connectedness significantly predicts lower suicidal ideation in international students and explains 16.7% of the variance in the population. Conclusions: Overall, the effect of social connectedness on suicidal ideation is evident. Without doubt, there are social determinants that contribute to our mental health and with the investigation of its components, we would be able to improve both theories of suicide and clinical interventions.","['social determinants of mental health', 'suicide', 'suicidality', 'suicidal ideation', 'social connectedness', 'international students']"
Investigating the Effects of Tweets on the Perception of Friendliness in the Framework of Racism,"Kleist, Mika","['Dr. Samarth, Varma']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Racism is a relevant topic and manifests itself in many ways in our society. Social factors have been most researched in that regard to understand the underlying mechanisms of racial bias. Less prominent research has highlighted the effects of personality and mood on racial bias. In the current study, the author investigated the effects of tweets on the perception of friendliness. Based on previous research it was hypothesized that the emotional mood elicited by reading a tweet will have a significant effect on friendliness perception. Tweets reflecting positive emotionality were expected to differ significantly from neutral and negative ones. To investigate this, participants were asked to rate White and Black faces on a 5-point-scale after being presented with a tweet. It was expected to observe a racial bias towards Black faces. Additionally, it was expected that differences in friendliness perception of Black and White faces would reduce after reading a tweet that reflected positive emotionality, whereas the opposite was hypothesized after reading a tweet reflecting negative emotionality. Besides, a personality questionnaire assessing openness to experience was included to investigate the effect of personality on friendliness perception. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed an antiWhite/pro-Black racial bias which was contrary to the hypothesis. A significant effect of mood on friendliness perception was found with a significant difference between the emotional categories (α = .95, p < .001), confirming the hypothesis. No difference in friendliness perception of Black and White faces could be observed, nor was the effect of personality on friendliness perception significant. This study gives an insight on how mood interplays with the formation of racial bias in the context of social media, thereby extending on prior research both on racial bias and the role of emotional states within the framework of racial bias","['racial bias, emotional categories, openness to experience, social judgement']"
De diepgewortelde kracht van schaamte: Over de rol van schaamte veerkracht bij de bereidheid tot contact leggen met schuldeisers,"Toorn Vrijthoff, Milla van der","['Seip, E.C.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Recent studies showed that financial hardship is often accompanied with experiencing shame and avoidance of contact with creditors. The shame resilience theory (Brown, 2006) states that shame is strongly intertwined with the experience of powerlessness and feeling trapped. The aim of this study is to investigate whether reducing these feelings can increase one’s shame resilience and whether this affects one’s willingness to contact a creditor. This is done by manipulating letters of creditors. Each condition gets to read a different letter. There is a control condition which gets to read a standard letter, a powerlessness condition in which the experience of powerlessness is addressed, a feeling trapped condition in which the experience of feeling trapped is addressed and an interaction condition in which both components are addressed. Results show that willingness to contact is greater in the powerlessness condition compared to the control condition. The other two conditions showed no significant difference compared to the control condition.","['Schaamte veerkracht, financiële schulden, schaamte, controle, macht, financiële stress, schuldeiser']"

Het effect van palliatieve zorg op de gezondheidsgerelateerde kwaliteit van leven bij patiënten met COPD,"Bersee, Leonie","['Broese, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Achtergrond: Patiënten met Chronische Obstructieve Long Ziekte (COPD) hebben een lage gezondheidsgerelateerde kwaliteit van leven. Daarom wordt in deze studie het effect van palliatieve zorg op de gezondheidsgerelateerde kwaliteit van leven onderzocht bij deze patiënten. Methodes: Het onderzoek volgt een cluster gerandomiseerd gecontroleerd onderzoeksdesign waarbij acht ziekenhuisregio’s elk fungeren als cluster (vier toegewezen aan interventiegroep en vier toegewezen aan controlegroep). Patiënten gediagnostiseerd met COPD, opgenomen voor een acute longaanval werden uitgenodigd voor de studie. De uitkomstmaat is gezondheidsgerelateerde kwaliteit van leven gemeten met de Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). Er zijn onafhankelijke t-toetsen en analyses van covariantie (ANCOVA) uitgevoerd na drie en na zes maanden. Resultaten en conclusies: 186 participanten (89 interventie en 97 controle) werden geïncludeerd in het onderzoek. Ongeveer de helft van de participanten viel uit of reageerde niet op de vragenlijsten. Er zijn geen significante verschillen gevonden op de gezondheidsgerelateerde kwaliteit van leven na drie maanden tussen de interventiegroep (M = 3.0) en controlegroep (M = 3.4), p = .103 en na zes maanden tussen de interventiegroep (M = 2.9) en controlegroep (M = 3.3), p = .074. Mogelijke redenen waarom er geen effect is gevonden zijn dat de beoordeling van de palliatieve fase als inclusiecriteria wellicht te streng was, er veel missende waarden waren en dat het palliatieve traject bij COPD minder voorspelbaar is dan bij longkanker. Advies voor vervolgonderzoek is om palliatieve zorg in een vroeger stadium aan te bieden en te kiezen voor een kwalitatieve benadering met interviews, waarbij wordt gecorrigeerd voor acute exacerbaties.","['COPD', 'palliative care']"

The effects of fatigue and coping on work absenteeism in people with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis,"Parlevliet, Lyanne","['Hiele, K. van der', 'Egmond, E. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system. Symptoms include fatigue, worsening mobility, and cognitive impairment. Unemployment is common in the MS-community. Within 10 years of disease onset 50-80% of MS-patients will be unemployed. Absenteeism often precedes unemployment. Work absenteeism has been associated with several physical and psychological factors in MS, such as fatigue, and use of maladaptive coping styles. Our aim is to investigate both fatigue and maladaptive coping as possible predictors for work absenteeism. To our knowledge coping and fatigue have not been investigated together with respect to work absenteeism in MS-patients. It is important to study absenteeism to prevent future unemployment as much as possible. Method. We investigated 269 employed MS-patients (age 21-63, Mage = 42.09, SDage = 9.39, 77.3% female) of which 47 had been absent within the last seven days. Participants completed questionnaires regarding fatigue (checklist for individual strength), coping style (coping inventory for stressful situations), and work absenteeism. We conducted three logistic regression analyses in which absenteeism was the dependent variable. Fatigue was investigated with subjective fatigue, motivation, concentration, and physical activity as predictors. Coping style was investigated with task-oriented, emotion-oriented, and avoidant coping as predictors. The last analysis investigated both fatigue and coping as predictors for absenteeism with all previous predictors mentioned. Results. A model in which multidimensional aspects of fatigue predict absenteeism was significant (X2(4) = 30.46, p < .001), fatigue, concentration, and physical activity were significant predictors of absenteeism (Bfatigue = 0.04, p = .036; Bconcentration = 0.07, p = .011, Bphysical_activity = -0.03, p = .032 respectively).","['multiple sclerosis', 'fatigue', 'physical activity', 'concentration', 'emotion-oriented coping style', 'avoidant coping style', 'work absenteeism']"

Association between parent and infant attention bias: the role of parental anxiety,"Belt, Stacey van den","['Nimphy, C.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Anxiety disorders run in families. Therefore it is important to have a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to this familial aggregation of fear. More anxious individuals show more attentional bias and for infants this attentional bias might be a risk factor for anxiety later in life. Therefore this study aimed to investigate whether parental anxiety mediates the association of parental attentional bias and infant attentional bias towards threatening faces. Methods: A cross-sectional research with 220 families invited by the municipality was done. Both parents of the infants filled in the Depression, Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). One of the parents and the infant did an eye-tracking experiment in which they looked at dynamic faces with different emotional expressions. The statistical analysis was done with 187 infants between 5 and 19 months old and their parents. Results: After performing a mediation analysis with PROCESS, against expectations parental attentional bias was not positively related to infant attentional bias towards threatening faces. Also, parental attentional bias was not positively related to parental anxiety. Similarly, parental anxiety was not positively related to infant attentional bias. Discussion: Attentional bias might indicate a greater risk for anxiety in children later in life. Due to mixed findings, future studies should focus on other developmental pathways underlying an attentional bias in infants and its consequences. Also, other possible elements which might underlie an association of attentional bias between parents and infants should be investigated further.",

Parenting style appears to be a possible cause of being a victim of bullying. However, little research is done on the relationship between parenting style and being a victim of bullying. Furthermore, social-emotional functioning appears to be related to both. In this research the extent social-emotional functioning is a mediator for the relationship between parenting style and being a victim of bulling is tested. These variables were measured using parenting and self-report questionnaires among 75 participants of 9 to 12 years of age. The mediation-analyses indicated the possibility of social-emotional functioning being a suppressor for the relationship between parenting style and being a victim of bullying. This indicates that the relationship between parenting style and being a victim of bullying is greater when social-emotional functioning is added in the regression equation. Further research can focus on confirming the suppression effect. By researching this relationship, interventions like social skills training can be deployed early on for children with parents who maintain an unfavourable parenting style. By implementing interventions, being a chronic victim of bullying and additional problems like internalisation can possibly be treated or prevented.","['children', 'KiVa', 'social-emotional functioning', 'bullying', 'victim', 'parenting style']"
Een vignettenstudie onder masterstudenten naar de afweging van relevante risicofactoren bij een uithuisplaatsing,"Bol Raap, Demi","['Haan, W.D. de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"An out-of-home placement is the most severe measure of child protection and has a great impact on children as well as parents. The decision-making process about whether to place a child out of home has been discussed for many years, mainly due to diversity in research results. Despite the considerable research on complex factors, the relevance of these specific risk factors seems to differ between professionals and therefore it remains unknown on which criteria youth care professionals base their decision. This study aims to determine the relation between child-, parent- and family risk factors and out-of-home placement decisions. To test the hypothesis that child-, parent- and family risk factors are related to out-of-home placements, 74 Master students (38 Master students in Education and Child studies, and 36 Master students in Child Law) were presented with vignettes reflecting child protection cases. In addition to these case descriptions, Master students in Child Law received additional information (a recommendation for an out-of-home placement or not) about the case from the Child Protection Board (CPB). The participants were asked to read the four vignettes individually and indicate whether they would consider an out-of-home placement. The Master students in Child Law were asked to assess each vignette twice: once before the advice from the CPB and once after the advice. General decision-maker factors (difference in education), case factors (child-, parent and family) and additional information from the CPB were not related to their decisions. Despite the fact that no significant results were found, the study does provide knowledge about the importance of education and the advice from the CPB. It still remains important to provide insight into the factors influencing decision-making to reduce the subjectivity in these decisions and provide starting points for a more unambiguous approach in the decision-making process.","['uithuisplaatsing', 'kinderbescherming', 'besluitvormingsproces', 'risicofactoren']"
Am I Enough: How Perfectionism Relates to Self-Esteem and the Potentially Moderating Effect of Giftedness in Early Adolescence,"Cruden, Jade",['Kiki Zanolie'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Self-esteem is an accumulation of cognitive and emotional self-reflections. Perfectionism and self-esteem in adolescence are associated to later life (mal)adaptive development. Whereas self-oriented perfectionists (SOP) aspire to an ideal standard for themselves, socially prescribed perfectionists (SPP) experience pressure from others. While striving traits of SOP (SOP-S) are associated with healthy adjustment, critical SOP (SOP-C) and SPP tendencies have been associated with maladjustment. It remains unclear whether intellectual giftedness, a high cognitive ability level, serves as a risk factor or a protective factor for self-esteem. Nevertheless, subgroups of gifted individuals seem vulnerable to maladaptive perfectionism. Therefore, this study investigated associations between perfectionism and self-esteem through multiple linear regression. SOP-S was assumed to have a positive relationship to self-esteem, whereas SOP-C and SPP, respectively, were predicted to have a negative relationship to self-esteem. Moreover, giftedness was hypothesized to be a moderator for all three relationships. Gifted and nongifted children, ages 10 through 12, completed the Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). SOP-C was indeed negatively associated with self-esteem. Neither SOP-S or SPP appeared significantly related to self-esteem. No moderation effect of giftedness was found, suggesting a similar effect of SOP-C on self-esteem for gifted and nongifted students. The lack of associations for either SOP-S or SPP with self-esteem was not in line with past literature. The CAPS may have failed to capture the essence the SOP-S dimension and the developmental stage of participants might have influenced their experience of SPP. Future studies should include larger sample sizes and preferably additional measures of perfectionism. Multiple reporters would be beneficial.","['Giftedness', 'self-esteem', 'perfectionism']"

Shame can make financial problems worse, because shame leads to avoidance of all information surrounding these financial problems. Therefore, in this study, an intervention was done to increase shame resilience. The research question that was attempted to be answered is: 'Does increasing shame resilience affect willingness to contact the creditor?' To measure this, an online questionnaire was administered to 189 participants between the ages of 18 and 75. There were four different conditions. First, the control condition, which stated that the debtor still had to pay money and when this had to be done. Second, the powerlessness condition, in which several options were offered if they could not pay. Third, the condition of feeling trapped which stated that the debtors were not alone, that the debtors could also contact the creditor if they were ashamed and the statement that being in debt is okay. Fourth, there was an interaction condition in which increasing the sense of power and decreasing the feeling of being trapped were combined. The study found that a heightened sense of power led to a greater willingness to contact the creditor. In addition, a reduced sense of being trapped did not lead to a greater willingness to contact. The interaction condition also did not lead to a greater willingness to contact.","['Schaamte', 'schaamteveerkracht', 'financiële stress', 'gevoel van gevangenzitten', 'machteloosheid']"
Metacontrol State Model Explains Additional Variance in Single-Dimension Impulsivity-Compulsivity Spectrum,"Bauman, Sandy","['Prochazkova, L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction The traditional approach to impulsivity and compulsivity entails that those behaviors are driven by reward sensitivity and anxiety/avoidance. According to the Metacontrol State Model by Hommel (MSM) (2015), tendencies towards either flexibility or persistence are the root of impulsive and compulsive behaviors, respectively. This study investigated whether the MSM can explain the additional variance of the single-dimension impulsivity-compulsivity spectrum in the subclinical population. Methods 41 Participants participated in the study with ages ranging from 18-35 years (M = 23.81; SD = 3.53). Data was gathered through questionnaires and experiments (S-UPPS, Stroop Task, Monetary Incentive Delay Task and Alternate Uses Task). Results The data was analyzed with a Multiple Linear Regression Analysis. The proposed model significantly predicts impulsivity and compulsivity with flexibility and persistence (F(4,32) = 5.948, p = .001, adjusted R² = .382). Conclusion The present study supports the theory of the MSM predicting impulsivity and compulsivity. Future research is recommended to confirm this to a greater extent.",
"Examining heart rate (variability), emotional processing, and depressive symptoms in the working mechanism of ketamine: a study on healthy participants","Eijk, Floor van",['A. Moreira João'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the search for an antidepressant with a rapid onset and long-lasting effects for patients with treatment-resistant depression, more and more studies have focused on ketamine. In our study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between increased heart rate, decreased heart rate variability, improved positive emotional processing and decreased depression after ketamine-infusion on a healthy female sample. This within-subjects designed study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Our seventeen healthy participants received ketamine and a placebo on two separate test days. We conducted our analyses with repeated measures ANOVAs, dependent samples t-tests, and mediation analyses. Although we found no significant effects, the following came to light. It stood out that after ketamine administration, participants showed small increases of depression. Further, sympathetic activity regarding heart rate and heart rate variability seemed to be successfully replicated with ketamine infusion. Also, both after a placebo and ketamine participants showed small improvements of positive emotional processing. Lastly, the improvement on positive emotional processing induced by ketamine did not mediate the hypothesized relationship between heart rate (variability) and depression. Different possible explanations lie at hand. For example, possibly healthy populations respond differently to ketamine infusion compared to depressed individuals regarding cardiac responses, depression, and emotional processing. We emphasize the importance of further research on how ketamine can provide opposing effects for depressed and healthy individuals to identify characteristics of the groups in which ketamine is and is not an efficacious antidepressant.","['ketamine, depression, heart rate (variability), emotional processing, facial emotion recognition tasks']"

Uit PIRLS onderzoek is gebleken dat het leesvaardigheidsniveau van leerlingen uit groep 6 in Nederland, stagneert. Om het leesvaardigheidsniveau te laten stijgen, moet de kwaliteit van het technisch leesonderwijs omhoog. In dit onderzoek is daarom de volgende onderzoeksvraag gesteld: In hoeverre passen de leerkrachten van de midden- en bovenbouw van drie basisscholen de uit literatuur effectief gebleken didactische principes op het gebied van technisch lezen toe? Hierbij werd eerst literatuuronderzoek gedaan naar effectieve didactische principes, hieruit kwamen 7 didactische principes naar voren: koorlezen, luisterend lezen, herhaald lezen, expliciete directe instructie model, individueel begeleid hardop lezen, listening passage preview en tutorlezen. Daarna is aan de hand van een vragenlijst onderzocht met welke didactische principes leerkrachten van drie scholen bekend zijn. De leerkrachten van de drie scholen zijn bekend met 6 van de 7 principes, alleen listening passage preview was niet onder alle leerkrachten bekend. Daarna is gekeken naar de inzet van de principes en of er significant verschil per bouw is. Alleen tutorlezen wordt zelden ingezet, wat mogelijk komt door de COVID-19 pandemie ten tijde van het onderzoek. Tussen de midden- en bovenbouw is er slechts één significant verschil in inzet van didactische principe, dit betreft individueel begeleid hardop lezen. Dit principe blijkt voornamelijk effectief voor de middenbouw, vermoedelijk dat het daarom significant minder wordt ingezet in de bovenbouw.

An Intervention Study Examining the Effectiveness of Loving Kindness Meditation in Reducing Depressive Symptoms: Compassionate Coping as a Mediator?,"Silhan, Mike","['Garnefski, N.', 'Kraaij, V.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM) has been attributed significant negative associations with depression in meta-analyses, yet little is known about the mechanisms of action. Some studies implicate a coping style characterized by self-compassion as potential mediator. Aim: We are interested in whether the LKM intervention has the potential to decrease depression and increase self-compassion. Self-compassionate coping was examined as a mediating variable. Method: A sample of 57 university students underwent a pretest-posttest design. Self-compassion was measured with the Self-Compassion Scale, depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire – 9, and self-compassionate coping was assessed using the Self-Compassionate Coping Measure. Participants completed all measures at both pre and posttest. Between both measurement moments there were 12 days in which participants followed either the LKM or a control exercise daily. Repeated measures ANOVAs and a simple mediation analysis were performed. Results: Over time, both groups decreased in their depression and increased in their self-compassion scores. Assignment to the LKM condition did not result in significantly higher self-compassion scores compared to control. We found a significant effect of LKM for depressive symptoms only when controlling for successfully completed homework exercises. Self-Compassionate coping did not emerge as significant mediator in our statistical analysis. Conclusion: The results indicate a mixed picture regarding the efficacy of LKM in reducing depression and increasing self-compassion. Both conditions were possibly too similar and involved helpful elements. Further research into the antidepressant utility of LKM is warranted to understand the exact mechanisms of action.","['Loving Kindness Meditation, Depression, Self-Compassion, Coping Styles']"

There have been multiple studies that show a high self-esteem relates to aggression but there are also studies that show a low selfesteem relates to aggressive behavior. This study focusses on whether high and low selfesteem can both relate to externalizing behavior problems and if this relation is different for different functions the aggressive behavior may have. The participants of this study were 6- to 12-year-old children at high risk of developing delinquent behavior (N=153) and typically developing controls (N=43). The externalizing behavior problems were measured trough the Teacher’s Report Form (TRF). This is a questionnaire about the behavior of the child, filled in by the teacher. The function of the aggression behaviors was also measured by a questionnaire called, Instrument for Reactive and Proactive Agression (IRPA), filled in by the teacher. The self-esteem of the children was measured by The Dutch Self-Perception Profile for Children (CBSK). This is a self-report questionnaire. The findings of this study do not support the expectations that low and high self-esteem relate to externalizing problem behavior. This study did not find any result on the relation between self-esteem and reactive and proactive aggression. There are different explanations possible for this outcome. One of them is self-esteem and externalizing problem behavior are in full development in the ages of these children. To gain more information about why the relation between self-esteem and externalizing problem behavior seems to differ in various studies, there is a need for more extensive longitudinal research on this topic.","['self-esteem, aggressive behavior, externalizing behavior problems, children, delinquency, functions of aggression']"

I draw on what Matthew Longo explores in his book The Politics of Borders as the thick description of borders: Borders from the Outside and Borders for the Inside; while bridging it to Julia Kristeva’s concept of Stranger in her book Strangers to Ourselves to explore how migration affected my national identity. Furthermore, I bring elements from psychoanalysis and education, as well as deepening the research by incorporating the stories of five people with whom I discussed how they experience the same phenomenon I analyze in this paper. By conducting relational interviews, I gather their views on topics such as migration, identity, education, and memories of upbringing within the context of Turkish national identity and migration to the Netherlands. I further discuss the use of interpretive methods in political science and emphasize the importance of sharing individual stories.","['Identity, Migration, Nationality, Turkish nationalism', 'Stranger/Other, Borders.']"
Draagkracht en draaglast onder Nederlandse jongeren. In opdracht van GGD Zeeland en het Nederlands Centrum Jeugdgezondheidszorg.,"Khoenkhoen, Swareshwani","['Lotz, A.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het is bekend dat het mede door de coronacrisis slecht is gesteld met het welzijn van jongeren. Om dit welzijn van jongeren in kaart te kunnen brengen, is het nuttig om inzicht te verkrijgen in de factoren die volgens jongeren bijdragen aan hun draagkracht en draaglast. Daarom is er behoefte aan het ontwikkelen van een balansmeter voor jongeren. Deze balansmeter kan bijdragen aan de vroegsignalering en mogelijke preventie van latere problematiek, om zo het welzijn van jongeren te kunnen verhogen. Dit onderzoek vormt de eerste stap in het proces richting het ontwikkelen van een balansmeter. De vraag die centraal staat in dit onderzoek is welke factoren Nederlandse jongeren van 13 tot en met 15 jaar ervaren als belangrijk voor het definiëren van hun draagkracht en draaglast. Om dit te meten is een online vragenlijst ontwikkeld waarin de domeinen mentaal welzijn, fysiek welzijn, sociale relaties, schoolbeleving, leefomgeving en vrijetijdsbesteding zijn uitgevraagd. Op basis van de resultaten blijken factoren met betrekking tot sociale relaties, met name in de thuissituatie, van belang te zijn voor draagkracht.

Er wordt geadviseerd om aan de hand van voorgaande factoren in te zetten op preventie en vroegsignalering van problematiek onder jongeren. Ook kan aanvullend kwantitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd worden onder een andere representatieve steekproef om zo de resultaten beter te kunnen generaliseren. Daarnaast wordt geadviseerd om door middel van kwalitatief onderzoek het belang van de gevonden factoren uit te laten diepen door jongeren. Ten slotte is het interessant om de onderzochte leeftijdscategorie te vergelijken met de leeftijd van 16 tot en met 18 jaar wat betreft de ervaren draagkracht en draaglast. Daarmee kan onderzocht worden of het nuttig is om voor elke leeftijdscategorie apart een balansmeter te ontwikkelen.","['Draagkracht', 'Draaglast', 'Balansmeter', 'Welzijn', 'Welbevinden', 'Jongeren', 'Veerkracht', 'GGD', 'NCJ']"
"COVID-19 Pandemic: Are Women at Risk for Adjustment Disorder Symptoms Because of Conflicts, Stay-At-Home Burden, and Violence?","Wagner, Vitalia",['Joanne Mouthaan'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background Conflicts and violence are expected to increase because of stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conflicts and violence at home might amplify stay-at-home burden during the pandemic, increasing risk for adjustment disorder. Women might experience conflicts, violence, and stay-at-home burden more likely than men, predisposing them for adjustment disorder. Objective This study aims to investigate whether conflicts/violence predict more stay-at-home burden and adjustment disorder symptoms depending on gender. It is hypothesized that stay-at-home burden mediates the positive association between conflicts/violence and adjustment disorder symptoms. Further, it is hypothesized that gender moderates this positive association between conflicts/violence and stay-at-home burden, with conflicts/violence predicting more stay-at-home burden and adjustment disorder symptoms for women than men. Methods A cross-sectional online survey study was conducted with mostly female and Dutch participants (n = 1883) from July 24th, 2020 until November 15th, 2020. Conflicts, violence, and stay-at-home burden were assessed with the self-constructed survey Burden by Corona Pandemic. Adjustment disorder symptoms were assessed with Adjustment Disorder – New Module 8. A moderated mediation analysis with “PROCESS” macro model number 7 (v4.1) was conducted. Results The moderated mediation analysis yielded non-significant results. Stay-at-home burden was not significantly mediating the positive association between conflicts/violence and adjustment disorder symptoms. Gender was not significantly moderating the positive association between conflicts/violence and stay-at-home burden. Discussion In this study, women did not report more stay-at-home burden and adjustment disorder symptoms due to conflicts and violence than men. Longitudinal studies should investigate how gender, conflicts, violence, and stay-at-home burden can impact mental health long-term during a pandemic.","['COVID-19 pandemic', 'gender', 'adjustment disorder', 'conflicts', 'violence', 'stay-at-home burden']"

The Implications and The Causes of Agricultural and Climate Issues Management Problems in Indonesia,"Maulana, Rizky",['Mark R Westmoreland and Federico De Musso'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Indonesia is one of the countries vulnerable to the impact of climate change due to its geography. Climate change has threatened the agriculture industry and the country’s ability for food security which can be a severe problem in the future. However, there are problems with how the government of Indonesia is trying to manage the impact of climate change on agriculture, especially on rice paddy farming, due to the impacts of the past neo-liberal policy (the green revolution) and challenges within the political reformation after the downfall of the Soeharto regime. In this thesis, I am trying to explore the implications and the causes of agricultural and climate issues management problems in Indramayu, Indonesia, by utilizing Aryo Danusiri’s (2018) visual methods of menjaring (trawling) and berburu (hunting). In understanding the implications, I was using the trawling method where I argue that climate change and agricultural management problems in Indonesia are creating a precarious situation for the rice paddy farmers, in line with Anna Tsing’s (2015: 20) statement of precarity being the condition of our time. Lastly, I was using the hunting method where I found out that ‘sectoral ego’ problems within the government and aggressive neo-liberal politics as one of the major causes.","['Green Revolution', 'Climate Change', 'Rice Paddy Farmers', 'Indramayu', 'Indonesia', 'Flooding', 'Precarity', 'Precariousness', 'Precarious', 'Ego Sektoral', 'Visual Ethnography']"

Adaptiveness of Somatic Focus and Its Role in Overpredicted Pain Experiences: Report on an Experimental Study about Pain Expectancies,"Myronenko, Anastasiia","['Peerdeman, K.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Pain is an unpleasant subjective experience that can be influenced by various factors. One of the important determinants of the feeling of pain is how much pain one expects to feel. Usually, expecting higher pain would result in experiencing pain as more intense than it is. A factor that might interact with pain expectancies is somatic focus - how one perceives changes in the body. Previous research suggested that somatic focus might vary on a spectrum from maladaptive (hypervigilant anxious-driven) to adaptive (mindful), and that might interact with how one would perceive overpredicted pain. This within-subject study investigated how correctly predicted, as well as mildly and strongly overpredicted painful electrical stimuli of moderate intensity were rated by a healthy sample of 30 people. Their responses on the MAIA-2, scale were used to assess the adaptiveness of somatic focus. We expected that those who had a more adaptive style of somatic focus would give more accurate pain ratings to overpredicted stimuli and will follow an overpredicting pain cue to a lesser extent. Statistical analysis showed that even though the actual intensity of the moderately painful stimuli was the same every time, participants rated all overpredicted stimuli as being more painful than correctly predicted ones. Stimuli that were strongly overpredicted were rated higher than the ones that had mild overprediction. Somatic focus did not affect how much participants followed the cue in their ratings, thus more research is needed to operationalize the concept and see if it truly can be adaptive or maladaptive.","['Pain, Expectancies, Somatic Focus']"

Both aggression and grooming are fundamental interactive processes influencing social structures in human and non-human primates. Each of these interaction contexts involves two parties – an initiator (aggressor or groomer) and a recipient (victim or groomee) – that may differ in the relevance assigned to the information they convey to observers. Using an eye-tracking paradigm, the present study investigated the presence of a human attentional bias towards position (initiator vs recipient) when looking at conspecific individuals who were observed in interactions involving aggression or grooming. Participants were presented with alternating naturalistic videos of dyadic grooming and aggression, each followed by a still frame from the video displaying the individuals involved. Eye-tracking data in terms of gaze duration at the initiator and recipient was collected during the presentation of the still images. The results indicated that humans demonstrate a significant gaze bias at the aggressor compared to the victim and at the groomee compared to the groomer. Several processes potentially underlying this gaze preference as well as future avenues for research are discussed.","['aggression, attention, eye-tracking, grooming, third-party observations']"

In addition, possibilities for differentiation in word learning education are investigated. The goal of this research was to maximize word development of preschool children and to reduce differences in vocabulary. The study involved 52 Dutch preschool children (50% girl, 50% boy) aged 48-71 months and consisted of a classroom reading intervention and an individual differentiation reading intervention. The participants were divided into four subgroups. Throughout the classroom reading intervention, a within-subject design exposed all participants to the following four conditions: without Viertakt, with Viertakt and phonological consolidation, with Viertakt and phonological and semantic consolidation, and the control condition. The individual differentiation reading intervention consisted of a between-subjects design. Half of the participants who benefited the least from the classroom reading intervention, were assigned to two conditions: differentiation whilst actively answering questions and differentiation without answering questions. The findings indicated that preschool children achieve a significantly bigger vocabulary from the classroom reading intervention with Viertakt compared to the classroom reading without Viertakt. Their vocabulary grew equally in both forms of consolidation. The preschool children possessed a bigger vocabulary after the individual differentiation reading intervention, however it is not certain whether the growth in vocabulary was due to the differentiation or also as a result of consolidation over time. Actively questioning helped the preschool children to improve their vocabulary. Altogether, the classroom reading intervention leads to a greater vocabulary and the individual differentiation reading intervention diminishes the pre-existing differences between children. Further research, including a control group for the differentiation, is needed to investigate the effect of the differentiation on vocabulary development.","['vocabulary', 'reading intervention', 'Viertakt', 'electronic storybooks', 'differentiation']"

This study examined the relation between experienced child abuse and the development of internalizing and externalizing problems, and the potential mediating roles of self-esteem and social support. In total, 280 participants filled in questionnaires about experienced child abuse, self-esteem, social support, and loneliness. The participants were adults between the age of 18 and 88. The sample had an oversampling of a history with childhood abuse, because they were recruited from studies which also researched childhood abuse. Results showed a significant positive relationship between experienced child abuse and internalizing problems. This relationship was partially mediated by self- esteem and loneliness, such that lower self-esteem and more loneliness were associated with more internalizing problems after having experienced childhood abuse. Experienced child abuse had a significant positive relationship with externalizing problems. This relationship was also partially mediated by self-esteem and loneliness, such that, lower self-esteem and more loneliness were associated with more externalizing problems after having experienced child abuse. Focusing on increasing self-esteem and decreasing loneliness in prevention for high-risk children can decrease their chance on developing internalizing and externalizing problems after experiencing child abuse.",

To detect SSA early and implement preventive interventions, it is necessary to identify risk factors for SSA. The objective of this study was to identify individual (being female) and family risk factors (number of children in the family and parental substance abuse and/or psychopathology) for SSA by comparing the presence of these factors to a group that experienced sexual abuse by a different familiar person (SAFP ), among clients treated for trauma related to these forms of sexual abuse between 2011 and 2021 at the Landelijk Psychotraumacentrum. Using a correlational matched pairs design, a casefile analysis was conducted, using matched cases of SSA (N-=-25) and SAFP (N-=-25). Cases were coded using a coding system designed for this study. The results indicated that the over-representation of female victims was comparable for SSA and SAFP (p-=-.52), meaning that being female was a risk factor for both forms of sexual abuse. Furthermore, victims of SSA lived more often in families with a larger number of children (p-<-.001), making it a larger risk factor for SSA compared to SAFP. This remained a risk factor when controlling for parental substance abuse and/or psychopathology (p-=-.002). Finally, the presence of parental substance abuse and/or psychopathology was more likely in SAFP (p-=-.02), making it a larger risk factor for SAFP compared to SSA. This remained a risk factor when controlling for number of children in the family (p-=-.02). The present study has taken a first crucial step in identifying risk factors for SSA and in developing possible risk assessment tools and preventive interventions, by showing how three possible risk factors relate to SSA. However, further research is needed, for which the present study can serve as a starting point.","['sexual abuse, sibling sexual abuse, sexual abuse by a different familiar person, risk factors']"

It is a valuable precious metal, and 80 percent of all of the world’s platinum can be found in South Africa. Despite this, very few South Africans actually benefit from its lucrative platinum mining sector. In fact, this sector appears to cause more problems for most of the people in mining regions, from bad working conditions to air and water pollution. In this thesis I will argue that the lucrativeness of the platinum mining sector and its many negative externalities are related through the Resource Curse. I hypothesize that the owners of platinum mines will use a specific form of lobbying – cronyism, also known as the ‘revolving door’ – to influence members of the National Assembly of South Africa to adopt policies favorable to the mining sector. My research will focus specifically on the case of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act of 2002 (MPRDA).","['Resource Curse', 'South Africa', 'Platinum', 'Extraction', 'Mines', 'Minerals', 'Lobbying', 'Cronyism']"
Lifestyle factors and Bipolar disorder: The effect of alcohol consumption and exercise on bipolar mood and the moderating effect of stress,"Senkum, Parichat","['Koenders, M.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is considered a complex disease and certain lifestyle factors such as alcohol use, exercise and stress could perhaps influence the severity of the illness. The effect of alcohol on mood seems to still be unclear. Also, exercise seems to decrease depressive symptoms, but it seems unclear whether or not it is also beneficial for manic symptoms. Further, stress may be another factor that influence individuals’ decision in engaging in certain lifestyles which in turn may impact mood. This current study aimed to investigate the relationship between these lifestyle factors and bipolar mood. Method: Participants (N=58) age range between 19-61 year-old of which 37 were female and 21 were male who participated in the Bipolar Netherlands Cohort (BINCO), a longitudinal study of patients who have recently been diagnosed with BD. At baseline and at the 6 months follow up, the amount of alcohol consumption, exercise and stress were assessed, as well as manic symptoms (YMRS) and depressive symptoms (QIDS). Results: Alcohol consumption and exercise showed no significant associations with bipolar mood both at baseline and at the follow-up. However, exercise was found to show significant quadratic association with manic symptoms at the baseline. This result added useful information regarding the effect of exercise and its influence on manic mood in patients with BD. Also, stress was found to show no moderating effect between alcohol consumption and mood nor exercise and mood in BD. Conclusion: This study added interesting findings regarding the effect of alcohol consumption, exercise and stress on the severity of bipolar mood. This information could give a better understanding of how lifestyle factors could perhaps influence BD.","['bipolar disorder', 'lifestyle factors', 'alcohol consumption', 'effect of exercise', 'stress']"

But what if people with less money (or more financial stress) want to do a more expensive pleasurable activity? Can they still enjoy that hedonic activity as much as people with no financial stress? It is expected that people with more financial stress will enjoy a (expensive) hedonic activity less and that this can be moderated by people’s capacity to enjoy pleasurable capacities (trait hedonic capacity). The aim of this study, held among Dutch citizens (n =129), was to identify if there is a relationship between financial stress (PIFS), trait hedonic capacity (THC) (and the interaction effect of those two), and the enjoyment of a hedonic activity (low- vs. high-cost). A mixed-model- ANOVA showed that financial stress is not a significant predictor for enjoyment. However, there is a significant interaction effect between THC and PIFS on the average enjoyment. All in all, the research has shown that hedonic activities do not need to be high in cost in order for an individual to enjoy the experience.","['Hedonism', 'Enjoyment', 'Financial stress', 'Trait hedonic capacity', 'Intrusive thoughts']"

A common developmental disorder in adolescence is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which might also influence learning in the peer context. Although research on observational learning has shown that children learn better from their peers than from adults, little attention has been paid to adolescents and the role of different peer relationship types, friendship quality, and ADHD symptoms. In our study, 203 adolescents aged 10–15 years performed an observational reinforcement learning task in four conditions (i.e., individually; with a friend; a known neutral classmate; an unknown peer) and filled out sociometric nominations and questionnaires measuring friendship quality and ADHD symptoms. Results showed that adolescents learned significantly better from a peer than individually, but there was no difference in learning performance between the social observational learning conditions (i.e., friend; neutral classmate; unknown peer). Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect of peer relationships and friendship quality on observational learning, and the relationship between ADHD symptoms and observational learning was not mediated by friendship quality. However, ADHD symptoms had a significant negative effect on observational reinforcement learning. These findings show that adolescents benefit from learning from a peer, regardless of the relationship with that peer, encouraging the implementation of peer learning in education. Finally, the results indicate that individuals with ADHD symptoms are potentially disadvantaged in their ability to learn from peers, highlighting the importance of developing interventions to foster observational learning.","['adolescence, observational reinforcement learning, peer relationships, friendship quality, ADHD symptoms']"

Their ability to cope with difficult situations influences their academic performance. Students with ASD are likely to face more challenges in university as a result of their autistic symptoms. Additionally, they may experience more difficulties employing effective coping strategies to manage difficult situations compared to students without ASD. This study explored the relationship between primary coping style and academic performance. Differences in primary coping style between university students with and without ASD were also examined. This study also investigated the relationship between primary coping style, autism diagnosis, and academic performance. Students with a clinical diagnosis of autism completed the AQ-Short to assess autistic symptoms. Students’ primary coping style was examined based on their scores on the subscales of the Brief-COPE. Academic performance was measured by students’ grade point average for the current academic year. Results showed, primary coping style was associated with academic performance. Problem-focused and emotion-focused primary coping styles were associated with better academic performance compared to avoidance primary coping style. Additionally, students with ASD were more likely to employ emotion-focused primary coping style or avoidance primary coping style, whereas students without ASD were more likely to employ problem-focused primary coping style. However, autism diagnosis did not moderate the relationship between primary coping style and academic performance. These findings suggested a link between primary coping style and academic performance, as well as differences in coping between students with and without ASD. Limitations and implications for future research were also discussed.","['Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'University students', 'Coping styles', 'Academic performance']"

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of dynamic testing, using a graduated prompts method, to analyse the learning potential in gifted children. This paper outlines the effect of the dynamic testing of analogic reasoning and the role of test anxiety and planning skills in relation to analogical reasoning and provided instructions. Sample. In this study participated 80 children (48 boys, 32 girls) from the western part of the Netherlands, their average age was 8.1 years (SD = 0.6). Method. An experimental group (41 children) which received the graduated prompts training, was compared in results of completing of analogic reasoning task with a control group (39 children). A pre-test-post-test-design with randomized blocking procedure was used to distinguish both groups. The computer program computerized dynamic testing of analogic reasoning was used to investigate analogic reasoning skills. The Children’s Test Anxiety Scale (CTAS), a self report, was used to measure test anxiety. The digital task named Tower of Hanoi was used to investigate the planning skills of the participants. Results. Dynamic testing of analogic reasoning proved to be successful in improving skills by offering a standardized training using the graduated prompts method. An influence of planning skills on provided hints was also found. Test anxiety did not seem related to dynamic testing of analogic reasoning. Conclusions. Dynamic testing is an effective method to analyse learning potential in analogical reasoning skills. Further research is necessary to investigate the role of planning skills and other metacognitive components. Although this study did not find any influence of test anxiety, further research may focus on more objective measurements of stress during test situations. The results of this study could be implemented in education and clinical assessments.","['dynamic testing', 'graduated prompts method', 'analogical reasoning', 'learning potential', 'planning skills', 'test anxiety']"
Het effect van een lotgenotengespreksgroep op de mate van zelfwaardering van jongeren met autismespectrumstoornis en genderdysforie,"Almekinders, Flora","['Meijer, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Among adolescents with gender dysphoria (GD) there appears to be an overrepresentation of the comorbid diagnosis autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while both diagnoses occur in (less than) 1% of the population (De Vries et al., 2010). The combination of ASD and GD is associated with low self-esteem, which can result in psychological problems (Balleur-van Rijn et al., 2012). To date, no intervention exists to increase the level of self-esteem of adolescents with ASD and GD (Myers et al., 2011). The current study focuses on the effect of a peer discussion group on the degree of self-esteem of adolescents with ASD and GD. This was examined in 33 adolescents with both ASD and GD (mean 17;7 years), consisting of 19 gender variant boys and 15 gender variant girls. To assess the degree of self-esteem, the Competentie Belevingsschaal voor Adolescenten (CBSA) was used. The CBSA is a self-report questionnaire that uses 35 items to measure various components of the self-concept. This questionnaire will be administered prior to and after the peer discussion group. The effect of the peer discussion group was measured using multiple repeated measures ANOVAs. The results show that the peer discussion group has no effect on the overall level of self-esteem, as the difference in self-esteem between the pre- and post-measurement was not significant (F(1, 32) = .08, p = .77). Looking closer into the results, the peer discussion group was found to have a negative effect on self-esteem concerning physical appearance (F(1, 32) = 8.73, p = .006) and a positive effect on self-esteem concerning behavioral attitudes (F(1, 32) = 11.14, p = .002). Thus, in its current form, the peer discussion group does not appear to be an appropriate intervention to increase all domains of self-esteem of adolescents with ASD and GD.","['Autisme, ASS genderdysforie']"

The influence of Russia and the US on EU member states’ sense of urgency to cooperate on defence,"Caris, Jan","['Meegdenburg, H. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In May 2017, during an election rally in Munich, Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel said something that would create international headlines: ‘The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. […] We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands’. The developments that followed were unique for the EU. The EU’s limited military structures already in place were being expanded, became more autonomous, and new mechanisms were created to foster more defence cooperation among the member states. Closer defence cooperation within the EU is generally being ascribed to geopolitical pressures, so how do the narratives of the US and Russia influence EU member states’ sense of urgency to cooperate in the field of defence? I combine the constructivist idea of perception with the realist idea of necessity and look at threat perception and the perceived necessity to cooperate further in defence. By analysing the narratives of the German and French political elite regarding EU defence cooperation in 2018, I come to the conclusion that while the US narratives significantly increase EU member states’ sense of urgency to cooperate in the field of defence, Russia’s narratives do not have such a significant impact.","['Russia', 'US', 'EU', 'defence cooperation', 'external influences']"

Coping in offspring of parents with mood disorders: The influence of trait neuroticism and estimated intelligence on coping st rategies in at risk offspring,"Bakker, Meggie M","['Hiele, K. van der']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Intergenerational research shows that children of parents with a mood disorder are at increased risk of developing a mood disorder themselves. Both risk as well as protective factors are believed to influence the onset of the development of a mood disorder. Coping is believed to be a factor that is of importance when studying this. However, little is known about the mechanisms of coping strategies in this population. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between neuroticism and intelligence on the one hand and coping strategies on the other hand. Neuroticism is linked with higher emotional reactivity to stress and is therefore expected to influence coping. Additionally, the degree of problem-solving abilities which are of importance for adequately coping with stress, is a relevant element of intelligence. Therefore, relationships between neuroticism and intelligence and coping are expected to be found in the population under study. A total of 109 children of parents with a mood disorder who were between 13 and 25 years of age (mean: 19.24 ± 4.02, 69 females (58,7%)) were included in this study. Data of the Utrecht Coping List for Adolescents (UCL-A), the neuroticism items of the Big Five Inventory short form (BFI-xs) and subtests vocabulary and matrix reasoning from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-V (WISC-V) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV) were used in the analyses. Seven multiple regression analyses were performed with each subscale of the UCL-A as outcome variable and neuroticism and intelligence as predictors, with age and sex as control variables. To correct for multiple testing a Bonferroni corrected p-value of .007 was used. The results of this study showed significant associations between neuroticism and active tackling (β = -.423, p <.001), passive response pattern (β =.716, p <.001), and reassuring thoughts (β = -.383, p <.001). Higher levels of neuroticism were related to less active tackling behavior and having fewer comforting thoughts in a stressful situation. Additionally, neuroticism was related to the use of more passive behavior during stress. No relations were found between estimated intelligence and coping. These findings highlight the relevance of a single personality feature in predicting some coping strategies in individuals at risk of developing a mood disorder. Prevention and intervention programs should focus on psychoeducation about mood disorders and coping and on tackling maladaptive coping strategies to bend these into adaptive strategies with the use of tips to correctly apply these strategies. For future research emotion regulation and emotional intelligence should be studied in relation to coping in at-risk offspring.","['Coping, mood disorders, offspring, neuroticism']"
"De therapeutische relatie in de interculturele context: Wat is de relatie tussen aantal sessies in therapie, therapiefase, cultuurafstand en de therapeutische relatie?","Felter, Afanaisa","['Henkelmann, J.R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Doelstelling: In dit onderzoeksproject wordt de relatie tussen aantal sessies, therapiefase, cultuur en de therapeutische relatie onderzocht. De verwachting is dat culturele afstand en tijd in therapie vanuit het perspectief van de cliënt een significant effect hebben op de therapeutische relatie. Methode: Respondenten waren 88 volwassen cliënten uit Nederland, die een online vragenlijst invulden die het effect onderzocht van het aantal sessies in psychotherapie, de fase van therapie en culturele afstand op de therapeutische relatiemaat, California Psychotherapy Alliance Scales patiëntversie (CALPAS-P). Respondenten worden gevraagd de CALPAS-P vragenlijst in te vullen in combinatie met vragen over hun land van herkomst en het land van herkomst van hun therapeut om een culturele afstandsindex te formuleren. Aanvullende vragen zijn gesteld over de therapiefase waarin ze zich bevinden en hoeveel sessies er zijn geweest. De data zijn geanalyseerd door middel van regressie en Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) analyses. Resultaten: De resultaten laten zien dat het aantal sessies en culturele afstand geen significante voorspellers zijn van de CALPAS-scores. Een niet-parametrische test laat ook een zwakke correlatie tussen de variabelen zien. De groepen op aantal sessies en therapiefase verschillen ook niet significant van elkaar op de CALPAS-scores. Conclusie: Uit deze resultaten kan worden geconcludeerd dat culturele afstand en tijd in therapie vanuit het perspectief van de cliënt in dit onderzoek niet significant gerelateerd zijn aan de therapeutische relatie. Verder onderzoek is nodig om de leemte in kennis over het effect van therapiefase, aantal sessies en culturele afstand in relatie tot de therapeutische relatie te overbruggen.","['therapeutic alliance', 'cultural distance', 'hofstede', 'cultural dimensions', 'working alliance']"

Keep away from the stranger! Transmission of social fears through parental social anxiety and verbal information,"Vikström, Ida-Sofia",['Dr. Evin Aktar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Parental communication of verbal threat information may contribute to the acquisition of social fears and induce behavioral avoidance in the offspring in social contexts. In this study, parents verbally communicated standardized threat and safety statements regarding two strangers to their preadolescent children (N = 73, M = 11.44 years, 38 girls) in a laboratory setting. Following the experimental manipulation, the children engaged in a social-evaluative interaction task with the strangers, while their behavioral reactions were simultaneously measured. Parents’ own social anxiety was also measured using standardized questionnaires. No significant association was found between parental verbal communication of threat information and children’s subsequent avoidance behavior in the social task. Further, no support was found for the moderating effect of parental social anxiety in our study. We conclude that parental verbal communication of threat did not induce observable avoidance of strangers with our sample of typically developing preadolescents, and with our experimental paradigm. In light of not significant results, considerations of the experimental paradigm will be further discussed. Our study was the first multimethod experimental study to investigate the role of verbal information on childhood fear acquisition in this age range and with a social situation paradigm.","['social fears, parents, verbal information pathway']"

The mediating role of maladaptive perfectionism in the relation between social anxiety and the negative expectancy bias,"Jongejan, Nienke","['Kortink, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Previous studies show contradictory results on the underlying correlations between perfectionism, social anxiety disorder and the negative expectancy bias. This study investigated whether maladaptive perfectionism is a mediating factor in the relation between social anxiety and the negative expectancy bias. We examined whether the healthy sample showed a positive or negative expectancy bias prior and during a task. Additionally, it was expected that individuals who scored higher on being socially anxious, showed a lower percentage expected acceptance. We predicted that social anxiety and maladaptive perfectionism are positively correlated and, in contrast to this, that maladaptive perfectionism is negatively correlated with the percentage expected acceptance. Moreover, a mediation was presumed, in which the relation between social anxiety and expected acceptance is mediated by maladaptive perfectionism. 149 bachelor students (mean age = 20.40 years) participated in this study and completed the SELF-Profile paradigm. This is a fabricated task in which participants are encouraged to believe that they are being evaluated by peers. The participants are asked to register their expectancies on whether they are liked or disliked by these peer strangers. Every evaluation followed feedback on if this prediction was true or not. Social anxiety was measured by using the LSAS questionnaire and (mal)adaptive perfectionism was measured by using the APS-R questionnaire. Contrary to our expectations, we found that there was no significant mediation. The mediation analysis, analyzed with Process macro, showed no mediation of maladaptive perfectionism in the relation between social anxiety and the negative expectancy bias before (Effect = -.027; 95% CI [-0.07, -0.00]) and during (Effect = .006; 95% CI [-0.016, 0.034]) the task. Not all additional hypotheses were met. We can conclude that this study did not show the expected mediation. Future research can focus on other possible mediating factors since influences of other variables are not ruled out within this study.",
Difficult social encounters: police officers' feeling of preparedness and investigating VR as a training method,"Huisman, Anique","['Procházková, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Police officers need hard skills and soft skill during their work. Adequate soft skills are essential for a police officer because they use them during most of their time working, they can prevent unnecessary use of force and they influence the public perception of police quality. Feedback is less objective for soft skills training and real interactions are too complex to simulate in a classroom. Virtual Reality (VR) soft skills training might be able to create a more realistic training environment. The first part of the study used a survey to research police officers’ feeling of preparedness for different incidents. It was expected that police officers feel more prepared for incidents requiring hard skills compared to incidents requiring soft skills. In the second part of the study, participants tried out two VR empathy simulations and answered questionnaires about their experience. It was expected that the simulations were able to induce empathy towards the protagonist in police officers. It was also expected that self-reported presence predicts how police officers rate the effectivity of the training. Although results show that participants indicated to feel more prepared for incidents requiring hard skills, participants mostly mentioned that soft skills should be better prepared. This contradiction is possibly caused by a relationship between the work experience of the participants and their feeling of preparedness. The VR simulations were unable to induce empathy and no relationship was found between self-reported presence and the effectivity of the training. Future research should investigate the feeling of preparedness of recently graduated police officers. More research is needed into the effectiveness of VR empathy training. Learning more about police officers’ feeling of preparedness and the effectivity of VR contributes to the soft skill adequacy of police officers and possibly other professional fields.","['Virtual Reality', 'police officers', 'police training', 'soft skills', 'hard skills', 'empathy']"
Don’t think about it ̶ Perfectionism and sleep quality: possible mediatory role of maladaptive repetitive thinking,"Kamta, Kiran","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Benefits of sleep (e.g., mental health) and detrimental effects of sleep-loss (e.g., impaired academic performance) have been extensively researched and implications are broad. A considerable amount of research on the relations between perfectionism and sleep exists, where perfectionism negatively affects sleep quality. Mediators, primarily anxiety, affecting sleep quality have been investigated as well. However, within the bounds of conducted literature search, research with a mediatory model of maladaptive repetitive thinking (MRT) on perfectionism and sleep quality in a student population seems to require further exploration. Therefore, current work investigated whether MRT (i.e., worry and rumination) mediates the relationship between perfectionism and sleep quality. Data was analyzed from an overarching main study which, through convenience sampling, recruited 69 healthy university students who filled in online questionnaires (e.g., assessing rumination and sleep quality). In line with previous research, results showed that increased perfectionism was related to worse sleep quality and increased maladaptive repetitive thinking. Furthermore, increases in maladaptive repetitive thinking was related to worse sleep quality. However, the proposed mediation was found to be nonsignificant. Several limitations were at play (e.g., self-report measurements), thus it is recommended to replicate the current work and minimize these limitations. As sleep has a wide array of implications on healthy overall functioning it is recommended to explore the triad further, paving the way to innovations to improve sleep quality and consequently healthy functioning in the student population.","['mediation', 'worry', 'rumination', 'perfectionism', 'sleep quality', 'penn state worry questionnaire', 'Pittsburgh sleep quality index', 'ruminative response scale', 'revised almost perfect scale']"
Mindful With Your Baby: Examining Treatment Effectiveness in a Preventive and a Clinical Setting,"Kroyer, Johanna",['Eva Potharst & Evin Aktar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"The aim of the current study is to investigate the effectiveness of the Mindful with your baby training in a clinical setting and in a preventive setting. The training is an eight-week group-based program designed for mothers of babies who cope with parental stress. Mothers in the clinical setting (n = 39) and in the preventive setting (n = 19) completed questionnaires on mindfulness, mindful parenting, parental stress, and parent-child relationship problems at pre-test, post-test, and two-month follow-up. We used multilevel analyses to examine the treatment outcomes. Furthermore, we used multilevel models to explore whether improvements in general and interpersonal aspects of mindfulness (i.e. acting with awareness, listening with full attention) are associated with parent-child relationship problems. The analyses revealed a significant improvement in mindful parenting, and a decline in parental stress and parent-child relationship problems from pre- to post-test (medium to large effect sizes). At follow-up, the effects were maintained for parent-child relationship problems. No differences in effects between the settings were found for any given period. Regarding our exploratory analyses, an improvement in listening with full attention and acting with awareness was not associated with a decline in parent-child relationship problems between pre-test and follow-up. Overall, mothers in the current sample showed positive treatment outcomes after the training, without differences between the preventive and the clinical setting. We suggest that both, mothers who register themselves in a preventive settinag and mothers who are referred to mental health care because of parental stress, can benefit from the training. On the long term, these improvements may contribute to a secure attachment relationship and a safe family environment for the baby.",

The goal of the current study was to determine the difference between video, audio and text when it comes to story comprehension. Besides the difference between the three different media, we were interested in the difference between the comprehension of strong and weak readers on these media. Because the standard of coherence could play an important part in story comprehension, we also examined if there was a difference in the standard of coherence between strong and weak readers. Children between eight and twelve years old (Grade 4-6) participated in this research. A within-subjects design was used and all children were presented with a video, an audio and a text. They answered open-ended questions to test their comprehension of the story. Their standard of coherence was tested with a self-report questionnaire. The results indicated a difference between the comprehension across different media. After watching a video, the story comprehension was better in comparison to after reading a text. No difference was found between audio and the other media. Strong readers appeared to have better comprehension than weak readers, but the pattern wasn’t different for video, audio and text. In addition, the standard of coherence didn’t differ between strong and weak readers. These findings have implications for the educational practice. Apparently both strong and weak readers seem to benefit from watching a video when it comes to their story comprehension. Teachers could therefore use videos to increase the story comprehension of their students. No difference was found between audio and text, but teachers may use audio to add some change to their lessons, in order to increase the engagement and motivation in reading education.","['verhaalbegrip', 'leesbegrip', 'media', 'niveau van leesbegrip', 'standard of coherence']"
'Het is maar een fase' Een systematisch review over ouderschap bij gendervariante kinderen,"Broeke, Nadja van den","['Rosmalen, L. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Gender variant children can experience gender dysphoria. When a child with gender dysphoria is supported is his or her gender identity at a young age through a social transition, this may lead to an overall improvement in well-being. However, some children who went through a social transition at a young age, return to their birth gender when they are older. This means that there is still no firm advice for parents of gender variant children. It is therefore important to inform parents about the positive and negative sides of a social transition. This systematic review synthesizes studies concerning the experiences of transgender parenting in the United States, Canada and Western Europe. The articles were selected through searching in various databases. Out of 449 identified articles, 24 articles remained. Most parents across these 24 studies report interpersonal processes (emotions, concerns) and interactions with relatives and health-care professionals that were not always supportive. Although parents describe mostly negative experiences, positive experiences such as the positive effect that a social transition has on the mental health of the child outweigh the negative experiences. These experiences suggest that parents of gender variant children may rely less on the traditional support networks that do provide support to other parents. A theme that recurs frequently is not knowing if parents are doing the right thing. This appears to be a genuine fear. Not only because there are no established guidelines or advice for raising a gender variant child, but also because detransition is becoming more prevalent. Follow-up studies should address the experiences of parents whose gender variant child detransitioned after a social transition at a young age. Furthermore, it seems that there is still a lot of ignorance within the health care system according gender variance and social transitions. Education on this topic is required.","['Gendervariantie', 'ouderschap', 'sociale transitie']"

Er is echter nog weinig onderzoek gedaan naar wat de rol van competentiebeleving is in de invloed van differentiatie op motivatie en welke rol prestatie hierbij speelt. In dit onderzoek wordt daarom onderzocht in welke mate differentiatie tijdens de rekenles samenhang heeft met competentiebeleving en dat leidt tot de volgende onderzoeksvraag: “Welke samenhang heeft de mate waarin de leerlingen (reken)differentiatie van de leerkracht ervaren met de mate van (reken)competentiebeleving van de leerlingen?” Om antwoord te kunnen geven op deze vraag is onderzoek gedaan naar 369 basisschoolleerlingen die een vragenlijst hebben ingevuld na afloop van de rekenles over hun ervaringen met de differentiatie door de leerkracht en over hun eigen rekencompetentiebeleving. Hierbij is gebruikgemaakt van het ADAPT-meetinstrument. Met de data zijn drie correlaties uitgevoerd om de samenhang te berekenen, omdat de term differentiatie is opgedeeld in drie deelvragen die een differentiatieprincipe dekken. Uit deze analyses bleek dat monitoring door de leerkracht tijdens de rekenles een niet-significante, zwakke samenhang had met de zelfcompetentiebeleving, evenals de samenhang tussen de moeilijkheidsgraad van de verwerking en de zelfcompetentiebeleving. Uit de correlatie tussen keuzevrijheid en autonomiebeleving bleek wederom een zwak verband, maar deze was wel significant. Deze drie differentiatieprincipes hebben dus een zwakke samenhang met competentiebeleving, maar gezien de beperkingen van het onderzoek kan niet gesteld worden dat er helemaal geen verband bestaat.",

Deze studie onderzocht mentaal welzijn tijdens en na de Covid-19 pandemie bij jongvolwassenen met en zonder een chronische aandoening, en de rol van psychologische flexibiliteit (PF) hierbij. De data werd verzameld via een online vragenlijst, afgenomen tijdens (2020-2021; n = 1203) en na de pandemie (2022; n = 826) bij jongvolwassen Nederlanders met en zonder een chronische aandoening. Mentaal welzijn werd gemeten met de SF-36 en PF met een verkorte FIT-60. Via een lineaire regressie is een model gemaakt om mentaal welzijn te verklaren uit de impact van de pandemie, PF en gezondheid status inclusief interacties, met controle op covariaten geslacht, leeftijd en opleidingsniveau (Adjusted R2 = .409, p < .001). De afwezigheid van de pandemie (β = .119, hoge PF (β = .504) en het hebben van een chronische aandoening (β = -2.16) waren allemaal (p < .001) geassocieerd met een hoger mentaal welzijn. Het interactie-effect van gezondheid status x psychologische flexibiliteit op mentaal welzijn was significant (β = .120, p < .001) maar pandemie x PF en pandemie x gezondheidsstatus niet (β = -.008, p = .805; β = -.041, p = .149). Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat mentaal welzijn van jongvolwassenen negatief samenhangt met het hebben van een chronische aandoening en dat PF hierbij een buffer kan zijn. Hoewel mentaal welzijn tijdens de pandemie bij iedereen lager was dan na de pandemie, was dit niet extra het geval bij chronisch zieke jongvolwassenen. Er is ook bewijs gevonden dat PF samenhangt met mentaal welzijn, met name bij chronisch zieke jongvolwassenen. Deze conclusies kunnen gebruikt worden voor het gericht verdelen van middelen in de GGZ en mentale gezondheidscampagnes.","['Covid-19 pandemie, psychologische flexibiliteit, mentaal welzijn, chronisch ziek.']"

Children from mothers who experienced abuse or neglect in their childhood show more problem behavior than children from mothers who do not have this experience (Myhre et al., 2014). This relation seems to be mediated by maternal depression (Miranda et al., 2013a; Pereira et al., 2018). In the current study the relation between maternal child abuse and neglect and internalizing- and externalizing problem behavior of the child, mediated by maternal depression, was researched in families who experienced domestic violence. Based on previous research it was expected that there would be a positive relation and a mediation effect. To answer the research questions questionnaires were used, which were administered to mothers living in a women’s shelter. The sample consisted of 15 women and their (youngest) child. The children were between 6 months and 6 years old. The results showed that the problem behavior of the child could not be predicted by maternal child abuse and neglect. Besides there was no mediation of maternal depression in this relation. The results did show however a positive relation between maternal child abuse and neglect and maternal depression. Possible explanations for not finding the expected relations are an intervention effect of the received help from the women’s shelter or a low statistical power due to the small sample. Replication with a larger sample size is needed. Although the hypothesis could not be confirmed, this research has shown that maternal child abuse and neglect and depression are related. This implicates that it is extra important to pay attention to depression symptoms in mothers who experienced child abuse or neglect and domestic violence.","['child abuse/neglect, domestic violence, depression, problem behavior']"

"Sorry, you are not my type: The effect of adult attachment style on initial attraction","Kaal, Myrthe",['I.Samara'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Attraction is a bodily feeling that most of us have likely felt before. This feeling is considered highly important when choosing a potential partner. Thus, plethora of studies have focused on uncovering the features that people generally find attractive, such as genuine smiles, coy smiles and provocative clothing. However, the role of personal characteristics that may also influence one’s level of attraction towards these features remains not well understood. In the present thesis, I examine one such characteristic, namely adult attachment style and its effect on attraction. Following the exclusion criteria, nineteen (N = 20; 9 men; 12 women; 7 securely attached; 4 avoidantly attached; 9 anxiously attached) participants were included in this study. Participants were presented with a series of videos of opposite-sex individuals dressed in either conservative or provocative clothing and exhibiting neutral expressions, genuine smiles and coy smiles. They filled in several questionnaires, including the Adult Attachment Questionnaire (AAQ). In line with the expectations, it was found that genuine smiles were rated as significantly more attractive, compared to neutral expressions. Contrary to my expectations, no significant effects were found of coy smiles, clothing or attachment style on initial attraction. Future research may benefit from replication of this thesis with optional improvements, such as a larger sample size, the adoption of Adult Attachment Interview methods (AAI), greater differences between provocative and conservative clothing conditions and a naturalistic setting.","['Attraction', 'attachment', 'avoidant attachment', 'anxious attachment', 'secure attachment', 'coy smile', 'clothing style']"

This longitudinal study hypothesized that physical exercise has a decreasing effect on the development of impulsivity. Multiple regressions were carried out cross-sectional as well as longitudinal to assess whether physical exercise had a significant positive effect on impulsivity within one time point and over time. Cross-sectional results showed that a higher cardiovascular condition is strongly related to lowered impulsivity.

Het doel van deze online survey (N = 201) was te onderzoeken of verstandig redeneren het verband tussen morele overtuiging en polarisatie medieert in twee actuele maatschappelijke onderwerpen: coronavaccinaties en klimaatverandering. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat een morele overtuiging en polarisatie positief samenhangen, maar de indirecte relatie via verstandig redeneren niet significant is. Verstandig redeneren hangt negatief samen met polarisatie. Dit onderzoek laat zien dat ook in gemoraliseerde kwesties, verstandig redeneren en polarisatie gerelateerd zijn.

"MOEDERS RESPONSIVITEIT VERZADIGING EN DE BMI VAN HET KIND: Stoppen met voeren wanneer je kindje niet meer wil eten: De relatie tussen de responsiviteit van de moeder naar de verzadigingssignalen van haar kind en de Body Mass Index van het kind,","Cornelissen, Teresa Adinda",['Marja Oudega'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In young children obesity prevalence has increased over the last few decates (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2017; Hurley, Cross, & Hughes, 2011). It is therefore important to understand the factors that influence food intake of young children to prevent obesity at a young age. In this research we have looked at one factor that might influence childs food intake: the responsive reaction to stop feeding when the child feels full (after the first few times of eating solid food, between 4 to 6 months old) and its relationship with the childs BMI (at the age of two). It is hypothesised that if the mother is less responsive towards the cues of satiety of the child, the childs own satiety recognition will develop poorly, leading the child to over-eat and therefore increasing the risk of a high BMI. We compare observed responsive reactions (Responsiveness to feeding cues scale, Hodges et al., 2013) with self-reported reactions (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire, Birch et al., 2001) to explain why researchers in earlier studies failed to find a clear relationship between responsive reactions and the BMI. Other factors that influence BMI, namely the temperament of the child and the education level of the mother, are taken into account. No relationships were found between the two types of measuring instruments of responsiveness, between the responsiveness and the BMI of the child and between the satiety recognition of the child and the BMI of the child, but there is a relationship between temperament of the child and the BMI of the child. Further research is necessary to understand how responsiveness relates to obesity in combination with other obesity risk factors and protective factors.","['responsivity to satiety cues, mother-child interaction, satiety recognition, BMI, obesity prevention']"

It was predicted that both social motives and power-differences influence the extent to which extra value is added to the negotiation (i.e. ‘expanding the pie’). In the “Sandwich Heaven” negotiation task (N = 192), participants negotiated according to the “Mandatory-Optional Issue Paradigm”. Participants had to agree on the five mandatory issues and had the option to include three additional issues. Dyads were randomly assigned to one of four conditions of the two (power: equal versus difference) x 2 (social motive: prosocial versus proself) design. The manipulations of power and social motive were operationalized through the instructions. Results showed that both social motive, and the combination of social motive and power, did not have a significant effect on the negotiated outcome. Prosocial oriented people were found to add more additional issues to the deal than proself oriented people.","['Social motive, Power, Integrative Negotiation, Expanding the Pie']"

GetStarted: an online intervention for procrastination in students: The exploration of stress as mediator between sex and procrastination,"Putten, Michelle van","['van Luenen, S']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Procrastination is a prominent issue in the student population. Procrastination seems to differ between men and women and had multiple causes, but is most often associated with stress. The current study had two aims; 1) examine the effect of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy based GetStarted programme as intervention for procrastination symptoms, 2) explore the possibility of stress symptoms as a mediator in the relation between sex and procrastination symptoms. For the first aim a pretest-posttest design was used, and for the mediation a cross-sectional study design was used. A total of 424 students (313 women, 111 men) from different universities in the Netherlands participated in the study. The measures in the current study consisted of the Irrational Procrastination Scale (IPS) and the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10). This study made use of paired sample t-tests in IBM SPSS and mediation analysis using the PROCESS macro. The results showed a significant decrease in procrastination symptoms between T0 and T1; t(207) = 9.40, p < .01 and between T1 and T2; t(97) = 4.65, p < .01. The mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect of stress symptoms on the relation between sex and procrastination symptoms (b = -0.58, boot SE = 0.25, CI [-1.08, -1.02]). The findings indicated that GetStarted is an effective intervention for decreasing procrastination symptoms in students. It was also shown that stress has a mediating effect on the relationship between sex and procrastination symptoms. When looking at the limitations of the study, future research is needed to make solid proclamations.","['Stress symptoms', 'procrastination', 'procrastination symptoms', 'mediation', 'GetStarted', 'CaringUniversities']"

This is an ethnography, studying the mundane, everyday life of Mayan parent in Guatemalan communities around Lake Atitlan. Guatemala is one of the few countries in the world, where indigenous people make up for half of the population. Although they are marginalized politically, socially, and culturally in the Guatemalan context, there is a strength in numbers. Vibrant indigenous communities pass on values, customs, and language onto the next generations. These communities became even more empowered because of a revival of Mayan consciousness after the signing of the peace accords after a 40 year civil war. This study attempts to create insight how Mayan communities parent and reproduce values and customs and over generations, but also how they meet the challenges of a globalizing world. The body of anthropological knowledge on parenting and the role of children in society is steadily growing. Even though it is important to learn from traditional rural communities, it is also very important to understand how people adapt to changing realities, while preserving indigeneity.","['Indigeneity, Parenting, Discrimination, Exclusion, Reproduction of cultural values']"

The structures are compared on task performance times, lostness, and user preference for the visually and mildly cognitive impaired web user. Twenty-four participants (fourteen with cognitive impairment (testing group) and ten without cognitive impairment (control group) participated in this study. The participants received eight search tasks in both a deep and slim audio web structure (four layers with four audio items per layer) and a broad and shallow audio web structure (two layers with sixteen audio items per layer). Due to outliers and a non-normal distribution, a Wilcoxon signed ranked test was used to test for statistical significance. We found a significant difference in task performance times, where participants performed best in the deep and slim structure. We also found higher within and between search task consistency in the deep and slim audio web structure. While the testing group showed significantly lower task performance times in the deep and slim web structure, this finding lacks power. No significant difference was found for lostness and user preference. This study shows initial support that a deep and slim web structure is the preferred option compared to a broad and shallow structure for the visually and mildly cognitive impaired web user.

The effect of power on expanding the pie by adding issues in negotiations.,"Langenberg, Maud",['Wolfgang Steinel'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Negotiation is often seen as a kind of competition where negotiators try to get the most profit for themselves. The alternative is integrative negotiating in which negotiators focus on creating the maximum outcome for both parties. This is known as ""expanding the pie"" which can be done by adding negotiating topics, referred to as issues, to the negotiation. Therefore, the research question of this study is: what influence does power have on expanding the pie by adding issues in negotiations and on the corresponding subjective value? This is investigated through a one-on-one role-playing negotiation game. In this game, the power position was manipulated by giving the participants different BATNAs. Included were mandatory topics but also optional topics to enable the negotiators to expand the pie. To understand the process, taking initiative for these optional issues had been manipulated. It was expected that there was a greater joint outcome in an unequal power situation (H1.a.) and that this was greatest if the less powerful negotiator was allowed to take initiative for the provided optional issues (H1.b.). Subjective value was expected to be greatest in the equal power situation (H2.a.) However, between the unequal power conditions, the joint subjective value will be higher in the condition where the less power can take the initiative for the optional items (H2.b). The results of this study found no evidence to support these expectations. Nevertheless, the research and the paradigm can be used for follow-up studies on the influences on integrative negotiation.","['expanding the pie, integrative negotiation']"
"Who decides what is ‘healthy’?

De Musso'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The basis of this thesis is the Leids Preventieakkoord, a health policy derived from the Nationaal Preventieakkoord and tailored to the local context of the city of Leiden. In this research I examine how the Leids Preventieakkoord on paper matches its implementation, emphasizing the difficulty of involving residents in the process but the attempts of the Regiegroep, i.e. the group of people responsible for the implementation of the health policy, to minimize the often occurring gap in a top-down approach. Furthermore, this research shows how the perspectives of the Regiegroep correspond and differ from the perspectives of residents of Leiden Noord on the topics of health, weight and food. While both parties try to broaden the definition of health in general in the sense of positive health, namely that one is healthy when being able to do whatever he or she finds important, their perspectives on the meaning of healthy 'weight' and 'food' remain rather narrow and are more in line with the medical approach, namely the absence of physical and mental diseases. In addition, the thesis differentiates residents' perspectives on healthy weight and food based on gender and ethnicity. The Leids Preventieakkoord is made only from a Dutch ethnic perspective, taking the body mass index tool and 'Schijf van Vijf' as the absolute truth of a healthy weight and eating pattern. Although many people argue that food connects people, this thesis show how the different perspectives and critiques on health and food reflect the polarisation today in Leiden Noord.","['Policy, Health, Weight, Food']"

Because the performance on verbal fluency tasks seems to correlate with musical training (Silvia et al., 2016; Fennell et al., 2020; Zuk et al., 2014), this researched focused on proving the hypothesis that people who have had musical education perform better on verbal fluency tasks. Verbal fluency was measured by the performance on a phonetic verbal fluency task that was delivered digitally. Musical skills were measured by the performance on the Swedish Musical Discrimination Task (SMDT) (Ullén et al., 2014). Participants who indicated on the Musical Coping and Responsivity Scale (Ridell Di Lorenzo & Schaeffer, 2021) that they had at least 6 years of continuous musical education and were currently practicing an instrument were considered having a history of musical education. 127 participants (N = 127) completed the research. Of these, 98 participants did not have a history of musical education and 29 did. Verbal fluency was found to correlate significantly with the scores on the SMDT and with the years of musical education. Furthermore, musical skills were a predictor of verbal fluency, but having a history of musical education was not. When corrected for musical skills, a history of musical education could not predict verbal fluency.","['Verbal Fluency', 'music', 'musical training', 'skills', 'verbal', 'language']"

However, this becomes dysfunctional when more attention is given to itch related stimuli compared to other stimuli, e.g. Attentional Bias (AB), which might be the case for chronic itch. Therefore, the current study aimed to identify the existence of an AB. It was expected that people with chronic itch would have an AB towards itch related visual stimuli and that a higher level of psychological distress could predict a higher level of AB. Finally, it was expected that a higher level of AB would be associated with a more severe impact on quality of life. A sample of five patients with chronic itch, as a result of atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, participated in the study. To test the presence of an AB towards itch related visual stimuli, a dot-probe test was performed. Furthermore, the level of psychological distress and quality of life were measured using the DASS-21 and the DLQI, respectively. A paired-samples t-test, multiple linear regression and Pearson correlation were used for data analysis. The results do not indicate the presence of an AB toward visual itch related stimuli in a population with chronic itch. Furthermore, psychological distress was not a significant predictor for the level of AB. Finally, no significant association was found between the level of AB and quality of life. Future research should examine different stadia of the attentional process towards itch related stimuli. This would help guide the development of interventions for patients with chronic itch.","['Attentional Bias', 'Pruritus', 'Chronic itch', 'Atopic dermatitis', 'Eczema', 'Psoriasis', 'Quality of life', 'Psychological distress']"
"Enrichment Process: Work social support, self efficacy and sleep quality","Posthuma, Veerle",['Juriena de Vries'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Many people work a full-time week from 32 to up to 40 hours.

Obtaining resources could lead to new resources (Hobfoll, 2022; Ten Brummelhuis & Bakker, 2012). Based on the enrichment process perspective, using the WHR model and the Spill-over theory, it was investigated whether there is a possible spill-over between the work and the home domains. This research specifically focused on a possible positive association between work social support and sleep quality with self-efficacy as a mediator. A group of 130 adult participants filled in 3 questionnaires once every week to collect data enabling studying this possible spill-over process. Multiple regression analyses and the SPSS-extension PROCESS were used to analyze the data. The results did not find an indirect effect of work social support on sleep quality with self-efficacy used as a mediator. This concludes that the expectancies of this research were not supported. Nevertheless, a small positive association has been found between work social support and self-efficacy and between self-efficacy and sleep quality, This is in line with the found literature and suggests a possible enrichment process after all. Possible limitations include the relatively short time between the questionnaires since self-efficacy and quality of sleep turned out to be pretty stable variables over the weeks. Other suggestions and limitations are discussed.","['Enrichment process, spill-over, WHR model, work social support, self-efficacy, sleep quality']"

A. de Kleine'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This cross-sectional study describes the validation and reliability testing of a newly developed questionnaire: the Trauma Reminder Exposure Expectancies (TREE). The TREE is a self-report measure with 30 items used to assess threat expectancies of exposure to trauma reminders in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) patients. According to the inhibitory learning theory, the violation of expected outcomes is crucial in Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy. The TREE gives the practitioner an instrument to tap into threat expectancies prior to, during and post PE. The data of a non-clinical sample (N = 152) of trauma-exposed individuals is used to get the first analysis of psychometric properties of the TREE. The TREE showed a strong internal consistency (30 items; =.95), moderate test-retest (r. = .82). The TREE showed strong convergent validity with instruments assessing PTSD symptoms and trauma-related cognitions (r. = .55; r. =.66) and moderate divergent validity (r. = -.428). Threat expectancies of confrontations with trauma-related stimuli have not been used in questionnaires before and these trauma-related cognitions may form an important construct. This study showed a unique explained variance by the TREE (R² = .07), in addition to trauma-related cognitions as assessed with the PTCI, in the explanation of PTSD symptom severity. This finding may serve a better investigation of the working mechanism of PE according to the inhibitory learning theory. Overall, these are promising results and a next step would be to perform this study in a clinical sample.","['PTSD, prolonged exposure, inhibitory learning theory, threat expectancies, questionnaire development, expectancy violation']"

After the revolutionary momentum had passed, women were excluded from the political domain, including the policymaking process. Based on the cases of Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, this thesis examines the structures that restrain women from participating in politics by looking at both formal and informal politics. Broadening the analytical field in the study of policymaking while adopting an anthropological approach, this thesis criticises modernisation theory by showing how development is not a linear process by considering the role of religion and patriarchalism. It explains why despite women striving for similar demands as men, one cannot adopt a gender-blindness approach to reflect upon women’s aspirations and demands in politics. Besides, it shows how women increasingly were able to problematise their aspirations and demands by participating in physical and digital activism. However, the exclusion of women from institutional decision-making processes and the patriarchalist model of social order prevent the institutionalisation of women’s aspirations and demands into policies.","['Policymaking', 'gender', 'Arab Spring', 'political participation', 'policy problematisation', 'model of social order']"

However, studies about the ideological difference in antisocial preferences against outgroups and the interactive effect of ideology and political extremism on anti-social preferences against outgroups are required for a better understanding of real-life violent political events. In a large experimental study (n = 769), I examined two hypotheses: (1) Rightists have higher anti-social preferences against outgroup members than leftists; (2) Levels of political extremity may moderate the relationship between ideology and anti-social preferences against outgroup members. Participants were asked to play the Joy of Destruction game with members of different ideology, same ideology, different nationality, and same nationality from them respectively. After the game, participants were asked about their political orientation and levels of political extremity. The results showed rightists have higher anti-social preferences against national outgroups than leftists; no significant difference in anti-social preferences against ideological outgroups was found between rightists and leftists. The level of political extremity was found not significant in moderating the relationship between ideology and anti-social behaviors against both ideological outgroups and national outgroups. These findings filled the gap for us to understand the ideological differences in anti-social preference against outgroups and they may stimulate future research.","['ideological difference', 'ideology', 'leftists', 'rightists', 'anti-social preferences', 'anti-social behaviors', 'political extremism']"

De wens van Vlietkinderen was informatie te krijgen over passende activiteiten die ook aansluiten bij hun kernwaarden ‘samen’, ‘echt’ en ‘avontuur’. Hieruit volgde een selectie van de vaardigheden ‘samenwerken’, ‘communiceren’, ‘creatief denken’ en ‘probleemoplossend vermogen’. De onderzoeksvraag luidde dan ook: “In hoeverre kan de BSO volgens pedagogisch medewerkers een bijdrage leveren aan de ontwikkeling van de vaardigheden ‘samenwerken’, ‘communiceren’, ‘creatief denken’ en ‘probleemoplossend vermogen van kinderen in de leeftijd van 4 tot en met 12 jaar?”. Om antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag zijn, naast een literatuuronderzoek, tien interviews afgenomen met pedagogisch medewerkers van de BSO Vlietkinderen. Hierin zijn de meningen van de PM’ers uitgevraagd over de mogelijke bijdrage die de BSO kan hebben in het stimuleren van de gekozen 21e-eeuwse vaardigheden. Hierbij is gevraagd naar de huidige situatie, verbeterpunten en de verschillen tussen leeftijdsgroepen met betrekking tot de activiteiten op de BSO. De resultaten van de interviews zijn getranscribeerd en vervolgens geanalyseerd met behulp van Atlas.ti (versie 22.1.0) en gekoppeld aan de gevonden literatuur. Volgens het literatuuronderzoek is het van belang dat de 21e-eeuwse vaardigheden gestimuleerd worden bij kinderen. Uit de interviews is gebleken dat de PM’ers zich over het algemeen niet bewust bezighouden met het stimuleren van de 21e-eeuwse vaardigheden, maar vooral activiteiten bedenken die leuk zijn voor de kinderen. Vrijheid binnen activiteiten, maar ook in het algemeen, vinden de pedagogisch medewerkers belangrijk. Daarnaast kwam naar voren dat 21e-eeuwse vaardigheden bewust en onbewust worden gestimuleerd. Al met al kan geconcludeerd worden dat de BSO een bijdrage kan leveren aan de ontwikkeling van de 21e-eeuwse vaardigheden en dat dit in zekere mate ook al gebeurt. Op basis van de resultaten van dit onderzoek zijn een aantal adviezen opgesteld voor de BSO Vlietkinderen. Ten eerste wordt geadviseerd om de activiteiten toneelspellen en bewegingsspellen op te nemen in het standaard activiteitenaanbod, aangezien deze activiteiten volgens het onderzoek een grote bijdrage kunnen leveren aan het aanleren van vaardigheden. Ten tweede wordt geadviseerd om werkgroepen op te richten waarin pedagogisch medewerkers van verschillende locaties kunnen samenwerken aan thema's en doelgerichte activiteiten. Tenslotte wordt geadviseerd om een studiedag te organiseren naar aanleiding van het nieuwe beleid. Op de studiedag kan de ontwikkeling van de 21e-eeuwse vaardigheden en het belang ervan verder toegelicht worden aan de pedagogisch medewerkers.",

Parents with a history of CEM are at increased risk of using negative parenting behaviors, such as parental criticism. Accordingly, it is known that parental criticism has a negative influence on adolescents’ daily affect. Yet, it is unknown whether there is an association between parental history of CEM, parental criticism and more adolescents’ positive and negative affect. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the associations between parental history of CEM and adolescents’ daily affect and the mediating role of parental criticism. Methods: This study is based on data from RE-PAIR (Relations and Emotions in Parent Adolescent Interaction Research). Adolescents (n = 80) and their parents (n = 153) filled in questionnaires on parenting behaviors and affect using ecological momentary assessments (EMA) for 14 days. Results: This study did not support the expectation of the association between parental history of CEM and adolescents’ daily affect and the mediating role of parental criticism. Discussion: The sample consisted of relatively healthy, well-functioning parents and adolescents who live in relatively favorable circumstances. Also, the assumptions of the multiple linear regression analysis were violated as such could have provided for loss of statistical power, which could have provided for an increase of the chance on Type I-error. In future studies, the effects of resilience factors in parents and adolescents could be researched in order to elucidate their buffering effects of intergenerational transmission of maltreatment and psychological problems.","['childhood emotional maltreatment, parental criticism, adolescent affect, daily life, ecological momentary assessments (EMA)']"
Sounds of Change: Music and its effects on children in Dutch refugee centres,"Fosse, Floortje de la","['Littlejohn, A.L.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Community music is a way of making music within a group of people, by letting everyone participate in the process in their unique way. Sounds of Change uses community music in order to establish social change in refugee centres. But how do they use social change in order to pursue social change and what social change are they seeking for? This study explores the effects of community music on children in Dutch refugee centres. After conducting semi-structured interviews and participant observation, I suggest that, in order to establish a sense of communal belonging, creativity and connection among the participants of the workshops, a safe space is required. Whenever children feel safe, they dare to share their ideas. A common language is not required for this; music can often speak for itself. Moreover, Sounds of Change equalizes all individuals and embraces cultural diversity, which is considered more common in grassroots and pragmatic practices than in national Dutch multicultural policies.","['community music', 'refugees', 'refugee centre', 'safe space', 'belonging', 'creativity', 'connection', 'diversity']"
Coping Through Music: The use of music for affect regulation and the preference for lyrics or melodies.,"Klok, Miryam","['Hall, J. M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Music listening is a popular and efficient strategy for coping with emotional distress. However, the extent to which people utilize music to regulate their emotions and whether they prefer to focus on the lyrics or melodies remains understudied. For this study, 136 respondents (mean age = 28.48, SD = 12.61) completed a test battery that included the “Emotional usage of music” subscale from the Musical Coping and Responsivity Scale (MCRS). Respondents expressed their agreement with the nine statements from the subscale (1 = Completely disagree; 7 = Completely agree), after which they indicated whether they tend to focus on lyrics or melodies using two sliders ranging from 0 – 100. The outcome of the subscale was used to predict a preference for lyrics or melodies and rhythms, using two linear regression analyses. The two analyses found no relationship between music listening to regulate affect and the focus on melodies and rhythms. However, there was a relationship between music listening for affect regulation and the focus on lyrics. This study set the groundwork for further research into reasons why music is used for affect regulation, as well as which components of music are most effective for this purpose. The findings of this study could be used to further improve the use of music in clinical settings.","['music listening, affect regulation, lyrics, instrumental music']"

Relatie tussen het subjectieve welzijn en individueel versus pro-sociaal leren. Presteer je beter als je je ook beter voelt?

Pro-sociaal gedrag en subjectief welbevinden, de manier waarop iemand hun leven beoordeelt, lijken uit literatuur elkaar wederzijds te beïnvloeden. Middels de pro-sociale leertaak van Lockwood et al. (2016) is er onderzocht of mensen beter voor zichzelf leren dan voor een ander. Daarnaast is er exploratief gekeken of mensen beter leren voor een vriend of een onbekende. Met deze leertaak en de SPANE vragenlijst die positief en negatief affect meet, is er onderzocht of er een positief verband bestaat tussen pro-sociaal leren en subjectief welbevinden. Uit onderzoek onder 52 mannen en 84 vrouwen (N=136) blijkt dat bij de conditie ‘voor jezelf’, respondenten een hoger correct percentage hadden dan bij de conditie ‘vriend’ en ‘ander’. Ook lag dit percentage bij ‘vriend’ significant hoger dan de conditie ‘ander’. Er is geen significante correlatie gevonden tussen de condities en de SPANE. Er kan geconcludeerd worden dat mensen significant beter voor zichzelf leren dan voor anderen en dat mensen ook significant beter voor een vriend leren dan voor een onbekende. Pro-sociaal gedrag naar vrienden neemt vanaf de adolescentie toe. Dit geeft meer bewijs om de hypothese aan te nemen en zijn er nieuwe bevinden over het pro-sociaal leren voor een vriend. Dat er in vorige studies wel een verband is gevonden, kan verklaard worden dat er met minder objectieve metingen is gewerkt. Er is meer onderzoek nodig op het gebied van subjectief welbevinden en pro-sociaal leren.","['pro-sociaal leren, SPANE, leergedrag, pro-sociale leertaak, subjectief welbevinden']"

Frontal midline theta power responses to social rejection feedback in avoidantly attached adults,"Yaakoub, Esma",['Elise Kortink'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Studies show that insecurely attached adults have difficulty forming healthy relationships. Evidence suggests that avoidantly attached adults might be more likely to disengage themselves from interpersonal relationships. This might make them less vulnerable to social rejection. In avoidantly attached adults, FM-theta reactivity to unexpected social rejection feedback might be blunted, due to their avoidant attitude. The relationship between FM-theta reactivity to unexpected social feedback and the avoidant attachment style has not been directly researched. The Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) questionnaire was administered, and the Social Evaluative Learning and Feedback (SELF)-Profile task was used to examine if FM-theta reactivity was blunted in people scoring high on attachment avoidance. 134 students (mean age: 20.455; SD: 2.025) were asked to indicate their expectancies of being liked/disliked by peers. Afterwards, the true feedback was revealed, leading to four social feedback conditions. Results revealed that FM-reactivity was highest in the unexpected social rejection feedback condition. There was no significant correlation between the height of FM-theta reactivity in the unexpected social feedback condition and the avoidant attachment score. A significant negative relationship was found between the height of FM-theta reactivity in the expected social feedback conditions and the avoidant attachment score, meaning FM-theta is blunted in individuals scoring high on attachment avoidance, in situations of expected social feedback. Future studies might benefit from including a report by the participant, after indicating their feedback expectations, containing their experience of this interaction to check what kind of attachment-related information avoidantly attached individuals might find (un)important.",['Frontal Midline Theta - Attachment - Avoidance - Social Feedback']

This research investigates to what extent ACEs of mothers in the Ne­ therlands relates to the warmth and involvement they show towards their children, and what the effect of parenting stress is on this relationship. It is examined whether there is a direct relationship between ACEs and the warmth and commitment that mothers show towards their children, and whether the possible influence of parenting stress on this relationship is of a medi­ ating or moderating nature. The Verwey­Jonker Institute is conducting a study into child abuse and domestic violence within families in the Netherlands. The respondents participating in this study were selected from applications under the heading domestic violence in four metropolitan regions of Veilig Thuis. The sample of this study consists of 600 mothers, of which 508 ulti­ mately met the inclusion criteria. This research has shown that there is no moderation effect, but a mediation effect is visible: ACEs have no direct influence on the warmth and involvement that mothers show towards their children, but they do experience more parenting stress, which can subsequently lead to less warmth and involvement. Knowing this could help in developing psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing ACEs.",
Positive and negative affect in daily life in adolescents with and without a depression,"Huiberts, Mexime",['Marie-Louise Kullberg'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Among adolescents in the Netherlands depression is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses. Positive and negative affect and how they fluctuate in daily life are important pillars in depression and in the onset of a depressive episode. Yet, little is known about these affect fluctuations in adolescents with depression. Method: In this ecological momentary assessment study, we examined the differences in adolescents with and without a depression in positive and negative affect. We compared daily reports on positive and negative affect that were gathered during a period of 14 consecutive days. Additionally, we explored if adolescents with a depression show more fluctuations in positive and negative affect and if the severity of the depressive symptoms is associated with a higher negative affect and a lower positive affect. Lastly, we examined if a higher severity of depressive symptoms correlates with more affect fluctuations. Results: Multilevel analysis showed that adolescents with a depression show a more negative affect compared to adolescents without a depression and that adolescents without a depression show a more positive affect in comparison to adolescents with a depression. Adolescents with a depression, also, show more fluctuation in both positive and negative affect. Furthermore, severity of adolescent’s depressive symptoms is associated with a more negative affect and a less positive affect. Lastly, it is also found that a higher severity of depressive symptoms is correlated with more fluctuations in negative and positive affect. Conclusion: This is the first study to compare daily affect and affect fluctuations between adolescents with and without a depression. It is important to focus on uplifting positive affect, decreasing negative affect and stabilizing adolescents’ mood in clinical practice when treating adolescents’ depression.","['Positive affect, negative affect, fluctuations, severity of depressive symptoms.']"

In totaal hebben 41 respondenten meegedaan aan het onderzoek. De data-analyse liet geen significante resultaten zien. Dit gaf aan dat er in de huidige studie geen verschil is gevonden tussen mannen en vrouwen. Deze uitkomst zou kunnen komen door de kleine steekproefgrootte en de ongelijke man/vrouw verdeling van dit onderzoek. Om deze redenen wordt vervolgonderzoek aanbevolen waarbij de steekproef groter en de man/vrouw verdeling is gelijker is. Engels The number of cancer patients in the Netherlands has increased every year. Also, the life expectancy of the patients increases, which means that the informal caregivers have a longer care period. This study looked at the communication between oncologist and patient, and specifically how the informal caregiver experiences this communication. The current study was designed to investigate whether women perceive communication with lack of empathy as more harmful than men. This was investigated using a questionnaire, where respondents could assess examples of communication as harmful or not harmful. A total of 41 respondents took part in this study. The data showed no significant results. This indicated that no difference was found in the current study between men and women. This outcome could be due to the small sample size and the unequal male/female distribution in this study.

Per test the participants were shown 3 neutral and 3 stressful stimuli in the form of a picture and were asked to bend forward 5 times per picture presentation. The range of motion of the low back, pelvis and the trunk and the level of arousal via skin conductance were measured. Results show no significant findings but that can be explained with the small participant group. Several findings were a higher level of arousal when presented with a stress stimulus compared to a neutral stimulus. Furthermore, the range of motion of the low back, trunk and pelvis are bigger in the neutral condition compared to the stress condition. The HADS score seems to have no relationship with the level of arousal. All these findings are based on a small group of participants, are possibly due to incidental finding and could be different with a bigger group of participants.","['Range of motion, trunk, pelvis, muscle tension, psychological stress']"

Per leerkracht is één of twee keer geobserveerd door twee observanten. Er is gekeken naar het soort feedback, de doelgerichtheid, de aard van feedback en de doelgroep. Vervolgens zijn de resultaten vergeleken met wat in de literatuur als effectieve feedback wordt beschouwd. Aan de hand daarvan is een advies samengesteld. Gevonden werd dat zelfregulatiegerichte feedback het meest gegeven wordt. Deze feedback wordt voornamelijk niet-doelgericht gegeven en is het meest bevestigend van aard. Bovendien wordt vooral feedback aan individuen gegeven. Geadviseerd wordt om naast zelfregulatiegerichte feedback net zo vaak taakgerichte- en aanpakgerichte feedback te geven. Deze feedback moet doelgericht worden gegeven en is voornamelijk effectief als het in een combinatie van bevestigende-, kritische- en constructieve feedback wordt gegeven. Het geven van individuele feedback is effectief en wordt goed gedaan op basisschool X. Een beperking van dit onderzoek is de onherleidbaarheid naar leerkrachten toe.

Inzet van didactische principes in het technisch leesonderwijs,"Overes, Boris","['Van den Bosch, L.J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek gaat in op het technisch leesonderwijs in de groepen 3 t/m 8. Het onderzoek beschrijft tien didactische principes, waarvan er zeven effectief zijn, twee waarover geen eenduidig beeld van effectiviteit is en één die niet effectief is. Het onderzoek bekijkt in hoeverre leerkrachten van de midden- en bovenbouw de uit de literatuur effectief gebleken didactische principes toepassen. Hierdoor kunnen leerkrachten meer evidence-informed werken. De tien principes zijn door een zelfontwikkelde vragenlijst uitgevraagd op drie basisscholen. Negentien leerkrachten hebben de vragenlijst ingevuld. In de vragenlijst zaten gesloten vragen waarin leerkrachten hebben aangegeven hoe vaak zij een principe gebruiken. Deze gesloten vragen werden ondersteund door open vragen, waarin leerkrachten hun antwoord konden toelichten. Het onderzoek is daarom een combinatie van kwantitatief en kwalitatief onderzoek, een mixed-method design. Uit de resultaten bleek dat koorlezen het meest door leerkrachten toegepast wordt. Daarna volgen op korte afstand luisterend lezen, herhaald lezen, EDI en individueel begeleid hardop lezen. Listening Passage Preview en tutorlezen worden door leerkrachten in mindere mate toegepast. Deze principes zijn wel effectief gebleken dus het vaker toepassen zou een positief effect op het technisch leesniveau op de leerlingen moeten hebben. Flitsen, wisselrijen en niveaulezen worden ook door leerkrachten toegepast. Hierover is alleen geen eenduidigheid in de literatuur of zelfs een negatief effect gevonden. Deze principes zouden voor het bevorderen van het technisch leesniveau minder vaak toegepast moeten worden.

Effectief feedback geven zou een potentiële strategie kunnen zijn om het rekenonderwijs te versterken. Voor dit onderzoek is de literatuur over effectieve feedback bestudeerd. Bovendien is door middel van gestructureerde observaties in kaart gebracht hoe zeven leerkrachten van de groepen 3 tot en met 6 van basisschool X feedback geven tijdens de rekenlessen. Er is gebruik gemaakt van een aangepaste versie van het meetinstrument ‘feedbackgedrag leerkrachten’, waarbij een verdeling gemaakt wordt tussen de vorm van feedback, doelgerichtheid, aard van feedback en doelgroep. De resultaten laten zien dat de vorm ‘feedback op zelfregulatie’ het meest gegeven wordt. Aanpakgerichte feedback en persoonsgerichte feedback worden het minst gegeven. Bovendien geven de leerkrachten vooral feedback die niet doelgericht is. Bij de resultaten over de aard van de feedback valt het op dat de meeste feedbackmomenten bevestigend waren. Feedback die zowel bevestigend, constructief als kritisch was, kwam weinig voor. Tot slot had de meeste feedback de individuele leerling als doelgroep. Om de inzet van feedback te optimaliseren zouden de leerkrachten meer feedback op aanpak en taak kunnen geven en de hoeveelheid persoonsgerichte feedback nog verder kunnen minimaliseren. Verder zou feedback effectief zijn als deze doelgericht is en bevestigend-constructief-kritisch van aard is. Wat betreft de doelgroep van de feedback zijn geen aanpassingen nodig.",

In May 2020, the United States was the first space-faring state to officialise a set of bilateral agreements, the Artemis Accords, aimed a legally and politically support the extraction, utilisation and commercialisation of lunar resources, as well as the permanent settlement of a lunar outpost. The American space agenda marked the opening of interesting times for the politics of space exploration, as all major space powers have either embraced or criticised the American approach. As such, this thesis attempts to fill the gap in the literature on the geopolitical implications of space exploration. In order to do so, a descriptive process-tracing of the single case study of the Artemis Accords is carried out, while investigating its geopolitical link with the international space agenda of four major space powers: the US, China, Russia and Europe. While relying on both primary and secondary data, the analysis allows to conclude the inherent geopolitical value of states’ practice in outer space, as well as the underlying political, economic and diplomatic factors that are at the heart of international politics. Outer space is increasingly bounded by geopolitical value, to a level seeing only during the 1960s space race, and while the future of international politics is yet to be determined, one thing is certain: it will pass by the Moon.","['Space Exploration', 'Astropolitics', 'Artemis Accords', 'International Cooperation']"

The current study aimed to test the two continua model of mental health by investigating the relation of the domains of functional disability and social support with positive mental health and psychopathology and aimed to examine the influence of psychopathology on positive mental health. Methods. In 1008 adults aged 18-81 who consulted their GP with mental health related complaints, psychological well-being, distress, domains of functional disability, social support, and common mental disorders were measured by a self-report screening instrument. Results. Examining differential predictors of positive mental health resp. distress using multiple regression analyses while controlling for distress resp. positive mental health showed that social support, cognition, and getting along predicted psychological well-being, and social participation, cognition, and getting along predicted distress with cognition being a stronger predictor for distress and getting along a stronger predictor for psychological well-being. Examining differences in psychological well-being between groups (control, anxiety disorders, depression, personality disorder, and comorbid disorder group) with analysis of variance showed that all disorder groups scored significantly lower on psychological well-being than the control group. When controlled for distress none of the disorder groups significantly differed from the control group. Conclusion. The findings partly support the two continua model of mental health, since domains of functional disability and social support were differentially associated to psychological well-being and distress. However, although all psychiatric disorders considerably influenced positive mental health, distress seemed to fully account for this influence of psychiatric disorders.","['Two continua model of mental health', 'positive mental health', 'well-being', 'psychopathology', 'disorder related distress', 'common mental disorders', 'domains of functional disability', 'social support.']"

Much research has been done on this topic, however, findings on the actual learning effect are questionable and multiple study factors seem to be influential. This study examined the effect of focus of attention on motor performance (day 1) and motor learning (day 2). Also, assessed was the role of task difficulty. 29 Participants performed the computerized version of the ‘Rotor Pursuit Task’ in E-Prime. Internal and external focus of attention was ensured by directive focus instructions and task difficulty by two various manipulations. It was hypothesized that an external focus of attention will have a beneficial effect on motor performance and motor learning. Also, it was expected that focus of attention and task difficulty will have an interaction effect. We used an experimental design. Performance scores were calculated via absolute distances in pixels between the cursor and target. Focus of attention corresponding to the focus group was calculated via a manually focus check. It was found that there was no significant effect of focus of attention on motor performance on day 1 and day 2. There was also no interaction effect between focus of attention and task difficulty. Though, focus check pointed out wrong data. This means that our data might not display effects of focus of attention on motor performance and motor learning which makes results difficult to interpret.

Leerlingen vinden het vaak een moeilijk of vervelend vak. Het is belangrijk de motivatie voor rekenen bij leerlingen te stimuleren. De afname in motivatie lijkt samen te gaan met het ouder worden van de leerlingen en de komst van de puberteit. Daarnaast spelen de basisbehoeften relatie, competentie en autonomie een rol in de intrinsieke motivatie. In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar de samenhang tussen ervaren autonomie, leeftijd en sekse met de intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen uit de bovenbouw van het basisonderwijs op twee Leidse basisscholen (N = 41). De leerlingen hebben een digitale vragenlijst ingevuld die bestond uit 22 stellingen over de rekenles. De vragenlijst was een aangepaste versie van de Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). De resultaten van het onderzoek lieten zien dat leerlingen die meer autonomie ervaren, meer intrinsieke motivatie hebben voor het vak rekenen. Daarnaast kwam uit het onderzoek naar voren dat er geen significante samenhang is tussen leeftijd en intrinsieke motivatie. Ook voor sekse en intrinsieke motivatie is er geen samenhang gevonden. Naar aanleiding van de onderzoeksresultaten is onderzocht wat de twee Leidse basisscholen konden doen om de intrinsieke motivatie van bovenbouwleerlingen te verhogen.

The PANAS-X fatigue questionnaire was used to determine the MF levels before and after participants played the videogame. Subjective MF was expected to be significantly lower in the nature group. The results were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA. Participants in the natural condition and the urban condition both reported lower MF mean differences. The difference did not appear to be due to the condition in which they were assigned. In both conditions, the reported MF mean levels were significantly lower after playing the videogame.","['Mental fatigue', 'videogame', 'environment', 'nature', 'urbanization']"

Cross-validation (CV) is a very useful statistical procedure that can generate predictive outcome measures. This study will compare the use and results of CV with the results of traditional NHST analyses using two case studies, one explanatory theory-driven - comparing means - question and one predictive data-driven - forwards stepwise logistic regression - question. In the case of explanatory questions, CV is able to generate similar conclusions and the outcome measure is more intuitive to interpret. Regarding the predictive data-driven question, the final models from the CV procedure have slightly lower out-of-sample prediction errors than the final model based on the traditional NHST procedure.

Wonder in academically gifted and non-gifted children: The mediating role of Openness to Experience,"Hubregtse, Renske","['Broekhof, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The presence of wonder affects how children see the world around them and their openness to experiences. Besides, intellectual capacities greatly impact children’s thoughts and perceptions. Therefore, IQ and wonder could be closely related. The first research aim was to investigate differences between academically gifted and non-gifted children on IQ, wonder and Openness to Experience. The second research aim was to examine the interrelations between IQ, wonder and Openness to Experience, and specifically to study the mediating role of Openness to Experience on the relation between IQ and wonder. Children between 9 and 13 years old (N = 116) participated in this study. Because of missing data not all children were included in all analyses. 50 of these children attended gifted and 66 attended mainstream education. The presence of wonder and Openness to Experience were measured by means of self-report questionnaires. IQ was tested using a subtest of a larger IQ measuring instrument. Academically gifted and non-gifted children did not differ in their scores on IQ, wonder and Openness to Experience. A mediation analysis showed that although IQ and wonder were not found to be directly related, the relation between IQ and wonder can be mediated by Openness to Experience. In further research on the relation between IQ and wonder, the role of Openness to Experience has to be taken into account. Including more extensive ways of testing IQ can also help further research connect different types of intelligence to wonder and therefore gain a better understanding of the relation between IQ and wonder.","['Wonder, IQ, Openness to Experience, giftedness']"

De relatie tussen obsessief-compulsieve symptomen en pro-sociaal leren: Het verschil tussen leren voor jezelf en leren voor een ander,"Wulterkens, Lisa",['Ellen de Bruijn'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar het verschil in pro-sociaal gedrag, gedrag ten gunste van anderen, onder drie condities. Participanten konden een beloning winnen door te leren voor zichzelf, een vriend en een onbekende. Dit werd getest met een online variant op Lockwood’s (2016) sociale leertaak. Pro-sociaal leren is hierbij gebruikt als maatstaf voor pro-sociaal gedrag. De verwachting was dat participanten beter zouden leren voor zichzelf dan voor een ander. Ook is de relatie tussen OCD-symptomen en pro-sociaal leren onderzocht. Voorgaande onderzoeken laten een tegenstrijdig beeld zien en tonen zowel positieve als negatieve relaties aan. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om meer inzicht te krijgen in deze relatie. OCD-symptomen zijn gemeten door middel van de Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) vragenlijst. De verwachting was dat er een positieve dan wel negatieve relatie zou zijn tussen OCD-symptomen en pro-sociaal leren. De steekproef is getrokken uit de niet-klinische populatie (N = 136; 84 vrouwen/ 52 mannen). De resultaten lieten zien dat participanten beter leerden voor zichzelf dan voor een vriend en ook beter leerden voor een vriend dan voor een onbekende. Er is geen relatie gevonden tussen OCD-symptomen en pro-sociaal leren. Een mogelijke verklaring hiervoor is de meer objectieve methode van dit onderzoek vergeleken met de methodes van voorgaande onderzoeken. Sociale wenselijkheid kan bij voorgaande studies mogelijk een vertekend beeld hebben gegeven van de werkelijke relatie. Omdat er een links scheve verdeling op de totaalscore van de OCI-R was, moet er echter voorzichtig met de conclusies van dit onderzoek worden omgegaan.","['OCD', 'pro-sociaal leren', 'reward prediction errors']"

This study examined the effect of being distracted while eating lunch on the subsequent snacking behaviour of participants. Previous research has focused mainly on external factors, examining the effects of distractions in the environment on the consumption of food. However, examining the influence of personality factors on the relationship between distracted eating and subsequent consumption could help identify those who are most sensitive to the effects of distraction. Therefore, this study included the personality factor trait self-control and investigated whether this factor had a moderating effect on the relationship between distracted eating and the subsequent consumption of food. Using an online questionnaire, participants (n = 107) were asked to either play a game, watch a video or do nothing else while consuming their lunch. Afterwards they were asked to report their intake of snacks in between lunch and dinner, as well as answer questions regarding trait self-control. An ANCOVA was performed, which revealed no significant effects of distracted eating and trait self-control on subsequent snacking behaviour. Additionally, no significant moderating effect of trait self-control was found. An exploratory ANCOVA showed significant effects of distracted eating and trait self-control on the desire for further gratification. Implications, limitations and potential directions for future research are discussed.","['distracted eating, trait self-control, distraction, food intake, snacking behaviour']"
Replication studies in Psychology: Clarifying the definition,"van den Bos, Danique","[""Anna van 't Veer""]",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent years, the field of social science has been in disarray because of the so-called replication crisis. In order to contribute to the improvement of the use of replication studies within psychology, this study aimed to find out what exactly the concept of replication means. For this purpose, we conducted a literature review in which we analysed 157 research articles, looking for definitions of replication. This resulted in 36 definitions, of which only 17 were actual definitions of replication. Among these definitions, ambiguity could be seen in terminology and types of replication, and were different elements present or different wording was used each time. By qualitatively examining the ingredients of these definitions, we selected one definition that was considered the most 'global' and one with the 'most ingredients’. We examined how often these definitions were quoted over the years and how many of these quotations actually used the word 'replication'. Together, the current study shows that there are many different definitions used within psychology and that more consensus could be reached for the ultimate goal of making it easier to understand and conduct replication studies, thus making it more attractive and therewith improving the reliability of the scientific field of psychology.","['replication, definition, psychological research']"

Difficult temperament has been hyphotesized to be important for the personality and social-emotional development of the individual. It is known that a mother’s mental health plays an important role in the development of temperament of the child, but less is known about whether this also apply to the young mother. Method: The sample consisted of 240 mother-child. Data were collected 6 months after delivery using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Dutch version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (ZBV) and the Dutch version of the Maternal Self-Efficacy in the Nurturing Role Questionnaire (SENR). Negative affect and effortful control was measured using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire – Revised (IBQ-R). Results: According to the results, there is a significantly positive relationship between postnatal depression and anxiety and negative affect. Higher postnatal depression or postnatal anxiety measured was associated with higher levels of negative affect. In other results there was found to be a significant positive relationship between parenting self-efficacy and effortful control of the child. Higher levels of self-efficacy was related with higher levels of effortful control. These results suggest that postnatal mental health of the mother plays an important role in the development of temperament at 6 months.","['Temperament, negative affect, effortful control, postnatal depression, postnatal anxiety, self-efficacy']"

(Presence of) Guerrilla Women and State-Rebel Peace Negotiations: Evidence from the Salvadoran Civil War (1979-1992),"Fakher Elabiari, Hafssa",['Juan Masullo Jiménez'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The literature on women in state-rebel peace negotiations has profusely tackled women’s roles in peace processes. It has also overwhelmingly focused on women's formal or informal involvement at the negotiation table. However, it has underexplored the impact of guerrilla women on negotiations. More strikingly, very few studies have explored the link between women’s presence in the ranks of a rebel group and negotiations between the state and that rebel group. To address this gap, process tracing is used in the Salvadoran civil war (1979-1992) to answer the following question: how does the presence of women in a rebel group impact peace negotiations between the state and that rebel group? I argue that the presence of women in a rebel group makes the state willing to initiate negotiations. In fact, a rebel group that recruits women establishes a bond with the local population and enhances its reputation among external audiences that value gender equality. This, in turn, strengthens the rebel group’s position vis-à-vis the state, especially if the latter is indiscriminately violent towards civilians. The empirical findings match the theoretical expectations. This study has notable implications for scholarship and policy because it adds to the literature on intra-state negotiations and highlights the importance of considering the challenges of guerrilla women when framing the peace process.","['Peace negotiations, bond, local population, external audiences, reputation']"

Half the participants started with passive learning; the other half started with making predictions. After a distractor task, in the form of a self-evaluation questionnaire on executive function, curiosity, and critical thinking skills, participants were tested on how many number facts they remembered correctly. There was an overall significant result of learning strategy, with participants scoring higher when learning from making predictions. Also, a significant interaction result was found for order of training and learning strategy, pointing to a possible carry-over effect for the participants starting the training with generating predictions. The covariates of critical thinking and executive function showed no significant interaction with the learning strategies. These results possibly point to the potential benefit learning from making predictions when learning number facts could have for all students, regardless of individual characteristics.","['generating predictions', 'learning strategy', 'primary school', 'passive learning', 'active learning', 'generative learning strategy', 'executive function', 'critical thinking', 'carry-over effect']"

Tevens is er een pilotstudie gedaan met dit instrument. Voor dit onderzoek zijn verschillende doelen opgesteld. Ten eerste: ‘Uiteenzetten wat de huidige wetenschappelijke inzichten zijn over het bevorderen van een growth mindset en welke factoren daarbij een rol spelen’. Ten tweede: ‘Het ontwikkelen van een meetinstrument dat op eenvoudige wijze het effect van de Klusklas op zelfeffectiviteit en houding ten opzichte van techniek kan meten en een pilotstudie uitvoeren met dit meetinstrument’. Tot slot: ‘Technolab op basis van de uitkomsten van de literatuurstudie en de pilotstudie adviseren over de wijze waarop workshops en projecten kunnen bijdragen aan het bevorderen van een growth mindset’. Iemand met een growth mindset gelooft dat je intelligentie en vaardigheden verder kan ontwikkelen door je hiervoor in te zetten. De ontwikkeling van mindsets wordt beïnvloed door verschillende factoren uit de omgeving. Al op vroege leeftijd kan de basis voor een growth mindset gelegd worden. Growth mindset kan voorspellend zijn voor succes in de academische en professionele loopbaan. De effecten van growth mindset zijn onder andere zichtbaar in leerdoelen en prestaties, motivatie, reactiepatronen en zelfeffectiviteit. Growth mindset kan bevorderd worden binnen alle leeftijdscategorieën via de onderwijsomgeving en de leerkrachten, mits die zelf ook beschikken over een growth mindset. Er kan gebruik worden gemaakt van zelfregulerend leren om de denkpatronen tijdens het leren om te vormen, wat ondersteund kan worden met procesgerichte feedback (feed-forward feedback methode). Het is daarbij belangrijk dat growth mindset in de omgeving van de leerling wordt geaccepteerd en bevorderd, omdat de omgeving een bepalende factor is in de duurzaamheid van interventie-effecten. Het meetinstrument is opgesteld aan de hand van twee reeds samengestelde vragenlijsten. Het instrument meet de ‘zelfeffectiviteit’ en ‘houding ten opzichte van techniek’, omdat deze concepten een positieve relatie hebben met growth mindset. Uit de resultaten van de pilotstudie is gebleken dat het instrument betrouwbaar is en gebruikt kan worden voor het meten van een effect over tijd, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van herhaalde metingen. Daarnaast kunnen geslachtsverschillen gemeten worden met de vragenlijst. Op basis van de uitkomsten van de literatuurstudie en de pilotstudie is een advies voor Technolab opgesteld. Voor de verbetering van het meetinstrument wordt geadviseerd om vervolgonderzoek te doen met een grotere steekproef en de vragenlijst verder te ontwikkelen. Daarnaast wordt geadviseerd om zelfregulerende vaardigheden in combinatie met de feed-forward feedback methode te implementeren in de workshops. Deze twee methoden kunnen een growth mindset bevorderen.","['Growth Mindset', 'Techniek', 'Workshop']"
The relation between familial substance abuse and adolescent substance use,"Andriessen, Robin","['Sieh, D.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Familial substance abuse is a known risk factor for substance abuse problems later in life. In this study (n = 14,729), the first aim was to further investigate how familial substance abuse is related to substance use in adolescents. The second aim was to see whether the quality of parent- child relationship mediates this effect. The study has a cross-sectional design. Data were derived from a standard health monitor by Gemeenschappelijke Gezondheidsdiensten (GGD) North and East Gelderland, a regional Dutch public health service. Nearly 15,000 Dutch 2nd and 4th grade high school students filled in an online self-report questionnaire about their substance use and life events. Results of 14,729 students were analyzed using an independent sample t-test and regression analyses. The target group consisted of 609 students (46.8% female), while 12,904 students (51.5% female) fit the criteria of the control group (healthy family members). Results showed familial substance use is related to more adolescent substance use. This emphasizes the need for a better inclusion of family functioning in substance abuse interventions. As for the mediator, quality of the parent-child relationship alone only explained an almost insignificantly small portion of this effect. The study highlights the need for further research into other environmental factors, such as peer influences and education.",
Guardianship en het Ontmoedigen van Criminaliteit: Actieve en Passieve Guardianship en de Invloed hiervan op het Gedrag van de Potentiële Dader,"Lende, Iduna van der","['Bommel, M. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Volgens de Routine Activiteiten Theorie (RAT) van Cohen en Felson fungeert de omstander als een cruciale actor in de misdaadpreventie door de interactie tussen een gemotiveerde dader en een geschikt doelwit te verstoren. De achterliggende gedachte hierbij is dat een dader wordt ontmoedigd door de aanwezigheid en het daaropvolgende gedrag van omstanders. Terwijl het onderzoek naar guardianship groeit, blijft er een relatieve schaarste aan experimenteel werk in dit domein. Deze studie presenteert een methode om het effect van omstanders op het gedrag van gemotiveerde daders te testen. Deelnemers kregen de opdracht om een fietskrat te stelen, waarbij de aanwezigheid en intensiteit van omstanders varieerde. Allereerst werd er verwacht dat de aanwezigheid van omstanders ervoor zou zorgen dat de participant langer over de diefstal zou doen. Verder hadden we verwacht dat wanneer de intensiteit van guardianship toenam, dat de tijd van de diefstal ook zou toenemen. De resultaten van het experiment toonden aan dat verschillende intensiteiten van guardianship het gedrag van de participanten beïnvloedden; wanneer er omstanders aanwezig waren, deden de participanten zoals verwacht langer over de diefstal in vergelijking met wanneer er geen omstanders aanwezig waren. Verder bleek in tegenstelling tot onze verwachting dat de aanwezigheid van actieve omstanders in vergelijking met passieve omstanders er juist voor zorgde dat de participanten sneller in de diefstal waren. Tot slot hadden we verwacht dat daders meer angst zouden ervaren wanneer er omstanders aanwezig zijn. Er werden echter geen significante resultaten gevonden voor het niveau van angst. Onze bevindingen sluiten aan bij de oorspronkelijke opvatting van omstanders door Cohen en Felson, omdat de routineactiviteit van de participanten verschilden in de verschillende condities. Aan het eind zullen we de implicaties van dit onderzoek bespreken.","['Routine Activiteiten Theorie', 'guardians', 'guardianship', 'angst', 'experimenteel onderzoek']"

Vanuit de Zelf-Determinatie theorie is er in dit onderzoek gekeken of autonomer of gecontroleerder gemotiveerde kinderen uit de bovenbouw daadwerkelijk andere activiteiten leuker en minder leuk vinden. Er is ook gegeken naar welke van de 3 basisbehoeften (autonomie, relatie en competentie) de voorkeur uitging. Met een vragenlijst zijn 178 leerlingen ingedeeld in twee groepen op soort motivatie en er zijn voorkeuren voor leesactiviteiten bevraagd. Uit deze voorkeuren is een top 3 leukste en minst leuke activiteiten gekomen voor de 2 groepen. Autonomie leek bij zowel de autonomer als de gecontroleerder gemotiveerde kinderen de beste voorspeller voor leesmotivatie. Leerlingen hebben dus vooral behoefte aan het zelf kiezen wat, waar en wanneer gelezen wordt als het gaat om motivatie. Er is meer vervolgonderzoek nodig om te zien of activiteiten rondom autonomie ook écht effectief de autonome leesmotivatie verhogen en welke activiteiten hierin het beste werken.",['Leesmotivatie']

Which can damage the child's mental health. In this study, we looked at the influence of mothers' maltreatment experiences on anxiety symptoms of the child, examining neglectful and overprotective parenting behaviors as possible explanatory variables. With this knowledge we can better support and guide mothers with the anxiety symptoms of their child. Also, this knowledge can be used for the prevention of anxiety symptoms. The participants for this study consisted of 63 healthy adolescents and 34 diagnosed depressed adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 and their mothers. Single and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. The analysis showed that more maltreatment experiences were associated with more anxiety symptoms in their children. Hereby, only the neglectful parenting behavior mediates the mentioned relationship. In short, the overprotective parenting behavior was not found as a mediator. The study found that mothers with abuse experiences may tend toward neglectful parenting behaviors, which may predispose the child to anxiety symptoms. This study indicates the importance of parenting support for traumatized mothers. For follow-up research, it is recommended to look at what role father plays in parenting, the underlying biological mechanisms, and what role exactly overprotection plays in the mental health of the child. Important assumptions were violated in the current study, so the results should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, it is also recommended that the study be conducted again with a larger sample and good representation of parenting behaviors. Also, an appropriate statistical analysis should be conducted that takes into account the development of overprotection.",['Nederlands']

Soft Power in a Pandemic World: a Story of Contagious Appeal: How did countries' Covid-19 response affect their attractiveness abroad?,"Sluis, Nastja van der",['Dr. I. Bakalov'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The Covid-19 pandemic has altered how countries project and gain soft power. Within the context of this global crisis, most researchers followed the conventional trend to investigate soft power as a resource (i.e., health diplomacy). Yet, scant studies have approached soft power as an outcome. The present thesis fills this gap by examining how countries’ (i.e., United States’ and New Zealand’s) Covid-19 response affected their attractiveness abroad (i.e., in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands). In order to address this inquiry, the theoretical lenses of rational and social attraction are amplified with socio-psychological literature on the Similarity-Attraction Theory. The theories are tested by means of minimalist process-tracing, combined with a cross-case analysis. The findings support the proposition that (in)competencies (demonstrated through the Covid-19 response) sparked rational attraction (or aversion) among foreign audiences. While support indicating the presence of social attraction (or aversion) is detected, it warrants a more cautious interpretation due to case-specific alternative explanations. The findings challenge the assumption that “likeness goes with liking”, by underscoring how dissimilarities tied to success appeared to elicit attraction. Further research should investigate whether this effect is still present when the scope condition is not met.","['Soft Power', 'Covid-19', 'rational and social attraction', 'Similarity-Attraction Theory']"

Stress bij Nederlandse en internationale studenten in Leiden: Is eenzaamheid een mediator in deze relatie?,"Velzen, Romée van","['Luenen, S. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek werd het verschil in stress onderzocht tussen Nederlandse en internationale studenten van de Universiteit Leiden en of eenzaamheid een mediator is in de relatie tussen nationaliteit en stress. Veel stress onder studenten kan leiden tot slechte studieprestaties en het verhoogt de kans op mentale stoornissen. De inter(nationaliteit) van studenten stond centraal in dit onderzoek, omdat uit voorgaand onderzoek bleek dat internationale studenten vaak met meer stressoren te maken hebben dan nationale studenten. Tevens zijn internationale studenten verder van huis, waardoor de kans op eenzaamheid groter is. Dit vormt een probleem, omdat meer eenzaamheid kan leiden tot meer stress en hierdoor de kans op negatieve gevolgen van stress worden vergroot. Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd met behulp van online vragenlijsten waaronder de Perceived Stress Scale-10 die het stressniveau mat en twee items die eenzaamheid maten. De hypotheses zijn getest middels een mediatieanalyse. Er bleek dat internationale studenten significant meer stress ervaarden dan Nederlandse studenten, maar beide groepen lieten gemiddeld middelmatige stress zien. Internationale studenten hadden ook significant meer gevoelens van eenzaamheid en eenzaamheid bleek een mediator in de relatie tussen nationaliteit en stress. Internationale studenten hebben hierdoor meer kans op de negatieve gevolgen van stress. Het is belangrijk dat de Universiteit Leiden interventies ontwikkelt om stress en eenzaamheid van inter(nationale) studenten te verminderen om zo de negatieve gevolgen ervan te beperken. Tot slot is het verstandig dat er bewustzijn wordt gecreëerd rondom de aangeboden interventies en hulp vanuit de universiteit, zodat de (internationale) student hiervan op de hoogte is. This study examined the difference in perceived stress between Dutch and international students who study at Leiden University and whether loneliness is a mediator in the relationship between nationality and stress. Students who experience a lot of stress have a higher chance of developing mental disorders and it can lead to worse academic performance. The effect of nationality was examined because previous research showed that international students often deal with more stressors than national students. Besides that, international students are further away from home which can lead to feelings of loneliness. Loneliness can subsequently cause higher levels of stress and therefore, international students are at risk. This study is conducted with an online questionnaire where the Perceived Stress Scale-10 was used 4 to measure perceived stress and two separate items were used to measure feelings of loneliness. The hypotheses are tested via a mediation analysis. International students significantly experienced higher levels of stress than Dutch students, however, both experienced moderate levels of stress. International students also had significantly more feelings of loneliness than Dutch students and loneliness turned out to be a mediator in the relation between nationality and stress. For this reason, international students are more vulnerable to the negative consequences of stress. It is important that Leiden University develops interventions to target stress and feelings of loneliness among the student body to reduce its negative consequences. Finally, creating awareness about the interventions and help available from the university is necessary in order to reach out to the international students in particular.",

Rumination and perfectionism as predictors of depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances in university students,"Thiele, Kay",['Umay Aksungur'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Depression and insomnia are prevalent disorders which are often found to occur comorbidly. Compared to suffering from one disorder alone, a comorbidity is related to a higher symptom burden and reduced treatment success. Still, only a number of studies focus on the psychological risk factors for the onset and maintenance of depression and insomnia. This study hypothesized that high levels of perfectionism and rumination can predict an increase in depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances. In a sample of 69 healthy university students, an online survey with a series of self-report questionnaires was administered. The study confirmed the already established finding of a comorbidity between depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances. Regarding the main hypotheses of this study, multiple regression analyses yielded that rumination significantly predicts depressive symptoms as well as sleep disturbances, while perfectionism was not a significant predictor of an increase in depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances. Existing literature suggests that this could be either explained by 1) the mediating effect of rumination between perfectionism and sleep disturbances or depressive symptoms and that 2) maladaptive, but not adaptive, perfectionism has detrimental effects on mood and sleep. Future research should investigate these hypotheses and additionally examining whether other factors, for instance worry or stress, might be relevant in predicting depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances. Further knowledge about the mechanisms behind the comorbidity between depression and insomnia is relevant in order to improve existing treatment approaches as well as establish prevention measures which target these risk factors.","['Rumination', 'Perfectionism', 'depressive symptoms', 'depression', 'sleep disturbances', 'insomnia', 'university students']"
"To those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure: Understanding religion as a social determinant of suicidal ideation","Harsevoort, Abel",['Ronald Bahamondes-Alvarez'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: In light of the framework of the Social Determinants of Mental Health (SDoMH) developed by prof. Crick Lund, this study investigated the relationship between religion and Suicidal Ideation (SI). Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and therefore its subdomains, amongst which SI, require specific attention. Religion is a major social determinant as 84.4% of the world’s population is religiously affiliated. Objective: Investigating the relationship between religion and suicidal ideation in light of the SDoMH framework. Methods: A non-clinical sample of 133 Leiden University students aged 17 to 26 were recruited. SI was measured by means of the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS) and religion was measured with two demographical questions regarding self-perceived religiosity and religious service attendance. Results: No significant relationship between SI and self-perceived religiosity (t(131) = -.334, p = .739), and between SI and religious service attendance (t(131) = 1.474, p = .143) was found. Furthermore, a SI prevalence of 51.8% was found. Conclusion: This study reveals the need for a detailed and structured approach to investigating the concepts of religion and suicidal ideation within future research into the SDoMH, as well as the possibility that the prevalence of SI has increased.","['Suicide', 'Suicidal Ideation', 'Social Determinants of Mental Health', 'Religion', 'Religiosity']"
Mr. en Mrs. Dictator: Hoe mannen en vrouwen met absolute macht invloed hebben op groepsonderhandelingen,"Weber, Rik",['Wolfgang Steinel'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek werd gekeken of vrouwen en mannen verschillen in het gebruiken van macht (dictator zijn) in een groepsonderhandeling van drie personen. Er werden 68 gemengde groepen van drie vrienden/kennissen geworven voor dit onderzoek. Deze groepen deden een onderhandelspel waarmee ze punten moesten verdienen voor zichzelf (individualistisch sociaal motief) of als groep (coöperatief sociaal motief). Hoe meer punten ze verdienden, hoe groter de kans was dat ze €20 beloning konden krijgen. We voorspelden dat coöperatieve groepen hoger zouden scoren dan individualistische groepen en dat coöperatieve groepen met een mannelijke dictator het hoogste zouden scoren en in de individualistische groepen het laagste. Uit de resultaten van een 2 (gender van de dictator) x 2 (sociaal motief) ANCOVA voor gezamenlijke groepsuitkomsten met genderstereotype goedkeuring en gender invloed als covariaten bleek dat er een significant hoofdeffect van sociaal motief was, waarbij de coöperatieve groepen gezamenlijk hoger scoorden dan individualistische groepen. Daarnaast bestond er een significant interactie-effect van gender van de dictator met sociaal motief. Voor groepen met een vrouwelijke dictator scoorden de individualistische groepen het laagst en coöperatieve groepen het hoogst. De verschillen waren niet te verklaren door de covariaten of door verschillen in hoe erg de leider zocht naar de beste oplossing, toegaf aan andermans wensen, conflicten vermeed, egoïstisch was of compromissen zocht. Mannelijke en vrouwelijke dictators verschillen ook niet in prestatie- of relatie-oriëntatie. De resultaten van het onderzoek zouden verklaard kunnen worden door het stereotype reactance effect, alhoewel dit uitvoeriger moet worden onderzocht.","['Gender, macht, sociaal motief, coöperatief, individualistisch, stereotype reactance']"

How do I feel? Social Anxiety and Negative Social Feedback: The Moderating Role of Perfectionism,"Zerbini, Debora",['Dr. Melle van der Molen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social performance feedback received from others influences self-feelings and self-evaluations. Recent work provides initial evidence that socially anxious individuals, characterized by a consistent negative self-view, show a negative bias for learning selfrelated information. A social speech task paradigm and a computational model were used to assess the hypothesis of whether a negative social learning bias regarding self-evaluation and self-feelings is present in subclinical socially anxious people. 106 young adults gave a speech in front of 3 judges from whom they received either positive or negative performance feedback. The feedback from the judges was simultaneously presented with the participants' own self-rating on their performance. Immediately after viewing both feedbacks, participants rated how they felt about themselves on a VAS scale. Affective Updating and an adapted Rescorla-Wagner learning model were used to assess how people changed their self-feelings over time in response to received feedback valence. Additionally, the study investigated the association between perfectionism, social anxiety and negative social feedback. Given that perfectionism is strongly related to both social anxiety and social rejection, we tested whether individuals with elevated levels of social anxiety and perfectionism would adjust their selffeelings stronger towards negative social feedback. Results did not indicate a negative social learning bias on self-feelings after receiving negative social feedback in socially anxious individuals. Also, perfectionism was not found to be a moderator between social anxiety and negative social feedback. Overall, results were non-significant, however, our study lies the groundwork and highlights the importance of further studies in this field.","['social anxiety', 'social anxiety disorder', 'negative social feedback', 'social rejection', 'social evaluation', 'perfectionism']"

This study uses a new research paradigm that examines adding subjects to the negotiation, also known as increasing the size of the pie. This research was conducted in a social setting where alcohol consumption was a factor. The purpose of this study is to find out whether adding topics to the negotiation and alcohol consumption leads to a better negotiation process and better outcomes for both parties. To this end, 190 participants participated in face-to-face conventional role-play negotiations in pairs and completed a questionnaire afterwards. It was found that the participant who could originally gain more points from the negotiation had less resistance to yielding when the topics were added at the beginning of the negotiation. The participant who was originally able to get fewer points out of the negotiation acted more simultaneously when the topics were added at the beginning of the negotiation. In addition, a cautious trend was found of more concern for other when an average amount of alcohol was consumed by the participant who could achieve fewer points and more concern for other by the participant who could achieve more points when the items were added at the beginning of the negotiation.","['Negotiation', 'Expanding the pie', 'Logrolling']"
Social anxiety in Dutch non-western children and young adolescents: How does social anxiety develop in Dutch non-western children?,"Marguoum, Amal",['Leone de Voogd'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social anxiety in non-western children and adolescents has not been well studied in the Netherlands, so the purpose of this study was to investigate social anxiety in this group. This study tested whether a high score on perceived discrimination is associated with a high score on social anxiety, whether there are gender differences in the non-western group in social anxiety and whether loneliness strengthens the relationship between perceived discrimination and social anxiety. Three classes from three different schools participated, there was a total of 22 participants. To test the hypotheses, the Social Anxiety Scale for Children (SASC-A), Adolescent Discrimination Distress Index (ADDI) and the Asher Loneliness Scale (ALS) have been used as measurements. The results show that there was only a significant difference in gender in social anxiety, girls scored higher in social anxiety than boys. However, this should be interpreted carefully. The other hypotheses were all not significant. Due to the sample size the reliability and validity of this study was not great, so the results are not a good reflection. It is advised to perform this study in a bigger sample size since this is an important matter to the non-western community.","['social anxiety, non-western, children, adolescents']"
Evaluating the effectiveness of an internet based cognitive rehabilitation program for working cancer survivors,"Versluis, Anne","['Kete Klaver', 'Karin van der Hiele']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Cognitive problems are associated with declined work performance. Interventions guiding cancer survivors in their return to work are growing, but evidence-based interventions for sustained employability are lacking. This study aimed (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel cognitive rehabilitation program “Niet Rennen Maar Plannen-online” for occupationally active non-central nervous system cancer survivors with cognitive problems in the attainment of work-related rehabilitation goals 12-weeks post-randomization, and (2) to examine whether its effectiveness differs between survivors with and without objectified cognitive problems at study entry. A multicenter three-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted. Survivors were randomly allocated to 1) the waitlist control group, 2) the basic program group, which involved a brief self-help cognitive training program, or 3) the extensive program group, where survivors received an online strategy training and guidance of a cognitive therapist in addition to the basic program. The attainment of individual work-related rehabilitation goals as assessed with Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) was the primary outcome measure. As this study is part of an ongoing study, only survivors that finished the evaluation 12-weeks post-randomization before 29-11-2022 were included. One hundred and eighty-nine adult cancer survivors participated in this study, distributed over the control (N=73), basic (N=64) and extensive group (N=52). Survivors in the extensive group had higher goal attainment scores (M=53.90, SD=13.39), compared to the basic (M=44.39, SD=16.23) and control group (M=44.59, SD=14.90), F(2,185)=7.43, p=.001. The control group and basic program group did not differ in goal attainment. Compared to baseline, goal attainment scores were higher 12-weeks post-randomization for all three groups, t(188) = 21.59, p< .001. The effectiveness of the program did not differ between survivors with and without objective cognitive impairment. Preliminary evidence showed the effectiveness of the extensive cognitive rehabilitation program “Niet Rennen Maar Plannen-online” in attainment of work-related rehabilitation goals. In contrast, the basic program did not prove its effectiveness. All three groups showed higher goal attainment scores compared to baseline, indicating effects of the natural course and/or setting goals, regardless of the treatment effect. If replication proves its effectiveness, the extensive version of the program seems a valuable addition to long-term survivorship care.",

The decline of the West: The relationship between polarisation and political decline,"Emde, Elise",['Dr. M.B. Longo'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Around the turn of the 21st century, there arose many Western declinist literature in response to Fukuyama’s ‘End of history’ paper. As it merely discussed decline with concepts of economics and international power, it could not explain ‘polarisation’, even while polarisation was in popular tongue often associated with democratic decline. While existing literature between polarisation and political decline only addresses direct democratic decline in small-N case studies, a framework for structural decline within the context of civilisations is needed to address Western decline. Nietzsche and Spengler both offer frameworks to analyse structural political decline within the West. Ultimately, the paper will conclude that there exists a positive relationship between polarisation and political decline, while it tries to make the conceptions of polarisation of Nietzsche and Spengler more contemporary. In the end, the paper states that more research is needed towards frameworks of decline and polarisation.","['Western decline', 'polarisation']"
Promoting cooperation in social dilemmas: The effectiveness of rewards in promoting cooperative behaviour in pluriform groups,"Wilbrink, Juno",['Welmer Molenmaker'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Experimental research has repeatedly shown that the use of rewards can effectively promote cooperative behaviour in social groups. However, studies have only examined the effectiveness of rewards in uniform groups, and not whether rewards are effective in pluriform groups including people from different backgrounds. We investigate the effectiveness of rewards in promoting cooperation in pluriform groups in a social dilemma context. In a Public Goods game, we manipulate the ability of rewarders to distinguish in rewarding group members differently. We found that rewards were not effective when the rewarder could distinguish, which is not in line with our predictions based on the Bounded Generalized Reciprocity (BGR) theory and Social Identity Theory (SIT). The results suggest that people favour a fair allocation of rewards over reputational concerns. This has implications for the extent to which the SIT and BGR predict behaviour and how rewards should be implemented in real-world social dilemmas.",

The participation of middle powers in NATO Security Force Assistance operations: Italy's quest for international reputation,"Buccino, Sara","['Hooft, P. A. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Security Force Assistance (SFA) operations have increasingly become the cornerstone of NATO’s foreign interventionism. Logically, the great powers of the Alliance would be expected to be the primary contributors to NATO SFA missions. Yet, middle and smaller powers appear to be the main troop providers to these operations. This research project aims to investigate how the quest for international reputation impacts the participation of middle powers in NATO SFA operations. This objective is achieved by taking the participation of Italy in NATO’s Resolute Support Mission (RSM) in Afghanistan and NATO Mission Iraq (NMI) as a case study. This paper reaches two main findings. First, Italy participated in RSM and NMI to enhance its reputation within NATO and within the broader international community, rather than out of strictly security motives. Second, when Italian policymakers employed stronger reputation-related rhetoric, they deployed a higher number of troops to the selected operations. This study concludes that middle powers that seek to enhance their international reputation participate in NATO SFA operations through higher troop deployments.","['middle powers', 'NATO', 'SFA', 'Italy', 'reputation']"

The surgeon is the mother; the role of implicit gender stereotypes of children and their parents on the professional interests of children.,"Vedder, Irisa","['Pol, L.D. van der']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Children grow up in a world full of consciously, explicit and unconsciously, implicit gender stereotypes. This thesis focusses on de implicit stereotypes of children and their parents. Children are influenced by implicit stereotypes by constantly being exposed to these in society, in schools or by their parents. By unconsciously expressing these implicit stereotypes, parents influence the interests, and thus the professional interests, of their children. This study, with a cross-sectional design, examined whether children's implicit gender stereotypes mediates the relationship between parents' implicit gender stereotypes and gender stereotyped occupational interests. 100 Dutch families were visited at home for this study. The data of 100 children, 99 mothers and 98 fathers was used for the mediation analysis. All of the children were 11 or 12 years old and were the second child in the family. To research the implicit gender stereotypes, the arts-science version of the Implicit Association Test was conducted on both parents and the child. In addition, the children were asked about their stereotyped occupational interests using a Dutch version of the Occupation, Activity, Traits – PM. The main analysis consisted of a mediation analysis using the causal steps method of Baron and Kenny (1986). And both the mother’s and the father’s stereotypes were examined separately. The regression analyses showed that parental stereotypes did not predict the professional interests of children (hypothesis 1). Also, no relation was found between the implicit stereotypes of parent and child (hypothesis 2). Furthermore, the children implicit stereotypes did not predict the children’s professional interests (hypothesis 3). Therefore, the conclusion of this thesis is that parents don’t seem to affect their children professional interests with their implicit stereotypes about gender (hypothesis 4). Implications for this research could be that we need more insight about how the communication between parent and child occurs.","['implicit gender stereotypes', 'gender roles', 'professional preferences', 'mothers', 'fathers', 'children']"

How Rejection Sensitivity Relates to Attachment: While Looking at Their Relationship with Feedback Learning,"Voetman, Vicky","['Vandenbroucke, A.', 'Akdag, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The present study looked into the relationship between rejection sensitivity (RS) and feedback learning, and whether this is possibly mediated by attachment. Humans have a need to fit in and have close interpersonal relationships, and therefore, it is essential to be able to adjust and learn from feedback from others. Individual differences, such as RS, could play an important role in which attachment style an individual uses and how one responds to feedback. Participants (N= 97) completed several questionnaires, including Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) and Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (RSQ). Additionally, they took part in the Social Probabilistic Learning Paradigm (SELF-Symbol) to measure feedback learning, and were observed for behavioural data. Results indicated that RS is closely related to attachment, and therefore, to attachment-related anxiety. The negative direction of the relationship between RS and feedback learning and between feedback learning and attachment were found as expected. However, these relationships were not robust. As this study did not find a mediating role of attachment on the relationship between RS and feedback learning, this study still contributes to the scarce knowledge in the field of RS and attachment. Future research can use the limitations of this study to build on the newfound knowledge obtained from this research, where possible interventions can be made to increase the well-being of people high in RS, attachment-related anxiety, and in civil society.","['attachment', 'attachment-related anxiety', 'Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS)', 'negative feedback learning', 'positive feedback learning', 'rejection sensitivity']"

The Role of Attachment and Gender in the Relation Between Maternal Love Withdrawal and Self-Esteem,"van Drunen, Anne-Fleur","['Cruijsen, R. van der']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Self-esteem is a fundamental change that occurs during adolescence, and previous studies suggested that maternal love withdrawal, parental and peer attachment quality contribute to adolescents’ self-esteem. Since lower levels of self-esteem are related to poor health outcomes, it is important to find out which factors contribute to these negative outcomes and which group of adolescents are especially at risk. Therefore, the present study investigated whether gender and attachment quality moderate the relationship between maternal love withdrawal and self-esteem. It was expected that there is a negative relationship between maternal love withdrawal and self-esteem in adolescents and that there are gender differences in this relationship. Moreover, it was hypothesized that there is a relationship between attachment quality and self-esteem, and that the relationship between maternal love withdrawal and self-esteem is stronger in adolescents who are more securely attached to their mother, father and/or friend than adolescents who are less securely attached. Participants were 160 adolescents aged 11-21 years who completed online questionnaires about maternal love withdrawal, attachment quality and self-esteem. The results showed that maternal love withdrawal, and maternal, paternal and friend attachment (anxious/avoidant) were negatively related to self-esteem. Furthermore, gender and attachment did not moderate the relationship between maternal love withdrawal and self-esteem. Interventions should be created that support insecurely attached adolescents or adolescents whose mother withdrew their love and educate parents about the negative consequences of using love withdrawal as a punishment for their child’s undesirable behavior.","['Maternal love withdrawal', 'attachment quality', 'gender', 'self-esteem', 'adolescence']"
Substance use disorder and violent crime: The relationship between single- and polysubstance use disorder and violent offenses in a Dutch clinical youth population,"Hetten, Marinde van","['Berg, J.F. van den']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the past decade, one of the main difficulties in describing a general relationship between substance abuse and violent crime is the question whether different types of substances may relate differently to violent crime, and which other factors may be influential. The current study investigated the effect of different types and combinations of substances on violent offenses committed by Dutch youth (16-22 years) who were starting an addiction treatment for a substance use disorder (SUD) with alcohol, cannabis, or stimulants (cocaine or amphetamines). Participants (N=310) were individually assessed, with questions about their substance use behavior and whether they had committed a violent offense. The independent variables for this study were polysubstance use, combined stimulants and alcohol use, and singular or combined cannabis use. Contrary to the hypotheses, the association between polysubstance use and violent offenses was not significant (OR=1.14, 95% CI= 0.62–2.08), and the association between stimulants use and violent offenses (OR=1.20, 95% CI=0.47–3.04) and between cannabis use and violent offenses (OR= 0.63, 95% CI=0.34–1.18) was not significant either. The covariate ‘indication of conduct disorder’ had a significant influence on the relationship between types of SUD and the occurrence of violent offenses, but an influence of age and gender on this relationship was not found. Because this is the first study with a clinical youth sample, the best explanation for these findings is that the psychoactive effects of the substances were (at least) not the primary influence of the occurrence of violent offenses committed by youth.","['substance use disorder, violent crime, Dutch youth, psychoactive effects']"
Differences in externalizing problems before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Dutch children and adolescents referred to youth care,"Sterk, Tessa","['Van den Berg, J.F.', 'Tieskens, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Aims: The aim of this study is to provide more information on the relation between the COVID-19 pandemic and externalizing problems in children and adolescents with mental health problems. In addition, this study examined the potential influence of gender and age on the relation between the COVID-19 pandemic and externalizing problems. Methods: This study is based on a between-subjects design that examined externalizing problems among children and adolescents between the ages of 8 and 18 years in a youth care sample (N = 3,215) before the COVID-19 pandemic (April 1, 2019–March 10, 2020, N = 1,873) and during the pandemic (March 11, 2020–April 1, 2021, N = 1,342). The Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) was used to measure externalizing problems. Parents or legal guardians filled in this questionnaire at the beginning of treatment. Results: No increases in externalizing problems were found in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to children and adolescents before the pandemic. In addition, gender and age did not influence the relation between the COVID-19 pandemic and externalizing problems significantly. Conclusions: Our results are not in line with most previous research. However, they are in line with recent research that found initial increases in mental health problems at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but not over time. This research contributes to the knowledge and sheds new light on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents referred to youth care.","['COVID-19', 'Externalizing problems', 'Behavioral problems', 'Children and adolescents']"
Psychopaths’ Moral Decision Making in an Empathy Dictator Game,"Gruner, Christopher Luis",['Dr. Sandy Overgaauw'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Deficiencies in empathic functioning are known to lay at the core of psychopathy and have been suggested to explain their immoral behavior. Although empathy can be divided into affective and cognitive components which have been shown to play an integral role in information processing when viewing others’ morally laden actions, the individual contribution of each component on the interpersonal behavior remains to be determined. This study set out to investigate whether incarcerated psychopathic offenders evaluate social situations different to non-psychopathic controls. An adapted version of the Dictator Game using an empathy induction protocol was employed to measure prosocial sharing behavior indicative of how an agent’s behavior is evaluated. Psychopaths showed less differentiation in sharing behavior which might be explained by an impairment of the affective component of empathy. Therefore, the tendencies of psychopaths to adjust to these scenarios should be taken into account when creating treatment plans against recidivism in psychopathic offenders.","['Psychopathy, Moral Decision Making, Empathy, Dictator Game']"

Attachment to peers and giving in gifted and typically developing pre-adolescents,"Schwing, Elisa","['Zanolie, C.K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current study examined the relation between attachment to peers and giving towards parents, friends, disliked and anonymous peers in a Prosocial Donation Task (PDT) for pre-adolescents. Secondly, this study examined the influence of giftedness of pre-adolescents’ giving towards parents, friends, disliked and anonymous peers in a PDT, before and after controlling for attachment. Pre-adolescence is an important transition period where a lot of changes (social, emotional, physical) occur and this period of time has not been investigated that much when it comes to prosocial behaviours, such as giving. Additionally, there is not a lot of literature on giftedness and its relation with attachment and prosocial behaviour. Sixty-nine pre-adolescents gifted and typically developing, between 9 and 12 years old filled out the Inventory of Peer and Parents attachment (IPPA) and performed a PDT. The results show that there is no linear relation between attachment and pre-adolescents’ giving behaviour in general. However, the results did show that the giving behaviour, when a distinction is made between targets, is influenced by attachment to peers, and that pre-adolescents give significantly more to parents and friends than to disliked and anonymous peers. This suggests that pre-adolescents who are more securely attached to their peers, display more giving behaviour towards targets they have a connection with (parents and friends). No difference was found in giving behaviour between gifted and typically developing pre-adolescents. One explanation may be that during pre-adolescence the difference between the giving behaviour of gifted and typically developing pre-adolescents is not that big. Another explanation may be that the PDT that was used was too simple, requiring less cognitive capabilities to process relevant information, and therefore no difference occurred between the two groups. Future research should investigate how giving behaviour develops for gifted and typically developing pre-adolescents as they get older, investigate the possible influence of COVID-19, and investigate the influence of attachment to peers and parents simultaneously to better understand the influence of preadolescents’ attachment on giving behaviour.","['pre-adolescence', 'peer attachment', 'giftedness', 'giving', 'prosocial behaviour']"

Coalitional Presidentialism and Corrupted Coalitions: The Case of Brazil,"Moreno, Andre",['Arlinda Rrustemi'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Coalition presidentialism is when a minority president must form coalitions in fragmented parliaments to govern. To do this, the president uses formal coalition-building methods, such as agenda-setting power, or informal methods associated with corruption, such as paying bribes. Corrupt practices are normally shielded by the Executive and Legislative from judicial and control bodies, however, sometimes anticorruption operations breach this blockage and shake the Executive-Legislative relations. Literature often covers the Executive- Legislative connection, but the influence of the Judiciary and control bodies on coalition- building methods is little explored. Hence, this thesis asks what the impact of large anticorruption operations on informal methods of coalition formation is. The thesis advances that by understanding such impact, one can better estimate the effectiveness of anticorruption operations and delineate the judicial and controlling bodies’ influence on informal methods of coalition-building. A typical case study about Brazil was selected and the method of analysis is theory-testing process-tracing. Furthermore, the thesis explores the development of big anti- corruption operations in each Brazilian presidency from 2003 to 2018: Lula (2003-2010), Dilma (2011-2016), and Temer (2016-2018). In the three governments analyzed, anti- corruption operations led to greater public and judicial attention to some types of corrupt practices, decreasing their attractiveness and leading to political instability. Moreover, billions of dollars were given back to the government because of the operations. The Presidency and politicians had to reinvent themselves on several occasions to sustain governability, but they ended up reinventing themselves in corruption itself: changing the intensity with which they used some coalition-building methods or resorting to innovative methods. As for the presidents, the ability with which they assembled a cohesive coalition was critical for their political survival and the intrusiveness of anti-corruption operations.",

"Are Women the Better Leaders? The Influence of Gender on Power, Responsibility and Climate Consciousness","Jakober, Annik",['Daan Scheepers'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The present study investigated the effect of female identification on power perception and climate consciousness. It was hypothesized that female identification would lead to perceiving power as a responsibility and that a stronger sense of responsibility increases an individual’s climate consciousness. This was tested with UK participants (N = 251) which are working in management and leadership positions, taking part in a questionnaire; data was followed up by two linear regressions and a mediation analysis. The results showed that, in line with expectations, women perceived their power more as a responsibility than men did. However, unexpectedly, responsibility and climate consciousness were negatively correlated. Therefore, individuals identifying as female were not more climate conscious because of their heightened sense of responsibility in leadership positions. The opposite effect was found for male identification, as through their decreased sense of responsibility the mediation analysis led to an increased climate consciousness. Therefore, the hypotheses in this study were only partly confirmed. The outcomes have practical implications for human resource management and politics, as certain characteristics can be determined for the “right” leadership positions. Given the necessity of climate change, more research is needed to examine which leadership characteristics would serve the best outcomes for the environment.","['climate consciousness', 'gender', 'leadership', 'social psychology', 'power construals']"
De invloed van verbale expressie van angst versus veiligheid van ouders op het krijgen van sociale angst bij kinderen,"Veenstra, Nina","['Aktar, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Ondanks dat sociale angststoornissen een grootschalig probleem zijn onder de bevolking, is nog niet veel bekend over hoe sociale angst zich ontwikkelt. Hoewel er meerdere risicofactoren betrokken zijn bij de ontwikkeling van sociale angst blijkt uit eerder onderzoek dat de sociale omgeving een grote invloed heeft. Kinderen leren sociale angst vooral aan door verbale uitspraken van de directe nabije omgeving, waarbij de ouders een grote invloed blijken te hebben. In dit onderzoek is gekeken naar het effect van verbale uitspraken van de ouders over de veiligheid versus het gevaar van een sociale situatie op het sociaal vermijdend gedrag van kinderen. Hierbij is een experiment gedaan waarbij kinderen tussen 10 en 13 jaar een presentatie- en interactietaak moesten uitvoeren na bedreigende versus veilige informatie te horen van hun ouders over iemand die hen ging beoordelen. Ondertussen is er ook gekeken naar aanwezigheid van het temperament gedragsinhibitie. Aangezien dit temperament zich kenmerkt in sociaal vermijdend gedrag is er vanuit gegaan dat dit aanwezigheid hiervan invloed heeft op de mate vertoond sociaal vermijdend gedrag. Er is een niet significant effect gevonden tussen de verbale uitspraken over de veiligheid versus het gevaar van de ouders en het sociaal vermijdend gedrag van de kinderen. Er is wel een significant effect gevonden tussen het sociaal vermijdend gedrag en het temperament gedragsinhibitie. Kinderen toonden niet meer sociaal vermijdend gedrag vertoond na bedreigende of veilige informatie te hebben gehoord over de onbekenden van hun ouders. Wel is er meer sociaal vermijdend gedrag aangetoond bij kinderen die een hogere score hadden op een vragenlijst die het temperament gedragsinhibitie aantoonde. Er moet nog meer onderzoek gedaan worden over hoe sociaal vermijdend gedrag wordt aangeleerd. Although social anxiety disorders are a widespread problem among the population, not much is known about how social anxiety develops. Although several risk factors have been implicated in the development of social anxiety, previous research has shown that the social environment has a major influence. Children mainly learn social anxiety through verbal statements from the immediate environment, in which the parents appear to have a major influence. This study looked at the effect of verbal statements by the parents about the safety versus the danger of a social situation on the social avoidance behavior of children. An experiment was conducted in which children between the ages of 10 and 13 had to perform a presentation and interaction task after hearing threatening versus safe information from their parents about someone who was going to assess them. In the meantime, the presence of the temperament behavioral inhibition has also been examined. Since this temperament is characterized in social avoidance behavior, it has been assumed that the presence influences the degree of social avoidance behavior. An insignificant effect was found between the verbal statements about safety versus danger of the parents and the social avoidance behavior of the children. A significant effect was found between social avoidance behavior and temperament behavioral inhibition. Children did not showed more social avoidance behavior after hearing threatening or safe information about the strangers. However, more social avoidance behavior has been shown in children who had a higher score on a questionnaire that showed behavioral inhibition. More research needs to be done on how social avoidance behavior is learned.",
"Mitigate climate change: responsibility for who? Distributive preferences of climate costs between different countries, based on wealth and pollution levels","Melaard, Mark","['Stallen, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Climate change is a worldwide problem and it has become clearer that costly actions are needed to stop this. Costs to prevent climate change can be distributed across different countries to solve this problem. However, what do people think is the fair way to distribute these costs and will they change their mind when they are informed about their country’s allocated costs? The hypothesis in this research is that the higher the wealth and pollution level of a country, the more costs will be distributed towards it. Additionally, it is expected that people who receive explicit information about their country’s wealth or pollution level will distribute less costs towards themselves. In this study the participants had to distribute costs between four country sets based on either wealth or pollution. Some received explicit knowledge about the wealth or pollution level of their country, to see if this influenced their distributive preference. Results showed that people distribute more costs to a country the higher its wealth or pollution level. When informed about their own country’s wealth or pollution level, people from less wealthy sets are willing to contribute more to the climate costs. This shows that people might be willing to pay more than would be expected at first hand.","['Distributive preferences, Climate change, Climate costs, Pollution, Wealth']"

The exploitation of resources in the South China Sea: How territorial disputes facilitate a Tragedy of the Commons,"Ansing, Tomas","['Hagen, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The South China Sea (SCS) is of global importance: it hosts one of the busiest trade routes in the world, and contains large amounts of natural resources such as fish, oil and gas as well. The SCS is also one of the most contested pools of water on the globe. Numerous countries claim (parts of) the SCS, and conflicting claims have resulted in a highly disputed environment. Mainly China has been assertive over the region, claiming a large part of the SCS with the so-called Nine Dash-line. This struggle over the resources in the SCS has caused states to move in rather destructive manners. Overfishing, (testing for) resource extraction and reforming islands have caused massive damage to the SCS and its marine populations. Due to lack of regulation and cooperation, local people as well as corporations are not only unhindered in taking destructive actions, they are incentivized to do so. The situation in the SCS is a dire one, fish populations are already at an all time low, putting the meals and jobs of millions of people at risk. A solution is called upon, but due to conflicting claims of countries, causing mistrust and increased militarization, this is not in sight. This thesis aims to explain the situation in the SCS, and will do so on two levels. First, it will explain the situation states find themselves in and which choices present themselves when operating in the SCS. As said, that situation creates an environment where locals as well as corporations find themselves being able to overexploit, thus eventually destroying the natural resources the SCS contains. Fish is one of the most overexploited thereof, with marine populations showing sharp decline in numbers since the last decades. Therefore this thesis will secondly present an analysis on what situation fishermen find themselves in. Both these parts will be explained through game theory. Multiple models will be presented to explain the interactions that countries and their populations find themselves in, and why they make the choices they make. Lastly, some propositions will be made on how to create an environment in which these problems can be overcome and create a well-managed sea.","['South China Sea', 'Tradegy of the commons', 'fisheries', 'security dilemma', ""prisoner's dilemma"", 'game theory']"
De ontwikkeling van emotieherkenning bij kinderen en adolescenten met een hoog risico op toekomstig crimineel gedrag,"Poirot, Nicole","['Jong, R.M. de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Social information processing begins with recognizing emotions in others. If emotions are not properly recognized, social information processing is less successful and a risk of responding with aggressive or rule-breaking behaviour arises. Children who frequently respond like this have a higher risk of developing criminal behaviour. Previous research has shown these children at risk have more difficulty recognizing sadness and fear in faces of others. The current study investigated how the development of the recognition of sadness and fear progresses and whether this development is different for boys and girls. Participants were between 5 and 18 years of age at high risk of developing criminal behaviour (N = 255, 75% boys). They were all included in the Preventive Intervention Trajectory (PIT) in Amsterdam. This project focuses on underaged siblings or children of delinquents or children who dropped out of school because of frequent absences or extreme antisocial behaviour. Recognition of sad and fear in facial expressions was measured using the Facial Emotion Recognition test (FER). Results indicated that correct recognition of sad facial expressions increased from childhood to mid-adolescence. This development was not found for the recognition of fear. Children, early and middle adolescents showed equal ability. Girls were, on average, better at recognizing sad facial expressions than boys. No gender differences were found in the recognition of fear in facial expressions. The development of both the recognition of sadness and fear with age proceeded in the same way for boys and girls. The insight that the recognition of fear in facial expressions for both boys and girls with a high risk of future criminal behaviour, shows no growth with age and that girls recognize sad facial expressions better than boys, offers the possibility to tailor interventions to the developmental needs of these children.","['Emotieherkenning', 'crimineel gedrag']"

Is the GSP+ a plus for the environment? A comparative analysis of the EU’s GSP+ on countries’ compliance with the Basel Convention,"Wiedmann, Lara","['Hagen, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Generalised Scheme on Preferences Plus (GSP+) of the European Union aims to improve good governance and sustainable development in developing countries. To achieve these aims, the GSP+ offers trade benefits to the beneficiary countries. In exchange, the countries need to ratify 27 core conventions in the policy areas on labour rights, human rights, good governance, and the environment. One of those conventions is the Basel Convention, which addresses the collective action problem of illegal trafficking of hazardous waste. Following the Global Public Goods and institutionalist theory, it is expected that international agreements help combat collective action problems by improving compliance with international conventions. However, a debate has emerged as to whether the GSP+ is an effective instrument to help beneficiary countries implement the conventions on the ground. Previous research focused on the effect of the GSP+ on the implementation of labour conventions and human rights. By focusing on the environmental side and investigating compliance with the Basel Convention, this research addresses the gap in the literature. This research presents a comparative quantitative content analysis between GSP+ countries and a control group to measure whether the GSP+ affects countries' compliance with the Basel Convention. The study finds that the GSP+ has no positive effect on all dimensions of countries' compliance with the Basel Convention compared to non-GSP+ countries.","['GSP+', 'Basel Convention', 'Global Public Goods', 'Collective Action', 'EU']"

Youth trauma and substance use: Cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression strategies role in patients with a substance use disorder and comorbid psychiatric disorders,"Lindeman, Nils",['Anne Cuperus'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research has established the mediating role of aspects of emotion regulation in the effect of youth trauma on substance use. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of two emotion regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES), mediate the effect of youth trauma severity on substance use severity. Sixty Dutch speaking participants (41 male) between the age of 21 and 63 years with a substance use disorder (SUD) and at least one comorbid psychiatric diagnosis were included. Participants completed self-report measures regarding youth trauma severity and emotion regulation strategies. A semi-structured interview was administered for substance use severity. We performed a mediation analysis using multiple regression analyses with youth trauma severity as independent variable, CR and ES as mediators and substance use severity as dependent variable. No significant effects of trauma severity on CR (b = -.03, t = -.37, p = .712) and of CR on substance use severity (b = .02, t = .54, p = .595) were found. Also, the effects of youth trauma severity on ES (b = -.07, t = -1.00, p = .322) and of ES on substance use severity (b = -.01, t = -.18, p = .854) were found to be non-significant. The completely standardized indirect effect of CR mediating the effect of youth trauma severity on substance use severity was calculated (ab = .01). The same was done for ES (ab = .00). Overall, the findings of this study suggested that CR and ES did not mediate the effect of youth trauma severity on substance use severity. The results did provide leads for future research like investigating the possibility of an inverted U relationship in the association of substance use and emotion regulation which may very well have influenced the results of this study. Additionally, future research should use objective measures administering the same time period and include subscales of youth trauma severity, more aspects of substance use severity and additional emotion regulation strategies in order to find potential associations which this study might have missed.","['youth trauma severity, cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression, substance use severity, mediation']"
Kennis van Basisschoolleerkrachten over Begrijpend Lezen en de Mate van Toepassing Hiervan in hun Lessen,"Koelewijn, Yvonne","['Koornneef, A.W.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Begrijpend lezen is een onmisbare vaardigheid. Er is de afgelopen jaren echter een achteruitgang zichtbaar van het niveau van Nederlandse leerlingen (Gubbels et al., 2017; Gubbels et al., 2019; OECD, 2019). Om goed onderwijs te geven in begrijpend lezen is kennis over begrijpend lezen bij leerkrachten noodzakelijk (Kelcey, 2011; Maguet et al., 2021; Podhajski et al., 2009). Daarom is in deze studie onderzocht in hoeverre aspecten rondom begrijpend lezen bekend zijn bij leerkrachten van groep 5 t/m 8 en in hoeverre zij deze kennis toepassen in hun lessen. Dit werd onderzocht door middel van een vragenlijst die werd ingevuld door leerkrachten van deze groepen (N = 27). Deze vragenlijst omvatte zes aspecten die naar voren kwamen uit literatuuronderzoek: technisch lezen, woordenschat, begrijpen, evalueren en reflecteren, informatie opzoeken en leesplezier. Respondenten bleken van evalueren en reflecteren de minste kennis te hebben. Meer kennis van de leerkracht hangt voor vrijwel alle aspecten samen met meer bestede tijd. Leerkrachten die een aanvullende taalcursus hebben gevolgd hadden op elk aspect meer kennis dan leerkrachten die dat niet hebben gedaan. Dit verschil was echter alleen significant voor woordenschat. Vervolgonderzoek zal zich moeten richten op hoe de kennis van leerkrachten verbeterd kan worden en welke invloed dit heeft op de leesvaardigheid van leerlingen. Er kan worden gedacht aan het ontwerpen van een aanvullende cursus gericht op verdieping van vakdidactische vaardigheden met in het bijzonder aandacht voor het aspect evalueren en reflecteren.","['begrijpend lezen', 'leerkrachten', 'basisonderwijs', 'PISA', 'primair onderwijs']"
Parental Warmth and Negative Affect in Adolescents: a Bidirectional Approach to Parent-Adolescent Interaction in Daily Life,"Vos, Esmay",['Loes Janssen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Studies on the relationship between parents and adolescents have shown consistently the importance of warm, supportive parenting for the healthy development of adolescents. Although theories suggest a bidirectional relationship between parental warmth and adolescent affect, the number of studies examining this bidirectionally is small. Additionally, previous studies have frequently used macro-level designs with retrospective self-report measures, while parent-adolescent processes can fluctuate at a smaller scale (i.e., days). The current study aimed to build on the small body of empirical research on the bidirectional, micro-level relationship between adolescent negative affect and parental warmth. We investigated whether perceived parental warmth on one day predicted changes in negative affect the following day, and vice versa. Our sample consisted of 80 adolescents (Mage = 15.90, 63.75% female). They completed four questionnaires a day for 14 consecutive days, including questions on perceived warmth from mothers and fathers and their affective states. Using EMA, results of multilevel analyses with a lagged effect showed that adolescents who experienced less parental warmth from both fathers and mothers experienced more negative affect the following day, while controlling for affect the previous day. Additionally, increased negative affect predicted more maternal warmth the following day. These findings suggest that the idea of bidirectionality is also applicable to day-to-day parenting processes, though support erosion appears to not take place at micro-level. These findings highlight the importance of supportive and warm parenting in family-focused prevention or reduction of negative affect in adolescents.","['Parent-child interaction', 'Daily life', 'Parental warmth', 'Adolescent negative affect', 'Ecological momentary assessment (EMA)']"
Werkgeheugen in relatie met antisociaal gedrag en de moderatie van sociale cognitie bij kinderen tussen de 8 en 13 jaar,"Hietbrink, Sanne","['Koopman-Verhoeff, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Introduction: Social cognition deficits are hypothesized to moderate impairments in working memory in those whom show antisocial behavior. Social cognitive functions could be a precursor on how well working memory processes social information. However, there are no studies on social cognition as a moderator in the relation between working memory and those with antisocial behavior. Methods: This study uses the PIT study. The participating children were between 8 and 13 years old and at risk to develop persistent antisocial behavior (N = 198, 79.8% boys and 20.2% girls). The participants were identified by school, the compulsory education bureau, or they were identified as brothers/sisters of criminals whom committed several high-impact crimes. Impaired working memory was measured with the subtest coding of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC). The Teacher Report Form (TRF) is a questionnaire completed by the teacher, and the conduct problems scale was used to measure antisocial behavior. The Sociaal Cognitieve Vaardigheden Test (SCVT) is a Dutch questionnaire and was used to measure social cognition. A simple regression analysis was used to measure the relation between impaired working memory and antisocial behavior, and a multiple regression analysis was used to measure the moderation of impaired social cognition between impaired working memory and antisocial behavior. Both analyses were controlled for age and sex. Results: Impaired working memory is related to antisocial behavior. Impaired working memory and impaired social cognition are predictors of antisocial behavior. Furthermore, there was an effect that is close to a moderation-effect of impaired social cognition between impaired working memory and antisocial behavior. Discussion: These results indicate that working memory and social cognition should be factored in when developing an intervention to prevent persistent antisocial behavior. Additionally, more research is needed to better understand the moderation of social cognition between working memory and antisocial behavior.",

An out-of-home placement is a far-reaching measure and is a difficult decision to make because the decision has to be made quickly and is often based on incomplete information. To date, differences in decision-making regarding professional out-of-home placements still exist. However, the difference in decision-making by professionals has not been sufficiently researched. Therefore, the present study examines the relationship between expertise and experience and the number of out-of-home places. The mediating role of mindset towards change is also investigated. The participants were 85 master's students (43 Juvenile Law, 42 Educational Sciences) and 46 professionals (25 juvenile judges, 21 council investigators). The number of out-of-home placements was calculated based on the formulated advice of the participants on fictitious case vignettes and the mindset toward change of parents was measured by a questionnaire based on the Implicit Person Theory. It can be concluded that there is a relation between professional experience and out-of-home placements. A relation has also been found between expertise and mindset towards change. No mediation of mindset toward change was found in the relationship between experience and expertise and out-of-home placements. Based on the results it is recommended that more research should be conducted into decision-making by professionals. Any follow-up research could focus on factors that could influence decision-making by professionals.","['mindset, uithuisplaatsing, growth mindset, fixed mindset']"
Western Perceptions of China’s Increased Economic Influence In the Developing World,"Brantjes, Puck",['Dr. A.R.

Through the provision of credit and projects like the Belt and Road Initiative, China is increasing its influence in the economies of developing states. While strengthening its position and increasing leverage within the global economy, it is bringing different values to the international arena. This increased Chinese influence can be considered a challenge to the international community, whose states long have dominated the global economy and the global provision of credit. Therefore, the perception of the international community, in relation to its own global economic status, of China’s increased economic influence in developing states was analysed in this paper. Their perceptions have been analysed through qualitative content analysis, using Schweller’s theory of balanced interests (1994). Analysis revealed differences within the international community – whereas the United States appears to be willing to balance Chinese development efforts and protect its own dominant position, this does not go for all European states. The United States and Europe seem to have different interests for their future and distinct contextual and economic factors influencing their perceptions.","['Geopolitics', 'Political Economy', 'China', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'International Community']"

To do so, questionnaires were used to measure internalized conduct and effortful control and a parent-child drawing task was used to measure sensitive parenting. In the questionnaire for effortful, questions about the levels of effortful control of the child were answered by the primary parent. In the questionnaire for internalized conduct, questions about the levels of internalized conduct of the child were answered by the other parent. The drawing task for parental sensitivity was done by the child and the primary parent. Significant effects were found in parental sensitivity as a predictor of both internalized conduct and effortful control. In addition a significant effect was found in internalized conduct as a predictor of effortful control. However, internalized conduct was not found to be a mediator in the relation between parental sensitivity and effortful control in this study.","['Developmental psychology', 'effortful control', 'parenting', 'parental sensitivity', 'internalized conduct', 'obedience', 'children', 'mediator']"
the relationship between state-trait anxiety and social feedback learning,"Demirel, Melissa","['Saadat, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The prevalence of anxiety in adolescents proposes the question on how it impacts an individual's daily social functioning. Social feedback learning is one of the key processes which occurs in such interactions thus looking into the role which state-trait anxiety plays enlights the propositions of its impacts for one's social functioning. Previous research does not directly focus on the effects of state-trait anxiety on social feedback learning. However, it is suggested that high anxiety levels amongst individuals hinders cognitive functioning in a manner which can indirectly imply that there is interplay with feedback learning. According to this suggestion, data from participants' reaction time for predicting whether a peer likes them or not was used to investigate the relationship between feedback learning and state-trait anxiety. Additionally, the participants' peer ratings before and after completing a test which assesses how much one expects to receive positive feedback from peers was used to further assist in the understanding of this relationship. Findings indicate that social feedback learning does not significantly take place in contexts where negative evaluations are present for individuals with high levels of state anxiety. However, people who have high levels of trait anxiety do learn from negative social feedback but it is not as dramatic as the individuals which have lower levels of state-trait anxiety. Additionally, the analysis based on reaction times showed that being anxious does not influence one's decision making on predicting ratings for peer liking/disliking.","['Adolescents, social evaluation, social feedback learning, state anxiety, trait anxiety']"
Verbanden tussen Expliciete Genderstereotypen van Ouders en de Ervaren Druk op de Genderidentiteit en het Zelfvertrouwen van Kinderen,"Hoff, Carlijn van 't","['Rozenberg, T. M. van de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The gender identity of a child exerts major influence on how a child develops itself and how it sees the world. Gender identity stands for the way a child represents itself as an individual and the associated gender conforming or non-conforming behavior. Parents can have explicit gender stereotypes, which could be an important factor in stimulating or suppressing gender conforming or non-conforming behavior. Children can perceive pressure from their parents when it comes to gender identity, which can influence their self-esteem. The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between explicit parental gender stereotypes, children’s’ perceived pressure on their gender identity and children’s’ self-esteem. The data is originated from the research project Blik op de Toekomst, performed by Leiden University. The sample exists of a subset of 200 families from an agglomeration of Dutch western cities known as “the Randstad”, consisting of a mother, a father and at least two children. This study focuses on the parents and the second child (N= 199; 61.8% girls; aged about 16 years old). In this study, explicit parental gender stereotypes were measured by the Child-Rearing Sex-Role Attitude Scale. Children’s’ self-esteem was measured by the use of the Self-Perception Profile for Children- Global self-worth subscale. Perceived pressure on gender identity was measured through the Dimensional Gender Identity Measure. Results showed no relationship between explicit parental gender stereotypes and childrens’s’ self-esteem. Additionally, results showed that boys experience significantly more perceived gender identity pressure than girls. Further, there was no mediation effect of perceived gender pressure on explicit parental gender stereotypes and children’s’ self-esteem. Lastly, there was no gender difference between the mediation models. In conclusion, in this study no relationship was found between explicit parental gender stereotypes and children’s self-esteem, but boys in the sample experience more perceived gender identity pressure than girls.","['Explicit Parental Genderstereotypes', 'Perecived Gender Identity Pressure', ""Children's' Self-Esteem""]"

EU-Russia Energy Relations and Sanctions,"Jansen, Ingmar",['Dr. Karolina Pomorska'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis asks the question whether dependence on fossil fuels from Russia for domestic energy supply influenced the support for sanctions against Russia of EU member states following the Russian annexation of Crimea and activities in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Support for sanctions is measured using data from previous research by Silva II and Selden (2020). Using multiple regression analysis, several other explanatory factors are accounted for, including expected trade change, FDI stock and former membership of the Eastern Bloc. A small, significant, positive relation between fossil fuel dependence and support for sanctions is found. This leads to three main conclusions: First, energy dependence does not seem to negatively influence the support for sanctions against Russia by EU member states. Second, the analysis suggest a positive relation between these variables might exist. Third, the other explanatory factors accounted for each have no significant influence on support for sanctions. In this time when the EU-Russia energy relations are being reconsidered, this sheds an important light on the debate on energy security and interdependence theory in EU-Russia context.","['EU', 'Russia', 'Energy', 'Sanctions', 'EU foreign policy', 'EU-Russia relations', 'Interdependence']"

Factors that increase the risk of suicidal ideation in the long-term may differ from factors contributing to present suicidal ideation. The aim of this single-case study was to investigate real-time, concurrent associations between suicidal ideation and perceived burdensomeness, hopelessness, loneliness, optimism, social support, and stress. Data were obtained via ecological momentary assessment with four assessments per day over a 21-day period. It was hypothesised that higher scores of burdensomeness, hopelessness, loneliness, and stress, as well as lower optimism scores and the absence of social support would be associated with concurrent increases in suicidal ideation. Additionally, the role of social support as a potential moderator of the relationships between suicidal ideation and perceived burdensomeness, hopelessness, loneliness, optimism, and stress was examined. A multilevel linear mixed model analysis yielded significant associations between hopelessness, loneliness, and social support with suicidal ideation. Further, social support significantly moderated the association between suicidal ideation and hopelessness, with both being lower when the participant was in company. These results imply that repeated daily assessments of hopelessness, loneliness, and social support in individuals at suicide risk may be used as indicators of the severity of current suicidal ideation. Besides, social support may serve as a protective factor that could be integrated in suicide prevention strategies. Nonetheless, these conclusions are limited in their external validity given the case-study design. Further research replicating this study with a larger sample is needed to obtain generalisable conclusions.","['Suicidal ideation', 'burdensomeness', 'hopelessness', 'loneliness', 'optimism', 'social support', 'stress', 'short-term risk factors', 'ecological momentary assessment', 'case study']"

However little is known about how these three concepts relate to each other amongst adolescents. The aim of this study was to examine the relations between these three factors and to find out if the relations were different for boys and girls. The current study has a cross-sectional design with 40 participants (12 girls and 26 boys) in the age range of 12 to 18 years. The Index van Empathie voor Kinderen en Adolescenten (IEKA) was used to measure empathy. The Competentiebelevingsschaal voor Adolescenten (CBSA) was used to measure social acceptance and self-worth. As expected a significant relationship between social acceptance and self-worth was found. No significant relationship between empathy and social acceptance was found. The expected difference in the relationship between empathy and social acceptance for girls and boys was also not confirmed. It was found that the relationship between empathy and self-worth could not be explained by social acceptance. The finding of a significant relationship between social acceptance and self-worth could be important for the development of interventions that aim to increase self-worth. The absence of the expected relationships could be explained by the small sample size and the uneven distribution of boys and girls. It could also be explained by the measuring methods that were used. Further research is needed to find out more about the relationship between empathy, social acceptance and self-worth.",

"Stress and Emotional Problems in Secondary School Students: The Stress Lessons, a School-Based Psychoeducational Program about Stress","Molenaar, Lalique","['Vogelaar, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Previous research shows that secondary school students experience increasing amounts of school-related stress and emotional problems. Students who struggle with these problems might benefit from learning more about stress, for example with a psychoeducational program about stress. Aim: This study investigated the effect of a school-based psychoeducational program, The Stress Lessons, on students’ knowledge on the subject of stress. In addition, this study also explored the relationship between stress and emotional problems and the influence of students' educational level (i.e., academic track or vocational track). Method: A total of 1617 (M = 13.41, SD = 0.89) students from nine different secondary schools in the Netherlands participated. The Stress Lessons had three aims: 1) to gain more knowledge about stress, 2) to learn how to recognize stress in one’s body and 3) to learn skills that can help cope with stress. The Stress Lessons were tested by employing a cluster randomized controlled trial with a pre-posttest design. Participants filled in self-reported questionnaires about knowledge about stress, internalizing problems, somatic complaints, school burnout, test anxiety, social phobia and perceived stress. Results: The results revealed that, after the Stress Lessons, knowledge about stress was higher in the experimental group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the results revealed a significant distribution between educational level and stress and emotional problems, indicating that students in the academic track are more likely to experience stress and emotional problems than vocational students. In particular, symptoms of school burnout, test anxiety and social phobia were experienced more in the academic track compared to the vocational track. On the other hand, stress from romantic relationships, peer pressure and financial pressure were experienced more in the vocational track compared to the academic track. Conclusion: The Stress Lessons revealed to be effective in teaching students about stress, which in turn might reduce stigma and stimulate help-seeking behavior among students. The results imply that schools should lower the demands put upon students, especially those in academic tracks. In addition, secondary schools should consider implementing the Stress Lessons into their curriculum to raise the understanding of stress among their students.","['School-related stress', 'academic pressure', 'emotional problems', 'school burnout', 'educational level', 'psychoeducation', 'mental health literacy', 'secondary school students']"

This thesis researches the latter at a municipal election in The Netherlands in 2022. A regression analysis has been conducted using the election results from The Hague and the composition of the different neighborhoods in terms of migration backgrounds. More specifically, it has been explored whether intraparty preference voting is influenced by the migration backgrounds of the voter on the one hand and the candidate on the other hand. The results of this research suggest that voters with a migration background are more likely to cast a preference vote for candidates that also have a migration background. This is shown by the effect that in neighborhoods that have relatively more residents with a migration background, more votes are casted on candidates with a migration background. This has implications for the way parties should compose their electoral lists and could raise the question whether the preferential threshold should be lowered to increase diversity in representative bodies.","['voorkeurstemmen', 'Den Haag', 'gemeenteraadsverkiezingen', 'verkiezingen', 'elections', 'municipality', 'preference vote', 'preferential vote', 'voting', 'open list', 'ethnical vote']"

Regime change is a threat to Russian domination of the region. Consequently, Russia bases its foreign policy on dissuading these states from democratizing. This paper looks at the effect of political reform on Russian foreign policy. Whereas previous research has focussed on examining the role of external actors, this paper argues that the direction of political reform plays a significant role using a case study of Armenia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The difference in political reform, more democratic or more autocratic, results in Russian assertive or cooperative behaviour respectively. Though this theorised relationship holds, dependency was observed to be a factor that plays a significant role in the effect of regime change on foreign policy. Armenia, a state that democratised, experienced limited direct aggression as a result of being deeply dependent on Russia. Conversely, Kazakhstan during periods of political crackdown did not grow long-term cooperative patterns as a result of being largely independent. Thereby showcasing that Russia is permissive to democratization at its borders so long as it retains significant influence.","['Russia, democratization, post-soviet region']"

Although previous research has established that due to Brexit the costs for logistics have increased enormously over the past years, previous research has been unable to establish the consequences of Brexit for the costs of road haulage. This is primarily because most of it was either speculative or non-specific (Long, 2022). The research for this thesis uses the expertise of traders and logistic experts to establish the increases in costs due to Brexit and its requirements as well as their significance as of January 1, 2020. The findings are that the increase in the costs is significant due to Brexit, and that increase in transaction costs affects the people of the United Kingdom and the European Union negatively in several ways. It also shows that the FTA which was negotiated post-Brexit is a dysfunctional international economic institution since it has not reduced transaction costs, even though that is one of the main targets of international institutions (Mattli, 1999; Guzman, 2013). As a result, Brexit also forms a break with the trend in the existing literature on economic institutions.","['Brexit, Trade, Logistics, Transaction Costs, European Union']"

As part of the BINCO study, participants filled out questionnaires about their symptom severity regarding depressive and manic mood, their actual and perceived stress, and their irritability. Correlational and mediational analyses (using PROCESSv4) did not show significant mediating effects of perceived stress and irritability. Only significant positive correlations were found between actual stress and manic mood, perceived stress and depressive mood, and perceived stress and irritability. Consequently, perceived stress and irritability do not seem to mediate the relationship between actual stress and depressive and manic mood in bipolar patients. The findings were not in line with Beck’s Cognitive Behavioral Model.

How has BASEL III mitigated systemic risks? Understanding the effectiveness of BASEL III,"Minero Latinovic, Victor Javier","['Giuseppe, M.', 'Sampson, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 demonstrated that banks have significant leverage in the global economy and could have massive repercussions if they were to collapse. To prevent another crisis, countries adopted the BASEL III agreement, which has the objective of implementing safeguards in banks and mitigating the possibility of systemic risks. However, a substantial amount of literature has emerged claiming that BASEL III does not enhance the stability of the global economy. Therefore, this research seeks to understand: how BASEL III has mitigated systemic risk? To understand the effectiveness of BASEL III, a Most Similiar System Design research was conducted comparing banks in the European Union and the United States. The banks selected for both areas were placed under severe adverse scenarios (stress tests) to identify if they comply with BASEL's III capital adequacy (total capital and leverage ratios). The research demonstrated that the banks in both areas have increased capital adequacy after implementing BASEL III. Nevertheless, the results show that banks are still exposed to systemic risks due to mismanagement and risk controls. BASEL III only places monetary safeguards; however, this thesis identified that banks mitigate systemic risk by placing strong corporate governance principles. This research showed that to maintain global financial stability and create strong safeguards both banks and regulators need to place safety measures of their own to prevent systemic failures.","['BASEL III', 'Systemic Risks', 'Too-big-to-fail', 'Financial Regulations']"

We compared the cognitive control processes of general performance (i.e., reaction time and error rate), distractibility (i.e., reaction time and error rate congruency effects) and posterror adjustments (i.e., post-error slowing, post-error accuracy) across two sessions of six blocks. Participants performed a flanker task while in an alternating (seated and standing) and a seated-only condition and self-reported their physical activity with the IPAQ. The results showed cognitive control improvements induced by acute physical activity, evident by faster general reaction times and decrements in general error rates and error rate congruency effects. Higher amounts of habitual physical activity caused an increase in general reaction time performance. The results suggests that physical activity plays a significant role in cognitive control performance. Regularly changing from a seated to standing posture can act as an intervention to improve cognitive control processes.","['Cognitive control, active workstations, posture, habitual physical activity, acute physical activity, Eriksen flanker task, IPAQ']"

"The Impact of Self-Esteem on Adolescents Social Feedback Learning, and the Association Between Fear of Negative Evaluation","Murathanoglu, Misra","['Saadat, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"People are motivated to learn from the social cues they receive from others to form healthy relationships and be socially accepted. Social feedback learning can explain how people learn if others accept or reject them based on previous feedback. This paper aims to investigate the underlying factors of social feedback learning. Self-esteem and negative evaluation fear, in particular, influence social feedback learning. Previous research has laid the groundwork for this. According to some researchers, low self-esteem increases reaction time in social evaluative tasks because of its effect on decision-making and prediction accuracy in people who receive negative feedback. Other studies propose that self-serving and negativity biases play an important role in how people get influenced by social rejection and their social expectations from others. Seventy adolescents' reaction times and pre-post task predictions regarding the Social Judgment Paradigm were obtained to analyze such associations. The RSES and BFNE are used to assess respondents' self-esteem and fear of negative evaluation (FNE). The results indicated no significant effect of self-esteem on reaction time. Adolescents with low self-esteem showed a significant difference in their pre-post task predictions in negative evaluation; however, this result was not exclusive to low self-esteem respondents. Lastly, FNE and self-esteem were found to have a significant negative correlation; people with high self-esteem indicated low fear of negative evaluation. The findings of this study contribute to the literature by showing the effect of self-esteem on social feedback learning in adolescents and the association between self-esteem and FNE.","[': social feedback learning, fear of negative evaluation, self-esteem, adolescents, social rejection']"

Previous research has shown that children develop less externalizing problem behavior when their fathers are more sensitive towards them and when their fathers are satisfied with their marital relationship. Including fathers in the current research is unique because of the limited availability of research about the role of fathers in children’s development. The data for this study is collected by home visits and questionnaires from one hundred fathers and their two oldest children aged between three and six years old. To be included in this study fathers needed to be born in the Netherlands and speaking the Dutch language fluently. The results revealed that fathers’ higher marital satisfaction is related to less externalizing problem behavior, but only for the second child. The marital satisfaction and sensitivity of the fathers were not related. The fathers’ sensitivity was also unrelated to the externalizing problem behavior of both children. There was no mediation of sensitivity between the marital satisfaction of fathers and the externalizing problem behavior of both children. It is important to improve such research and study the interaction of fathers with their children. Because more knowledge about the influence of fathers’ marital satisfaction on the interaction with the child could help to reveal more information about parental traits that fathers possess that could influence children’s overall development. We suggest that follow-up studies including fathers from different social classes and ethnicities could shed more light on the influence of fathers’ sensitivity and marital satisfaction on the development of externalizing problem behavior in children.","['Fathers', 'externalizing problem behavior', 'marital satisfaction', 'sensitivity']"

Results indicate that randomization preference is not associated with specific treatment preference, cancer worry, or tolerance of uncertainty. Findings do suggest that women with higher levels of anxiety were less willing to be randomized (OR = .92, p = .10). Further, the qualitative analysis shows women who agreed to randomization seem to be driven by altruistic motives, whereas women who declined randomization seem to be more concerned with autonomy. Finally, both groups expressed a preference for active surveillance. This thesis forms a basis of understanding why women are (not) willing to join the LORD, and suggest more research be done into other factors such as optimism, altruism, autonomy, and patient understanding, specifically in the DCIS population.","['DCIS', 'accrual', 'cancer worry', 'anxiety', 'tolerance of uncertainty', 'treatment preference']"
Placebo knowledge and expected effectivity in symptom reduction of placebo applications in pediatric health care and their association in pediatric health care professionals and parents,"Kraats, Hannah van de","['Middendorp, H. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Placebo applications could be a positive addition next to regular treatment in the pediatric health care. Previous studies have mainly focused on placebo applications as a replacement of regular treatment and focus on adults despite the promising results for using placebo effects in pediatric care. Pediatric health care professionals and parents’ knowledge and opinions about the use of placebo applications could be related to placebo use in pediatric healthcare. To examine differences in and associations between placebo knowledge and expected effectiveness of potential placebo applications between healthcare professions and parents, an online questionnaire was used in 150 pediatric health care professionals and 28 parents of children who have undergone a medical procedure or treatment in the past year. Professionals had more knowledge about placebo effects than parents (t(176 =3.146, p =.002), and a higher expected effectivity, (t(147)=3.59, p<.001) of placebo effects than parents. More knowledge about placebo effects was associated with higher expected effectivity in both groups, which did not significantly differ between the two groups (z=1.79, p=.073, r(127)=.18, p=.047 (professionals), r(18)=.57, p=.009 (parents). The current study showed that knowledge and opinions on placebo effects are lower in parents than healthcare professions but are related in both groups. Future research could examine whether educating pediatric healthcare professionals and parents on placebo effects in child healthcare leads to more favorable opinions about placebo applications in pediatric care, allowing a larger use of non-invasive optimization strategies within child healthcare.","['Placebo, application, pediatric health care, pediatric health care professionals, parents, knowledge, opinions']"
