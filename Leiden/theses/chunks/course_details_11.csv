The driving forces of providing aid: How ideas and party ideologies influence foreign aid policy preferences in donor countries,"Creutzburg, Rhea","['Tsagkroni, V.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Foreign aid policies vary greatly in their means and ends. Long-term development policies, aiming to promote development and welfare, distinguish from short-term humanitarian policies that respond to humanitarian emergency crises. Politicians seem to differ in their preferences, leading scholars to question how these preferences emerge. Existing literature has been focusing on theories of elite competition in explaining why states construct and implement certain policies. However, these theories seem to ignore the concept of political agency, and grant no primacy to the role of ideas and values. This thesis aims to fill this gap by asking how party ideologies influence foreign aid policy preferences. It employs the discursive legitimation model of Van Leeuwen (2008) to analyze Dutch parliamentary debates. Here, it is found that conservative values affect politicians to refer to authorization and rationalization when legitimizing their preferences, while liberal values work through to moral evaluation and story-telling strategies. This confirms that ideas and ideologies do matter for policy preferences.","['foreign aid', 'policies', 'donor countries', 'governments', 'ideas', 'party ideologies', 'discursive legitimation', 'the Netherlands']"

Een pyrronistische denkstijl en (het ontbreken van) angsten: Rekening houdend met cannabisgebruik,"Jansen, Sophie",['Dr. T.A. van den Berg'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Introduction: Philosophical Pyrrhonism states that when someone does not suspend judgment (SOJ) about non-evident matters, ataraxia automatically follows and is thus free of fears. Cannabis use should moderate this because it can influence divergent thinking. Methods: SOJ is measured with 10 self-developed statements (4 argumentative and 6 intuitive) and the GAD7 measures ataraxia. We expected that a high score on SOJ predicted a low score on GAD7. And we predict that more cannabis use leads to a lower SOJ score. The N=207, with 19 missing. The average participant was 21,526 years old and did not use cannabis (49.6%). Of these, 19% were men and 70.4% were women (1.12% falls under other). Results: EFA showed that SOJ loads on 4 components. In the simple regression analysis, the normal distribution assumption was not met, so we analyzed the Adjusted Rsquare. There was no significant effect (R2Adj = .011, p = .071, df: 205). The intuitive questions did have a significant effect (R2Adj = .032, p = .006, df: 205). The multiple regression analysis with the moderator was not significant (R2Adj = .007, p = .117, df: 204). Discussion: SOJ does not significantly predict ataraxia. There is a small effect between SOJ-intuitive and the GAD7. But this effect is most likely due to 4 confounding variables in the SOJ questionnaire (see EFA) and a spread of anxiety due to time pressure. Cannabis use has no influence on this effect. Future research is needed to clarify confounding variables and biases.","['Pyrronisme', '(ontbreken van) angsten', 'cannabisgebruik', 'ataraxie', 'SOJ']"
Contagious Yawning and Mimicry: A Relation?,"Omeragic, Masha","['Diana, F.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"One of the most contagious behaviors among humans is contagious yawning (CY). There is an ongoing debate in the current literature about its' functions and underlying mechanisms. Two perspectives prevail, namely the physiological stance, suggesting that CY is merely a homeostatic response. The social stance suggests a solid relation to the social environment, where individual characteristics, such as empathy and theory of mind, play a role in the yawning contagion. To investigate this, we consider the relation between CY and the primary innate mechanism of imitation, (facial) mimicry. Mimicry seems to be indirectly related to CY via empathy. We hypothesize that individuals who mimic more have higher rates of yawning contagion. To test this, forty-one healthy participants partook in a psychophysiological experiment. We measured the physiological activity of facial muscles (with electromyography, EMG), heart rate, skin conductance, and pupil dilation (with an eye-tracker) during computer tasks. We also control for the potential effects of hours of sleep, energy levels and order of condition. After conducting a generalized linear mixed model in R, we did not find a significant effect of facial mimicry on CY. Empathy, theory of mind, sleep and energy levels did not influence CY. However, we found a significance in the order of condition, supporting physiological arousal theories. We suggest additional research by considering other types of mimicry (pupil). We also provide novel detection criteria of CY and the visual representations of EMG activity of the Zygomaticus Major and Corrugator Supercilli during CY. These are crucial for future research, as they have not been previously identified.","['contagious yawning', 'facial mimicry', 'arousal hypothesis', 'empathy', 'theory of mind']"
The influence of age and sleep on visuo spatial working memory.,"Es, Sven van","['Band, G.P.H.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Our visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM), a cognitive component responsible for wayfinding and arithmetical challenges, is negatively related to aging according to prior studies. At the same time, aging is related to a decrease in sleep quality. However, the triangular relation of these three variables is unknown. This current research aims to identify the direct relation between VSWM and age and sleep. Additionally, we tested if the relation between VSWM and age can indirectly be explained by sleep duration and sleep variability. Finally, the explorative part of the study looked at the effect that sleep duration the night before testing has on VSWM performance. Unique about this study is the use of tappigraphy as a measure for sleep. Tappigraphy is a naturalistic way of deriving data from people’s smartphone touches, allowing for the calculation of sleep duration and variability. The study included 151 participants, 99 for the explorative analysis, who installed an app on their smartphone (tappigraphy measure) and additionally had to complete a VSWM performance task (Corsiblock task). The analysis confirmed the negative relation between age and VSWM, but did not find a relation between sleep duration, variability and sleep the night before testing and VSWM. Additionally, no mediating effect of sleep on the relation between age and VSWM was found. In conclusion, while age and VSWM seemed related the sleep variables of current study did not show any relation to VSWM. This could be partially be explained by the limitations of this study. Future research should focus on constructs of sleep that do not deviate much from current literature. Plus, future research should aim to validate tappigraphy for an older population.","['visuo-spatial working memory', 'VSWM', 'age', 'sleep duration', 'sleep variability', 'tappigraphy']"
Angst Verminderen Door Het Uitstellen Van Oordelen: Het effect van Gender op de relatie tussen Oordelen en het ervaren van Angst.,"Dam, Margot van",['Thor van den Berg'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Sinds het einde van de vierde eeuw voor Christus zoeken filosofen naar rust in de geest. Een van deze filosofen was Pyrrho van Elis. Pyrrho zou met zijn filosofische benadering op gebeurtenissen rust bereiken. Mensen met overmatige angstklachten ervaren onrust. Zij beredeneren uitkomsten op gebeurtenissen negatiever en nemen positieve uitkomsten minder in overweging. Het is bekend dat vrouwen gevoeliger zijn voor angst. Wellicht heeft gender ook invloed op de relatie tussen het oordelen en de mate van ervaren van angst. In deze studie is onderzoek gedaan naar de relatie tussen het uitstellen van oordeel (suspension of judgement; SOJ) en angst en het moderatie effect van gender. Er is online een vragenlijst afgenomen. Een exploratory factor analysis is uitgevoerd op het SOJ-meetinstrument. Een lineaire en multipele regressieanalyses zijn uitgevoerd op totaalscores van SOJ en angst met gender als moderatie effect. De exploratory factor analysis gaf aan dat er een relatie is tussen de variabelen en dat er 4 verschillende onderliggende factoren zijn. De relaties tussen de variabelen zijn sterker wanneer alleen de intuïtieve vragen, vragen met tijdsdruk maar zonder argumentatie, worden meegenomen. Uit de regressieanalyse kwam een niet significant resultaat. Er is geen relatie tussen SOJ en de mate angst, wel is er een kleine relatie tussen de intuïtieve vragen van SOJ en angst gevonden. Uit de multipele regressieanalyse kwam naar verwachting een significant resultaat. Gender bleek de relatie tussen SOJ en angst te versterken. De invloed van SOJ op angst groter bij vrouwen.","['Pyrrhonisme', 'uitstel', 'oordelen', 'angst', 'denkwijze', 'effect van gender', 'therapie']"
Uitstel van Oordeel als Angst Therapie: en de mogelijke effecten van slaaptekort,"Schrofer, Isaac",['T. A. van den Berg'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Klinische angst komt helaas veel voor. De effectiviteit van de hedendaagse angstbehandelingen voldoet niet. Cognitieve Gedragstherapie is bij minder dan de helft effectief. Er is dus belang bij een alternatieve therapie om angst te behandelen. Volgens de filosoof Pyrrho (360 v. Chr.) neemt angst af door niet te oordelen. In dit correlationele onderzoek wordt nagegaan of er een relatie bestaat tussen het uitstellen van oordelen (SOJ) en de mate van angst. Hierbij wordt gekeken of slaapgedrag invloed heeft op deze relatie. 206 Respondenten werden op 10 stellingen gemeten in hoeverre zij het ermee eens of oneens waren. Ook werd een veelgebruikte angstvragenlijst afgelegd, de GAD-7. Er bleek geen significante relatie te bestaan tussen de mate van het uitstellen van oordelen en de mate van Angst. Er bleek wel een significante relatie te bestaan tussen oordelen onder tijdsdruk en mate van angst. Ook oordeelden mensen significant meer op de stellingen met tijdslimiet. Slaap bleek op zichzelf invloed te hebben op mate van angst, maar niet op de relatie tussen SOJ en angst. Om te kunnen vaststellen of een SOJ-behandeling echt zal aanslaan is experimenteel vervolgonderzoek nodig, met een voor en na meting. Omdat in de hedendaagse maatschappij mensen gedwongen zijn om onder continue tijdsdruk besluiten maken, is het bij vervolgonderzoek naar SOJ van belang om rekening te houden met de tijdsdruk component.","['Pyrrhonisme', 'Uitstel van Oordeel', 'Angst', 'Alternatieve Angst Behandeling', 'Effect van slapeloosheid', 'Intuïtie']"

An analysis of psychological safety in relation to self-determination theory.,"Nieuwelink, Bas","['Groeneweg, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examines the relationship between the self-determination theory and perceived psychological safety, respectively popularized by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan; and Amy Edmondson. Whereas psychological safety has been found to positively contribute to team performance, the self-determination theory is used to assess individual needs and fulfilments, and can be a contributor to individual performance. The aim of this potential relationship is to enable the use and combination of individual-, and team-based strategies more effectively in order to enhance overall performance in organizations. I hypothesized that a significant positive correlation exists between self-determination theory factors and perceived psychological safety, and that the former could be used to predict the latter. The data gathered in an international online survey among people working in the healthcare sector supports that there is a significant positive correlation between the levels of the self-determination theory’s autonomy component and perceived psychological safety. However, when setting up a regression model, I found that the autonomy component of self-determination theory is the only significant predictor for the level of perceived psychological safety. This model explains five percent of the variance in the level of perceived psychological safety, and is thus practically of no use. Secondly, hypothesized that there are no gender-based differences in levels of self-determination theory and perceived psychological safety. In the analysis I found that there are generally no gender- based differences in either of the variables, except for the competence component of self- determination theory. This potentially signifies that men and women prioritize their psychological needs differently, but more research is needed to confirm this. In conclusion, based on the evidence gathered in this study, I cannot conclude that the relationship between self-determination theory and psychological safety can be used in a meaningful way to increase overall performance in the healthcare sector, or other organizations for that matter.","['Psychological safety', 'healthcare', 'self-determination theory']"
Multinomial Restricted Unfolding for Multivariate Binary Data,"Machado Ladeira, Mariana Rita","['Rooij, M. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Multivariate binary data with multiple binary response variables arise in many areas of research, including biology, psychology, medicine, dentistry, and other empirical sciences. In such data, the effect of a predictor on the response variable and the effect of a predictor on the association structure between the response variables is of interest. Multinomial Restricted Unfolding (MRU) is a probabilistic multidimensional unfolding model that can be used to analyse multicategory response variables in the presence of predictors. In this thesis, we investigated an extension of the MRU model to analyse multivariate binary data focusing on how diagnoses of depressive and anxiety disorders are influenced by personality traits and how the association between two disorders is affected by these personality traits. We compared the results using usual and squared Euclidean distances for the main effects and associations MRU models. We have demonstrated that MRU models using squared and usual Euclidean distances can be used to analyse multivariate binary data, representing well the changes in log odds and the changes in log odds ratio. Our results indicated that the MRU models using squared Euclidean distances are more straightforward and easier to be interpreted than those using usual Euclidean distance. However, despite the more complicated interpretation, the model using the usual Euclidean distance is more flexible, which might lead to a better model fit. Regarding the change in log odds of having GAD, the main effects model results indicated a constant change in slope between different pairs of categories that represent GAD. For the associations model, the parallel lines indicate that the change in the slope was constant within a pair of categories that represents GAD but not the same for different pairs of categories. When usual Euclidean distances were used, the change in slope was not constant for both main effects and associations models. Regarding the interpretation rules to express the change in the log odds ratio, the main effects model showed that the association structure does not dependent on the value of the predictor variable. However, for the associations model, the log odds ratio is dependent on the value of the predictor variable, in which a constant change in slope is shown. When using usual Euclidean distances to explore the association structure between two response variables, the change in slope was not constant for both models.","['Multinomial Unfolding', 'Multivariate data']"
Spatial Navigation in Virtual Environments: the Role of Presence and Subjective Ability in Navigation Performance,"Keaveney, Grace","['Ham, C.J.M. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Spatial cognition deficits can be caused by various factors including aging, neurodegenerative disease, stroke, or TBI, and have thus far received inadequate attention in the literature. This study aims to further our understanding of spatial cognition in order to progress the field and assist in the assessment and diagnostics of associated deficits in affected populations. Research has outlined the practicality of VR in assessing cognitive complaints. VR can provide ecological validity to navigation assessments and can be used alongside neuropsychological tools to further understand cognitive deficits. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the relationships of presence and subjective navigation ability with objective navigation performance in VR, and to further examine the effect of gender on navigation performance. The van der Ham et al. (2020) online task battery was used to assess spatial navigation ability by requiring participants to complete five tasks testing landmark, location and path knowledge. The experiment was conducted online on a computer or phone screen. Sense of presence in the virtual environment and subjective navigation ability were measured using the IPQ (Schubert, Friedmann, and Regenbrecht, 2001) and the WQ (Claessen et al., 2016). A test-retest design was employed to investigate the gender differences in performance over time. The results of this study indicate that presence is not a significant predictor of navigation performance in the VR task. However, subjective navigation ability did predict objective navigation performance. Additionally, gender differences were found in performance over time, with males consistently performing better than females. These findings suggest a need to further investigate the different navigation mechanisms used by males and females, and the effect that stereotypical beliefs have on performance. In conclusion, this study determined that assessment of navigation abilities is not affected by experienced presence, and thus can be made accessible in an online format. The findings for gender differences and the relationship between subjective navigation ability and objective navigation performance also have the potential to contribute evidence-based improvements in assessments, diagnostics and rehabilitation interventions. Further research is required to investigate the effect of different levels of immersion on sense of presence and performance as this could affect VR assessment of navigation.","['spatial cognition', 'navigation', 'virtual reality', 'presence']"

Just one crisis? How the strive for a common asylum system shed light on inconsistencies,"Wright, Antonia Marie","['Kinacioglu, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Most nations are a mix of various ethnicities and backgrounds, especially prevalent within the European Union. With the emphasis that is currently based on nationality and ‘belonging’, the European Migrant Crisis, brought these sentiments to the forefront. With the sudden rise in asylum applications, the shock was reverberated throughout the continent. Since its creation, the EU and its member states have always been a goal destination for those seeking asylum. When member states aim to join the union, they must adhere to certain regulations with regards to various concepts, such as the right to asylum. As each nation had its own asylum system that was not unified under supranational regulations, the communication between the nations were blocked. With the realisation that a unified asylum system had to be created, the EU set out to complete this. But with the unification of asylum processes and regulations, the member states had to change their national asylum systems in accordance with EU regulation as well. But unifying more than 20 asylum systems proved difficult. As an emphasis is primarily based on the EU perspective, this research will be conducted from a member state perspective. This an attempt will be made to further identify and consequently understand the causes of variation within the member states. Instead of focusing on the EU aspect of this, an emphasis will be made in understand the variation from a bottom-up aspect, essentially from the view of the case studies.",
Summarizing the outcomes of a multiverse analysis,"Kuipers, Charlotte","['Heyman, T.D.P.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The multiverse analysis can be used as a way of assessing the influence of different analysis choices that could reasonably be made by researchers, instead of only presenting the result of one research ‘path’ as is often done in studies. While the multiverse analysis increases transparency about the results, it is still unclear how researchers can best summarize the results of this analysis more formally. Moreover, as far as we are aware, no previous studies have examined how the multiverse analysis performs under different research conditions. In this study, we simulated data under different research conditions. In addition, we built a generic multiverse analysis that was used to analyze this data. Two methods were used to summarize the results of this analysis, namely the mean p-value and the harmonic mean p-value (HMP). The results of this study showed that the mean p-value may be the preferred summarization method, as it provides a more conservative estimate of the different paths in the multiverse and has less false-positive results than the HMP in a situation where data was simulated under the null hypothesis. In addition, our study shows that the summarization methods of our multiverse analysis are robust against variations regarding the number of variables that are part of the analysis, the amount of missing data in a dataset and changes in the correlation between variables. However, the summarization methods in our multiverse were not robust against underpowered data. Only if the different research paths in our multiverse analysis had adequate power, the HMP was generally able to find a significant result in at least 90% of cases. However, future research is needed to see if these results can be replicated, since the definition of a generic multiverse analysis may differ depending on the research field.","['multiverse analysis', 'mean p-value', 'harmonic mean p-value']"

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the CBM maze and reading comprehension. To examine this relationship the scores between the CBM standard maze (a maze that follows the standard rules) and the scrambled maze (a maze with distorted coherence) were compared. Furthermore, the effects of standards of coherence and genre on the difference in scores between the CBM standard maze and scrambled maze were examined. Expected was that the scores on CBM maze would reflect reading comprehension. A group of 40 Dutch bachelor-students participated in the study. The data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. The repeated measures ANOVA consisted of two within factors (type maze: CBM standard maze vs scrambled maze and genre: expository vs narrative) and one between factor (standards of coherence: high vs low). The results show a significant difference in scores between the CBM standard maze and the scrambled maze F(1, 38) = 103,349; p = < .001, η2 = .731 with scores on the CBM standard maze being higher than the scores on the scrambled maze, suggesting that scores on the CBM standard maze reflect text-level reading comprehension. No influence of standards of coherence, F(1, 38) = ,340; p = ,563, or genre, F(1, 38) = ,340; p = ,563, was found on the difference in scores between the CBM standard maze and the scrambled maze.

It was hypothesised that brand morality is a stronger predictor of consumer purchase intention than brand competence. Secondly, it was predicted that for low-involving products, the effect of brand morality on consumer purchase intention is stronger than the effect of brand competence, whereas for high-involving products, the opposite was expected. An experiment (N = 216) was conducted to test these predictions. The results show that brand morality is a stronger predictor of consumer purchase intention than brand competence, irrespective of product involvement. The findings highlight the importance of morality in brand perception, indicating that companies of both low- and high-involving products should emphasise their brand’s moral characteristics to increase consumer purchase intention.","['brand personality', 'brand morality', 'brand competence', 'consumer purchase intention', 'product involvement']"

Research shows that prejudice and discrimination have many negative effects on both individuals and society. In order to avoid these negative effects, it is important to investigate the underlying mechanisms of prejudice and discrimination. According to existing literature, social categorization is a factor associated with the emergence of discrimination and prejudice. Social categorization in young children is influenced by their environment, for example by (ethnic) socialization of parents. The present study examined whether there was a difference between ethnic socialization in the majority group and the minority group. This was also examined for social categorization based on ethnicity for these two groups. In addition, it was examined whether there was a relationship between ethnic socialization of the mother and social categorization based on the ethnicity of the child. Finally, it was examined whether the ethnicity of the child was a moderator for the relationship between ethnic socialization and social categorization based on ethnicity. Mother's ethnic socialization was measured by a picture book task. Social categorization was measured by the child's segregation preference through a grouping task. The study was conducted in mother-child pairs from the majority group (White-Dutch) and the minority group (Turkish-Dutch and Afro-Dutch). Two independent t-tests showed that there were no differences. No significant difference in ethnic socialization between the majority and minority groups was found. Also, no significant difference in social categorization based on ethnicity was found between the majority and minority groups. A simple regression showed that there was no significant relationship between ethnic socialization and social categorization based on ethnicity. Finally, no significant moderation effect of ethnicity was found. For further research it is advised to extend the measurement method for ethnic socialization and social categorization, so that more detailed measurements can be done.","['ethnic socialization', 'social categorization', 'ethnicity', 'majority group', 'minority group', 'mother', 'child']"

About one percent of children do not feel at home in their birth genders to varying degrees and in different ways. What are the effects of parental emotions and parental gender stereotype concerning the parents and the social transitioning that children are undergoing to conform to their preferred gender? The current research investigated to what extent children’s social transition status mediates the relationship between the psychosocial functioning of children and their parents’ emotional response to gender(variance) and gender stereotyping. The results showed that children undergoing a complete social transition differ significantly from children undergoing an incomplete social transition, but only in terms of their parents’ emotional response to gender(variance). Second, the research considered whether the psychosocial functioning of children can be predicted based upon their parents’ emotional response toward gender(variance) and their gender stereotyping. The study also investigated whether children’s social transition status mediates a possible correlation. The results showed that the parents’ gender stereotyping rather than the children’s social transition status determines the psychosocial functioning of transitioning children. To support these children as much as possible in their search for identity, it is important that research examine the short- and long-term factors that influence psychosocial functioning in the development of children. It is especially important to follow children longer to investigate whether the various variables change over time and, if so, how they change.","['Social transition', 'emotions towards gender(variance)', 'gender stereotyping', 'psychological functioning and gender(variance)']"
Hoe kunnen leerkrachten concreet handelen om bij te dragen aan de intrinsieke motivatie van basisschoolleerlingen,"Langeveld, Marla",['Eddie Dennessen'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Motivation within the educational system has been a subject with a wide range of attention for many years. Still, there are no clear guidelines teachers can use to contribute to the intrinsic motivation of their students. The goal of this literature review was to provide concrete guidelines that teachers can use to contribute to the intrinsic motivation of their primary school students. This was done firstly by identifying concrete actions that teachers can use to contribute to the intrinsic motivation of their students, according to the selfdetermination theory. Secondly literature research focused on how big the effect sizes matching with these concrete actions were. A systematic search yielded five studies that were eligible. However there were studies included in the study that had a different student population than primary school students, which were highschool- and university students. The results indicated that there were no huge differences in the outcomes of the studies with different student populations. Results of the concrete actions teachers can use to contribute to their students' intrinsic motivation can be categorised by the basic needs of the selfdetermination theory. When it comes to autonomy, this research indicates that teachers should give their students valuable choices during their learning process. The bond or relationship can be improved by showing affection, respect and by being understanding. The research also indicates that teachers should try to match teaching with the personal interest of the students. When it comes to competence, research indicates that teachers should offer activities to their students that match their current competence. Communication, expectations and positive feedback are also key, when it comes to competence, according to the literature research.","['Intrinsieke motivatie', 'leerkracht', 'basisonderwijs', 'zelfdeterminatietheorie']"

Problematic internet use, problematic use of social media and problematic gaming behaviour are included as types of digital problem behaviour. The main research question is: How is alexithymia related to problematic use of internet, social media and videogames? To examine the relationship, a systematic research was conducted. After having executed the research 266 articles were selected. However, after excluding all of the identical articles only 167 were left. Out of the 167 studied, 23 studies were included. Studies were excluded if they were not labelled as empirical, written in another language than English or Dutch; and lastly, if they had a clinical sample besides alexithymia. The selected studies were double coded on the methodological features: chosen study design, sample size, and used research instruments. Combining all 23 studies a total of 41.274 participants was established. The median of all these studies was 429 participants. From the 23 studies, 14 were about problematic internet use, 3 about problematic use of social media and 6 about problematic gaming behaviour. 20 of the 23 studies found a positive significant relationship between alexithymia and problematic internet use, problematic use of social media and problematic gaming behaviour. However, the reliability of the results is questionable. Due to the fact that the cross-sectional design and sample size of all studies do not allow to draw strong conclusions. Furthermore, the use of only self-report does not contribute to the quality of the studies. Follow-up research of better quality will be necessary to draw valid conclusions about the relationship between alexithymia and digital problem behaviour.","['Alexithymie', 'digital problem behavior', 'internet', 'social media', 'videogames']"
The Effect of Parental Verbal Threat Information on Children’s Attention to Strangers: The Role of Child Social Anxiety,"Pater, Annemieke de","['Evin Aktar, PhD']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Parental verbal threat information is considered to play an important role in the development of childhood anxiety. Attentional biases induced by verbal threat information may increase the risk of developing social anxiety disorder. This study aims to investigate the effect of parental verbal threat information about strangers on children’s attention to these strangers. In addition, we explored the potential moderating role of child social anxiety. Method: The sample consisted of 75 9-to-14-year-old children (M= 11.51 years; 39 girls) and their primary caregivers from the community. The children filled in a questionnaire to measure their social anxiety levels. In the lab, the children had to give two speeches about shyness and confidence in front of two different strangers. Before the social performance, the caregiver verbally communicated threat or safety information about the two strangers. The duration of the looks measured the child’s attention to each stranger during the social performance. Results: The parental verbal information did not influence the child’s attention to the stranger during the social performance. No significant moderation of this effect by the child’s social anxiety was observed. Conclusions: Parental verbal threat information about strangers does not influence children’s attention to these strangers. In addition, child social anxiety does not affect the effect of parental verbal information on children’s attention to strangers.","['verbal information pathway', 'parents', 'attention', 'child social anxiety', 'strangers']"

Little tyrants: Explaining early physical aggression through stress response profiles,"Vellekoop, Elja E.J.","['Huijbregts, S.C.J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Developmental Psychopathology in Education and Child Studies (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Individual differences in behavior are best explained through a multisystem approach by integrating neurobiological, neurocognitive, and social environmental factors. This longitudinal study examined whether early physical aggression could be predicted by stress regulation, inhibitory control, risk background, and sex. In addition, this study is among the first to investigate whether the four stress response patterns of the Adaptive Calibration Model (Del Giudice et al., 2011) could be generalized to 12-month-old children by studying: autonomic nervous system (ANS), sympathetic nervous system (SNS), parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. ANS was indexed by heart rate, SNS by salivary alpha-amylase and pre-ejection period, PNS by respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and HPA axis by salivary cortisol. The sample consisted of 214 mother-child dyads (116 boys) with an equal number of high- and low-risk backgrounds. Physical aggression was assessed through maternal reports at 12, 20, and 30 months of age. At 12 months, children performed an inhibitory control task and the fear task (robot paradigm) was used to measure baseline, response, and recovery levels of the stress systems. Latent profile analysis revealed three profiles: (1) ANS Responders, (2) Moderate Arousal, and (3) Hormonal Responders. No significant differences were found between the profiles with regard to inhibitory control, average age of mother and child, number of boys and girls, and number of high- and low-risk children. Results showed that higher physical aggression scores were associated at 12 months with ANS Responders and lower inhibitory control, at 20 months with Hormonal Responders, boys and high-risk, and at 30 months with boys and high-risk. In addition, an interaction effect was found at 20 months: higher inhibitory control in girls was associated with lower physical aggression scores, but not in the Hormonal Responders. The discussion highlights the importance of using a multisystem approach to explain individual differences in early physical aggression.","['adaptive calibration model', 'autonomic nervous system', 'hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis', 'latent profile analysis', 'physical aggression', 'stress response profiles']"

Previous research indicates that potential impacts may include a feeling of ostracism or an adjustment of perceived social norms. This study explored how participants would react in a dictator game wherein they are given less money than their peers, in circumstances where the peers do or do not try to help, measured by their retaliation against the perpetrator, their psychological needs evaluation and ratings of fairness and justifiedness. No significant differences were found between the two conditions. However, as some research previously suggested, there are differences in coping strategies and responses to mistreatment between individuals. This study found that retaliators also had poorer psychological needs scores for control and self-esteem, rating the perpetrator’s behaviour as unjustified whilst their own vengeful retaliation was, according to them, justified. Future avenues for research are explored.","['dictator game', 'retaliation', 'ostracism', 'bystander effect', 'social norms', 'conformity', 'influence', 'psychological needs', 'revenge', 'victimisation', 'victim', 'victimhood', 'economic', 'financial mistreatment', 'unfair', 'unjustified', 'equality', 'bystander intervention']"
Self-Awareness Interventions for Children: What is Their Effectiveness and the Role of Cultural Background? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Ramscheid, Nicole","['Tona, K.-D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Social-emotional skills are pivotal for children’s intra- and interpersonal well-being. Social-emotional learning (SEL) interventions have been shown to improve these skills, with self-awareness (SA) being the most influential intervention component. However, these interventions apply varying conceptualizations and operationalizations of SA. Therefore, the defining characteristics of SA interventions and their effect on children’s well-being are unknown. Identifying these could help educators, policy makers and researchers to optimise content and accessibility of SA intervention to the benefit of children’s mental health. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to analyse the characteristics and effectiveness of currently available interventions targeting SA in children, and to examine children’s cultural background as potential moderator. Method: Eight electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, EMCARE, ERIC, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science and Academic Search Premier) were searched for intervention studies investigating SA interventions in September 2019. Children’s SA was the primary outcome of interest, positive and negative mental health were the secondary. Of 7050 identified studies, 42 were included in the systematic review and 29 in the meta-analysis. Results: It was found that SA interventions had a small to moderate effect on children’s SA (g = 0.31 (0.05), 95% CI [0.21, 0.40], p < .001). Furthermore, they had a positive effect on children’s mental health. Cultural background did not significantly moderate SA intervention effectiveness. There was no evidence for publication bias. Conclusion: Overall, interventions targeting SA can positively influence the level of SA and mental health in children irrespective of their cultural backgrounds.","['self-awareness', 'self-concept', 'social-emotional learning', 'children', 'interventions', 'effectiveness', 'cultural background', 'ethnicity', 'systematic review', 'meta-analysis']"

This study investigated whether people would be motivated to experience ideology-congruent and -incongruent emotions, if they believed these would reinforce their (left or right) ideology. A repeated-measures design showed that across ideologies, people were more motivated to experience fear when they believed it was ideology-reinforcing than when they had no such belief. Contrary to the hypothesis, for hope, the data suggested motivation to be high regardless of people’s beliefs about its usefulness for their ideology. This study also investigated potential differences between leftists and rightists in their motivation to experience ideology congruent and incongruent emotions. Whilst the data suggested rightists to be generally more motivated to experience both hope and fear, these results had to be disregarded, due to a great gender and age difference between the samples of the leftist and rightist supporters, which influenced the results. The significance and implications of the current findings are discussed.","['Emotion', 'Hope', 'Fear', 'Ideology', 'Emotion Regulation']"

The main goal of this study is to investigate whether there is an association between using a certain type of antipsychotic medication and the amount of exercising in people with a psychotic disorder. First, this study examines whether people with a psychotic disorder that use atypical antipsychotic medication exercise less compared to those that use typical antipsychotic medication. Second, whether people with a psychotic disorder that use clozapine and olanzapine exercise less compared to those that use another type of antipsychotic medication. The data used originates from a longitudinal cohort study named GROUP, a total of 523 people with a psychotic disorder who participated are used in this study. From these 523 participants, a number of 69 used typical antipsychotic medication and 454 participants used atypical antipsychotic medication. In addition, a total of 241 participants from these 523 participants used clozapine or olanzapine, and 282 participants used other antipsychotics. Further, t-tests are used in the analysis to answer the research questions. The results show there is no significant difference in both groups with regards to the two hypotheses. This implies there is no association between using a certain type of antipsychotic medication and the amount of exercising in people with a psychotic disorder.","['exercise, antipsychotic medication, people with psychotic disorders, weight gain, and metabolic disturbances']"

De relatie tussen gevoel van eigenwaarde en externaliserend probleemgedrag bij kinderen met een verhoogd risico op crimineel probleemgedrag,"Es, Lisa van der",['Rachel de Jong'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The Preventive Intervention Trajectory (Preventief Interventie Team; PIT) is a project which intervenes preventively in children who have a risk of future criminal behavior. Interventions focus on reducing externalizing problem behavior in these children. It is important to know which factors have an influence on the effectivity of the PIT. Current research focused on the association between self-worth and externalizing problems. Previous research is inconsistent, which suggests there is a possibility that the association between self-worth and externalizing problems is a quadratic association. Current research examined the possibility that children with average self-worth would have less externalizing problems at timepoint one than children with high and low self-worth. Children with low, average and high self-worth were compared on (reduction of) externalizing problems before treatment, on the short term (six months), and on the long term (twelve months). Results showed that there is was no significant linear association between self-worth and externalizing problems before treatment, which supports the suggestion that there might be a quadratic association. However, ANOVA-analysis revealed that there was also no significant quadratic or linear relation. Externalizing problems in children reduced significantly on the short and long term. However, no significant linear or quadratic relation between self-worth and the reduction in externalizing problems on the short and long term was found, indicating that there is no association between self-worth and (the reduction of) externalizing problems. Future research should include a larger sample to verify the current findings.","['Preventie', 'eigenwaarde', 'zelfwaardering', 'zelfbeeld', 'probleemgedrag', 'externaliserend probleemgedrag']"
Communication Considerations for Remote Contact with Cancer Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Potential Harmful Situations,"Wortman, Christy-Anne","['Van Vliet, L. M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Communication is important, especially in cancer care. Good communication can positively influence patient outcomes, whereas poor communication can cause harm. Due to COVID- 19 physical contact decreased leading to remote communication. In addition, general health care was downscaled, resulting in patients potentially receiving limited information about (treatment) changes. Currently, we do not know whether these changes are considered harmful and whether that depends on certain characteristics. Objective: This study aims to determine to which extent communication themes and communication situations within these two themes, are deemed harmful and by whom during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the relationship between patients’ age, gender, education and information need, and the changed communication (remote consultations and limited information about (treatment) changes) and specific communication situations. Methods: An online survey study was conducted based on a scoping review and input from researchers, clinicians, and patient representatives. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older, had advanced (incurable) cancer and had sufficient command of the Dutch language. Participants were presented with six potentially harmful communication situations (grouped under the themes remote consultations and limited information about (treatment) changes) which they assessed as harmful or not (yes/no). The background characteristics were dichotomised, and the relationships were measured using (logistic) regression analyses. Results: The sample existed of 47 participants, aged between 44-81. Most participants (57%–87%) perceived the communication situations as harmful. The relationships between age, gender, education, and information need and remote consultations, limited information about (treatment) changes and specific communication situations were all non-significant (p > .01). The relationship between education and not checking if the discussed information is remembered was marginally significant, c2(1, N = 46) = 6.21, p = .013 and recorded an odds ratio of 7.29 (95% CI: 1.31 – 40.54). Conclusions: As we suspect telehealth to increase, we suggest creating specific guidelines for remote contact using harmful communication examples and helpful alternatives. Furthermore, we advise physicians to provide explanations about treatment changes and as to why patients are not (or less) involved in decision-making when information provision is limited. Larger and more representative research is needed to replicate and substantiate our findings.","['Cancer', 'COVID-19', 'Communication', 'Remote Communication']"
Quantification of Replication Value in Social Psychology: A Comparative Study on Different Quantifications of the Value of Replicating Findings in Social Psychology,"Beekhuizen, Tobias van","[""Veer, A. van' t""]",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"There is a need for replication studies in psychology, yet resources are scarce. Study selection strategies are required that can guide researchers in which studies to prioritise for replication. The goal of this paper was to examine potential selection strategies and to identify possible issues with these strategies. Therefore a quantitative method for Replication Value (RV), inspired by Isager (2019), was proposed. RV determines the relative importance of replicating a study and was defined as impact over uncertainty. The studies in this paper formulated and compared different operationalizations of RV. Web of Science (WoS) was used to extract relevant data on a random sample of papers from WoS’s social psychology category. The first study examined a RV formula using minimal information, with yearly citations as a measure for impact and sample size as a measure for uncertainty. Study 1 also introduced Statcheck as a method to examine potential relations between RV-ranking and erroneous reporting. Study 2 elaborated on study 1, combining p-values with sample size as a measure for uncertainty. As part of this study, p-curve analysis was conducted to find relations between evidential value and paper ranking. Study 3 elaborated further, adding Altmetric score, a measure for societal influence of a paper, as a measure for impact. For all studies, similarity between RV-rankings was examined using Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO). Results tentatively indicate that sample size and citations are measures that can be useful when creating RV-formulas. Adding p-values to the RV-equation wasn’t beneficial, because it hardly changed the ranking of higher ranking papers. The addition of Altmetric score did change the RV-ranking and might be of interest to researchers interested in emphasising societal impact. Overall, this paper lays a groundwork for future RV research, mainly by exploring possible metrics involved in RV equations, but also by pointing out potential issues when using RV equations.",['Replication Social Psychology']
The anticommons dilemma: the effects of externalities awareness and social value orientation,"Witte, Sanne","['Kwaadsteniet, E.W. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The social dilemma called the anticommons dilemma represents a context in which a scarce resource has multiple owners who can exclude one another from harvesting from that resource. Not much attention has been paid to factors that lead to non-cooperative decisions in this context. Consequently, the present study investigates how the salience of collective consequences (externalities awareness) influences (non-)cooperative choice behavior in people differing in social value orientations (SVO). After SVO was measured and one of the two externalities awareness conditions was presented, the participants (N = 168) had to indicate a minimum price to give a co-owner access to the resource (WTA) in a modified anticommons paradigm. It was expected that when externalities were made salient individuals would display higher levels of cooperation, by indicating lower WTA’s, compared to when externalities were not made salient. Moreover, it was expected that when externalities were not made salient prosocials would display higher levels of cooperation than proselfs, whereas when externalities were made salient this difference would be smaller. Although the effect of externalities awareness and the interaction effect of this factor with SVO was non-significant, exploratory analyses indicated severe underuse of the common resource. The limitations of this study and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

Methods: This study was of a cross-sectional, analytical and retrospective design using baseline data of an intervention study. Participants with rheumatoid arthritis were recruited and a total of 30 participants (7 males (23%) and 23 females (77%)) between the ages of 26 and 74 years (M=55.2 and SD=10.74) were analysed in this study. The measures of the study included peak melatonin levels, the IRGL (pain), HADS (depression), DAS-28 (disease activity) and CIS-8 (fatigue). Spearman’s correlations were used to analyse the relationships between all the variables and PROCESS.spss was used to conduct mediation analyses. Results: There was a significant negative relationship between peak melatonin levels and depression scores (p=.039), a significant positive relationship was found between depression and fatigue (p<.001) and a significant positive relationship was found between pain and disease activity (p=.018). The mediation analyses did not reveal any potential mediators. Conclusion: Melatonin is linked to depression; however, this link cannot be explained by the mediators listed in this study and further examination of this link is needed. While there were no potential mediators between melatonin and depression, the relationships found between depression and fatigue as well as between pain and disease activity could be explained by the overlap in the items in the various measurements.","['Melatonin', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Depression', 'Disease Activity', 'Fatigue', 'Pain']"

Reading comprehension is one of the most important tasks in primary school. It is important for success in all subjects in school, but it is also important in daily life. The aim of this study is to investigate if readers a text understand better if they are interested in the subject of the text than when they are less interested. In addition, it is investigated whether the difference is different for low-motivated readers than for highly-motivated readers. The following research question has been formulated: ‘Do readers understand a text better when they are very interested in the subject of a text than when they are uninterested in the subject of the text? And is the difference non-identical for highly intrinsically motivated readers and low intrinsically motivated readers?’ To answer the research question, the reader has completed a reading task and a questionnaire about reading motivation. The reader has chosen three interesting topics and three uninteresting topics to read. After reading the text, the reader was asked to answer three literal questions and three inference questions about the text. In this way, it could be investigated whether interest in a specific text plays a role in text comprehension. The reader also completed a questionnaire about reading motivation to investigate whether the difference is different for highly motivated readers than for low-motivated readers. In this research, attention is only paid to intrinsic motivation. The research has shown that interest has no influence on text comprehension and there is no difference for highly motivated readers and low-motivated readers. Despite these results, it is still recommended to look for texts that arouse the interest of children. According to the literature, interest and motivation are effective factors for text comprehension.","['leesmotivatie', 'tekstbegrip']"
Human support in eHealth physical activity interventions for patients with or at risk of cardiometabolic diseases: A meta-analysis,"Hoog, Shyvana de",['Talia Cohen Rodrigues'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"General abstract Background: Unhealthy lifestyle increases the change of early mortality of patients with or at risk of Cardiometabolic Diseases (CMDs). Positive effects of eHealth physical activity interventions have been recently found. In human supported eHealth interventions feedback and support is primarily provided by a healthcare professional, and in self-help eHealth interventions feedback is primarily automated and displayed via text or graphical form. Incorporating human contact by healthcare professionals showed its first improvements on physical activity. However, influential differences between human supported eHealth interventions and self-help eHealth interventions on physical activity remain unclear. Objective: In this meta-analysis we first evaluated the overall effectiveness of eHealth physical activity intervention in patients with or at risk of Cardiometabolic Diseases (CMD). Second, we analyzed the influence of human support and self-help on the effectiveness of different type(s) of eHealth physical activity intervention. Methods: Our meta-analysis was based on the PICO and PRISMA statements. We searched for English and Dutch studies between 1995 and 2020. We included randomized controlled trials focused on interactive web- mobile based physical activity interventions, and with the goal to modify healthy physical activity in patients of 18 years and older. Baseline and post measures of outcome measurement ‘BMI’ and ‘step count’ were collected. Risk of bias assessment was performed by Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. We estimated the pooled effect sizes with a random-effects model meta-analysis. Results: A total of 36 studies (N=6,919) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in our meta-analysis, including seven self-help interventions and 29 human supported interventions. We found a significant increase in BMI (Hedges’G 0.29, 95% CI. 0.45 - 0.12) and daily step count (Hedges’G 0.79, 95% CI. 1.37 - 0.22) in the eHealth physical activity intervention group. The subgroup analysis showed that both human-supported and self-help interventions significantly reduced BMI (Hedges’G 0.29; 95% CI 0.45 - 0.12). We found a significant increase in daily step count in the human-supported interventions (0.71; 95% CI 1.34 - 0.09; p = < 0.01), but no significant increase was found in the (group) with self-help interventions (0.11; 95% CI 2.34 - 0.32; p = 0.13). We found no significant difference in effectiveness between human-supported and self-help interventions on BMI (Q(1) = 0.35; 95% CI -0.47 - -0.18; p = 0.552) and daily step count (Q(1) = 1.06 CI -0.32 - 2.44). Discussion: eHealth physical interventions are effective on BMI and daily step count, but there is no significant variety in physical activity outcomes between human supported interventions and self-help interventions. Our results support that physical activity is one of the greatest modifiable behaviors for eHealth physical activity interventions. Future meta-analysis should continue with a multimorbid approach by adapting the shared underlying risk factors.","['Cardiometabolic disease', 'meta-analyse', 'human support', 'eHealth', 'underlying risk factors', 'physical activity', 'self-management', 'online intervention']"
Judging the Trustworthiness of Others: The Role of Eye Contact and Empathy in Monetary Transactions,"Gelderen, Ottoline van","['Perea-Garcia, J.O.', 'Kret, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the domain of interpersonal communication, the eye region has a vital role. Specifically, the pupil has an essential signalling function, reflecting different cognitive and affective states. The colours of the iris, surrounding the pupil, varies largely among human beings. Although studies are conducted on how the colour of the iris influences gaze perception, none have yet investigated the role of iris brightness on the perception of pupil size changes. It is furthermore known that pupil size changes affect interpersonal trust: while dilating pupils lead to a signal of trust, constricting pupils convey untrustworthiness. Nonetheless, the role of iris brightness within this process remains unknown. Moreover, there is evidence for the role of empathy within the processing of pupil size changes. Therefore, the current study explored whether iris brightness affects the perception of pupil size changes. Also, the study examined whether the brightness of the iris in dilating and constricting pupils affected the reported trustworthiness of virtual partners while controlling for the participants’ level of empathy. Fifty-one participants were included in the analysis. These participants were shown animations of a virtual partner with either dark or light irises and dilating, static or constricting pupils. In the Perception of Pupil Movement-task, they were asked: ‘Do you see movement?’. In the Trust-Game Task, they were asked: ‘Would you trust this person to donate money to a charity on behalf of you?’. The results showed that iris brightness affected the perception of pupil size changes. In stimuli with brighter irises, it was easier for participants to detect changes in the size of the pupil. Participants showed less trust when exposed to stimuli representing dilating pupils than static pupils in both light and dark irises while controlling for the individual’s level of empathy. The decreased trust in the constricting stimuli compared to the static stimuli in light and dark irises was in line with expectations. In the dark irises, there was no difference in trust scores between dilating and constricting pupils. In the stimuli representing light irises, on the other hand, there was an effect. This research found no evidence that more empathetic people perceive these subtle cues in eye contact better than less empathetic people. Our results underline the interplay of iris brightness and pupil size changes in monetary decision making and interpersonal communication, specifically regarding perceived trustworthiness.","['Pupil Size Changes', 'Iris Colour', 'Empathy', 'Economic Decision Making']"

The current study aims to investigate whether threat or safety information presented by parents about a stranger affects the heart rate of the children when interacting with those strangers. Additionally, in the light of earlier evidence that has shown a moderating effect on the influence of verbal threat information on physiological changes, the role of child trait social anxiety has been explored as a possible moderator. A sample of 38 10-to-14-year-old children and their primary caregivers have participated in the current study. Parents gave their child verbal threat or safety information about two strangers that the child had to interact with during social tasks: social performance, watching back their performance, and social interaction. Heart rate was continuously recorded during these social tasks. Child trait social anxiety was measured through the child's report on the social anxiety subscale of the SCARED questionnaire. Results showed that parental verbal expressions of threat versus safety did not have a significant effect on the heart rate of the child. Furthermore, no significant moderation of this effect by child trait social anxiety was found.

Cognitive Adaptation to Scarcity: How those who experienced childhood scarcity are better adapted to conditions of current scarcity,"Wijk, Twan van","['Ruigendijk, H.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Our current findings add to the literature into the effects of childhood scarcity and current scarcity on cognitive performance. We show that participants who experienced childhood scarcity generally perform worse on executive functioning, as measured by the Hearts and Flowers task. This is in line with the general trend that childhood scarcity seems to impede cognitive functioning (Cermakova et al., 2018; Everson-Rose, 2003). For current scarcity we found no significant main effect of on cognitive performance. However, a interaction effect between childhood scarcity and current scarcity on cognitive performance was present. While childhood scarcity generally impedes cognitive functioning; our research shows that under conditions of high current scarcity people who experienced high levels of childhood scarcity show heightened performance on the HF-task compared to those who experienced lower levels of childhood scarcity. These findings imply that cognitive performance in people who experienced childhood scarcity might not simply be impeded, but rather adopted to specific environments of uncertainty.",
Effects of Cognitive Load and Semantic Instruction on Walking Parameters,"Boutalbi, Loubna Wafaa","['Ruitenberg, M.F.L']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this project, we aimed to examine the effects of cognitive load and semantic instructions on walking parameters. The study may help further our understanding on how walking patterns and motor actions can be improved, specifically in older healthy adults. This study’s findings may be valuable in developing rehabilitation programmes as post-stroke patients often show changes in walking patterns. A total of 16 healthy adults aged 55-67 years old walked along a 10-m straight runway under various conditions, while walking speed, step length, and step width were measured. The study used a 2x3 repeated measures design resulting in a total of 6 conditions. The first independent variable was cognitive load which contained two levels; single and dual task. The second independent variable was semantic instructions which contained three levels: no instructions, analytical instruction, and metaphoric instruction. The conditions consisted of each type of instruction being paired with each cognitive load level. There was also a baseline condition, in which participants walked with no instructions. This study hypothesised that a higher cognitive load will result in slower walking speeds, shorter steps and wider steps. Moreover, it hypothesised that compared to analytical instruction, metaphorical instruction will lead to walking parameters closer to baseline performance. Additionally, it was hypothesised that an interaction will occur; as cognitive load increases, metaphoric instruction will result in walking parameters closer to baseline performance. Whereas analytical instruction will result in performance closer to baseline with a lower cognitive load. The measures MANOVA showed that the main effects of cognitive load (p < .001) and semantic instruction (p < .001) on walking speed and step length were significant. A significant interaction was found (p < .001) between our two independent variables on walking speed. Specifically, there was an interaction between baseline performance and type of semantic instruction used. When compared to baseline performance, participants walked faster in the single task condition under metaphorical instruction as compared to under analytical instruction. In conclusion these findings suggest that semantic instruction is important to consider when instructing movement as it can result in deterioration or improvement of performance.","['Walking', 'Cognitive load', 'semantic instruction', 'dual task']"
"Who do you see fulfilling a technical profession? The role of fathers’ gender-stereotypical expectations in their sons’ and daughters’ occupational aspirations, and the role of children’s gender-stereotypical beliefs as mediator in this relation","Makelaar, Dagmar","['Doornkamp, L.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite the fact that girls are increasingly choosing technical subjects in high school, the vast majority who practices a technical profession is men. Current research examined the relation between fathers’ gendered expectations on their sons’ and daughters’ feminine and masculine occupational aspirations, and the role of the children’s gender-stereotypical beliefs in this relation. The resulting research question concerned: To what extent are the father’s genderstereotypical expectations of professions related to his children’s gender-stereotypicaloccupational aspirations, and to what extent do his children’s gender-stereotypical beliefsabout sciences mediate this relation? This question was expected to be answered by examining a sample of 100 Dutch families. Two children from each family, one aged 15 and one aged 17, participated and were asked to complete the OAT-PM and the IAT. The OATAM was administered to their fathers. The results showed no relations between either the father’s gender-stereotypical expectations of professions and his children’s gender-stereotypical beliefs about sciences, nor between the children’s gender-stereotypical beliefsabout sciences and their own gender-stereotypical occupational aspirations. However, it was found that the adolescent daughter’s masculine occupational aspirations were higher when their father had less gender-stereotypical ideas about professions. It was concluded that future research should explore the relation between the father’s implicit gender stereotypes and his children’s gender-stereotypical occupational aspirations further in other social-cultural contexts, and examine the role of explicit gender stereotypes of the child as a mediator in this relation.","['children’s occupational aspirations', 'father’s gender-stereotypical expectations of professions', 'children’s stereotypical beliefs about sciences', 'gender stereotypes']"

This research examines whether the volunteers of a non-profit organisation report appraisal and autonomous respect, job satisfaction and intent to remain a volunteer with the organisation, when they perceive that the paid workers of the organisation display self-sacrifice on behalf of the organisation and interactional justice. The research had a cross sectional survey design and the participants were volunteers working with paid workers in a non-profit organisation (a hospice; N = 52 hospice volunteers). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses about direct effects. Among volunteers, autonomous and appraisal respect were found positively and directly related to job satisfaction. Additionally, among volunteers, interactional justice received from the paid workers of the organisation was found positively and directly related to autonomous respect, appraisal respect, and job satisfaction. Furthermore, among volunteers, perceived self-sacrifice on behalf of the organisation by the paid workers of the organisation was found directly and positively related to appraisal respect. Thereafter, a mediation regression analysis was conducted to test the hypothesis about the indirect effect. The mediation regression analysis showed that among volunteers, interactional justice received from the paid workers of the organisation relates positively and indirectly to job satisfaction through appraisal respect as a mediator. The theoretical and practical implications, as well as the limitations and suggestions for further research, are discussed.","['volunteerism', 'self-sacrifice', 'interactional justice', 'appraisal respect', 'autonomous respect', 'cooperation', 'intent to remain', 'job satisfaction']"
The Gardens of Leiden: A study on the behavioural motives behind the appearances of the gardens of Leiden,"Kranenburg, Karlijn","['Weiden, A. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Urban centres are among the most vulnerable geographical locations for the impacts of climate change. Strengthening the green infrastructures of these urban areas is therefore increasingly important, as this contributes to their climate resilience. For the city of Leiden, as of many other Dutch cities, public space that can be used for greening initiatives is scarce due to urbanisation processes. The private urban gardens of Leiden can provide a solution for this. Many gardens in this cities are currently ‘grey’. Understanding why would provide valuable information for its policy makers. Therefore this study explored the behavioural motives behind the gardens of Leiden and answered the question: ‘why does a garden in Leiden looks like it does’. Next to that this study also researched the relationship between perceived impact and adaptation behaviour. The data for this study was collected through an online survey in which 67 garden owners of Leiden participated. The data gave insight on the behaviour and motives of these garden owners. It showed that green in a garden is often considered important, yet most garden owners had or wanted their garden (partially) tilled. A frequent motive given for this was the functionality of tilling for the use of a garden. Furthermore the data showed a moderately positive correlation between perceived impact of a garden on climate adaptation and the amount of green in a garden. Further research should examine the predictor in this relationship.","['private gardens', 'green urban infrastructure', 'behavioural motives', 'perceived impact']"
Partner Choice and Social Environments Shape Rule Abidance Behavior,"Simon, Sebastian","['Gross, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Rules regulate society as they help to predict social interactions. Groups, however, do not always abide by rules. Instead, they break them when the conditions are right. Here we hypothesized that rule abidance behavior is determined by a) an individual choosing another for mutual benefit based on their reputation and b) the social-environmental incentives like fairness and dishonesty. We had three participants building a reputation for their willingness to abide by or break rules. A fourth participant used that information to choose one to three participants, then played several rounds of a dictator game and a die-roll task. Participants were chosen more often when their reputation was in line with environmental incentives, where merely transitioning from one environment to another strengthened that effect. Regulators should therefore ensure the consistency and kinds of environmental incentives that individuals in power positions face across environments for controlling resulting rule abidance behavior.","['Rule-abidance', 'partner choice', 'social environments', 'norms']"
Stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with psoriasis and its predictors in the Dutch population,"Museler, Leonie","['Beugen, S. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Stigmatization frequently occurs in individuals with a skin condition such as psoriasis, which can negatively influence their mental health and disease status. While stigma is known to be the leading cause of disability for these individuals, little is known about stigmatizing attitudes among the general population and its correlates. This study aimed to examine stigmatizing attitudes towards psoriasis among the Dutch population and investigated possible predictors. Methods. An online survey was administered to 124 participants, which were recruited based on convenience sampling. A 3 x 1 within-subject cross-sectional design was used, investigating the difference in stigmatizing attitudes towards the health conditions psoriasis and common cold (included due to COVID-19), and a healthy control condition. To describe the different conditions, vignettes were used. A one-way repeated measure Manova examined differences between the three conditions on stigmatizing attitudes (assessed by a social distance scale, a direct and indirect version of the impact of skin condition in daily life scale, stereotype endorsement scale, and emotion ratings). In addition, zero-order correlations and multiple regression analyses investigated possible predictors of stigmatizing attitudes towards psoriasis, including sociodemographic variables, familiarity and knowledge about psoriasis, indicators of the behavioral immune system and fear of corona. Results. Manova analysis displayed higher stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with psoriasis as compared to the control group (p<.001). Besides, overall higher stigmatizing attitudes towards a common cold as compared to the psoriasis group were found. Higher stigmatizing attitudes towards psoriasis were correlated with lower knowledge, higher pathogen disgust, higher perceived infectability, male gender, and familiarity with psoriasis. No correlations were found regarding age, education, fear of corona, or gem aversion. Multiple regression displayed male gender, higher levels of pathogen disgust, and lower levels of knowledge about psoriasis to be predictors of stigmatizing attitudes (p<.05). Conclusion. Stigmatizing attitudes towards psoriasis is shown to be prevalent in Dutch society. As stigmatizing attitudes were shown to be related to reduced knowledge and male gender, future interventions might focus on these factors. Besides, different age groups and professions could be investigated in future studies. Further research is needed, as stigma towards psoriasis is rarely been investigated among the public.","['Psoriasis', 'Common cold', 'Stigmatizing attitudes', 'Predictors']"
The impact of daily work-time pressure on recovery and the moderating role of work-home segmentation supplies and psychological detachmen,"Vink, Sharina","['Wijn, N. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examined the relationship between work-time pressure during the workday and recovery at the beginning of the following workday and the role of segmentation supplies and psychological detachment. The research question was as follows: ‘’What is the relationship between work-time pressure and recovery at the beginning of the following workday and what is the role of work-home segmentation supplies and psychological detachment from work as moderators of this relationship?’’. Recovery was measured through questionnaires, as a state, by levels of fatigue and vigor. Five hypotheses were tested by the data of one day from a diary study, which was conducted online. Work-time pressure and psychological detachment were measured in the evening and recovery the next morning. Segmentation supplies was measured at the start of the diary study through a questionnaire. The final number of respondents was N= 45 (26.7 percent male and 73.3 percent female). The findings indicate no significant relationship between daily work-time pressure and recovery. Segmentation supplies and psychological detachment were examined as possible moderators of this relationship but showed no significant relationships. However, segmentation supplies positively predicted vigor significantly. Finally, the relationship between segmentation supplies and psychological detachment was examined, but also showed no significant relationship. Concluding, more research is necessary to increase the reliability of the results. Furthermore, organizations and employers need to be aware of working conditions and how this relates to recovery of their employees to be able to prevent poor employee health in the long run.",

The aims of this study are to examine if there is a difference in comorbidity rate between PD clusters and how people with a PD, PTSD or both would score their quality of life. In this study, 11 outpatients, who were diagnosed with a cluster B or C PD with the aid of the SCID-5-P, were assessed with the CAPS-5 to examine if they also got PTSD. Additionally, the patients filled out the MHQoL to determine their quality of life. Analyses showed no significant effect between cluster B or C PD with comorbid PTSD. Additionally, analyses showed no significant alteration between cluster B and C PD on quality of life of patients. Lastly, there was not a significant effect between patients with a cluster B or C PD and comorbid PTSD on quality of life. During all analyses, no effect was found between the PD and PTSD diagnoses and the quality of life of patients in outpatient clinics. However, not finding significant effects throughout the whole study could be due to the small sample size which resulted in a lack of power of the analyses. Yet, this does not undermine the importance of exploring this topic. Cluster B and C PD and PTSD are common (comorbid) diagnoses and their impact on daily life are still tremendous.",

They are presented with one of two versions. In one version the communication of the organisation is geared toward attenuating feelings of shame, whereas in the other it is not. As hypothesized, participants who experienced less shame perceived the organisation as more positive and were more likely to contact or recommend the organisation to friends or family, and these people dealt with the financial situation more constructively (hypothesis 1a-1c). Contrary to our hypothesis, only people with higher shame perceived the organisation as less positive and people with higher shame and stigma would contact or recommend the organisation less often to friends or family and handled their financial situation less constructively (hypothesis 2a-2c).","['financial scarcity', 'financial help', 'financial shame', 'financial stigma', 'perception of organisation', 'warmth', 'competence', 'morality', 'behavioural intention', 'recommendation intention', 'adaptive coping', 'denial coping', 'disengagement.']"

"The Relationship between Spatial ability, Spatial Anxiety, and Gender","Geest, Jens van der","['Ham, C.J.M. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Spatial learning using innovative tools like the Microsoft HoloLens is becoming more popular in STEM fields and education. However, not every individual seems to benefit from this type of instruction the same way. This might be caused by individual differences in spatial ability, but also by the cognitive load that AR learning can generate that could vary between individuals. This study tries to investigate several factors that might influence spatial learning when using 3D AR tools like the Microsoft HoloLens. The impact of the factors embodiment, spatial ability, spatial anxiety, and gender on spatial learning are examined and whether there is an relationship between these factors. Participants were 110 individuals between the age 18-35 that performed several online embodied and non-embodied spatial ability tests and had to fill in an spatial anxiety questionnaire to assess self-reported spatial anxiety. A three-way mixed ANOVA was performed on the different factors with two between subject variables – gender and spatial anxiety – and one within subject variable – embodiment in spatial ability, with two levels: embodied and non-embodied spatial ability score. Results show comparable scores between embodied and non-embodied cognition, genders, and spatial anxiety types, hence no interaction effect was found, F(1, 77) = .011, p = .915, partial η2 < .001. Furthermore, no significant main effects were found. The results from the current study are not line with previous research, making it debatable whether these factors are of main influence on spatial learning and suggesting that there are other factors at play. Reasons for the conflicting results as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.",
Closing the Door on too much OR Traffic: An Investigation of OR Traffic Behaviors in Two Dutch Hospitals,"Otten, Sophie","['Band, G.', 'Groeneweg, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study investigated operating room (OR) traffic at the OR’s of two Dutch hospitals. OR traffic is one of the multiple causes of surgical site infections (SSIs). Hospitals are trying to reduce their amount of OR traffic as much as possible in order to reduce the number of SSIs. Knowing how much variation of the amount of OR traffic occurs and knowing the reasons for its occurrence, is important to actually be able to reduce OR traffic to an tolerable level. For this study, OR traffic was investigated by observing OR traffic during surgeries (N = 83). On average, 4.29 door openings per hour occurred. Between the hospitals, the averages of OR traffic per hour differed greatly (hospital 1 M = 3.00, hospital 2 M = 5.23). Overall, there was a positive linear relation between the amount of OR traffic and the duration of a surgery. Two-way traffic was related to less overall OR traffic. Visible signs about the OR traffic policy did not seem effective in reducing OR traffic. Based on the results of this study, practical recommendations to improve OR traffic policy were proposed. Also, we advised on improving OR traffic registration and efficient behavior of OR personnel to reduce OR traffic.","['door openings', 'hospital safety management', 'OR policy', 'OR traffic', 'surgical site infections']"

The first line treatment for PTSD is prolonged exposure (PE) therapy. Inhibitory learning theory proposes threat expectancy violation as a strategy to enhance effectiveness of PE. No standardized instrument for the assessment of threat expectancies is currently available. The aim of the current study was to assess the psychometric properties of the TREE, a novel instrument to assess threat expectancies. The reliability and factor structure of the TREE were assessed in a non-clinical sample of 158 trauma-exposed individuals. The TREE showed excellent reliability and was found to consist of four subscales: 1. Fear of dying/losing control, 2. Externalizing symptoms, 3. Negative evaluation, 4. Internalizing symptoms. The reliability of all subscales was good with an internal consistency ranging from .75 to .85. The TREE allows clinicians to tailor exposure sessions to the individual threat appraisal profile of their patients. Furthermore, by making threat expectancies explicit, it can aid in further understanding the mechanisms underlying PE. The factor structure of the TREE should be confirmed and its generalizability to the non-clinical and clinical population should be corroborated in future research.","['Posttraumatic Stress Disorder', 'exposure therapy', 'inhibitory learning theory', 'expectancy violation', 'psychometric properties']"

Due to technological developments, organizations and their employees are increasingly participating on social media, where employees can express their support for their organization. This online behavior can be viewed as online ambassadorship behavior (OA). The current study (N = 196) uses a survey to investigate the differences in employees' general engagement, perception, and the motives to engage in online ambassadorship in comparison to two affiliative OCB's, namely civic virtue (CV) and organizational loyalty (OL). As expected, engagement in OA was lower than in CV and OL and perceived as socially riskier and more visible. Unexpectedly, there were no significant relationships between self-enhancement and organizational identification regarding OA engagement, which indicated that self-enhancement and organizational identification are not motives for employee’s engagement. In sum, this study provided evidence that employees’ perceived perception influences engagement in OA.",

Quality of life and mood problems: gender differences among individuals in treatment for co-morbid substance use disorder and psychiatric comorbidities,"Kerkhof, Iris van de","['Jong, K. de', 'Molendijk, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background and aim: Although literature suggests that quality of life (QoL) in women with substance use disorders (SUDs) is lower than in men, it remains unknown whether this 1) applies to SUD patients with psychiatric comorbidities in the Netherlands; and 2) whether there is a gender difference in QoL gain during treatment. This study therefore aimed to compare QoL (gain) between genders. Because research linked mood problems to worse QoL and substance usage in women, it was also the aim to compare genders in the association between (change in) mood problems and (change in) QoL. Methods: The longitudinal design involved data of day-patient treatments between 2018-2020. Sixty nine females and one hundred and thirty males with SUDs and comorbidities were assessed, using the EQ-5D-3L and the ICECAP-A. Analysis of variance and moderation analyses were performed with multiple imputation, controlling for treatment group. Results: At pretest, QoL in women was significantly lower when compared to men. There was no significant gender difference concerning gain in QoL, as well as regarding the association between mood problems and QoL at pretest and posttest. Conclusions: Women with SUDs and comorbidities experience lower QoL than men, a gender gap that is less profound in the normal population. Stigma and adverse life conditions arguably play a role. There is no evidence that men and women profit differently from treatment. In any case, mood problems, trauma experiences and meaningful activities could be considered more in future studies, as their association with QoL seems to be critical.","['Quality of life', 'substance use disorder', 'gender differences', 'anxiety', 'depression']"

We drew on these findings to examine whether this link is also present with a subcomponent of self-esteem, namely parental self-efficacy. Parental self-efficacy has a mutual influence on parental care, and, along with eye contact, they are critical to the formation of a healthy parent-child relationship, which in turn fosters favorable child development outcomes. However, not much is known about how parental self-efficacy and parental care impact (the experience of) eye contact between a parent and their child. The present study (n = 62) investigated the association between parental care as perceived by the child, parental selfefficacy, and the affective response of parents to eye contact with their own child. Parents engaged in an fMRI task where they were shown pre-recorded movies of target people gazing directly at them. Targets were either the participant’s own child or an unfamiliar child. The objective was to explore whether parental self-efficacy impacts how parents feel after direct eye contact with their child and if parental care influenced this relationship. Our findings did not support these expectations. The study provides further grounds for the link between parental selfefficacy and parental care. Additional implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.","['affective eye contact', 'parental self-efficacy', 'parental care', 'parent-child relationship', 'direct gaze']"
Effects of Musical Expertise on Music-Induced Fatigue for Complex Rhythms,"Honk, Eric van","['Schaefer, R.', 'Middelkoop, H.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Fatigue is commonly seen in a large range of neuropsychological disorders and is a problematic symptom when conducting music therapy. Fatigue slows down the treatment and limits treatment options. One common theory about the occurrence of fatigue is that knowledge about stimuli affects how much fatigue these stimuli induce. The basis for this theory is that surprising stimuli are thought to be more fatigue-inducing compared to unsurprising stimuli. To test this idea, we investigated how expertise affected the amount of induced fatigue experienced when listening to music samples that differed in tempo and complexity. It was also investigated how complexity and tempo affected the amount of induced fatigue that 72 participants experienced during a tapping task. The complexity of music was defined by the polyrhythmical structure of the used stimuli. Twenty-one samples were classified as low complexity samples and 21 samples as high complexity samples. The tempi of the used samples were used as a control variable. Three tempi were used, grouping low, medium, and high tempo, which all consisted of 14 samples. We expected that an increase in complexity would cause more induced fatigue ratings and that this effect of complexity was more apparent in the low expertise group compared to the high expertise group. We also expected that an increase in tempo would lead to an increase in induced fatigue. The main effect of complexity was studied using a Friedman Anova, (p =.401). The effect of tempo was also examined using a Friedman Anova and showed no significant effect (p =.486). In both the tempo and complexity analyses, there was no significant difference between the fatigue scores based on expertise scores. A possible explanation for this lack of effect is that expertise in music nor the complexity of a stimulus does not affect how tiring a stimulus is. Implications of this research could be that the personalization of music samples regarding their musical complexity and tempo based on someone’s musical expertise does not affect the fatigue experienced by the patients.",

The potential of trust to influence the integrative outcome of group negotiations: A comparative study of group negotiations between groups of friends and strangers,"Becker, Tom","['Steinel, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Group negotiations are an important aspect of social interactions and can be strongly influenced by familiarity, social motive and power differences between involved parties. A pro-social motive was associated with more concern for the needs of others. Powerful individuals in the asymmetric power conditions were expected to have more influence on the outcome. Friends were expected to have more integrative results compared with strangers. Additionally, groups that trusted each other were expected to reach higher joint outcomes by openly sharing information. The results of a three-person online negotiation exercise supported a crucial role of trust. Groups that trust each other reached higher joint outcomes for all experimental conditions. The integrative potential of the outcome was not influenced by the groups consisting of friends or strangers. Pro-social motive groups reached more integrative outcome for groups of friends and stranger alike. Furthermore, participants that were given more power had more influence on the outcome of the negotiation. Contradicting our expectations, strangers showed more concern for a fair and considerate negotiation process.",

The moderating role of household chaos in the association between parental sensitivity and proactive aggression in childhood,"Wolterbeek Muller, Roos","['Drunen, L. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between parental sensitivity and proactive aggression in children four years later, when they were 10-12 years of age. Furthermore, we aimed to explore whether household chaos moderated this association. Based on a sample of 257 Dutch families, the results showed that proactive aggression in children was not predicted by parental sensitivity. Also, the relation between low levels of parental sensitivity and proactive aggression in children was not stronger when children experienced more household chaos in their family situations than children who experienced less household chaos. In some way, it is positive that proactive aggression was not shown by children with unsensitive parents and that household chaos did not moderate this association. Children may be more resilient than expected and the social context of the child may possibly prevent the occurrence of proactive aggression. Individual differences in a child’s perception of the environment might also influence whether the child is showing proactive aggression. Possibly, individual differences in coping with negative environments, such as negative parenting, are important in unraveling the prediction of proactive aggressive behaviour. For further research, we suggest adding the moderating effect of temperament to the model. In this study, unsensitive parenting was not associated with proactive aggression in children. However, other factors, such as harsh parenting, can be investigated in future research to expand our knowledge concerning proactive aggression in children.",
Relationship Anxiety and Avoidance as an Indicator of Self-Esteem throughout Adolescence,"Ravinale Cañón, Zoe","['Spaans, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study was one of the first to cross-sectionally research the association between relationship anxiety and avoidance with self-esteem through the different stages of adolescence. The final sample consisted of 155 teenagers aged 11 to 21 years old (M = 15.93, SD = 2.98, 53.5% female). The participants were divided into three age groups; early (11-15 years), middle (15-18 years), and late adolescence (18-22 years). Five Ordinary least squares regression analyses were carried out. The results revealed a significant association between relationship anxiety and avoidance with self-esteem. Lastly, the strength of these associations varied throughout adolescence. The results showed that the strength of the relationships between relation anxiety and avoidance over self-esteem was significantly different for middle adolescents compared to late adolescents. This could be caused by normal developmental changes. Future research should focus on bigger sample sizes and maximizing generalization by including participants from different cultures, countries, and socio-economical backgrounds.","['Relationship anxiety', 'relationship avoidance', 'self-esteem', 'adolescence']"
Response inhibition and mood across the menstrual cycle,"Stefánsdóttir, Sigurbjörg","['Bruijn, e. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The menstrual cycle is a complex biological process that occurs approximately monthly over the span of a woman‘s reproductive age. In recent years, it has attracted researchers attention in relation to many aspects, such as cognitive processes and mood. However, most research on the topic is relatively recent, findings are inconsistent and much is still to be further investigated. The current study seeks to find out whether the menstrual cycle influences response inhibition and mood. We hypothesized that when women are in the second half of their menstrual cycle (luteal phase, approximately 2 weeks prior to menstruation), they would respond faster and more accurately to cognitive tasks (better response inhibition) and report worse mood than those who were in the first part of their menstrual cycle (menses to ovulation). We recruited 60 healthy, naturally cycling women with an average cycle length (21-35 days), aged 18-35 years. To assess response inhibition, they performed the Flanker task and the Go/NoGo task and to assess mood symptoms, the DASS-21, SPANE and BITe questionnaires were used. Additionally, participants answered questionnaires about their menstrual cycle and demographic factors. The experiment was conducted online using PsyToolkit and used a between-subjects design, with each particant tested once. We found no statistically significant main effect of cycle phase on response inhibition or mood. We therefore concluded that the menstrual cycle does not appear to influence response inhibition or mood significantly.","['response inhibition', 'mood', 'menstrual cycle']"
"‘’She is strict, nobody likes her’’: The effect of exposure to verbal expression of social anxiety from parents on children’s fear beliefs","Mul, Lisa","['Aktar, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social anxiety disorder has an early onset (median age at thirteen years) and runs in families. An important pathway for acquiring fear is via verbal expression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of parental verbal information of threat/anxiety on the fear beliefs of their children and tried to determine whether the parental social anxiety levels moderated the effect of the parental verbal expression on the fear beliefs of children. A community sample of children (N = 68) between 11 and 13 years visited the lab with one of their parents. The parents were instructed to verbally give threat/anxiety information about one stranger (judge) and safety information about the other stranger to their children. After the manipulation, the children were asked to do a social performance for each stranger which was a presentation about confidence and shyness. After the performance the children were asked about their fear beliefs. A significant effect was found of the parental verbal expressions of threat/anxiety (vs. safety) on the fear beliefs of the children. The fear beliefs of children were higher about the stranger when threat/anxiety information was given than when safety information was given. This effect was independent from the parental social anxiety levels. This study provides insight to the effect of parental verbal information on the fear beliefs of their children. It can be implicated that parents have an important role in verbally conveying fear to children.","['Social anxiety disorder', 'social learning pathways', 'fear beliefs', 'verbal information', 'parental social anxiety disorder']"
The Effect of Parental Verbal Negative Expressions on Children’s Avoidance of Strangers,"Vermaas, Charlotte","['Aktar, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Transmission of parental verbal negative (versus positive) information regarding social situations might cause fear acquisition of social encounters noticeable in children’s avoidance of strangers. The present study investigated the influence of parental verbal negative (versus positive) information about strangers on a child’s avoidance of strangers in late childhood/adolescence years (10-13 years old). In addition, the moderating role of parental trait social anxiety on children’s behavior towards a stranger was explored. Parents were presented with standardized negative or positive information about two strangers, which they transferred to their child (N=72, M= 11.56 years; 39 girls). Following the manipulation, children performed three social tasks twice (social performance, watching performance back, and social interaction), with each of the strangers. In addition, parents reported their own social anxiety symptoms in a questionnaire. Findings revealed that parental verbal negative (versus positive) information did not make children more avoidant towards the stranger. Parental social anxiety did not moderate the effect of verbal information on child stranger avoidance, and parental social anxiety levels did not predict children’s overall avoidant behavior to the strangers. In conclusion, the findings reveal no effect of parental verbal expressions on a child’s avoidance to strangers and highlight the importance of further research on this topic, to acquire more knowledge on the environmental influences in the development of SAD.",
The effects of parents’ verbal information on children’s self-focused attention with the moderating effects of children’s fear of being negatively evaluated,"Bouman, Mitch","['Aktar, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Parents’ verbal transmission of information is shown to have an influence on children’s anxiety, which could be moderated by an attentional bias. This study investigated the link between parents’ verbal information transmission about a stranger and the children’s self-focused attention in the context of social anxiety and explored possible moderation of this effect by the children’s fear of being negatively evaluated. Methods: 75 9-to-14-year-old children visited a lab to perform a task, i.e. speaking in front of two strangers sequentially and a live screen on which they were projected. The parents’ verbal manipulation made one of the strangers seem safe and one of the strangers a threat to their evaluation and the looks to the live screen were measured between conditions. The children also filled out questionnaires on the Fear of Negative Child evaluation Results: Our analyses showed no significant result for the effect of parents’ verbal transmission of information on the children’s self-focused attention. Our analyses also showed no significant result for the fear of being negatively evaluated as a moderating factor. Conclusion: No significant effects were found for either the effect of parents’ verbal information on the children’s self-focused attention nor the moderating effects of the fear of being negatively evaluated. We hypothesize that this could be because parents’ verbal information may not be enough to create anxiety in the children or that our sample consisted of more confident children than average, because of a selection bias.",
Sex and age differences in the effects of novelty on memory performance,"Wiersma, Eva","['Schomaker, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Several studies found that recollection improves up to 10 minutes after exploring a novel environment, but recognition does not. This is because recollection is hippocampus-dependent, and recognition is hippocampus-independent. A novelty signal releases dopamine in the hippocampus. The increase in dopamine can last up to 10 minutes after exploring a new environment and thus also improves recollection up to 10 minutes. This master thesis study aimed to examine the differences of age and sex regarding the effects of novelty on memory performance, distinguishing between recollection and recognition. This cross-sectional study was conducted in NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam. After excluding participants who did not meet the selection criteria, the sample size was 426, of which 224 men and 202 women. The age range of the participants was between 8 and 77 years old (M = 24.5, SD = 16.8). Age 8 to 11 were considered children in this study, age 12 to 20 were considered adolescents, age 21 to 64 were considered adults, and age 65 and over were considered seniors. The participants explored a virtual environment with several landmarks on the computer twice, of which the second exploration was either a familiar or a novel environment compared to the first exploration. In addition, the participants filled in questionnaires and performed tasks, such as a word-learning task. This task was used to measure recollection and recognition. A significant effect was found between age groups and memory performance. In both the recollection and recognition test, adolescents and adults performed better than children. However, no significant effect was found between the other age groups on memory performance. In addition, no significant main effects of novelty and sex, and no interaction effects on memory performance were found. These results could be helpful to develop a treatment or intervention to combat disease- and age-related memory decline. However, further research is recommended, including all experimental factors in the analyses and equal numbers of participants in the age and sex groups.",

The Association of Therapist’s Level of Experience and Facilitative Interpersonal Skills: Secondary Analysis,"Sadłowska, Maria","['Jong, K. de', 'Spinhoven, P.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objectives: Some of the domains in which more experienced practitioners have been shown to outperform their less experienced colleagues relate to interpersonal skills, that can be measured by performance-based measure called Facilitative Interpersonal Skills (FIS). FIS has been identified as a strong predictor of treatment outcome, yet it is not known whether the FIS score is dependent on therapeutic experience. The present study tested the impact of clinical experience on FIS task performance by examining the influence of experience on FIS total score and the eight domains. Method: A total of 46 clinical psychology master’s students and 94 licensed cognitive-behavioural therapists participated in FIS assessment and provided information on their prior clinical experience. To test the hypotheses the multi-level growth model for repeated measures was employed. Results: Experienced therapists, on average, scored higher on FIS assessment than master’s students. The analyses of individual FIS domains revealed that the therapists performed significantly better on the 5 out of 8 FIS domains. Conclusions: Results were consistent with the hypothesis that the FIS assessment is dependent on one’s level of experience. The results imply that interpersonal skills can be modified through training or over the course of a therapeutic career. Conceptual and practical considerations of the findings are discussed.",
Impact of (subclinical) mood symptoms on the IQ and cognitive performance of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I and type II,"Longin, Raissa","['Koenders, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Intellectual deficits have been known as a core feature of bipolar disorder for decades and are hypothesized to be responsible for the unfavorable psychosocial outcome and high unemployment rates. Those alterations seem to be permanent and are present not only during active- but also during euthymic phases. The focus of this study was on investigating a possible link between mood symptoms, assessed through the clinician-rated questionnaire YMRS and the self-rated QIDS, and the IQ together with cognitive abilities in four different domains. Measured was the performance of 50 recently diagnosed patients participating in the BINCO-study. Furthermore, the focus was on observing differences in scoring between different symptomatic states and the two types of disorder. The impact of confounders, including the intake of antipsychotic medication, benzodiazepines, and the educational level, were considered. While no significant association between depressive symptoms and the subscale-derived IQ could be detected, a quadratic relation was found between manic symptoms and SDIQ score, pointing towards lower scoring in patients with subclinical symptoms and higher performance in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. The QIDS-score significantly impacted the performance in the sub-scale „information”, which provides the verbal comprehension index. The YMRS- score again showed a curvilinear association with the same subtest. The intake of antipsychotic medication seemed to show the greatest confounding effect on the dependent variable. Further research is needed to elucidate the effect of manic symptoms on IQ and verbal comprehension, as well as the role of antipsychotic medication. Also, larger sample sizes would determine the actual impact of each mood phase on the IQ.","['Bipolar disorder', 'IQ', 'cognitive performance', 'mood', 'depressive symptoms', 'manic symptoms', 'phase']"
'Estimated time since disease onset' vs cognitive decline: An exploration of the trajectory of amyloid accumulation in the brain since disease onset vs. cognitive decline as a means to improve secondary prevention efforts of Alzheimer's disease.,"Barzev Barreto, Sofia","['Van Houdt, C.', 'Wink, A.M.', 'Schuitema, I.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This paper explores the trajectory of amyloid accumulation onset in the brain relative to cognitive decline to potentially improve secondary prevention efforts of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This was accomplished by attempting a replication of the study ""Spatiotemporal distribution of β-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease is the result of heterogeneous carrying capacities"" (Whittington et al., 2018) using data obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results showed that Whittington’s model of the temporal evolution of the in vivo PET β-amyloid signal over time (i.e. using the four parameters: the tracer nonspecific binding (NS), the exponential uninhibited growth rate (r), the time of half-maximal β -amyloid concentration (T50) and the carrying capacity (K)), and the derived “estimated time since disease onset” could be used to model β-amyloid accumulation trajectory. Additionally, by studying the relationship between the trajectory of amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline, the results showed that amyloid accumulation in the brain does precede cognitive decline and can be modeled to predict cognitive deterioration. Thus, it was concluded that “estimated time since disease onset” does serve as a possible effective predictive diagnostic tool of cognitive impairments and AD pathology. Additionally, this study emphasizes the need for future research on the mechanisms by which amyloid accumulation influences cognitive impairments.","['Amyloid accumulation trajectory', 'Estimated time since disease onset', 'Cognitive decline.']"
The influence of cognitive emotion regulation on the relationship between empathy and anxiety in adolescents,"Hartogs, Max","['Aktar, E.', 'Overgaauw, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Studying the relationship between empathy and anxiety is important, since previous research shows that different kinds of empathy, cognitive and affective, could predict anxiety in adolescents. Cognitive emotion regulation (CER) could be of importance in this relationship, since it is related to both constructs. This is why this study investigates the relationships between empathy, anxiety and CER in adolescents. A group of 99 adolescents aged 9-19 filled in several questionnaires. The Empathy Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index to measure affective- and cognitive empathy, the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory to measure anxiety and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire to measure CER. The results showed: 1) Affective empathy was found to be a predictor for anxiety, 2) Cognitive empathy was found to not be a predictor for anxiety, 3) CER was found to not moderate the found relationship between affective empathy and anxiety. In conclusion, the found results regarding the influence of affective empathy on anxiety will prove useful in anxiety treatment. There is more understanding about how affective empathy could influence anxiety treatment, and therefore it can be taken into account when treating anxious individuals. Further research is required on the possible influence of cognitive empathy and CER. This might improve treating anxiety even further.",
Investigating Irrational Inactivity: A Prototype Analysis of Financial Inertia,"Rietveld, Daniel","['Rooij, R.J.B. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"As inertia lacks a comprehensive definition, this thesis aids the formulation of a singular yet widely applicable definition. This is accomplished by examining the feasibility of definitions obtained through the scientific literature (a top-down approach) and laypeople (a bottom-up approach). A single definition for inertia proves to be elusive due to inertia’s many different uses, interpretations, and overlap with other constructs. For this reason, several distinguishing features were identified to differentiate inertia. In addition, a dichotomy between inertia as a behaviour and tendency was proposed to reconcile contradictions within the literature. Nevertheless, a classical definition with clear boundaries proved to be problematic. Therefore, a bottom-up approach examined through a prototype analysis whether inertia may have a prototype structure. In this case, inertia is best explained through many distinct, yet overlapping concepts instead of a few boundary conditions. In Study 1, participants freely generated features of financial decision-making. In Study 2, the resultant features were adapted to financial inertia and were tested for their representativeness. These preliminary analyses indicated that inertia might indeed have a prototype structure as numerous features were considered central to inertia. While these inferences are somewhat tentative until inertia’s prototype structure is fully confirmed in subsequent tests, there are indications that the dichotomy following from the top-down approach may mirror patterns in the most centrally rated features from the bottom-up approach.",

Linking Observed Parenting Behaviors to Childhood Depression and Child Gender: A Meta-Analysis,"Stock, Eva","['Wentholt, W.', 'Aktar, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: Theoretical models propose that parenting practices play a role in the development and maintenance of child depression. However, previous meta-analytic findings indicated that parenting accounted for only 5-11% of the variance in childhood depression, with varying effects for different types of parenting behaviors. Research Question: The current study aimed to investigate the association between observed negative/positive parenting behavior, childhood depression, and child gender, while controlling for the confounding effects of type of informant and assessment approach for childhood depression. Method: Two meta-analysis were conducted for the negative parenting – childhood depression and positive parenting – childhood depression association, while including moderating and confounding variables. The current study included thirty articles in total, with nineteen examining negative parenting behaviors and twenty-three examining positive parenting behaviors. Results: Observed negative parenting behavior was positively and observed positive parenting behavior was negatively related to childhood depression, with overall small effect sizes. Type of parenting behavior, child gender, and assessment approach for childhood depression did not moderate the associations. Type of informant for childhood depression explained some variance in the positive parenting – childhood depression association. Conclusions: Parenting interventions for childhood depression might aim to improve a broader range of parental behaviors. Future research is advised to compare actual to perceived parenting behaviors and investigate the direction of the parenting – childhood depression association, while adopting a multiple levels of analysis perspective. This could possibly contribute towards developing most effective personalized interventions for childhood depression, while lowering the high burden of depression.","['Parenting', 'Childhood depression', 'Meta-analysis']"

Autistic traits were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition. Results showed a difference in social attention between children with SCT and TD children during the social interaction condition. There was no difference in social attention between the SCT subgroups. The SCT group showed more autistic traits than the TD group and the 47,XXX subgroup had more autistic traits than the 47,XXY subgroup. There was a significant relation between social attention during the single-face condition and autistic traits in the 47,XYY subgroup only.

How does medical decision making take place in diagnostic consultations about Parkinson’s Disease and how is this related to patients’ satisfaction?,"Bigot, Anna","['Wirken, L.', 'Hillen, M.A.', 'Veldhuijzen, J.', 'Kurpershoek, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative, progressive motor disorder. Receiving this diagnosis can be impactful for patients. PD patients have reported dissatisfaction with the diagnostic process, which may partly result from a perceived lack of active involvement during medical decision-making. Neurologists are expected to inform and involve patients based on the ethical imperative of patient autonomy. Yet, insight into how medical decisions are actually made is scarce, particularly which types of medical decisions, the extent of patient involvement, and how this affects their satisfaction. This study aimed to get more insight into medical decision-making by observing PD diagnostic consultations in current clinical practice. Hypotheses: Firstly, it was expected that medical decisions were related to topics such as follow-up appointments and PD medication (H1). Secondly, it was expected that the level of patient involvement was low during PD diagnostic consultations (H2). Thirdly, it was hypothesized that patient involvement and overall satisfaction were positively associated (H3). Fourthly, it was hypothesized that female, younger, and more highly educated patients were more substantially involved compared to male, older, and more lowly educated patients (H4, H5 & H6). Methods: This prospective longitudinal study used both quantitative (i.e., questionnaires, structured observational coding) and qualitative (i.e., explorative observational coding) data. PD patients (N=12) visiting neurology outpatient departments in the Netherlands were included upon referral. Diagnostic consultations were video-recorded and patients filled in questionnaires. Types of medical decisions were identified using an adapted existing coding scheme. The observed level of involvement was scored using the OPTION-12 for the most frequently and crucial occurring medical decision. Patients’ overall satisfaction with their consultations was measured six weeks after their last consultation. Statistical analyses included non-parametric tests and multiple regressions. Results: Topics of medical decisions most frequently concerned: follow-up appointments, PD medication and diagnostic testing. Patient involvement was low (M = 9.8; 0-100), indicating that neurologists exhibited few attempts to involve patients during medical decisions about PD medication. Patient involvement was not predictive for patients’ overall satisfaction (p = .23), nor did patients’ demographic characteristics predict the level of patient involvement (p = .29). Conclusion: Medical decisions during PD diagnostic consultations mainly pertained to follow-up appointments, diagnostic testing, and PD medication. PD patients are rarely involved in decisions about PD medication. These results should be interpreted with caution due to a small sample. We recommend repeating this study with a larger sample and investigating what neurologists think is necessary and feasible in terms of patient involvement for the various identified types of medical decisions.",

This study aimed to investigate the role of parents’ verbal threat messages on children’s observed fear and avoidance in a social situation with strangers, and explored a potential moderation of this effect by parental social trait anxiety levels. A sample of 68 children participated with their parents. Both parents filled out a social anxiety questionnaire and then the primary caregiver came to the lab with the child. Parents provided their children with a threat message and a safety message, each linked to a stranger. Then children’s fear and avoidance was observed during an interaction with each stranger. Results showed that there was no significant effect of parents’ verbal threat messages on children’s observed fear and avoidance behavior, compared to the safety messages. Moreover, parental social trait anxiety did not moderate this effect. Although these results indicate no effect of parents’ verbal messages on children’s social anxiety, it is more likely that children did not display socially anxious behavior due to prior exposure to the stranger and the presence of their parents in the room. Further research on this topic should shed light on these issues and help give more insight into the verbal pathway of social anxiety transmission from parents to children.",
The effect of parental verbal expressions of social anxiety on children's reported and observed fear,"Langer, Rona","['Aktar, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background Parental verbal transmission of fear is an important pathway of fear acquisition through which social anxiety may be transmitted from parents to children. Studies show that verbal expressions of threat elicit more fear in children compared to safety information. This is mainly tested in situations involving a novel animal. The current study investigated the effect of parental verbal threat versus safety information on children’s reported and observed fear in response to a stranger. Methods Children (N=71) between 10 to 13 years old participated to this experiment with their primary caregiver. Parents were instructed to provide verbal threat and safety information about two strangers. The children had to give a presentation to those strangers, watch back the presentation together and have a social interaction. Reported fear to each of the strangers was measured with a questionnaire and observed fear was measured by observing child’s behaviour throughout the tasks. Results Children report more fear for the stranger who was paired with threat information compared the stranger paired with safe information. Observed fear behaviour did not differ significantly between the threat and safe condition. Consequently, observed fear could not be predicted by reported fear. Conclusion Parental verbal expressions of social anxiety had a different effect on reported fear and observed fear. As a response to verbal threat comments provided by parents, children reported higher levels of fear compared to verbal safe information. Whereas those comments made no difference in children’s observed avoidance behavior.",

Is the relationship between psychological control and emotion regulation moderated by childhood emotional maltreatment in healthy adolescents?,"Otto, Marie-Sophie","['Wentholt, W.', 'Krause-Utz, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adaptive emotion regulation is crucial in all aspects of life and includes processes through which individuals influence the occurrence, timing, nature, experience, and expression of their emotions. The family environment plays an important role in the development of emotion regulation strategies and can affect it through various routes. In this study, we aimed to test the association of parental psychological control (PC) and adolescent cognitive and behavioral emotion regulation strategies. In addition, we investigated if childhood emotional maltreatment (EM) moderated the proposed relationship. It was expected that parental psychological control and emotional maltreatment would both be negatively related to emotion regulation. Additionally, we expected less adaptive emotion regulation strategies in adolescents with high parental psychological control and experiences of childhood emotional maltreatment. The proposed relationships were expected to differ for cognitive and behavioral emotion regulation and for the two different interaction tasks between parents and adolescents. The current sample consisted of 80 healthy adolescents (64% girls) and 137 parents, with the majority having Caucasian heritage (91%). We used a cross-sectional online survey to assess emotional maltreatment and emotion regulation. Psychological control was observed and coded during two on-sight interaction tasks. We analyzed the data with multiple linear regression analyses. None of the proposed associations were found to be significant. Therefore, it remains unclear whether parental psychological control relates to maladaptive adolescent emotion regulation and the extent to which emotional maltreatment may moderate this relationship. However, using data from healthy adolescents might have biased our results. Differences with other studies and implications for future research are discussed.",
"Us, them, and my dilemma: The influence of observation and dependence on decision making in the Volunteers Dilemma.","HibbertGreaves, Theodore","['Kwaadsteniet, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research suggests that both observability and dependence (having a reliant other subgroup in a collective) are influential factors, in promoting prosocial behaviour in social dilemmas. This study explores the influence of observability, dependence and a combination of both, on volunteering within the Volunteer’s Dilemma (VoD). It was hypothesized that observation and dependence would increase volunteering, with the combination of both factors being the most effective in increasing volunteering. For the dependence conditions, it was further hypothesized, based on previous research, that participants would identify more with a superordinate identity, and that this would correlate with increased volunteering. However, both the observability and dependence conditions did not significantly increase volunteering behaviour, when compared to a control, whilst the observability & dependence condition had a negative correlation with volunteering. Participants also identified more with the subordinate identity, which was found to be significantly negatively correlated to volunteering",
Social anxiety in Dutch non western children and young adolescents: How does social anxiety develop in Dutch non western children?,"Marguoum, Amal","['Voogd, L. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Social anxiety in non-western children and adolescents has not been well studied in the Netherlands, so the purpose of this study was to investigate social anxiety in this group. This study tested whether a high score on perceived discrimination is associated with a high score on social anxiety, whether there are gender differences in the non-western group in social anxiety and whether loneliness strengthens the relationship between perceived discrimination and social anxiety. Three classes from three different schools participated, there was a total of 22 participants. To test the hypotheses, the Social Anxiety Scale for Children (SASC-A), Adolescent Discrimination Distress Index (ADDI) and the Asher Loneliness Scale (ALS) have been used as measurements. The results show that there was only a significant difference in gender in social anxiety, girls scored higher in social anxiety than boys. However, this should be interpreted carefully. The other hypotheses were all not significant. Due to the sample size the reliability and validity of this study was not great, so the results are not a good reflection. It is advised to perform this study in a bigger sample size since this is an important matter to the non-western community.",

Emotional Regulation as a Protective Factor for Negative Mood among Early Adolescents during COVID-19 Pandemic,"Eshet, Ofri","['Zanolie, K.', 'Bos, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the social containment measurements have significantly changed children, adolescents and adult social lives. Changes in the social context may affect more strongly individuals in their early adolescent's developmental period due to the ongoing shift to a new social environment following the transition to secondary school. This transition includes a major shift in focus from parents to peers. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what caused some early adolescents to be impacted more strongly than others. In the current study, we examined mood in early adolescents during the first and second lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, where containment measurements in the Netherlands took place. Moreover, the role of emotion regulation and parents and peers attachment on mood was investigated. Adolescents rated their mood (i.e., happy, sad, fear, angry) once a day and reported their emotion regulation perception once a week. Moreover, adolescents reported their experienced attachment to parents and peers one time during baseline measurement. Results showed a decrease in positive mood from the first to the second lockdown and an association between parents and peers attachment to mood during the first lockdown. However, emotion regulation as a protective factor did not associate with mood or parents and peers attachment. Lastly, parents and peers attachment did not moderate the association between mood and emotion regulation. Overall, this study suggests that the mental well-being of early adolescents was affected by the COVID-19 crisis and that social connectedness to parents or peers might influence mood in early adolescents.",

Deze studie onderzocht de mate van en het verband van gedragsverandering van het kind na behandeling in het ziekenhuis met acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit op angstreductie door ouders van placebotoepassingen bij kinderen, en de mogelijke rol van demografische en klinische kenmerken hierin. Uit een lopend cross-sectioneel vragenlijstonderzoek werden tien ouders geïncludeerd, waarvan hun kind het afgelopen jaar een behandeling in het ziekenhuis had. Ouders rapporteerden een bovengemiddelde acceptabiliteit (M=7.47±{1.80} op een 0- 10 schaal) en een iets lagere verwachte effectiviteit voor angstreductie (M=6.86±{1.58}) van placebotoepassingen bij kinderen. Kinderen vertoonden gemiddeld weinig gedragsveranderingen na de behandeling in het ziekenhuis. Het toedienen van een narcose door injectie in vergelijking met inhalatie was het enige kenmerk die met gedragsverandering, acceptabiliteit en effectiviteit een niet-significant, grote of middelmatige samenhang vertoonde en leidde tot meer gedragsverandering (d=0.66), minder acceptabiliteit (d=-0.78) en minder verwachte effectiviteit (d=-0.91). Daarnaast zijn er nog enkele mogelijke relevante, niet significante, individuele verbanden gevonden. In tegenstelling tot de hypothese hing de mate van gedragsverandering van het kind niet samen met de acceptabiliteit of verwachte effectiviteit van placebotoepassingen door ouders (p-waarden ≥ .83). Door in te spelen op kenmerken die een samenhang vertonen, zoals het toedienen van narcose, zouden ouders mogelijk meer open staan voor placebotoepassingen, waardoor de kwaliteit van de pediatrische zorg kan verbeteren.",

Het is belangrijk manieren te vinden om deze negatieve gevoelens te verminderen en zo de zorg te optimaliseren. Placebo-toepassingen zouden een potentiële oplossing kunnen zijn, maar ouders en zorgverleners moeten hiervoor open staan. Er is weinig onderzoek gedaan naar het gebruik van verschillende pediatrische placebo-toepassingen en de rol van kennis over placebo-effecten. Deze studie heeft als doel te onderzoeken of kennis over placebo-effecten samenhangt met de acceptatie van behandelversterkende en behandelvervangende placebo-toepassingen bij kinderen onder ouders en zorgverleners. Een online vragenlijst werd ingevuld door 11 ouders van een kind dat in het afgelopen jaar in het ziekenhuis is behandeld en 65 zorgverleners. Ouders en zorgverleners verschilden niet in hun (hoge) kennis over placebo-effecten en acceptatie van placebo-toepassingen (p>.090). Meer kennis over placebo-effecten werd geassocieerd met een hogere acceptatie van placebo-toepassingen door ouders (p<.001), maar niet door zorgverleners (p=.196). Na het lezen van beschrijvingen van specifieke pediatrische placebo-toepassingen nam de algemene acceptatie toe voor zowel ouders (p=.008) als zorgverleners (p=.011). De resultaten van deze studie moeten voorzichtig worden geïnterpreteerd, vanwege de kleine en niet generaliseerbare steekproef, maar indiceren dat kennis belangrijker is voor acceptatie van pediatrische placebo-toepassingen door ouders. Meer onderzoek is nodig naar de relatie tussen kennis over placebo-effecten en de acceptatie van de verschillende vormen van placebo-toepassingen. Uiteindelijk is het wellicht mogelijk om met de kennis uit deze studie ouders en zorgverleners beter te informeren over pediatrische placebo-toepassingen en zo hun acceptatie ervan te verhogen.",
Attitudes van ouders ten aanzien van Comfort Talk als placebo-toepassing in de pediatrische zorg: Kansen en mogelijkheden om de ziekenhuiservaring voor kinderen te optimaliseren,"Krouwel, Frederieke","['Middendorp, H. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Angst, stress en pijn zijn veelvoorkomende verschijnselen gedurende ziekenhuiservaringen van kinderen. Verschillende placebo-toepassingen worden ingezet om dit te verminderen, waaronder Comfort Talk. Via kindgericht en effectief taalgebruik beoogt Comfort Talk de ziekenhuiservaring zo comfortabel mogelijk te maken. Het doel van dit onderzoek was om meer inzicht te krijgen in de attitudes van ouders jegens de acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit op angstreductie van Comfort Talk en de mogelijke rol van demografische en individuele ouder- en kindkenmerken. Als onderdeel van een lopend cross-sectioneel vragenlijstonderzoek zijn 12 ouders geïncludeerd waarvan hun kind maximaal een jaar geleden een ziekenhuisbehandeling heeft ondergaan. Ouders zien Comfort Talk als een acceptabele en (verwacht) effectieve methode om angst bij hun kind te verminderen en gaven gemiddeld een 8.43 ± 2.30 aan acceptabiliteit en een 8.26 ± 1.37 aan verwachte effectiviteit op angst (range 0-10). Andere bevindingen waren onder andere dat acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit op angst van Comfort Talk significant samenhangen met elkaar (rs = .79, p = .002). Van de meegenomen predictoren bleken alleen een hogere mate van optimisme en een betere behandelrelatie tussen zorgverlener en ouder significant samen te hangen met een hogere acceptabiliteit en/of verwachte effectiviteit. Er zijn, naast deze significante bevindingen, enkele interessante effectgroottes gevonden voor de predictoren angst van ouder, leeftijd van kind en type aandoening van kind. De bevindingen uit dit onderzoek tonen aan dat ouders positief staan tegenover Comfort Talk. Eventueel, kwalitatief, vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op achterliggende redenen waarom ouders een positieve of negatieve attitude hebben jegens Comfort Talk.",

Informatie over bijwerkingen kan echter ook nocebo-effecten oproepen, waarbij de verwachting zorgt voor het meer ervaren ervan. Authorized concealment is het met toestemming achterhouden van informatie over mogelijke bijwerkingen. Omdat kinderen nog niet zelfstandig kunnen beslissen over hun behandeling is de opinie van ouders en zorgverleners over het toepassen van authorized concealment van belang, om dit in de praktijk te kunnen toepassen. Het doel is om de acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit van authorized concealment binnen de pediatrische zorg te achterhalen van ouders (N=11) en zorgverleners (N=66). Er was een verschil in bereidheid bij het inleveren van het recht op informatie van de ouders en de plicht van informatieverstrekking van zorgverleners. Er was geen verschil tussen ouders en zorgverleners in de acceptabiliteit (6.97±2.52 vs. 7.26±2.32 op een 0-10 schaal; p= 0.71) en verwachte effectiviteit (6.47±1.95 vs. 7.38±1.98 op een 0-10 schaal; p= 0.16) van authorized concealment. Hoewel de leeftijd van het kind een middelmatige, niet-significante samenhang vertoonde met de de acceptabili teit en verwachte effectiviteit., hingen de openheid naar het kind over de behandeling en het vertrouwen in de primaire zorgverlener niet samen met de acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit. Dit onderzoek heeft het inzicht gegeven dat ouders en zorgverleners hoog sco ren op de acceptabiliteit en verwachte effectiviteit bij authorized concealment, maar dat toch veel ouders volledig geïnformeerd willen worden over de behandeling. Dit betekent dat er meer informatie moet komen over behandeling met authorized con cealment, voor een positiever behandelresultaat bij hun kind.",

Elf ouders van een kind dat in het afgelopen jaar een ziekenhuisbehandeling heeft ondergaan en 55 pediatrisch zorgverleners hebben de online vragenlijst ingevuld tussen April en Mei 2021. Vergeleken met ouders toonden zorgverleners een hogere acceptabiliteit (M=7.28, SD=2.15 vs. M=5.67, SD=3.12; p=.04) en verwachtten positievere effecten (M=6.97, SD=1.97 vs. M=5.17, SD=2.76; p=.01), waarbij de acceptatie en verwachte effectiviteit sterk gecorreleerd zijn (p<.001). Alleen bij ouders was meer placebo-kennis (p=.02) en de eerste behandeling van het kind (p=.05) gecorreleerd met een hogere acceptabiliteit. Er zijn geen significante verbanden gevonden voor andere eigenschappen, voor verwachte effectiviteit, of voor de zorgverleners. Verborgenheid werd gezien als een vereiste voor placebo-effecten door 64% van de ouders en 51% van de zorgverleners. De doorgaans positieve opvattingen tegenover open-label placebobehandelingen in de pediatrische zorg bieden potentie tot implementatie, ondanks een lacune in kennis dat misleiding vereist is voor placebo-effecten. Factoren als placebo-kennis en de eerste behandeling van het kind spelen mogelijk een rol in de attitude van ouders en kunnen in acht worden genomen bij toekomstig onderzoek in grotere steekproeven.",

Self-Efficacy and It’s Positive But Non-Mediating Relation to Openness and Rhythmic Tasks,"Wihelm, Anouk","['Perschl, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Self-efficacy is a widely researched concept describing someone's confidence in their capabilities to organize and carry out the courses of action that are necessary to manage prospective situations. Nonetheless, its effect on the personality trait openness and musical identity in relation to a rhythmic task has not yet been examined. This study used a tapping task to assess the tapping stability of people from different age ranges, personality traits and degree of musical identity. The aim of this study was to analyze the mediating effects of self-efficacy on personality and musical identity in relation to a rhythmic task. A sample of 98 participants with a mean age of 29 (min = 16, max = 69, SD = 14.8) completed measures of the general self-efficacy scale (GSEs), music coping and responsivity scale (MCRS) and the ten-item personality inventory (TIPI) in a 45-60 minute online experiment. Two mediation analyses were conducted and findings indicated that self-efficacy did not mediate the relationship between the personality trait openness and tapping performance but nevertheless showed a predictive relation with the personality trait openness and rhythmic performance. The second mediation model on the relation of musical identity and self-efficacy was shown to be non-significant. Perfectionism was discussed to be an important variable to be controlled for in further research since it could inhibit people high on musical identity to perform well. Moreover, this study calls for further inspection into musical identity research on rhythmic tasks since the results were incongruent with previous research.",
The Properties of Interpersonal Synchrony that Play a Role in Increasing Cooperativity,"Kok, Manca","['Perschl, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Cooperation and interpersonal synchronization are two diagnostic features of the human species. The relationship between these inherently social behaviours is interesting with regards to the mechanisms that are able to explain how and why the relationship arose during our evolutionary history. Interpersonal synchrony increases the ease of prediction of the movements of the other person, creating a rewarding experience that can reduce the psychological distance between the interaction partners. The current thesis studied the influence of interpersonal orchestral synchronization (in the form of an online musical dyadic tapping task) on cooperative attitude change. This was done by examining the relationships between the mode of tapping, the objective and subjective measures of synchrony and the changes in the attitudes towards the interaction partner. The findings suggest that, when it comes to increasing cooperative attitude, the way the participants experience synchrony is more influential than the actual quality of synchronization. The perception of synchrony, enabled to a different extent by the mode of tapping, gave rise to differences in the attitudes of the interaction partner, which appear to be important in predicting cooperative attitude change as well. All in all, the perceptive cues of synchrony seem to be the ones to guide the person’s cooperative attitude to be influenced by the interaction. Beyond the improvement of cooperative attitude, the observed decline brings new considerations of the importance of the evaluation of the synchronization experience as a whole and should encourage synchronization research with higher ecological validity.",

In deze studie is onderzocht welke kenmerken van placebo-toepassingen (behandelversterkend/behandelvervangend), het ziektebeeld (acuut/chronisch, oncologisch/cardiologisch/migraine), het kind (leeftijd en sekse) en de zorgverlener (kennis en gebruik van placebo-toepassingen) samenhangen met de acceptatie door drie typen zorgverleners (artsen/verpleegkundigen/medisch psychologen) van placebo toepassingen in de medische pediatrische zorg. Een online vragenlijst is afgenomen onder 62 pediatrisch zorgverleners. De placebo-kennis van de zorgverleners was groot (M = 6.31; SD = 0.71), met een hogere kennis bij artsen dan verpleegkundigen (p = .04). De typen zorgverleners verschilden niet (p-waarden ≥ .07) in hun gemiddeld hoge acceptabiliteit (M = 8.23; SD = 1.09) en gebruik (M = 7.42; SD = 1.77) van behandelversterkende placebo toepassingen.

Voor geen van de zorgverleners hing placebo-kennis en gebruik van placebo-toepassingen samen met acceptabiliteit (p-waarden ≥ .11). Behandelversterkende placebo-toepassingen werden voor alle ziekte- en kindkenmerken acceptabeler gevonden dan behandelvervangende placebo-toepassingen (p-waardes < .001).

"Relationship between gender, anxiety and stereotypical beliefs and spatial navigation in healthy subjects","Boos, Lorette","['Van Houdt, C.A.', 'Van der Ham, C.J.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Spatial navigation includes spatial actions, object location memory and wayfinding. We use our navigation abilities in our everyday environment to get to places and remember the route we have taken as well as to explore new environments. Differences in objective and subjective measures of spatial navigation have been studied in relation to specific disorders but have not been sufficiently measured in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the effect of individual factors in spatial navigation remains largely unknown. Yet, increasing our knowledge of the causes of individual differences and common biases in self-reports, such as stereotypical beliefs, is necessary to better assess navigation impairments and provide more efficient and personalized treatment interventions. We designed an online study to assess spatial navigation in healthy subjects from 18 to 35 years old. Our aim was to assess objective performance and performance estimation and investigate potential contributing factors, namely, gender, trait and state anxiety and stereotypical beliefs. Trait anxiety was found to be negatively associated with objective performance on several subtasks and with overestimation of performance. State anxiety did not seem to have any effect. Interestingly, objective performance and performance estimates were strongly correlated. We did not find any effect of gender and stereotypical beliefs on performance estimation. This study suggeststhat objective and subjective performance are influenced by trait anxiety. It should therefore be taken into account in the interpretation of tests results and questionnaires on navigation abilities.","['spatial navigation', 'objective performance', 'performance estimation', 'gender', 'trait and state anxiety', 'stereotypical beliefs.']"
Optimism and Fear in Expectations,"Laagland Winder, Matthias",['Opinions of parents and paediatric care providers on immersive virtual reality as placebo application in medical paediatric care'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"While immersive virtual reality (VR) is considered useful and effective in several paediatric care applications, it is dependent on its acceptability and expected efficacy. This study is one of the few investigating these factors in parents and paediatric care providers. Trait optimism, trait fear and age were recorded and their potential cohesion with acceptability and expected fear reduction of immersive VR placebo were assessed. An online survey was conducted in parents with a child hospitalized during the last 12 months and paediatric care providers. We found high levels of acceptability (M = 8.24, SD = 2.25) and expected fear reduction efficacy (M = 7.03, SD = 2.51) in the parent group and high levels of acceptability (M = 8.91, SD = 1.35) and expected fear reduction efficacy (M = 8.34 SD = 1.47) in the paediatric care provider group. A significant negative correlation was found between age and expected fear reduction efficacy (p = .01). No association was found between lower trait optimism and lower acceptability of immersive VR placebo in both parents (p = .47) and paediatric care providers (p = .97). Improving general acceptability and expected fear reduction efficacy in parents and health care providers of immersive VR application could lead to improvement on child patients’ quality of treatment and the administration of that treatment. Efforts to reduce trait fear may also aid improvement of acceptability of immersive VR application. This may improve the likelihood of immersive VR being implemented, thus improving paediatric care.",

The power of feeling good: An ecological momentary assessment study on how joy relates to mental health in students,"Peters, Mazimiliane","['Fried, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Poor mental health in students is deemed to be the next global crisis due to the increasing number and severity of symptoms. It is even further amplified by the effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many students are left alone and are not accommodated by their university, creating a vulnerable group to develop mental illnesses. However, joy as an intense and brief positive emotion may serve as a protective factor. Thus, this study aims to increase our understanding of the relationship between student mental health and the daily experience of joy. By utilizing an ecological momentary assessment for 15 days, 63 Dutch and international bachelor students enrolled at Leiden University were queried about their experience of their mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress) and joy. The data was interpreted by applying a network analysis that generates contemporaneous and temporal network models. The results illustrate that daily fluctuation of joy decreases subclinical measures of depression, anxiety, and stress within the same momentary assessment period on a contemporaneous level. On a temporal level, joy predicts future improvement of anhedonia, worrying, and relaxation, whereas worrying about the future predicts reduced joy. In accordance with prior literature, we conclude that joy may protect against future depressive symptoms and prevent the progression of anxiety. Additionally, joy may contribute to a stress-buffering effect. Bearing in mind the study’s limitations, future research should consider defining joy more precisely, capture the broad spectrum of mental health in EMA, and investigate joy's contribution to resilience.",
The Relation between Sedentary Behavior and Mental Health: An Ecological Network Analysis in a Student Sample,"Röttgers, Alisa","['Fried, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Sedentary behavior as a medical and psychological risk factor has gained attention in the last decade. However, little is yet known about its relevance in the subclinical student population, despite student’s elevated risk for the development of psychological disorders. To investigate the mutual interaction of sedentary behavior with state mental health variables, we conducted a 2-part study, consisting of a baseline questionnaire (N=66) and a 2-week ecological momentary assessment (N=63). The ecological momentary assessment took place 4 times per day and consisted of items assessing states of stress, anxiety and depression, as well as time spent engaging in sedentary behavior. A network analysis was then conducted based on the data from the ecological momentary assessment to investigate partial correlations between the assessed variables. A small relation between sedentary behavior and worrying was found, with worrying predicting sedentary behavior at the next time point with a partial correlation of 0.08. This finding is discussed and evaluated based on strenghts and limitations of the study, with a focus on factors that could have limited statistical power. Future research could be advanced by creating validated measures in terms of ecological momentary assessment items as well as a modern sedentary behavior questionnaire.",
Feelings of loneliness and poor mental health during the Covid19 pandemic: An Ecological Momentary Assessment about the subjective feeling of loneliness in bachelor students,"Gehring, Sarah Elaine","['Fried, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"People had to adjust their daily lives as a result of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, which emerged in December 2019, and was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Uncertainty about the future and social distancing rules had a significant influence on individual’s mental wellbeing. Previous research suggests that the pandemic is expected to have a consequential impact on mental health. This research looks at the complex relationship between the subjective feeling of loneliness and mental health variables among university bachelor students at Leiden University during the third wave of Covid-19 infections and its associated restrictions. The research began in late March 2021and started with a baseline assessment to acquire basic information of the participants. Over the course of 15 days an Ecological Momentary Assessment was used to measure the mental health of 66 students, four times a day. The surveys included questions from the DASS-21 and UCLA Loneliness scale. Through the use of a network analysis a vicious loop between mental health variables and isolation was discovered, as well as loneliness being a potential predictor for mental health problems. The study points out that loneliness is an important component when tackling mental health issues in students.",

One variable that often influences mental health is fatigue. Prior research has found a strong association between fatigue and psychiatric disorders. The study investigated if the level of fatigue influences depression, anxiety, and stress or vice versa. Method: For 15 days and 4 times a day, students were asked questions on their smartphones regarding symptoms of depression, stress, anxiety, and fatigue. With this data, network models estimated the relationship between those variables. Results: Sample descriptives, mental health descriptives, time series data, and network models were made. The network models show that the strongest relationships between variables are between stress and anxiety and between depression items. The temporal network shows a bidirectional link between fatigue and having a bad outlook on the future. Discussion: In spite of its limitations, conclusions about the link between fatigue and outlook on the future can be drawn.",
Less is More: The Influence of Active Social Media Use on Mental Health in University Students,"Fuhrmann, Clara","['Fried, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In light of the growing mental health crisis in university students and increased social media usage in this population, we conducted the present study to investigate a potential relationship. Previous research reports conflicting results about the psychological consequences of social media use. Findings differ depending on the user’s engagement with social networking sites. Active social media use, commenting, and messaging, versus passive use, lurking, and browsing, may benefit mental health. The present study used Ecological Momentary Assessment to collect data at different time points during the day. The sample consisted of Leiden University students (N=63) who were recruited online. Participants reported about their social media use and filled out the DASS-21 before answering four questionnaires per day for fifteen days through a smartphone application. Throughout the length of the study, participants were asked two DASS-21 items for depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms each and how much time they spend with active SNS activities in the last three hours. Analysis and visualization were provided via a contemporaneous and a temporal model, showing partial correlations and predictions. Depressive and anxiety symptoms did not relate to active social media use on the contemporaneous level. However, one stress symptom, feeling irritable, related to using social media in an active way. No relations between depressive and stress symptoms and active social media use were found on the temporal level. One anxiety symptom, worrying, predicted using social media actively and vice versa. The current findings are discussed in terms of possible explanations and implications for future research.",

Studies indicate that parental ethnic prejudice is associated with children’s ethnic prejudice. How parents think and talk about multiculturalism may similarly play a role in the development of children’s ethnic prejudice. In this study with (N = 80) White Dutch mothers and their children, it was examined if there would be a negative relation between maternal views on multiculturalism and children’s ethnic prejudice towards Black and Muslim children and if these relations would be negatively mediated by maternal ethnic-racial socialization. Two separate mediation models (one predicting ethnic prejudice towards Black children, the other predicting ethnic prejudice towards Muslim children) were run using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. No significant relations were found between maternal views on multiculturalism and children’s ethnic prejudice towards either out-groups and maternal ethnic-racial socialization did not mediate these relations. However, most of the directions of the relations are in accordance with this study’s hypotheses. More research is needed and future reseach could use different approaches (e.g., larger sample, child reports of parental views, the views of both parents on multiculturalism, different cohorts existing of younger and older children or a longitudinal design) to gain more knowledge about the role that parents play in the development of their children’s ethnic prejudice. In this way parents could be informed about their role and how they might be able to prevent ethnic prejudice in their children.",

Neuroscientific network analysis of executive functions and resting-state EEG oscillations in patients with a psychiatric disorder,"Janse, Adinda","['Houdt, C. van', 'Habers, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Executive functions (EF) are often impaired in patients with a psychiatric disorder, even after treatment. The neuropsychological assessment Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) measures cognitive function, including EF, which is located in the prefrontal cortex. EF performance is associated with prefrontal lobe function and deficits lead to difficulties in everyday functioning. Psychiatry is, in addition to current psychological measures, in search of biological underlying mechanisms. However, the clinical practice lacks biomarkers for investigating psychopathology. Electroencephalography (EEG) has promising utility to measure electrical brain activity, thereby having potential as a biomarker in clinical practice to ease describing, diagnosing and detecting neuropsychological functions. The objective of this study was to estimate a partialcorrelations network of three EF domains and EEG oscillations. A sample of 216 patients with a psychiatric DSM-5 diagnosis conducted a CANTAB assessment and an EEG-scan. In a network analysis, the EF subdomains were correlated to closed-eye resting state EEG oscillations. It was found that alpha oscillations positively correlate (r = .12) with performance on spatial planning tasks (One Touch Stockings of Cambridge: OTS), whereas theta oscillations negatively correlate (r = -.17) with performance on this task. Accordingly, alpha oscillations are suitable for the detection of high prefrontal lobe function performance, , whereas theta oscillations indicate a lower prefrontal lobe function. Therefore, EEG could have practical implications as a biomarker of EF performance.",

Transparantie tijdens een behandeling met placebo-toepassingen in de pediatrische zorg: De opinie van ouders ten aanzien van transparantie naar het kind toe rondom het gebruik van placebo-toepassingen in de zorg voor hun kind; de mogelijke rol van leeftijd en reden van behandeling van het kind,"Fierst van Wijnandsbergen, Robin","['Middendorp, H. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Placebo-toepassingen als aanvulling of vervanging van een behandeling kunnen bijdragen aan een verbetering van de zorg voor kinderen. In de zorg is het belangrijk om transparant te zijn naar de patiënt over de behandeling. De mate van dit belang zou per leeftijdscategorie kunnen verschillen. Dit transparantieprincipe botst met bepaalde kenmerken van placebo toepassingen. Onderzoek naar de mening van ouders ontbreekt en is cruciaal voor de ontwikkeling van de zorg voor kinderen. Ouders worden namelijk betrokken in het maken van beslissingen voor en met hun kind. Met een cross-sectioneel vragenonderzoek werd data verzameld van tien ouders met kinderen (0-18 jaar) die een ziekenhuisbehandeling hebben gehad in het laatste jaar voor een chronische of acute reden. Ouders vonden het belangrijk dat er transparantie is naar het kind toe (M = 8.90, SD = 0.88 op een 0-10 schaal) en dit hing niet significant samen met leeftijd van het kind (p = .33). Verder was er geen verschil tussen de twee typen placebo-toepassing (behandelversterkend vs. behandelvervangend) wat betreft invloed op de verwachte transparantie (p = .70). Het blijkt dat er een grote variëteit is in de beoordeling van ouders betreffende de transparantie naar het kind bij het toevoegen van een placebo-toepassing die niet samenhangt met de reden van behandeling, chronisch of acuut, de leeftijd van het kind tijdens deze behandeling of het type placebo-toepassing. Er is meer onderzoek nodig om te kunnen bepalen of de bevindingen van dit onderzoek kunnen bijdragen aan de bereidheid om placebo-toepassingen toe te voegen in de zorg voor kinderen.","['Placebo', 'childcare', 'pediatrics', 'transparency', 'open-label placebo']"
Level of Optimism as a Moderator in the Relationship between Stress and Sleep,"Mafait, Yentl","['Çetin, M.E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research findings on the interrelationships between stress and sleep, stress and optimism, optimism and sleep have been found in the literature. However, a possible relationship between all three of these variables together remains unstudied. Understanding this relationship and whether these relationships are interdependent, may provide new prevention and intervention opportunities for sleep- or stress-related health problems. The current study aimed to investigate whether the relationship between perceived stress and sleep quality depends on the level of optimism. The study employed a quantitative and quasi experimental design, with data collected cross-sectionally via online self-report questionnaires. The Life Orientation Test Revised was administered to measure the level of optimism, the Perceived Stress Scale was administered to measure the level of stress, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was administered to assess sleep quality. To examine the hypothesis that the level of optimism will moderate the relationship between level of perceived stress and sleep quality, a moderated hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was conducted on data from 250 respondents. The results revealed that the level of perceived stress was able to predict sleep quality (b = .14, p < .001), but the level of optimism failed to predict sleep quality (b = -.05, p > .05) and no evidence was found for the moderating role of optimism in the relationship between perceived stress and sleep quality (b = .002, p > .05). It is possible that the baseline sleep quality was not poor enough, and there were not enough people with low levels of optimism to detect whether the level of optimism could interfere with the relationship between perceived stress and sleep quality. However, the role of optimism within this relationship can be studied more in the future, with better-informed research designs.","['optimism', 'sleep quality', 'perceived stress', 'moderation']"
The Relationship between Optimism and Health-related Quality of Life in a Healthy Population,"Verhagen, Madelief","['Çetin, M.E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Different studies have researched the effect of optimism on health-related quality of life in various patient groups. The relationship between these two constructs in a healthy population has not been studied yet and thus the aim of this study was to look at the potential effects of optimism on different aspects of health-related quality of life in a healthy population. This was tested with an independent samples t-test using data from online self-administered questionnaires. These were the Life Orientation Test-Revised, which measures optimism, and the 12 Item Short Form Survey (SF-12), which measures health-related quality of life. The main finding was that higher scores on optimism were associated with significantly better ratings of health-related quality of life. This significant association was found for both components of health-related quality of life assessed in the SF-12. Those with higher optimism scores had both a significantly higher physical component score (p < .05) and a significantly higher mental component score (p < .001) than those with lower optimism scores. A possible explanation for this finding is argued to be that the relation between optimism and health-related quality of life is mediated by engagement in health-enhancing behaviors. A limitation was that the research design of the study was cross-sectional, limiting the interpretations that could be made about the directionality of the established association. A longitudinal and experimental design would be beneficial in future research to examine whether optimism has a direct effect on health-related quality of life.","['optimism', 'health-related quality of life', 'physical health', 'mental health', 'health-enhancing behaviors']"
Optimism and Social Functioning by the Numbers,"Weerts, Marijne","['Çetin, M.E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social functioning is a health outcome, but unlike many other health outcomes, its relation to optimism has not been studied before in a healthy population. In this study, the Life Orientation Test-Revised was used to measure levels of optimism and the Social Functioning Questionnaire was used to measure levels of social functioning. The final sample consisted of 250 respondents and they were divided into two groups (low and high) according to their optimism scores. It was hypothesized that there would be a significant difference between the low optimism and high optimism groups in their level of social functioning. An independent samples t-test was conducted and the results showed that the individuals in the high optimism group had significantly better social functioning scores than the individuals in the low optimism group (p < .001). Although an association between the level of optimism and social functioning has been found, the main limitation of the study was that the data were collected cross-sectionally and the level of optimism was not manipulated experimentally, meaning that no causal inferences could be made from the data. Conducting an experimental and longitudinal study could show whether there is such a direct effect and reveal the direction of this potential effect.","['social functioning', 'optimism', 'mental health', 'physical health']"
Executive Functioning in a New Perspective: Does Optimism Predict Success in Executive Functioning?,"Winkelhorst, Katie","['Çetin, M.E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research on optimism has increased in the past years. Optimism is known to have a positive relationship with several health outcomes. Additionally, optimism has also been established as a predictor of various mental and physical health outcomes. Whilst the relationship between optimism and executive functioning has been discussed, little is known about optimism as a predictor of success in executive functioning. In this study, data from 250 respondents was collected through online questionnaires to study whether optimism is a significant predictor of success in executive functioning in general, as well as in separate aspects of attention, self-control and self-monitoring, and planning. The measuring instruments that were used were the Life-Orientation Test-Revised for optimism and the Amsterdam Executive Function Inventory for executive functioning and its aspects. Four simple linear regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. The results showed that optimism is a significant predictor of executive functioning in general (b = .22, p < .001), as well as of attention (b = .13, p < .001) and planning (b = .06, p < .05), but not of self-control and self-monitoring (p > .05). The main limitation in this study was that data were collected cross-sectionally instead of longitudinal. For self-control and self-monitoring, further research could be beneficial to understand what made this outcome differ from the others. These outcomes could be helpful to further investigate possible implications for the treatment of neuropsychological problems.","['optimism', 'executive functioning', 'attention', 'self-control and self-monitoring', 'planning']"
The association between mindfulness and student well-being during 15 days of ecological momentary assessment,"Kokkomäki, Ville","['Fried, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Coronavirus disease 2019 has negatively affected the general population, and especially university undergraduates. Attending to and being aware of the present moment in an open, accepting and compassionate manner (i.e. mindfulness) has been shown to decrease depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, and increase positive affect. In our present study, we used network analysis to examine the associations between anxiety, depression, stress, mindfulness and joy. An observational research design was used with a convenience sample of 66 undergraduate students aged 18 to 34 years who completed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) on their phones. They were asked eight questionsーtwo psychological constructs and six subclinical psychopathology symptomsーfour times a day for two weeks. Network analysis resulted in temporal and contemporaneous network models, indicating that mindfulness at time t does not significantly predict any variable at later time t+1 on the temporal level. At the contemporaneous level, mindfulness is associated with depression, anxiety, stress, and joy. Given the limitations of the present study and the hypothesis generating nature of network analysis, we conclude that the significant partial correlations between mindfulness, psychological well-being and joy in the contemporaneous network may indicate potential causal relations worth following up on in future research.","['mindfulness', 'joy', 'psychological well-being', 'COVID-19', 'ecological momentary assessment', 'network approach']"
Tapping in Time Together: Investigating the Effects of Musicality and Empathy on Interpersonal Synchrony,"Beemsterboer, Emilie","['Perschl, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The scientific community is trying uncover and understand the underlying mechanisms of music, movement and social cognition. As an attempt to do so, this thesis proposes an interactive model that hypothesizes a relationship between tapping ability and interpersonal synchrony, moderated by musicality and interpersonal synchrony. Furthermore, this study predicts that there is a relationship between these two moderators as well and that musicality predicts empathic perspective-taking. A sample of 209 participants was recruited to take part in an online experiment that included questionnaires on empathy and music, as well as a tapping task in which participants tapped along to music with another person on the screen and rated their feelings of synchrony with them. The results showed that even though the interaction of tapping ability and musicality and that of tapping ability and empathic perspective-taking were not significant, the full model did turn out to be significant. In addition, musicality significantly predicted the scores on empathic perspective-taking. These results strengthen the existing literature on the socially adaptive effects of synchrony and the connection between the mechanisms present in movement to music and empathic abilities. It is concluded that the knowledge from this study can be applied to treatment and non-clinical populations, but that more research is needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms of music, movement and social cognition by exploring different interaction models.","['interpersonal synchrony', 'empathy', 'music', 'movement', 'moderation']"
Effect of Music on Felt and Perceived Emotion and the Role of Empathy,"Dulk, Lieke den","['Perschl, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Emotion is one of the most important reasons why people listen to music. The present study looked at how perceived and felt emotions are elicited by music by measuring valence and arousal, and the effect of tempo on this ratings. The role of empathy in the relationship between perceived and felt emotions was also investigated. 153 participants were recruited and asked to listen to positive, neutral, and negative music pieces by completing a tapping task. The results showed that there is an association between tempo and perceived and felt emotions and that there are differences between perceived and felt emotions for positive, neutral, and negative music pieces. Furthermore, it was shown that empathy acts a moderator for the differences between perceived and felt emotions. In this way, how different emotions are evoked by music was studied and the role of empathy in this mechanism. This has important implications for understanding how emotions are used during social interactions and can be helpful for the development of therapeutic approaches that make use of music.","['emotions', 'music', 'tempo', 'empathy']"
"The Sound of Empathy: Investigating the Relationship between Musicality, Sensorimotor Synchronization and Empathy","Huß, Hannah","['Perschl, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research on the topic of social cognition and music suggests a close interconnectedness of musical abilities and socio-cognitive abilities like emotion recognition, perspective taking and empathy. As part of a larger research project, the present study aimed to specifically investigate the link between musicality, sensorimotor synchronization, and empathy. It was hypothesized that musicality would predict empathy scores, and that tapping ability would mediate this relationship. A total of 153 participants completed the online study. A significant relationship was found between musicality and empathy scores, and musicality was found to be predictive of empathy. However, tapping ability did not mediate thisrelationship and was not significantly associated with musicality or empathy. As part of an exploratory analysis, musical skill alone was found to be predictive of tapping ability, but neither of these variables predicted empathy scores. Results of the current study suggest that individuals with higher musical responsiveness, engagement, and more emotional use of music in combination with better musical skills score higher on measures of perspective taking and empathic concern. However, results also suggest that musical or rhythmic skills alone are not indicative of empathic abilities, and that musical or rhythmic training alone may not be enough to affect socio-cognitive abilities. Increasing the (emotional) engagement with, or responsiveness to music through shared musical interaction may offer a way of promoting empathy, and therefore also social competence and prosocial, altruistic behaviors.","['musicality', 'sensorimotor synchronization', 'empathy']"

We assessed the arousal level of each participant before and after the musical task to investigate music-induced arousal. The participants' memory of background items, as well as their enjoyment of the musical activity, were assessed. While arousal and enjoyment levels fluctuate during the musical activities, the arousal change had no significant effect on enjoyment levels. Levels of enjoyment had no significant effect on memory recall. These findings show evidence that refutes the idea that arousal and enjoyment have distinct effects on recall. Instead, the present findings support previous research that enjoyment of the musical experience and musical arousal interplay a critical role in the relationship between music-induced arousal and memory.","['Music', 'arousal', 'enjoyment', 'recall']"
Social Cognition & Music: The Influence of Extraversion On Preference of Background Music During Study or Work Time,"Lakho, Quinty","['Perschl, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this study, the potential relationship between extraversion and preference of background music during study or work time was investigated. This research was executed in order to contribute to the lack of knowledge regarding music psychology, thereby aiming to find correlations between social cognition, specifically personality, and music. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic stressed the importance of developments in work-from-home innovations, work efficiency and well-being. Therefore, it was also aimed to find relations between the findings of this study and the practical implications regarding the pandemic. All participants engaged in a 45-60 minutes online study consisting of several questions regarding different areas of social cognition, such as cooperation, personality and rhythmic tapping. Results showed extraversion significantly influencing the preference of background music during study or work time. The higher an individual scored on the spectrum of extraversion, the more likely they are to listen to vocal, arousal-seeking music. On the other hand, the lower an individual scored on the spectrum of extraversion, the more likely they are to listen to arousal-avoiding music, if preferred to listen to music at all. Practically, extraverted individuals should listen to arousal-seeking music during work or study time and introverted individuals should listen to arousal-avoiding music or no music at all in order to improve working from home.","['extraversion', 'background music', 'music psychology', 'personality', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'work-from-home innovations']"
De impact van de Coronapandemie op het mentaal welbevinden van Nederlanders en de rol van toegewijd handelen,"Bogaerdt, Jolijn van den","['Koppert, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Doel. De Coronapandemie en de maatregelen die overheden hebben genomen tegen de verspreiding ervan, kunnen zijn weerslag hebben op het mentaal welbevinden van de bevolking. We hebben de samenhang tussen stress en mentaal welbevinden getoetst en we hebben getoetst of toegewijd handelen, een onderdeel van psychologische flexibiliteit, de impact van stress op het mentaal welbevinden buffert. Methoden. We analyseerden de data van online enquêtes afgenomen bij de algemene Nederlandse bevolking in 2018 en tijdens de eerste (mei 2020) en tweede (maart 2021) piek van de Coronapandemie. Er is een variantieanalyse gebruikt om te zien of er een samenhang is tussen stress gemeten in jaren en mentaal welbevinden, waarbij er is gecontroleerd voor leeftijd, geslacht, opleidingsniveau en burgerlijke status. Resultaten. Het mentaal welbevinden van Nederlanders tijdens de Coronapandemie in 2020 en 2021 verschilde niet significant van het mentaal welbevinden vóór de pandemie in 2018 (p = .280). Een hoge mate van toegewijd handelen werd wel geassocieerd met een hogere mate van mentaal welbevinden (p < .001), maar buffert niet de impact van stress op het mentaal welbevinden. Conclusies. De stress veroorzaakt door de Coronapandemie in 2021 en 2020 heeft niet gezorgd voor een lager mentaal welbevinden bij de Nederlandse bevolking in vergelijking met 2018. Daarnaast fungeert toegewijd handelen ook niet als buffer tegen de impact van stress tijdens de Coronapandemie op het mentaal welbevinden. Wel is er een samenhang tussen mentaal welbevinden en toegewijd handelen in het algemeen, maar niet ten tijde van de Coronapandemie. Met deze bevinding kan bij toekomstig onderzoek rekening mee worden gehouden, wanneer een zelfde of ander soort crisis ontstaat waarbij de bevolking wel een lager mentaal welbevinden ontwikkelt.","['Mental well-being', 'committed action', 'psychological flexibility', 'Corona', 'COVID-19', 'pandemic', 'crisis']"

The effects of voice procedure were examined by means of an experimental study among UK citizens (N = 168). We offer our participants an experimental scenario where a project developer plans to build a wind farm near their house. Depending on the experimental condition, participants were told that they could voice their opinion and that this was considered in the decision-making process (voice), that they could voice their opinion but that this was not considered (pseudo-voice) or that they could not voice their opinion (no-voice). We hypothesised and found that giving voice to citizens increases perceived procedural fairness, which in turn increases trust in the project developer and project acceptance (versus no-voice and pseudo-voice). In addition, this research predicted higher perceived procedural fairness, trust in the project developer and project acceptance in people who were given pseudo-voice compared to no-voice. However, the results did not support this. Other factors found to be positively relating to citizens’ project acceptance were perceived community benefits and general attitudes towards wind farms. This research concludes that giving voice to citizens increases perceived procedural fairness, trust in the project developer and project acceptance, provided that this voice is actually considered by the project developer.","['citizen voice in decision-making (voice, no-voice, pseudo-voice)', 'trust in project developer', 'project acceptance', 'perceived procedural fairness', 'renewables', 'wind energy']"

Het is daarom belangrijk dat er inzicht gekregen wordt in de factoren die de mate van acceptatie van de bouw van windparken bepalen. Het huidige onderzoek had tot doel om te achterhalen wat het effect is van inspraak door lokale belanghebbenden in de besluitvorming op de acceptatie van de bouw van de windparken, vergeleken met pseudo-inspraak en geen inspraak. Dit werd gedaan door middel van een experimenteel onderzoek, dat voorgelegd werd aan 199 participanten die wonen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk. In het onderzoek werd ook een sequentieel mediatie model getest, dat beschrijft hoe inspraak een positief effect zal hebben op acceptatie, doordat de inspraakmogelijkheid de waargenomen procedurele rechtvaardigheid vergroot, wat vervolgens het vertrouwen in de autoriteit vergroot. Dit verhoogde vertrouwen zorgt vervolgens voor een grotere mate van acceptatie van de bouw van het windpark. De resultaten lieten zoals verwacht zien dat inspraak, vergeleken met pseudo-inspraak en geen inspraak, een positief effect heeft op acceptatie, via de mediatoren. In tegenstelling tot wat voorspeld werd bleek pseudo-inspraak, ten opzichte van geen inspraak, geen significant effect te hebben op zowel de mediatoren als de mate van acceptatie. Ook werd gevonden dat risicopercepties over horizonvervuiling, geluidsoverlast en gezondheidsschade een significante negatieve relatie hebben met acceptatie van het windpark.

This task has therefore been used as a measure of self-directed executive functioning. Previous studies have found that SVF performance improves through childhood and adolescence. This developmentalimprovement has been observed both in the total number of words produced during the task and in switching between subcategories. The present online study tested the hypothesis that the agerelated improvement in SVF performance is partly driven by an improved ability to select between competing word representations. The study included three age groups: 8–10-year-olds (n=26), 12–14-year-olds (n=17), and young adults (n=31). The semantic blocking effect in the blocked cycling naming task was used as a measure of selection abilities. Measures of vocabulary and general processing speed were included as control variables. Age-related differences in SVF performance were only partly replicated: there were signs of age-related differences in the total word count but not in switching. The semantic blocking effect was replicated across age groups. However, there were no signs of age-related differences in the magnitude of this effect, suggesting that word selection abilities did not differ between age groups. Moreover, the magnitude of the semantic blocking effect did not predict SVF performance. Thus, although further research is needed, the present study does not support the hypothesis that the age-related improvement in SVF would be driven by an improvement in selection abilities.","['semantic verbal fluency', 'blocked cyclic naming', 'cognitive development', 'executive functioning', 'word selection']"

Additionally, the current study further contributed to the research on RIF by examining the mean reaction times of both age groups throughout the study. The main findings of the study demonstrated that for the sample used, RIF was not found in terms of percentage of correct items nor the reaction time of the children across the different items.

What if they don’t like me? How Rejection Sensitivity affects Frontal Midline-Theta power levels during unexpected rejection in socially anxious individuals.,"Toor, Laura van","['Molen, M.J.W. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Although Social Anxiety is well-understood, the neural mechanisms behind this phenomenon are still under debate. Recent research suggests that Frontal Midline Theta power level expression seems indicative of the emotional processing of social evaluative feedback. However, it is still unclear what pattern this FM-theta expression follows in Socially Anxious individuals. The FM-theta power responses to social evaluative feedback in Rejection Sensitive people is not investigated thoroughly yet, although recent research points to a clear increase in FM-theta power in responses to unexpected rejection. In the current study, utilizing a social evaluative learning task, we tested whether the construct Rejection Sensitivity could influence the relationship between social anxiety and FM theta power expression in 12 female participants. Social feedback was provided by peers who provided positive social feedback in fixed numbers, creating Peer 1 who would provide positive social feedback in 85% of trials and Peer 4, who would provide positive social feedback in 15% of trials. We also examined which coping mechanisms are utilized more often in both Socially Anxious and Rejection Sensitive population (e.g. self-blaming, other blaming, catastrophizing, rumination, acceptance, refocusing, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective). Correlation analyses revealed a strong negative correlation between Rejection Sensitivity and FM-theta level expression in unexpected rejection by Peer 1, whereby lower FM-theta levels were associated with higher Rejection Sensitivity. A large, positive and significant correlation between receiving unexpected rejection and unexpected acceptance by Peer 4 was observed. Unfortunately, the main question about the influence of Rejection Sensitivity on the relationship between Social Anxiety and FM-theta power as a response to social evaluative feedback, could not be answered due to methodological issues related to a small sample size. These issues also led the analysis of coping mechanisms to be invalid and therefore no results are indicative as to which coping mechanisms are utilized more often. Finally, FM-theta band activity seems to be a servicing as a reactive error correcting mechanism, which might lead to clear responses in Rejection Sensitive people, but not necessary in Socially Anxious individuals, who suffer more from anticipating fears. Therefore, it seems somewhat unsure whether FM theta is completely suitable for the investigation of emotional processing within Socially Anxious people. It is advised for future studies to include a larger sample.","['Coping', 'EEG', 'Theta power', 'Peer feedback', 'Rejection Sensitivity', 'Social Anxiety', 'Unexpected Rejection']"
The Price of a Missed Opportunity: Defining Financial Inertia: A prototype analysis,"Maksimovikj, Vladimir","['Rooij, R. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Inertia as a concept in the natural sciences has been used since Newtonian times. However, the social science literature still struggles in defining inertia and its many variations. In current social science literature, numerous definitions exist that define inertia differently; consequently, not much is known about inertia (Bozzo, 2002). Furthermore, inertia is often confounded with related phenomena, such as procrastination and status-quo bias (Cui et al., 2020). This ultimately hinders the effective study of inertia, as the quality of a theory or research is only as good as the quality of the definition that is used for the studied phenomenon (Rozin, 2009). The current study adds to the inertia literature by utilizing a prototype approach in defining “financial inertia”. For the purposes of this study “financial inertia” is viewed as inertia in a financial setting. Compared to classical definitions, a prototype definition is more encompassing and is not hindered by absolutes. Through a prototype analysis, we asked laymen in the United States of America and United Kingdom about their thoughts, views, and feelings regarding financial decision making. Afterwards, using this data we identified a list of features related to financial decision making (Study 1) and used these features to calculate their centrality in relation to financial inertia (Study 2). Centrality refers to the relatedness of these features to financial inertia and was used to divide the features into central features (more related) and peripheral features (related to a lesser extent). Using the gathered data, this paper proposes a working definition of financial inertia in the hopes of clarifying inertia literature and aiding the creation of an instrument that measures financial inertia. As we assume that all that applies to “financial inertia” reciprocally 4 applies to inertia itself, the current findings will contribute to future research on this topic as well.","['inertia', 'financial inertia', 'status-quo bias', 'procrastination', 'prototype analysis']"

This was a single-blind controlled study in which the participants reported their sleep quality on the PSQI and KSS and their vigilance performance was measured with the Psychomotor Vigilance Task. After two weeks of intervention, wearing blue-light filter glasses in the experimental condition and listening to music in the control condition, follow-up measures were registered. Measures of total sleep quality and sleep latency increased and vigilance reaction times decreased over time in the analysis of variances with repeated measures. These changes could not be explained by the use of blue-light filter glasses or the relation between vigilance and sleep quality. The expected positive relation between sleep quality and cognitive performance was not supported by these findings. In conclusion, this study does not provide convincing support for blue-light filter glasses as an effective aid for poor sleep quality.

The Potential Role of Attachment and Cortisol Reactivity in the Development of Internalizing Problems in Childhoo,"Fischer, David","['Tollenaar, M.S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Children’s early life experiences cause the emergence of individual differences in stress coping and social behavior. Attachment styles (AS) conceptualize stable behavioral patterns in response to stress and can predict long-term susceptibility to mental illness. This study investigates the relationship between 1-year-old infants’ AS, their hormonal stress response in terms of cortisol reactivity (CR) - both assessed in the course of the Strange Situation procedure - and the influence of these factors on children’s scores on the Child Behavior Checklist’s internalizing behavior problem scale (CBCL-I) five years later. Based on previous research, CR was expected to be higher with insecure compared to secure AS. Insecure AS and higher CR in infancy were expected to be associated with higher CBCL-I scores in later childhood. CR was hypothesized to partly mediate the relationship between AS and CBCL-I. Relevant longitudinal data (n=220; 40.8% female, 51.7% male) were drawn from a sample of mother-child dyads (“BIBO” research project). No evidence for any of the hypotheses could be found, as the analyses yielded no statistically significant associations between AS and CBCL-I scores, AS and CR, or CR and CBCL-I. Consequently, testing for CR’s potential mediating role was deemed irrelevant. The results contradict previous findings and raise important questions. The study’s limitations are discussed and suggestions are derived to inform future research on stress pathways in the pathogenesis of mental disorder. Above all, the poorly understood role of potentially decisive covariates in the interplay between AS, CR, and internalizing behavior need to be investigated more thoroughly.","['childhood', 'stress', 'attachment style', 'cortisol reactivity', 'internalizing behavior problems']"

Through studying trends of aid distribution we find that the ability to mitigate and recover from the harms of a natural disaster is distributed according to existing socio-economic structures favouring the privileged. By applying relative deprivation theory this study explores how horizontal inequalities of aid increase economic inequalities. Subsequently, economic inequalities can be employed to mobilise organised violence, given there is a financial opportunity presented by international development aid. A sub-national empirical analysis is conducted that includes 171 first order administrative divisions across five South East Asian countries. Using data covering the World Bank’s aid distribution from 1995- 2009 an indicator is calculated that measures the level of inequality. The binary logistic regression finds that the more unequal the aid distribution, the less likely organised violence is to occur.","['aid distribution', 'natural disaster', 'relative deprivation', 'organised violence', 'subnational']"

At T1, participants were 205 adolescents between 12 and 17 years old (mean age=14.81 year, SD=1.31, 49.3% female). This study also replicated past studies that investigated gender differences in depression and stress responses including coping. The Response to Stress Questionnaire was used as an instrument to assess adolescents’ reaction and coping methods to social stressors, whereby the participants indicated the ways in which they react to social stressors on a four-point scale. Furthermore, the depressive symptoms of the participants were measured with the Children Depression Inventory at two time points two years apart, whereby the participants answer a 27-item self-report questionnaire. Based on the results of the statistical analyses, there were no significant gender differences in depression, nor were there significant age-related differences in depression between adolescent girls and boys. There were, however, significant gender differences in stress responses, namely Primary Control Engagement coping and Involuntary Engagement stress response. And finally, Primary Control Engagement coping, gender, and depression at T1 significantly predicted depression at T2, however the interaction effects of gender, age, and gender by age with the stress response did not significantly predict depression at T2. In conclusion, later depression can be predicted by stress responses, however gender and age do not moderate this prediction.","['depression', 'stress response', 'social stress', 'adolescent', 'gender', 'age']"

Participants were recruited via the online data platform Academic Prolific (n = 78). Analyses of variance (ANOVA) showed that the manipulations of the research were successful. Thereafter, a hierarchical regression analysis showed a positive and significant direct relation of psychological ownership of the organization with willingness to donate. Then, a one-way ANOVA demonstrated that participants allocated to the ‘intimate knowledge’ - condition reported significantly more psychological ownership of the organization than participants allocated to the control condition.

Subsequently, a mediation regression analysis showed that having intimate knowledge of the organization relates indirectly and significantly to the willingness to donate to the organization among people targeted by a marketing campaign, through psychological ownership of the organization as a mediator. Theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and suggestions for further research, will be discussed.","['Psychological ownership of the organization', 'willingness to donate', 'marketing campaigns', 'non-profit organizations', 'intimate knowledge', 'investment of the self']"
The Target Class Effect: Facilitation by Need Concerns and Attenuation by Moral Identity,"Agbenyo, Jennifer","['Doesum, N. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Perceptions about one’s social class has social consequences on interactional decision making. Studies have shown that the social class of an interaction partner (i.e., the target) predicts how prosocial one will be towards this target. Lower-class targets elicit greater prosociality than higher-class targets, known as the target class effect. The present study (N = 294) replicated this effect in the US with an online survey. We operationalized social mindfulness (SoMi) as a measure for prosociality, while manipulating target class with information about the target’s position on a social ladder. The objective was to explore fairness and moral perspectives as underlying explanations for the target class effect. We proposed that need-based distributive fairness preference (i.e., taking the needs of others into consideration when allocating resources) and moral identity will facilitate and attenuate the target class effect respectively. Our findings did not support these expectations. Implications, limitations, and future directions are further discussed.","['perceived social class', 'moral identity', 'distributive fairness', 'social mindfulness', 'prosocial behaviour']"

Does the heart feel pain? Examining the effects of social rejection on beat-to-beat heart rate.,"Vlasman-Nugter, Nadina","['Molen, M.J.W. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social rejection is conceptualized as a threat to survival, yet the physiological mechanisms at work during social rejection have not received much attention. Prior research has shown a link between heart rate changes and social rejection and the possible correlation of self-esteem levels to heart rate changes. Here we examined the effect of positive and negative peer feedback on heart rate changes of participants. Fifty participants (mean age = 20.4) took part in the newly developed social evaluation through feedback (SELF)- paradigm where they predicted, then received social evaluative feedback from four peers who differed in their probability of giving social acceptance versus rejection feedback. We hypothesized that social rejection would result in a transient slowing of heart rate and that this effect would be more prominent with unexpected social rejection. We also expected to find a significant difference in heart rate changes towards each different peer. Moreover, we expected self-esteem to influence heart rate reactions to feedback. As predicted, results revealed a more pronounced deceleration of heart rate during unexpected rejection, though this effect was also found with unexpected social acceptance. Difference in heart rate in response to feedback from each different peers was found, namely a transient slowing of heart rate for negative feedback from Peer 1 and positive feedback from Peer 4. Moreover, levels of self-esteem did not explain a significant amount of variance in heart rate changes. Future research should focus on a larger and more diverse sample size in order to confirm the current findings. This study added to current literature by again confirming a brake in heart rate during unexpected social rejection and by finding new results in heart rate during unexpected social acceptance from a more negative peer.","['social rejection', 'heart rate', 'peer feedback', 'autonomic arousal', 'anterior cingulate cortex', 'self-esteem']"
Self-evaluated loneliness in primary-school autistic children: the relations with the quality and quantity of friendships,"Meer, Anne van der","['Li, B.', 'Klaveren, I. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Autistic children tend to experience difficulties in interaction with peers, which makes them vulnerable to experience feelings of loneliness. This study investigates quantitative and qualitative variables related to friendship in relation to self-evaluated feelings of loneliness in both autistic and non-autistic children. Questionnaires and sensor data were used to examine the differences in quantity of friendships (network size, time spent in interaction, number of interaction partners and network centrality) and quality of friendship (reciprocal nominations and acceptance) between autistic and non-autistic children in special education as well as how the variables related to self-evaluated feelings of loneliness. No differences were found between feelings of loneliness in autistic and non-autistic children. Autistic children had fewer interaction partners and spent less time in interaction, but did not have a less central position in their networks or a smaller network size. Besides, autistic children might not have had a lower quality of friendships, as they did not have fewer reciprocal nominations than non-autistic children. Concerning the relationship between feelings of loneliness and quantitative variables, only a significant relationship was found between feelings of loneliness and network size for autistic children. No relationship was found for feelings of loneliness and quantitative variables for non-autistic children. No relationships were found between feelings of loneliness and qualitative variables for both autistic and non-autistic children. Further research should involve examining the differences in feelings of loneliness between autistic children in special and mainstream education.","['Loneliness', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'quantity of friendships', 'quality of friendships']"
Group dynamics and decision-making in habitual route use in Taï chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus),"Twaalfhoven, Mirte","['Janmaat, K.R.L.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Habitual routes are assumed to be travel paths that are, due to familiarity, energetically relatively less costly to travel on. This study derives from the idea that according to energy maximizing strategies, cognitively demanding situations possibly evoke more habitual route use. In this study I attempt to explore this assumption by linking ecological and behavioural attributes to movements as observed in primates. It compares and analyzes three years of ranging data of wild chimpanzees to learn about underlying mechanisms involved in decision-making processes concerning travel on habitual routes. I explored the chimpanzee’s travel strategies by testing the influence of group size, group composition, seasonal variation, weather conditions, time of day, and human-made research trails on the probability that the chimpanzees will use habitual routes. The results of this study suggest that the probability of habitual route use increases when the chimpanzee travels alone or in a small group and thus substantiates the assumption that larger groups might take on more extensive cognitive challenges.","['Decision-making', 'habitual route use', 'group foraging size', 'travel behaviour']"
"Associations between Trait Hedonic Capacity, Luxury consumption and Discount","Große, Till Jasper","['Vliek, M.L.W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Successful long-term goal pursuit is equally important for subjective well-being as successful hedonic goal pursuit (Huta & Ryan, 2010). Past research has shown that people differ in their ability to derive momentary enjoyment from hedonic goal pursuit, a measure which is called trait hedonic capacity (THC) (Bernecker & Becker, 2020). Here, we examined within a mixed-factorial design, whether people who differ in THC differ in the extent to which they enjoy the purchase of a luxury good. Next, we investigated if discounts can reduce rumination for people lower in THC and additionally alleviate intrusive thoughts about luxury consumption. Trait hedonic capacity predicted participants’ negative emotions after the (imagined) purchase of a luxury item. Discount predicted differences in rumination and purchase intention between discount conditions. Results yielded no evidence that discounts have beneficial effects for especially people lower in THC or alleviate intrusive thoughts about luxury consumption. Specifically focusing on people lower in THC, this study provides a better understanding of the effects of discounts on individual hedonic goal pursuit (luxury consumption).","['trait hedonic capacity', 'luxury consumption', 'discount', 'hedonic goal pursuit']"
"The development of cut-off points for multi-dimensional constructs. Comparison of a model-based clustering approach to percentile norms, standard scores and normative comparisons.","Woestenburg, Dion Hermann Anton","['Wilderjans, T.F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Cut-off scores can be useful guides for researchers, clinicians or respondents in interpretating responses on psychometric instruments. Statistical methods involved in the development of cut-off scores are predominantly based on univariate analysis and in the presence of an observable criterion variable or normative sample data. To date, little is known about statistical procedures in defining multiple cutting scores for several latent variables within a multidimensional construct (i.e., subscales of a questionnaire). This study aims to evaluate the discriminatory power of various univariate and multivariate methods in cutting score development, and to explore a model-based clustering approach in setting cut-off scores for (sub)scales of multidimensional questionnaires. The investigated approach aims to cluster the responses on multidimensional constructs by using model-based clustering to classify respondents into ordered groups. Subsequently, cut-off points were identified as the intersection points of kernel density curves between the clusters or as (sub)scale split-rules in predicting cluster membership by the use of classification trees. A simulation study was conducted to compare the methods under medium and large sample sizes, various psychometric circumstances (the magnitude of factor correlations and item loadings), and across simulated homogenous and heterogeneous populations. Results of a simulation study show this model-based cluster approach is often preferred over percentile norms and linear standard scores in terms of discriminatory power, especially in defining two cut-off points. Recommendations for model selection and strategies to obtain cut-off points are given. Future research should focus to integrate the presented methodology into a case study using existing questionnaires to examine substantive implications of the calculated cutting scores. This study gives an overview the commonly known statistical techniques involved in cut-off score attainment, provides a multivariate framework to evaluate the discriminatory power in setting cutting scores, and lays out a promising novel application of model-based clustering in developing cut-off points for multidimensional questionnaires.","['multi-dimensional constructs', 'cut-off points', 'model-based clustering']"
How to change avoidance into action? The promising role of addressing shame and inducing control in a negative financial context. An investigation of the effect of addressing shame and inducing control on a person’s willingness to contact a creditor.,"Dinter, Sjim van","['Seip, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study aimed to explore possible implications to tackle obstacles that prevent people from contacting their creditors when facing financial hardship. It is found that people living in poverty often do not use the available help, leaving them with social withdrawal. We identified two possible reasons for the problem. The first is the experienced shame, the second is the perceived control. This study, therefore, examined the effect of experienced shame and perceived control on behavioral tendencies. Specifically, it investigated whether addressing shame and inducing control in a negative financial situation has an impact on willingness to contact one’s creditor. To test our hypothesis, an online study was distributed to people who experience or have experienced financial hardship. Results showed no increase in willingness to contact when shame was addressed. An increase in willingness to contact was found when control was induced. Exploratively, it was found that addressing shame and inducing control combined increased a person’s willingness to contact. The results indicated that control had a positive effect on the relation between shame and avoidant tendencies.

This study aimed to gain insight into changes in social anxiety before and after a school closure associated with COVID-19 lockdown and its relation to the experience of the lockdown in Dutch adolescents aged 12-15 years. Methods. A total of 188 adolescents (M = 13.48, SD = 0.81) completed self-report measures of social anxiety on March 2020 (T1). In September 2020 (T2) they completed the same self-report measures of social anxiety, enjoyment of the lockdown, and Worries about COVID-19. Results. Adolescents with average or high symptoms of social anxiety before the first school closure showed a significant reduction in social anxiety symptoms after the first school closure. The expected positive association between social anxiety before and after school closure was moderated by Enjoying the lockdown but not gender. Furthermore, higher symptoms of social anxiety before the first school closure were associated with higher levels of enjoying the lockdown. Conclusion. Results indicated that adolescents with moderate to high social anxiety symptoms and who enjoyed the lockdown and associated consequences such as less face-to-face interaction were most at-risk of reporting higher symptoms of social anxiety once the schools had reopened.","['Adolescents', 'COVID-19', 'Enjoying the lockdown', 'Gender', 'Lockdown', 'School closure', 'Social anxiety', 'Worries about COVID-19']"
The Moderating Role of Empathy on the Relationship between Trait Anxiety and Cognitive Flexibility in Adolescence,"Landthaler, Maren","['Overgaauw, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The complexities of daily life require us to have a flexible mind. Indeed, our world is constantly changing, urging us to respond in an adaptive, flexible manner to external demands. Previous research has linked trait anxiety to decreased cognitive flexibility. Although past research has repeatedly implied that higher levels of anxiety in adolescents is related to lower levels of cognitive flexibility, there is little research about protective factors that positively influence this relationship. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate whether different types of empathy have a moderating effect on the relationship between trait anxiety and cognitive flexibility. It was hypothesized that higher levels of trait anxiety predict lower levels of cognitive flexibility, this relationship was expected to be moderated by three types of empathy, namely affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and intention to comfort. In the final sample, a total of 103 healthy participants were included, (51 females, 52 males), around 25 from each of the defined age groups: 9-10 (pre-adolescents), 12-13 (early adolescents), 15-16 (mid-adolescents), 18-19 (late-adolescents). Trait Anxiety was measured with the State-Anxiety Inventory DY (STAI), the Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS) was used to assess cognitive flexibility, and the Empathy Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (EmQue-CA) measured the level of all three empathy types. Results indicated, concurrent with the first hypothesis, higher levels of trait anxiety predict lower levels of cognitive flexibility. However, inconsistent with the second hypothesis, the relationship between trait anxiety and cognitive flexibility was not moderated by any of the three empathy types. Given that results predicted decreased levels of cognitive flexibility in trait-anxious adolescents, more research is crucial to investigate the protective mechanism of empathy on the interaction between trait anxiety and cognitive flexibility.","['Trait anxiety', 'cognitive flexibility', 'empathy', 'affective empathy', 'cognitive empathy', 'intention to comfort']"
The Impact of Childhood Emotional Maltreatment and Emotion Dysregulation on Perception of Child-Parent Interaction in Adolescence,"Münker, Lina","['Tollenaar, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"BACKGROUND: Childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) has been identified as a considerable threat to adaptive child development. Emotion regulation is commonly impaired in victims of CEM, which can adversely impact broader socio-emotional functioning, such as the quality of child-parent interactions in adolescence. The current study examines to what extent maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (i.e., catastrophizing and rumination) mediate the association between experienced CEM and the quality of child-parent interactions as perceived by the adolescent. METHOD: The healthy control group of the larger RE-PAIR study (‘Unravelling the Impact of Emotional Maltreatment on the Developing Brain’) was included, incorporating adolescents (N = 80, age 11 to17) and their parents (N (Mothers) = 80, N (Fathers) = 76). Adolescent participants performed a reminiscence task with each parent and consecutively filled in a questionnaire to assess perceived parental interaction and communication behaviors during the task. CEM and emotion regulation were assessed through online versions of a Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and a Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. RESULTS: Two underlying factors were formulated after performing Principal Component Analyses (PCAs) on the perceived behavior per parent, namely ‘perceived general satisfaction with the interaction’ and ‘perceived criticism’. CEM did not predict either formulated outcome, for parents together and mothers separately. However, CEM had a negative effect on perceived general satisfaction, (F(1,64) = 6.175, b = -.502, p = .016) and a positive effect on perceived criticism, (F(1,64) = 6.612, b = .127, p = .012) by the adolescent during the interaction with their father. No mediation effects were found for either catastrophizing or rumination. DISCUSSION: Suggestions for future research include comparisons between different childhood maltreatment and to assess emotion dysregulation on multiple levels of functioning.","['Childhood Emotional Maltreatment (CEM)', 'Emotion dysregulation', 'Catastrophizing', 'Rumination', 'Reminiscence task', 'Child-parent interaction', 'Perceived general satisfaction', 'Perceived criticism']"
Midfrontal theta power as response to social-evaluative feedback from predominantly positive or negative peers in individuals with fear of negative evaluation.,"Nabuurs, Noor","['Molen, M.J.W. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Midfrontal EEG oscillations in the theta (4-8 Hz) band reflect a threat-detection mechanism, which might work differently in individuals with fear of negative evaluation (FNE) due to attentional biases. This study aimed to examine FM theta reactivity to social-evaluation in a probabilistic feedback learning experiment, and possible biased learning processes in individuals with FNE, a hallmark feature in social anxiety. Additionally, the current study explored the possible mediating role of FM theta power in the relationship between FNE and emotion regulation. Fifty-nine undergraduate students (mean age = 20.5 years) participated in the newly developed SELF-profile paradigm. The participants received social rejection or acceptance feedback by (predominantly positive and negative) peers, which was either congruent or incongruent with prior expectations. Results revealed that unexpected peer feedback, regardless of the valence (acceptance or rejection), elicited a significant increase in FM theta power, as did feedback from the most negative peer. No association between FM theta power and FNE was found, and FM theta power did not mediate the relationship between FNE and emotion regulation (positive reappraisal or rumination). Behaviourally, participants had more difficulties in learning the probability of acceptance feedback for the negative peer than the positive peer. Individuals with FNE were slower in predicting acceptance feedback for the most positive peer, and felt more rejected after the experiment. Together, the results provided evidence that individuals with higher FNE seemed to display increased negative affect after receiving feedback and an attention bias towards threat. Furthermore, FM theta power seemed to reflect uncertainty-driven exploration.","['EEG', 'Emotion regulation', 'Fear of negative evaluation', 'Social-evaluative feedback', 'Theta power']"
Developing a common metric for commonly used instruments in Routine Outcome Monitoring,"Ruhland, Maren","['Beurs, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Using a wide variety of clinical questionnaires might hamper the communication between clinicians and researchers in Routine outcome monitoring (ROM). Linking test scores to T scores as a common metric might be a solution. Item response theory (IRT) is the preferred way to estimate T-scores. However, required software and a large dataset is needed for that. In this thesis, two methods were used to arrive at a common metric for often used questionnaires and their subversions: the BSI, BSI-18, the DASS-42 and the DASS-21. As one method, we used an IRT approach to estimate theta-based T-scores, leading to crosswalk tables. For the second approach, conversion formulas were estimated for raw scores to calculated T-scores based on the best-fitting regression equation between the raw scores and the previously estimated theta-based T-scores. Crosswalk tables and conversion formulas are both alternative ways to link individual scores to a common metric. It was investigated if conversion formulas are valid by comparing calculated T-scores with theta-based T-scores. The agreement between calculated T-scores and theta-based T-scores were high for all questionnaires except the DASS-42. The agreement was also lower at the extreme ends of the questionnaires (T= < 50 and T= >75). All in all, conversion formulas seem to be a good alternative for estimating a common metric. Offering different options to calculate common metrics can help in improving the communication between professionals in the clinical field. Increased involvement and better communication in ROM is able to increase the quality of mental health care.","['common metric', 'Item Response theory', 'conversion formulas', 'Routine outcome monitoring']"

The study consisted of two sessions: In the first session, all children completed a reading self-concept questionnaire. In the second session, the children were randomized into an experimental or control condition for a test-training-test design. Children in the experimental condition received a dynamic training between pre-test and post-test, the control condition did not. Results indicated that trained children had improved more on prosodic awareness than non-trained children. This effect was not found for phonemic awareness. Dyslexia diagnosis did not influence improvement. Furthermore, children with dyslexia had lower reading self-concept compared to children without dyslexia. However, reading self-concept was not related to improvement during a dynamic test, and dyslexia diagnosis did not moderate this relationship.","['Dynamic testing', 'dyslexia', 'reading', 'self-concept']"

While research has explored this connection previously, this study also aims to apply it to the gifted and pre-adolescent population. Giftedness is a complex topic with a wide array of definitions and an even wider array of implications. In the current study, children between the ages of 9-12, in either non-gifted or gifted schools all over the Netherlands, were administered the subscale of openness to experience from the Big Five Questionnaire for Children and the subscales of Empathic Concern and Perspective Taking from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. For the first hypothesis, testing whether openness to experience can be predicted from empathy, results showed that students (N = 95) showed higher scores in openness to experience if they were more empathetic. The overall Interpersonal Reactivity Index score was the best predictor, closely followed by the Perspective Taking scores. Results for the second hypothesis, that the previous prediction would be more significant for gifted students (N = 44) than non-gifted students (N = 51), showed no statistical evidence, but hinted towards a significant trend. It was concluded that individuals higher in empathy might also show more openness to experience. Additionally, the study highlights the need for improvement in the current educational systems by mentioning current options and their practical limitations in relation to gifted and non-gifted individuals.","['Giftedness', 'Openness to Experience', 'Empathy']"
"The Relationship between Childhood Maltreatment, Different Types of Dissociation, and PTSD","Xu, YanXin","['Krause-Utz, A.D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction: Childhood maltreatment (CM) is a highly prevalent issue in our society that includes physical, emotional and sexual abuse, as well as physical and emotional neglect. CM can lead to various negative consequences, such as dissociation. Known subtypes are amnestic dissociation, absorption and depersonalization/derealization. There is ample empirical evidence supporting sexual and physical abuse leading to dissociation, but rarely do studies focus on all facets of the variables. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the different types of CM and dissociation taking post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a mediator into account. Methods: Using an online self-report survey, CM, dissociation and PTSD were assessed cross-sectionally among a sample recruited on online platforms for domestic violence via Leiden University (N=432). Obtained data were analyzed by performing a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and mediation analysis (PROCESS macro). Results: The results support the notion to use all subscales of both variables, as sexual abuse and physical neglect were significantly associated with amnestic dissociation, while sexual abuse, physical neglect and emotional abuse were significant predictors of derealization/depersonalization; physical neglect had a significant relationship with absorption. PTSD was a significant mediator but it did not fully explain the link between CM and dissociation. Discussion: Future studies should focus on using clinical samples and longitudinal designs to gain deeper knowledge into therapeutic implications. Integrating the findings of our paper is an important step to better understand the types of CM, dissociation and the importance of PTSD.","['childhood maltreatment', 'dissociation', 'post-traumatic stress disorder']"
Curating Recovery All-Round: Network Analysis of Patients’ Internal and External Factors in Substance Use Disorder Treatment,"Gattone, Agnese","['Veenman, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Network theory perceives mental disorders as a network of interconnected symptoms influencing each other instead of latent variables of a diagnosis. A similar approach is taken in inpatient treatment for substance use disorder (SUD) by treating the psychological factors and curating the contextual factors related to substance use. Since previous studies have found contextual, psychosocial, and mental health factors to influence SUD recovery and outcome, it is important to understand these inter-factor relations promoting successful and durable change. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate what role these factors play in a network of individuals in inpatient treatment for SUD. The difference between pre- and post-treatment was investigated and a distinction was made in networks of patients with and without personality disorder (PD) comorbidity at post-treatment. Data from 307 patients recruited from Norwegian treatment facilities was used. Contextual, psychosocial, and mental health factors were examined by estimating four regularized partial correlation networks (Pre-Treatment, Post Treatment, PD, Control) and their respective accuracy and stability bootstraps. Whereas, to test the differences between these networks the NetworkComparisonTest was performed. Results of all networks indicate strong connections between depression and anxiety, and between emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Furthermore, the Post-Treatment and PD networks show connections between contextual factors and substance use thereby illustrating the importance of a curated environment. Further investigation of contextual, psychosocial, and mental health factors through employment of a network intervention analysis in longitudinal research is important to purposefully target mechanisms of change in treatment for SUD recovery.","['inpatient treatment', 'substance use', 'network']"
A meta-analysis on the physiological stress effects of nature versus urban sites on stress: food for the Generalised Unsafety Theory of Stress,"Ábri, Anna","['Brosschot, J.F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background - The Generalised Unsafety Theory of Stress, a novel stress explanation, considers the stress response as a default mode of the body, which is always active independently from stressors unless it is inhibited based on perceiving safety. GUTS suggests there are compromised domains where stress is chronically released despite a lack of clear stressors, and the organism is unable to inhibit the stress mechanism mostly because of perceiving generalised unsafety around. One of these compromised domains is believed to be urban environments as they cannot provide sufficient signs of safety, and they mainly consist property of strangers. Natural environments in contrast are believed to provide signs of safety and therefore decrease stress levels. Using meta-analysis, this current research aimed to find and summarize evidence from existing studies reporting that urban environments are associated with increased levels of stress, Method - In total, 12 studies, collected from Web of Science database, were included in six meta-analyses conducted on heart rate variability (high frequency, low frequency/high frequency), saliva cortisol, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), and heart rate data of healthy adult participants during and after exposure to urban and natural environments. Results - Statistically significant increased heart rate was found after a walk in the urban environment (g = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.20; 0.50, p <0.0001). High frequency heart rate variability was significantly lower after an urban walk(unknown baseline balance group: g = -0.33, 95% CI: -0.55; -0.11; baseline balanced: g = -2.52, 95% CI: -3.25; -1.78). Low frequency heart rate variability was significantly higher during the urban walk (unknown baseline balance group: g = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.49; 1.80; baseline balanced: g = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.78; 3.26). Subgroup analyses and funnel plots for heart rate variability showed a possible small-study effect in the baseline balanced groups. Blood pressure and cortisol measurements showed no significant effect and were ambiguous because of high heterogeneity and small number of included studies. Conclusions - Heart rate variability and heart rate measures indicated a higher stress level in urban than in natural environments providing an example of prolonged stress without stressors, explainable by GUTS. For blood pressure and cortisol no such evidence was provided. However, the results should be carefully interpreted because of high between-study heterogeneity and other limitations of these studies. Further research into stress measurements and effects of natural and urban environment on stress are required to provide reliable evidence.","['stress', 'forest-bathing', 'Generalised Unsafety Theory of Stress', 'heart rate variability', 'heart rate', 'blood pressure', 'cortisol', 'nature', 'urban']"
Trade and Politics: How the U.S. uses their extensive economic resources to influence other states in case of the contested (non)recognitions of Israel and Palestine,"Wilmink, Valentijn","['Kursani, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent decades, scholars have found that the influence of Great Powers in recognition politics is fairly big. They choose whether or not to recognize entities as states and other countries simply follow. Scholars have stated that in fear of costs of contravention, small states are being pressured to align recognition policy by extensive military, economic and diplomatic resources of major actors in world politics. Following the path of prior research on how Great Powers influence non-Great Powers on recognition policies, this paper aims to explain how extensive economic resources can be used to push other system members in certain recognition positions. Using data from the Correlates of War project and the World Trade Bank this paper argues that trade interdependence does, in fact, correlates with alignment of recognition policy with the U.S. With that said, no hard evidence has been found that the U.S. is willingly using trade as leverage to push states towards the recognition of Israel and the nonrecognition of Palestine.","['contested sovereignty', 'great power rule', 'political economy', 'trade politics']"
The effects of depression and anxiety on memory decline in older adults,"Aarts, Annemarijn","['Schuitema, I.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Depression and/or anxiety affect approximately one third of the Dutch population at least once in their lifetime. Cross-sectional research has shown the relationship between elevated depression and/or anxiety symptoms and low scores on memory function. However, there is a scarcity of data on the effects of depression and/or anxiety on memory decline over time. Thus, Multilevel growth curve modelling was applied to assess associations between depression, anxiety and memory. We used nationally representative data from older adults in The Netherlands that participated in the LASA-study, that encompasses data on predictors and consequences of aging. The final sample included 4056 individuals, aged 55 – 86 and 51.3% female. Model B (main effects) showed a negative effect of depression on memory and a positive effect of anxiety on memory. Model C and D dealt with the rate of change and the acceleration of rate of change. Among the focal predictors, only depression and age significantly affected the staring rate of change in memory. The effect of anxiety on the initial rate of change in memory was non-significant and could not be generalized. The effect of measurement point (mp) on the starting rate of change, does not depend on the combination of values for depression and anxiety. Within model D, only age turned out to affect the (positive) starting rate of change and the de-acceleration of this starting rate of change. Relatively older people tend to start off with a somewhat lower positive rate of change in memory and are more likely to have a stronger decline of this rate of change over time. The effect of depression on the starting rate was still negative and had the same direction in model D as in model C, but depression lost its significance in model D. Also, it had a non-significant effect on the de acceleration of the rate of change. Anxiety, as in model C, did not contribute significantly to model D in any way. The interaction between depression and anxiety was non-significant and did not contribute. In conclusion, memory decline is not accelerated in people with high levels of depression and/or anxiety. Only older age and sex have effect on memory decline over time. Further research could take additional variables into account in predicting memory decline, such as dementia, since depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in patients with dementia and it is plausible that early AD is one of the most important factors in age-related memory decline. Further research could take other variables into account, such as dementia, other cognitive functions, education, lifestyle, health-risks, heart disease, diabetes. Moreover, further distinctions in the variables could be made, such as the difference in effects on memory decline between late-onset depression (LOD) and early-onset depression (EOD).",
Looking for the Perfect Beat: On Tempo Comfort and its Influence on Liking in a Dyadic Finger Tapping Task,"Strassen, Anna","['Perschl, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"When listening to music people often start moving together, which has been shown to increase interpersonal liking. In fact, even small synchronous movements, such as tapping your finger to music with another person, appear to increase liking. The current online study investigated the impact of tapping tempo and resulting tempo comfort on liking in a dyadic tapping task. It was expected that people would like another tapper significantly more if they judged the tapping tempo to be comfortable as opposed to uncomfortable. Furthermore, it was expected that the personality trait openness to experience would moderate, and that task enjoyment would mediate the relationship between tempo comfort and liking. Both of the latter predictions were rejected. However, two different tapping tempi were indeed experienced as differing significantly in tempo comfort. Tempo comfort was a significant predictor of liking with a small effect size during the fast, but not during the slow tempo. It is possible that when tapping tempo is comfortable it is not a prevalent or consciously perceived musical factor and therefore does not impact social cognition or behaviour. However, when tempo does become a prevalent factor, for example by being perceived as too fast or potentially also too slow, tempo comfort starts having an impact on interpersonal liking. Future research could profit from determining a tempo interval in which most people perceive the tapping tempo to be comfortable enough as to not negatively impact liking.","['Dyadic Tapping Tasks', 'Synchronous Movement', 'Tempo Comfort', 'Interpersonal Liking', 'Rapport Building', 'Music Therapy']"
The Role of Resilient Coping in the Relationship between Level of Optimism and Perceived Stress,"Kanhai, Asha","['Çetin, M.E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Optimism and perceived stress are concepts that have been studied extensively in the recent years. Even though an association between the two has been established before, whether coping might play a role in this relationship is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether resilient coping can be a mediator and explain at least part of the association between the level of optimism and perceived stress. A quasi-experimental design was employed and the data was collected cross-sectionally. The final sample consisted of 250 respondents with an age range of 16 to 60. The Life Orientation Test-Revised, Perceived Stress Scale, and Brief Resilient Coping Scale were used to measure the level of optimism, perceived stress, and resilient coping, respectively. Model 4 in PROCESS macro was used to test the mediation hypothesis. The results showed a significant indirect association between optimism and perceived stress via resilient coping BCa CI [-0.18, -0.02]. To gain more information about whether any causal effects are present within the established associations, an experimental and longitudinal research design is recommended for future studies, as well as going into detail about the potential roles of different coping strategies in this relationship. The findings provide insight about at least one mechanism that could explain the relationship between optimism and stress and could have important implications for interventions that target stress reduction if it is follow-up with some further research.","['optimism', 'perceived stress', 'resilient coping', 'mediation']"
The Role of Coping Skills in the Relationship between Optimism and Anxiety Symptoms,"Jonge, Malou de","['Çetin, M.E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Dispositional optimism is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to mental and physical health. The role of resilient coping on the relationship between dispositional optimism and anxiety symptoms has not yet been examined. In this study, the potential mediating role of resilient coping in the relationship between dispositional optimism and anxiety symptoms has been tested using PROCESS macro. The Life Orientation Test Revised, the Brief Resilient Coping Scale, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaires were used for the assessment of optimism, resilient coping, and anxiety symptoms, respectively. The total, direct, and indirect effects were estimated using data from a healthy population (N = 248). The results showed that the level of dispositional optimism significantly predicted the level of anxiety symptoms (b = -.36, p < .001) such that higher levels of dispositional optimism were associated with lower levels of anxiety symptoms. No significant evidence was found for the mediating role of resilient coping in this relationship, possibly due to the low internal consistency of the questionnaire in this sample. As the sample in this study had an overrepresentation of students within the age range of 20-25, it is likely that the results might not apply to the larger population, given that there are differences in what students have to cope with compared to people who are in other phases of their lives. Future research may complement findings by investigating whether there is a causal relationship between coping skills and anxiety symptoms.","['dispositional optimism', 'resilient coping', 'anxiety symptoms', 'mediation analysis']"
A Closer Look at the Relationship between Optimism and Depressive Symptoms: How Does Neuroticism Come into Play?,"Draijer, Noa","['Çetin, M.E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Depression is a worldwide problem and therefore it is very important to do research on its possible predictors or early symptoms. Studies have shown that the occurrence of depressive symptoms is related to certain personality characteristics such as optimism and neuroticism. However, there is not much research that takes both of these factors into consideration when looking at the occurrence of depressive symptoms. In this study, the role of neuroticism in the relationship between optimism and depressive symptoms was investigated. It was hypothesized that the degree of neuroticism will at least partially mediate the relationship between the level of optimism and depressive symptoms. The Patient Health Questionnaire, the Life Orientation Test-Revised, and the neuroticism subscale of the Big Five Inventory were used to measure depressive symptoms, optimism, and neuroticism, respectively. The results of the mediation analysis in PROCESS macro confirmed the hypothesis that the degree of neuroticism partially mediates the relationship between the level of optimism and depressive symptoms, b = -.29, BCa Cl [-.40, -.21]. The main limitation of the study was the cross-sectional study design which prevented making any inferences about the directionality of the found relationships. Nonetheless, the results have implications for both the research and the clinical field as they encourage further research to assist in the development of intervention strategies.","['depressive symptoms', 'neuroticism', 'optimism']"
Do Optimists Experience Less Anxiety? A study on the level of optimism and anxiety ratings in healthy respondents,"Claassen, Nena","['Çetin, M.E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Optimism and anxiety are both widely studied constructs in psychology. However, inconsistent results are found regarding the effect of optimism on anxiety, and research is often conducted in clinical samples. The present study aimed to investigate whether there is a significant difference between the anxiety ratings of healthy individuals who had high optimism scores compared to those with lower optimism scores. The hypothesis was that more optimistic individuals would have significantly lower anxiety ratings. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a between-subjects design. The respondents were asked to complete the Life Orientation Test-Revised to measure their level of optimism and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment to measure the number of anxiety symptoms experienced by each respondent. Using a median split, they were divided into two groups of low and high optimism before the analyses. The final sample size consisted of 250 respondents. An independent samples t-test was conducted to test the hypothesis. There was a significant difference between the two groups (p < .001). Confirming the initial hypothesis, the high optimism group had significantly lower anxiety ratings than the low optimism group. Cohen’s d indicated a large effect size (d = 3.85). However, the data were collected cross sectionally thus no causal relationships can be inferred from the results. Looking to the future, it is important to investigate the underlying pathways between optimism and anxiety, and it is recommended that optimism be actively used during preventive interventions, therapeutic treatments for anxiety, and in educational settings.","['optimism', 'anxiety', 'mental health', 'self-report questionnaires']"
Domestic Hell: Linguistic analysis of online domestic violence testimonies in the context of COVID-19,"Buchner, Valentin","['Molendijk, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Worldwide, an increase in cases and severity of domestic violence (DV) has been reported as a result of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. As one’s language can provide inferences about one’s mental health, this study analyzed word use in a DV online support group, aiming to investigate the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the mental health of DV victims. As social support and leisure activities might mitigate the consequences of DV on one’s mental health, their role as protective factors was examined. 5856 posts were collected from a DV support group and from two comparison groups on the social media platform Reddit. Confirmatory analysis was conducted following a registered pre-analysis plan. The results show that DV victims used significantly more linguistic indicators of depression than individuals in the comparison groups. However, linguistic indicators of depression did not increase significantly with the onset of COVID-19. Negative emotion words showed a weak negative correlation with words referring to social support (rho = - .110) and leisure activities (rho = -.137). Similarly, pre-occupation with COVID-19 was associated with using more negative emotion words (rho = .148). Exploratory analysis revealed that mid-pandemic, daily posting frequency in the DV support group was 22% higher than pre-pandemic. It is concluded that DV victims show more linguistic indicators of depression than comparison groups and that these characteristics are stable over time. Further, one’s concern with COVID-19 could contribute to negative emotions, whereas social support and leisure activities could function to some degree as protective factors for victims of DV","['COVID-19', 'domestic violence', 'linguistic analysis', 'social media', 'Reddit', 'mental health', 'depression', 'social support', 'leisure', 'pre-registration']"
Relating depressive symptoms to word use of victims of domestic violence: Is there an influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of these words related to depression?,"Goudriaan, Danica","['Molendijk, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created another pandemic: one of domestic violence (DV) and intimate partner violence (IPV). Multiple sources have indicated that there is a relationship between the use of certain words and depressive symptoms, for instance the self-awareness theory of depression states that depressed people use more words referring to the self. This study aimed to see if there was a relationship between exposure to DV and depressive symptoms, indicated by word use and to examine the influence of COVID-19 on the use of these words that indicate depressive symptoms. In total 4671 texts from three different subreddits were analysed: one on DV and two control non-DV groups. The outcome variables were: first-person singular pronouns, negation words, negative emotion words, anxiety-related words. Results indicated that victims of DV used more first-person singular words, words related to negative emotions and anxiety-related words and fewer negation words, relative to the control group. The general effect of subreddit on word use was a value of Pillai’s trace of .662. No effect of time or interactions between subreddits and time were found on the use of the word categories. There is potential in the use of textual analysis to detect depressive symptoms and possibly also victimisation of DV.","['depression', 'domestic violence (DV)', 'Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)', 'COVID-19', 'corona', 'pandemic', 'LIWC', 'word use', 'Reddit']"

As the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of domestic violence and mental health problems, social media site Reddit was used to detect changes in depression and suicidality in victims word use (using more first-person singular pronouns, negative emotion words, death-related words and less positive emotion words). The present study aims to see whether the word use suggesting depression or suicidality has increased in the victims (r/domesticviolence) versus non-victims (r/changemyview) from pre-COVID19 to during COVID-19. 1669 and 2358 posts for the r/domesticviolence and r/changemyview respectively were analyzed using LIWC2015. The main effect of subreddit showed that victims used more first-person singular pronouns (Eta squared η²=.668) and negative emotion words (Eta squared η²=.167), both having a large effect. The control group used more positive emotion words and death-related words. Main effect of year showed an increase in the use of first-person singular pronouns in both victims and non-victims. There was no interaction effect between the year and the subreddits. These results indicate that COVID-19 didn’t contribute to the differences in depressive or suicidal word use between the two subreddits. However, COVID-19 had an effect in general for the increases in self-focus. Finally, overall the victims showed more word use related to depression or suicidality. Some limitations and future directions were considered in the end.","['domestic violence', 'COVID-19', 'word use', 'depression', 'suicidality', 'Reddit']"
The potential role of Covid-19 related traumatic stress on the relationship between disgust sensitivity and OCD tendencies.,"German, Marie","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2019, the contagious virus Covid-19 caused the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak of a pandemic, leading to various new challenges for the mental health field. The present study investigated the potential role of experienced Covid-19 traumatic stress on the relationship between disgust sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) tendencies. Previous research indicates an association between higher disgust sensitivity levels and higher fear of contamination and hand-washing compulsions (subdomains of OCD). To investigate a potential moderation effect on this association, 183 respondents were recruited through Leiden University research participation recruitment platform i.e., SONA and through a convenience sample via social media platforms. In line with previous findings, the results showed that respondents who indicated higher levels of disgust sensitivity also reported higher OCD tendencies. Further, individuals who experienced the Covid-19 outbreak as more traumatic displayed higher OCD tendencies. However, a significant moderation of Covid-19 traumatic stress on the relationship between disgust sensitivity and OCD tendencies was not found. Nevertheless, this study provides support for previous research and indicated a significant relationship between disgust sensitivity and OCD tendencies. Additionally, it contributes to further research by introducing traumatic stress as a new variable on this association. Moreover, the findings of this study hopefully encourage further research on the association of Covid-19 traumatic stress on the development of a variety of mental health problems and help to underline the importance of looking at the consequences of the pandemic not only in terms of physical health but also in terms of mental health.","['Covid-19', 'disgust sensitivity', 'OCD tendencies', 'Covid-19 related traumatic stress']"

Suicide Risk in Depression: Longitudinally Investigating the Role of Cognitive Reactivity,"Durante - Bose, Ishana","['Does, W.A.J. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Suicidal ideation is a grave symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), that can have long-lasting cognitive effects. Cognitive Reactivity (CR) is the reactivation of depressogenic cognitions by dysphoric mood states, after recovery. CR is important as it predicts relapse. Previous studies found that individuals who have contemplated suicide may be particularly vulnerable to reactivation of depressive cognitions; however, suicidal ideation was assessed retrospectively. The present study is prospective. Methods: Cohort study. Participants who met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for MDD were included if they no longer satisfied the criteria two years later (N = 943). CR scores during remission were compared between individuals who were not suicidal during their index (baseline) episode (SI-) (N = 346), versus those who were (SI+) (N = 597) — within which, a subcategory of those who attempted suicide in their lifetime (N = 152) was included. Results: During remission, SI+ participants had significantly higher hopelessness reactivity scores than SI- participants, even when factoring current depressive symptoms and suicidality, and anxiety comorbidity. Current hopelessness reactivity was significantly predicted by previous suicidal ideation, and to a lesser degree, feelings of worthlessness/guilt. Participants who had attempted suicide had significantly higher aggression reactivity, compared to without a history of suicidality. Limitations: Cognitive reactivity may have been influenced by the unaccounted disparity in participants’ most recent suicide attempt, and the number of previous depressive episodes. Conclusions: The results support the differential activation model of suicidality. Robust and strong longitudinal associations are drawn between suicidal ideation during depression, and a subsequent, distinct cognitive reactivity profile on the hopelessness dimension during remission. Given the profile specificity of cognitive reactivity, preventative measures for relapse are promising. Further research including the number of previous depressive episodes, suicide attempts and their recency may strengthen the validity of findings.","['Cognitive reactivity', 'suicidal ideation', 'mood congruency', 'hopelessness/suicidal reactivity', 'cognitive vulnerability', 'differential activation']"

These papers all use the same candidate-based approach, where they research whether the use of Twitter and other Twitter features have an impact on the amount of votes each candidate receives. This paper will use a new party-based approach and seeks to find out wether the content political parties post on their Twitter accounts has an effect on the amount of preference votes the party together receives. To do so 5.114 tweets, sent during the campaign for the Dutch national elections of 2021 from 34 different political parties, have been analyzed and categorized. These tweets formed the independent variabele ‘share of personalized tweets’. A tweet is considered ‘personalized’ when the content of the tweets is about one or more candidates, who are not the list puller of the party. The share of personalized tweets has been analyzed together with the share of preference votes the parties received. No significant effect was found between these two variables.",

The sample of the study consisted of 139 Dutch and International University students at a Dutch University, with a mean age of 21.15 years old. Their COVID-19 fear, study-related stress and hopelessness levels were measured with the use of 3 scales: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, The Law Student Perceived Stress Scale and The Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity (Hopelessness subscale). Hopelessness was positively related to study-related stress (β= .32, t=3.89, p < .001), and COVID-19 related fears was positively related to study-related stress (β= .42, t=5.48, p < .001). No significant association was found between COVID-19 related fears and hopelessness (β= .10, t=1.13, p=.261). The pandemic and its consequences have taken a toll on students, and their levels of academic stress, however their reported COVID-19 fears are lower than previous research has shown.

THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ITS EFFECT ON THE RELATION BETWEEN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MENTAL HEALTH – A TWO-WEEK EMA STUDY: Physical activity in times of crisis,"Hassink Ta, Luna","['Fried, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In light of the novel coronavirus that emerged in December 2019, changes in our daily lives are inevitable and students’ mental health is at risk. During the third lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, we used Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) while following 63 bachelor students attending Leiden University, sending them mini-surveys, 4 times a day for a period of 15 days. These surveys included two questions per each subscale of the DASS-21 variables (depression, stress, and anxiety) and one question concerning physical activity (PA). Through the use of network models (contemporaneous and temporal), we analyzed the given partial correlations and interpreted them accordingly. Before the EMA study, participants (N = 66) completed a baseline assessment. In this study, we investigate the influence PA and mental health have on each other, as previous research states that PA has a positive influence on mental health, and that the state of one’s mental health influences how physically active someone is. Our sample of students spent about an hour a day, 2-3 times a week being physically active. Findings based on the EMA data, show a relation between the engagement in physical activities (PAs) for the recommended amount of time, and a drop in depressive and anxiety-like symptoms. This goes together with an increase in one’s mood (affect) and low feelings of arousal. According to previous research, being physically active establishes resilience within an individual, which can act as a buffer against stressful situations. These findings are discussed using possible explanations.",

Cognitive Reactivity Before and After Major Depressive Episodes,"Bik-Multanowska, Kinga Maria","['Does, W. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Cognitive reactivity (CR) can be defined as the ease with which dysfunctional and negative cognitions can be activated when an individual experiences mild sadness or low mood. Past research supports the stance that such reactivity constitutes a vulnerability marker of depression. Aim: To assess whether CR scores in people who develop major depressive disorder (MDD) episodes are already elevated before their first episode of depression (i.e., vulnerability hypothesis) or whether major depressive episodes result in higher residual CR scores (i.e., scarring hypothesis). Methods: Data from a large cohort study, The Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) (Penninx et al., 2004) was analyzed. Two samples of previously never-depressed individuals who developed at least one MDD episode within the study period (N=129 and N=142) and met the inclusion criteria, together with two samples of healthy controls (N=41 and N=130) were followed over the course of six years. CR was measured with Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity – revised and the presence of major depressive disorder was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: CR scores of previously never-depressed individuals who developed at least one MDD episode (and were depressed for 1-10 (M=14.8), 11-25 (M=18.2) or 26-71 (M=20) months) were already elevated at baseline compared to never-depressed individuals who remained healthy (M=9.2). CR scores decreased over the course of six years for individuals who developed MDD (17.4 vs. 15.4) and healthy controls (9.1 vs. 7.5). Conclusion: Present study found support for vulnerability rather than scarring hypothesis with relation to cognitive reactivity.",
