Parental factors related to sensitive parenting are depression and parental self-efficacy. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between depression and sensitive parenting, and whether parental self-efficacy mediates this association. Participants were 17 Dutch mothers and 4 Dutch fathers of children aged 3-5 years. Parents played 5-10 minutes with their child during two measurement moments, while the researcher was present through a Microsoft Teams connection. A video of the playing was recorded. In between the two measurement moments, parents completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression-questionnaire (CES-D) and the Me as a Parent-questionnaire (MaaP). Afterwards, the video recordings were encoded according to the Ainsworth sensitivity scale. Only the relation between depression and sensitivity was significant, where depression was positively related to sensitivity. There was no indication found for a mediational role of parental self-efficacy in the relation between depression and sensitivity. Explanatory theories, limitations and practical implications were discussed. Future research will have to show which other factors can explain these unexpected findings.","['Parenting', 'sensitivity', 'depression', 'parental self-efficacy']"

De attitude van de leerkracht richting prentenboeken en het gebruik van Bereslim in de klas,"Hakze, Esmee",['Dr. R. D. Plak'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Despite the known effectiveness of digital storybooks for young children's language development, their use in classrooms remains limited. Digital storybooks can lead to a child being read to more often since they don’t rely on an available adult to read aloud. This study investigated whether the teacher’s attitudes toward printed and digital storybooks correlated with their class's frequency of logging into Bereslim, an interactive digital storybook platform for children aged 3 to 7 years old. The study also examined whether the number of children in a class at risk of developing language problems correlates with the frequency of logins to Bereslim. Additionally, it investigated whether teacher’s attitude toward printed storybooks could predict the amount of Bereslim logins. Lastly, the study explored whether the teacher's age impacted their attitude toward reading digital storybooks and the frequency of logins. In this research 8 teachers from 6 schools and 1 daycare participated, completing an online questionnaire about their attitudes toward reading aloud with print and digital storybooks. Log data was also utilized, containing information about the frequency of logins into Bereslim in each class. No significant results were found regarding teachers' attitudes toward print and digital storybooks and the frequency of logging into Bereslim in their class. There was no significant correlation between the number of children in the class who are at-risk of developing a language problem and the teachers' attitude toward print storybooks. Neither teachers' age nor their attitudes toward digital storybooks significantly predicted login frequency. It's possible that the sample was too small to produce significant effects. To increase the usage of Bereslim in class, providing teachers with more information about the platform and opportunities to gain experience with digital storybooks could be beneficial. A lack of experience with digital storybooks prevents teachers from using them.","['Bereslim, digitale prentenboeken, attitude van de leerkracht']"

Deze scriptie gaat in op de manier waarop doven en slechthorenden worden gezien. Hierbij zal vanuit verschillende perspectieven worden gekeken wat het inhoudt om doof te zijn. De perspectieven van de horende maatschappij zullen tegenover die van de doven en slechthorenden worden gezet. Het perspectief van de horende maatschappij is op dit moment dominant. Om te analyseren waarom dit het geval is zal worden gekeken hoe de horende maatschappij het zintuig horen waardeert. Vervolgens zal worden gekeken hoe doven en slechthorenden in het dagelijks leven functioneren zonder het zintuig horen. Zij bewijzen dat het zintuig horen niet nodig is om goed te kunnen functioneren in de maatschappij. Op dit moment leven doven en slechthorenden in een wereld die niet altijd toegankelijk is. Er worden wel veranderingen gedaan om de maatschappij toegankelijker te maken, maar zijn dit wel de veranderingen die doven en slechthorenden zelf graag zien? Er is sprake van een spanningsveld tussen doven en slechthorenden en de horende maatschappij en dit spanningsveld zal in deze scriptie worden geanalyseerd.",
De toevoeging van subcorticale volumes aan grijze stofdichtheid om de Alzheimerclassificatie te verbeteren: Alzheimerclassificatie door middel van structurele MRI-scans,"Hertog, Sara","['Vos, F. de', 'Verdam, M.G.E.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Onderzoek naar de classificatieaccuratesse van Alzheimer is belangrijk om de ziekte in de toekomst beter te kunnen behandelen. In deze scriptie werden twee structurele MRI-maten geëvalueerd: grijze stofdichtheid (48 predictoren) en subcorticale volumes (14 predictoren). Deze scriptie onderzocht wat de toegevoegde waarde van subcorticale volumes bovenop grijze stofdichtheid is. Hierbij werd verwacht dat I) grijze stofdichtheid accurater was voor de classificatie van Alzheimer dan subcorticale volumes, maar dat II) subcorticale volumes nog wel iets zouden toevoegen aan grijze stofdichtheid. Om dit te onderzoeken, is data gebruikt van 249 participanten afkomstig uit twee verschillende studies. 76 participanten hadden de diagnose Alzheimer en de overige 173 participanten waren cognitief gezonde ouderen. Er zijn drie modellen gebruikt: een model van grijze stofdichtheid (48 predictoren), een model van subcorticale volumes (14 predictoren) en een combinatiemodel van grijze stofdichtheid en subcorticale volumes (62 predictoren). Voor alle modellen is een logistische regressieanalyse met geneste kruisvalidatie uitgevoerd. Het model van grijze stofdichtheid had een AUC-waarde van 0.897 en een MGA-waarde van 0.822. Het model van subcorticale volumes had een AUC-waarde van 0.807 en een MGA-waarde van 0.769. Het gecombineerde model had een AUCwaarde van 0.897 en een MGA-waarde van 0.841. De eerste hypothese werd bevestigd, aangezien grijze stofdichtheid belangrijker was voor de classificatieaccuratesse dan subcorticale volumes. De tweede hypothese kon niet worden bevestigd, aangezien subcorticale volumes weinig tot niets lijken toe te voegen aan grijze stofdichtheid voor de classificatieaccuratesse van Alzheimer. Deze kennis kan gebruikt worden om toekomstige classificatiemodellen van Alzheimer te verbeteren.","['brein en cognitie', 'Alzheimer', 'structurele MRI', 'grijze stofdichtheid', 'subcorticale volumes', 'logistische regressie', 'kruisvalidatie']"

A Qualitative Research of Online Ceremonies Psychedelic Experiences,"Arslan, Berivan",['Luisa Prochazkova'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many activities and platforms have shifted to the virtual realm, including rituals and ceremonies. When it comes to psychedelic rituals, there are several important factors to take into account, such as the setting, dosage, and type of substance consumed. This paper examines the effects of virtual ceremonies on psychedelic experiences. The study utilized an online self-report questionnaire that was sent 1-2 days after the ceremony conducted by retreat company Spinoza. The gathered data were analyzed using thematic qualitative analysis. The categorization and themes were agreed upon by two independent researchers. The themes presented relate to the improvement of mental health and physical comfort along with insightful personal journeys. Further evaluation of the research suggested that the findings provide a general idea about the effects of digital format on the psychedelic experience. It has been found that with digital platforms on psychedelic experiences, individuals can experience clarity of unsolved issues, improved self-regulation, as well as improved emotional and mental states.","['Psychedelic, online ceremony, virtual platform, qualitative analysis, experience']"

Op zoek naar een efficiënt meetinstrument voor ouderlijke sensitiviteit: een Q-sort gelegd door ouders,"Weijtmans, Maria","['Biro, S.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"There are many instruments available to measure parental sensitivity, however each has its own limitations. In search of a more efficient instrument, an adapted mini-MBQS is proposed, in which parents sort the cards instead of professionals. In this study, parent’s accuracy to report about their own parental sensitivity with this adapted Q-sort was explored. Additionally, it has been explored whether sex of the parent and parental reflective functioning influence parent’s accuracy on the Q-sort. To answer these questions, two online home visits were conducted with twenty parent-child pairs. During the home visits parent and child played together. Afterwards, the parent sorted the Q-sort about how sensitive s/he thought s/he was to the child during the play task. The play task was recorded and later coded on parental sensitivity with the Ainsworth Maternal Sensitivity Scale by a professional. Furthermore, parents filled in a questionnaire between the two online home visits, which contained questions about the family’s background and parental reflective functioning. The results from parent-reported and observed sensitivity were compared, which showed a positive, but weak and non-significant correlation of .22, suggesting a mismatch between parent’s own judgement and that of a professional about the level of sensitive parenting. Next, two ANCOVAs were conducted and showed that sex of the parent (F (1,16) < .01; p = .95) and parental reflective functioning (F (1,16) = .06; p = .81) did not moderate the relationship between observed and parent-reported sensitivity. From these results, it can be concluded that parents are not accurate when reporting about their parental sensitivity with the Q-sort. In addition, the results showed that gender or self-reported level of parental reflective functioning do not influence this accuracy. Therefore, it is not recommended to use the current form of the adapted MBQS as an instrument to measure parental sensitivity.","['Parental sensitivity', 'Q-sort', 'Ainsworth Maternal Sensitivity Scale']"
"De samenhang van zelfvertrouwen van ouders, temperament van het kind en leeftijd van het kind met de sensitiviteit van ouders","Tigelaar, Willemijn","['Plak, R.D.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Parental sensitivity refers to the degree to which parents are aware of their child’s signals, and respond quickly and appropriately to those signals. This parental sensitivity plays an important role in raising children. In this study, correlations between sensitive parenting, parental self-confidence in raising children, child temperament and child age were investigated. Twenty-one parents participated in an online meeting in which they played for eight minutes with their 3-5 year-old child. Two to four weeks after the first meeting, parents participated in a second online meeting in which they also played for eight minutes with their child. After the first meeting, parents filled in a questionnaire about their sensitivity, their self-confidence in raising their child, and child temperament. The following questions were investigated: ‘are parental self-confidence in raising children and parental sensitivity correlated?’; ‘is child temperament or parental self-confidence in raising children more closely correlated with parental sensitivity?’; and ‘to what extent does child temperament affect the correlation between child age and parental sensitivity?’. Using a correlation, multiple regression and moderator analysis, no correlations were found. Parental sensitivity was not correlated to parental self-confidence in raising children, child temperament or child age. These results indicate that interventions for increasing parental sensitivity must not focus on parental self-confidence or child temperament, but for example on how parents can practice sensitive parenting or how parents can react sensitively when their child is angry.","['sensitief opvoeden, zelfvertrouwen van de ouder, temperament van het kind, leeftijd van het kind']"

Online blootstelling aan seksuele content: de samenhang tussen telefoonrestricties en blootstelling,"Rooijen, Elaine van","['Nas, C.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Teenagers spend a lot of time online, which may cause worry to their parents as the internet can bring a lot of risks. To protect their children from these dangers, parents might implement rules or restrictions of phone use for their teenagers. These restrictions can keep them away from risky apps or reduce their time online. However, it is unknown if these restrictions result in less encounters of dangerous situations. This study focusses specifically on exposure to sexual content online. The aim of this study is to find out if there is a relation between phone restrictions someone might have had while growing up and exposure to sexual online content. Participants were asked to anonymously fill in an online questionnaire about their online experiences and possible phone restrictions. Using this data, an ordinal regression analysis was used to examine the relation between the presence of phone restrictions and the exposure to sexual content online. In addition, this study looks if there is a relation between what type of restriction someone might have had and the type of online exposure to sexual content: unwanted exposure and wanted exposure for the participant. The results of this study have found no significant effect, implying there is no relationship between the presence of phone restrictions and exposure to online sexual content. Furthermore, no evidence was found to indicate a relationship between the type of restrictions and wanted exposure to online sexual content. Only a significant, positive relationship was found between a limited screen time and wanted exposure to online sexual content.","['phone use, phone restrictions, sexual exposure online, unwanted exposure, wanted exposure']"
Wellbeing after Traumatic Brain Injury,"Slagter, Judith","['Donkervoort, M.', 'Van Houdt, C.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is one of the most common forms of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), and has a high incidence rate across the world. Following TBI, many patients experience cognitive complaints, as well as physical complaints about their health. Their general wellbeing can also be an issue. Fortunately, for most patients these complaints typically improve over time. This study investigates patients’ memory, concentration, energy, as well as general wellbeing, over time. Methods. Patients received questionnaires about their health and wellbeing every three months following hospital release, with the main goal to track their health and wellbeing after TBI. That data was used for this research. Energy, concentration, and memory were all measured by one question in the questionnaire. General wellbeing was measured by taking the average ratings of all questions on the questionnaire. Analyses were done with three and six questionnaires over time, using repeated measures ANOVAs. Descriptive statistics were used from the first questionnaire. Results. This study found that while patients rated all these measures on average positively, they still did not feel the same as before the injury, and most experienced hindrances in daily life. When looking at the ANOVAs with three questionnaires, there was a significant improvement on concentration, energy, as well as general wellbeing over time. For all of these, most improvement took place between the first and the second questionnaires. Memory did not change significantly over time. None of the ANOVAs with six questionnaires had any significant changes over time. Conclusion. This study shows that patients may suffer from long-lasting effects of TBI. It questions whether more should be done for these patients following hospital release, to alleviate symptoms. This study has limitations concerning selection bias and drop out.","['TBI', 'ABI', 'Wellbeing', 'Memory', 'Concentration', 'Energy']"

Het sociaal welbevinden in het schoolteam en de mate van self-efficacy van de leerkracht in burgerschapsonderwijs,"Smit, Leonore","['Krijnen, M.A.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In 2021 is de wet voor burgerschapsonderwijs op basisscholen aangescherpt, met het doel de burgerschapscompetenties van leerlingen te verbeteren. Een factor die van invloed is op de prestaties van leerlingen is de self-efficacy van de leerkracht. De mate van self-efficacy van een leerkracht hangt samen met het sociaal welbevinden van leerkrachten. In dit onderzoek werd het verband tussen sociaal welbevinden in werkrelaties en de mate van self-efficacy van leerkrachten in burgerschapsonderwijs bestudeerd. Dit werd gedaan door middel van vragenlijstonderzoek onder 59 leerkrachten. Leerkrachten rapporteerden in hoeverre zij zich in staat voelden verschillende burgerschapsonderwerpen te onderwijzen en in hoeverre zij sociaal welbevinden in werkrelaties ervaarden. Uit de analyses van het verband kwamen geen significante resultaten. Daarom kon niet geconcludeerd worden dat er een verband bestaat tussen sociaal welbevinden in werkrelaties en de mate van self-efficacy die leerkrachten ervaren bij burgerschapsonderwijs. Voor de praktijk betekent deze conclusie dat wellicht andere factoren, zoals kennis of motivatie, bekeken moeten worden om de self-efficacy van leerkrachten op het gebied van burgerschapsonderwijs en de burgerschapscompetenties van leerlingen te stimuleren. Meer onderzoek naar factoren die de kwaliteit van burgerschapsonderwijs kunnen bevorderen is nodig.","['burgerschap', 'burgerschapsonderwijs', 'self-efficacy', 'sociaal welbevinden', 'rol van de leerkracht', 'basisonderwijs']"
Begrijpend lezen in cluster vier van het speciaal onderwijs: Elementen van effectief leesonderwijs voor deze doelgroep,"Koolhaas, Kirsten",['Anne Helder'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek is voor PI de Brug, een cluster vier school uit Leiden, gekeken naar met welke elementen van effectief begrijpend lezen er rekening gehouden moet worden bij het kiezen van een nieuwe methode voor hun doelgroep. Als eerst zijn er uit drie reviews van wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar begrijpend leesonderwijs zes elementen gehaald die van belang zijn bij het vormgeven van effectief begrijpend lezen binnen het basisonderwijs. Deze elementen zijn: woordenschat en achtergrondkennis, leesstrategieën, leesmotivatie, technisch lezen, rijke taalomgeving en interactie. Het doel van het onderzoek was om na te gaan hoe deze elementen vormgegeven konden voor PI de Brug. Na het opstellen van de elementen is er onder de werknemers van de school een vragenlijst uitgezet over hoe het begrijpend leesonderwijs binnen de school ervaren wordt. Op basis van de resultaten uit de vragenlijst en wat er bekend is in de literatuur zijn er specifieke adviezen opgezet voor de school. Uit de resultaten bleken woordenschat en achtergrondkennis, leesmotivatie en een rijke taalomgeving als meest belangrijk te worden gezien binnen de school. Technisch lezen en interactie kwamen als laagste uit de resultaten. Deze resultaten en de literatuur hebben geleid tot aanbevelingen voor het begrijpend leesonderwijs op PI de Brug. Aanbevelingen waren bijvoorbeeld om een methode met veel aandacht voor interactie te vermijden, en leesmotivatie en een rijke taalomgeving te stimuleren door veel verschillende tekstsoorten en -structuren aan te bieden.","['Begrijpend lezen', 'speciaal onderwijs', 'bachelorscriptie']"
Advance care planning for people with dementia: Comparing views of physicians from different cultural backgrounds,"Sikorska, Gabriela","['Hanneke Smaling', 'Xu Jingyuan', 'Jennifer Becker']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Advance care planning (ACP) is a process in which the patient expresses their wishes regarding future medical care in the presence of their family and health care provider. ACP is generally accepted in Western countries and has a positive effect on end-of-life care for people with dementia. However, culture affects expectations and preferences regarding end-of-life care and decision making. This study compared the acceptability of and preference for two types of ACP interventions for patients with dementia in health care providers from the Netherlands, the US and Japan. One intervention focused on concrete treatment orders in which the patient makes specific decisions. The other focused on what the patient finds important in life, resulting in global goals of care. A total of 125 participants were assessed by means of a structured interview and a questionnaire. Participants found both types of ACP acceptable, in general and per country. A multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated no significant difference in acceptability of the concrete or the global ACP approach between countries when adjusted for age and gender. However, age was a significant predictor of acceptability of the concrete ACP approach (2 (2, 123) = 6.32, p = .042), with older participants being less likely to find it acceptable compared to not finding it acceptable (W(8) = 5.50, p = 0.019). Participants preferred the global ACP approach for patients with dementia. A multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated no significant differences in preference between countries when adjusted for age and gender in general. However, Dutch participants were less likely to prefer the global ACP approach (W(8) = 5.18, p = .023). The relationship between country and preference was not influenced by whether participants most strongly considered what the patient with dementia wants for themselves, what the patient’s family wants or what they as the health care provider want for their patient when making medical decisions. ACP is generally regarded as an acceptable form of care for patients with dementia by health care providers across countries. Future research could more specifically determine which cultural or demographic aspects affect health care providers’ views on different ACP approaches.","['advance care planning', 'advance directives', 'dementia', 'physician', 'acceptability', 'preference', 'medical decision making', 'cross-cultural', 'the Netherlands', 'the United States', 'Japan']"

Er werd onderzocht of academische hulpbronnen als buffer kunnen dienen binnen de relatie tussen academische eisen en spanningsklachten. Het onderzoek is gebaseerd op het Study demands-resources model, wat het Jobs demands-resources model toepast in academische context. Bij dit onderzoek werd er gekeken naar verschillende academische eisen: rolconflict, het tempo en de hoeveelheid werk en de mentale belasting. Voor academische hulpbronnen werd er gekeken naar autonomie, rolduidelijkheid en de relatie met de begeleiding. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd door middel van een online vragenlijst onder universiteit studenten. Het was een cross-sectioneel onderzoek met 171 respondenten. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat tempo en hoeveelheid werk zorgt voor meer spanningsklachten. Autonomie daarentegen vermindert spanningsklachten. Rolduidelijkheid heeft een buffer-effect op de relatie tussen tempo en hoeveelheid werk en spanningsklachten onder universitaire studenten. Verder is er gevonden dat een hoge score op relatie met de begeleiding een buffer-effect kan hebben op de relatie tussen mentale belasting en spanningsklachten. De uitkomsten van dit onderzoek bieden de mogelijkheid om in te spelen op academische eisen en academische hulpbronnen om vervolgens de spanningsklachten onder studenten te verminderen. Verder kan dit onderzoek een basis zijn voor uitgebreider onderzoek naar spanningsklachten onder studenten en de oorzaken van de spanningsklachten.",

Hebben negatieve herinneringen een effect op het brein? Een fMRI studie naar de invloed van een ruminatie inductie taak op de functionele connectiviteit in het salience netwerk bij vrouwen.,"Dolderen, Marit van","['de Rover, M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Depressie is een veel voorkomende stoornis, vooral bij vrouwen. Er zijn verschillende cognitieve en neurale risicofactoren die bijdragen aan depressiegevoeligheid. Brooding ruminatie is een belangrijke cognitieve risicofactor. Een belangrijke neurale risicofactor is abnormale connectiviteit in of tussen een van de netwerken van het triple netwerk model. Het doel van dit bachelorproject is om te onderzoeken wat er in het salience netwerk gebeurt bij vrouwen tijdens acute ruminatie. Hiermee proberen we inzicht te krijgen in eventuele neurale aanwijzingen voor depressiegevoeligheid. Hiervoor zijn de volgende onderzoeksvragen opgesteld; wat is het effect van acute ruminatie op het salience netwerk bij vrouwen? Wordt de grootte van het effect van ruminatie gemodereerd door de gevoeligheid voor depressie? Hebben deelnemers met een hoge score op brooding ruminatie ook een hoge score op de LEIDS? Voor dit onderzoek hebben vrouwelijke participanten verschillende vragenlijsten ingevuld en zijn er MRI-scans van de hersenen gemaakt; één tijdens ruminatie en één tijdens resting-state. Vervolgens is er een region of interest analyse op de scans, een moderatie analyse op het effect en een correlatie analyse op de resultaten van de vragenlijsten uitgevoerd. Hieruit blijkt dat tijdens acute ruminatie verschillende hersengebieden meer connectiviteit met het salience netwerk vertonen. Er zijn geen significante resultaten gevonden voor de moderatie en correlatie analyse. Concluderend, acute ruminatie leidt tot een verhoogde functionele connectiviteit met het salience netwerk, dit leidt niet tot meer depressieve gevoeligheid; hoge connectiviteit met het salience netwerk zou dus geen biologische marker zijn voor depressiegevoeligheid. Voor vervolgonderzoek wordt aangeraden een inclusievere groep te onderzoeken.",
Werken met vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking. De mening van professionals,"Stok, Kyra van der","['Lotz, A.M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking (LVB) worden in onderzoek naar vaders vaak over het hoofd gezien, terwijl de rol van vaders in de opvoeding in de afgelopen decennia veranderd is. Vaders zijn meer betrokken bij de opvoeding en in het leven van hun kind(eren) (Mesman & Vermeer, 2017). Wanneer vaders een LVB hebben, is het van belang dat professionals passende ondersteuning bieden (Van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2022b). Dit onderzoek geeft een overzicht van de ervaringen en knelpunten die professionals ervaren in het werken met vaders met een LVB. De volgende vragen staan in dit onderzoek centraal: ‘Wat is er in de literatuur bekend over de ervaringen van professionals in het werken met vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking?’ en 'Wat zijn de ervaringen en knelpunten van professionals die werken met vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking?'. Het onderzoek omvat een literatuuronderzoek en zeven semigestructureerde diepte-interviews met professionals die werken met vaders met een LVB. De bevindingen van de interviews zijn gecodeerd aan de hand van thema’s die in de transcripten naar voren komen. Uit de literatuur komen een aantal risicofactoren naar voren die aanwezig zijn bij vaders met een LVB. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn een slechte mentale en fysieke gezondheid en een lage sociaaleconomische status (SES) (Emerson, 2015). Ook worden kenmerken van vaders met een LVB benoemd die bijdragen aan de ervaringen en knelpunten van professionals die werken met deze vaders. In de literatuur wordt benoemd dat vaders met een LVB minder vaardig zijn in cognitief en adaptief functioneren en een laag IQ hebben (Pratt & Greydanus, 2007). Negatieve ervaringen die professionals hebben in het werken met vaders met een LVB, zijn gerelateerd aan de samenwerking tussen professional en vader met een LVB, maar ook tussen professionals onderling. Daarnaast worden het hebben van een lage mate van begrip en minder goede communicatievaardigheden van vaders met een LVB als lastig ervaren door de professional (Joha, 2004). Negatieve ervaringen die benoemd worden door vaders met een LVB zijn dat ze zich weggeduwd en buitengesloten voelen. Vertrouwen, positieve aanmoedigingen en goed georganiseerde hulpverlening kunnen deze negatieve ervaringen verminderen (Theodore et al., 2018). In het empirisch onderzoek hebben professionals een aantal ervaringen en knelpunten benoemd. Positieve ervaringen die professionals hebben in de samenwerking met vaders met een LVB, zijn de eerlijkheid en openheid van vaders met een LVB. Ook de emotionele expressie van deze vaders en de liefde en betrokkenheid die vaders met een LVB tonen naar hun kinderen vormen positieve ervaringen van professionals. Negatieve ervaringen die werden benoemd, zijn moeilijkheden in de communicatie, beperkt reflectievermogen, slechte emotieregulatie, lage intelligentiequotiënt en problemen in de samenwerking binnen het gezin. Ook benoemen professionals risico- en beschermende factoren van vaders met een LVB. SES, mentale gezondheid en omgeving kunnen bevorderend of belemmerend werken voor vaders met een LVB zelf en de samenwerking tussen de professional en de vader met een LVB. Daarnaast geven zij aan dat het bevorderen van betrokkenheid van vaders in het gezinsondersteuningsproces een manier is om het competentiegevoel van vaders met een LVB te versterken, waardoor de samenwerking tussen professional en vader met een LVB verbetert. Op basis van het onderzoek is geadviseerd om te kijken naar de rol van de vader binnen een gezin om knelpunten in de samenwerking tussen vaders met een LVB en professionals te voorkomen. Ook wordt geadviseerd om meer educatie te verzorgen voor professionals op het gebied van vaders met een LVB. Daarnaast is het van belang om knelpunten op organisatorisch vlak te voorkomen. Tenslotte is uit dit onderzoek naar voren gekomen dat het van belang is dat de juiste hulp geboden wordt aan vaders met een LVB.","['Vaders, Licht verstandelijke beperking, LVB, Mening professionals']"

The associations between Objective and Subjective Cognitive Functioning and Treatment Delays in Bipolar Disorder,"Dobre, Mara",['Manja Koenders'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis sought to investigate the relationships between treatment delays in bipolar disorder (BD) and cognitive impairments which characterize the disorder, measured both objectively and subjectively. Previous studies have established that a long delay occurs between the onset of mood symptoms in BD and the first form of treatment received, estimates ranging between 6 and 11 years. Cognitive impairments in the domains of executive functions, processing speed and memory were found to persist in BD patients even during euthymia. Such cognitive impairments burden BD patients, prevent them from regaining an appropriate level of general functioning and diminish their quality of life. Thus, in order to determine whether treatment delay impacts the cognitive impairments present in BD, 69 participants were followed over the course of one year, at three different time points. The participants took part in clinical interviews, and then were asked to complete multiple measures, such as the YMRS, the QIDS, four WAIS subscales (Block Design, Arithmetic, Information and Digit symbol), and the Cognition subscale of the WHODAS. The average treatment delay found in the current sample was 14.53 years. The results of the current study suggest that longer treatment delays did not significantly predict worse cognitive functioning in BD patients, either when measured subjectively, or when measured objectively.","['Bipolar disorder', 'treatment delay/latency', 'WHODAS', 'WAIS', 'cognitive functioning', 'objective cognitive impairment', 'subjective cognitive impairment.']"

Het verlegen kind in een politieverhoor: Een onderzoek naar de rol van kinderpersoonlijkheid in de Nederlandse kinderverhoormethode,"Piers, Noortje",['Arnout Koornneef'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In the Netherlands, children are interrogated using the Dutch child interrogation method ‘the scenariomodel’. Surprisingly, this method does not consider the impact of children's personality traits, despite literature indicating that these traits play a central role in their perspectives and can therefore influence the course of the interrogation and their testimony. This correlational study investigated the extent to which the personality trait 'shyness' plays a role in the course of the child interrogation according to the scenariomodel and in the quality of the witness statement. The research target group are children under the age of 12 who are victims of online sexual abuse. Participants (N = 23) underwent an ethically responsible simulation of online sexual abuse and a simulation of a child interrogation according to the scenariomodel. The transcripts of the interrogations were coded to first examine the quality of the testimony based on three indicators: accuracy of the statement, completeness of the statement and the amount of forensic information. And second to investigate the course of the interrogation based on the resistance that children show. Shyness was measured with a questionnaire. The study anticipated that shy children exhibit more resistance and provide lower quality testimonials due to their susceptibility to suggestiveness and social discomfort during interrogations. However, the results showed no significant correlations between shyness and the quality indicators of the testimony, nor between shyness and resistance. A mediating effect of resistance on the quality of the testimony was therefore also excluded. This suggests that the scenariomodel may be resistant to the negative influences of this personality trait and can be used without concern for interrogating shy children who have been victims of online sexual abuse. However, due to important limitations of the study, firm conclusions cannot be drawn and follow-up research is necessary.","['kinderverhoor', 'verlegenheid', 'scenariomodel']"

Suicidal Ideation in Relation to Borderline Personality Traits: Mediated by Shame and Guilt?,"Ouwerkerk, Renee",['L.M.M. Kivelä'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Suicidal ideation is more prevalent in people with Borderline Personality Disorder. Negative self-conscious emotions, such as shame and guilt, may be related to this relationship. In this study the relationship between suicidal ideation and borderline personality traits was explored. Shame and guilt were analysed as possible mediators. The Personality Assessment Inventory – Borderline Scale was used to assess borderline personality traits, and Ecological Momentary Assessment was used to gather data on suicidal ideation, guilt and shame four times a day, over the course of three weeks via an app. The sample consisted of (N = 82) adults with a history of a suicide attempt or moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation in the past year. The relationships were analysed using a parallel mediation model consisting of multiple multilevel regression analyses. All steps of the model showed significant relationships. The last step showed that instead of typical mediation, the model indicated suppression, because of an increase in the association between borderline personality traits and suicidal ideation when accounting for shame and guilt. More research is necessary to explore the possible cause of these findings.","['Borderline Personality Disorder, Suicidal Ideation, Shame, Guilt']"
The influence of reward and catecholamines on functional network topology,"Klaasse, Iris",['Dr. Julie Hall'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This research aims to investigate the topology of the brain during reward processing and the influence of dopamine and norepinephrine on this network. So far, most research about reward processing has concentrated on specific brain areas and connections between particular regions, rather than the brain's organization and architecture. By investigating this organisation, gaps in our understanding of the brain architecture can be addressed, which could in turn lead to a better understanding of pathologies that disrupt the brain’s architecture. It is hypothesized that the brain will be more integrated during reward processing, and that increased dopamine and norepinephrine activity will result in a more integrated brain organisation. To test this prediction, the Global Efficiency (GE) of a total of 132 Regions of Interest (ROIs) and BOLD- activity of the Substantia Nigra/Ventral Tegmental Area (SN/VTA) and the Locus Coeruleus (LC) were obtained during a reward processing task, which 38 participants completed. During a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan, participants completed a reward- emotion recognition test. As predicted, in the reward condition, the paired t-test showed a higher GE in comparison to the no-reward condition in several nodes, mostly in the default mode network. These findings imply that the brain is more integrated when processing reward than when it is not processing reward. However, the catecholamines showed no significant correlation with this integration. Future research is needed to investigate the topology and influence of different catecholamines in more detail. The implications of these findings will be discussed.","['Brain topology, Global Efficiency, Integration, Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Catecholamines']"
The Mediating Effect of Mindfulness on the Interaction Between Psychedelic Drug Intake and Cognitive Flexibility,"Cyliax, Marilu",['Huseyin Beykoylu'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent years, classical psychedelics have become increasingly popular as a possible treatment method for mental health disorders. Optimizing set and setting during psychedelic use leads to the most beneficial outcomes. Trait mindfulness, which is the general tendency to experience mindfulness in daily life, could be seen as part of the set. Earlier research suggested that psychedelic drug intake could lead to increases in practicing mindfulness, trait mindfulness, and cognitive flexibility (CF), all factors associated with positive mental health outcomes. Moreover, these factors seem to be interconnected, as, for instance, trait mindfulness can predict higher CF. Since there has currently been no research yet on the influence of psychedelic drug intake on CF with trait mindfulness as a mediator, as well as on the impact of psychedelic drug intake on trait mindfulness controlling for current meditation practice, this paper aimed at filling this explanatory gap. The findings suggested that psychedelic-experienced individuals are more likely to currently be a meditator than psychedelic naives and that the positive association between psychedelic use and trait mindfulness remains after correcting for current meditation practice. Further, a significant indirect relationship between psychedelic drug intake and CF with trait mindfulness as a mediator has been found, though the direct effect is non-significant. Lastly, psychedelic use-related variables were investigated, showing that the dose could positively predict CF but other variables, including frequency, recency, and likelihood of next intake could not. Implications of these findings for current practice, future research, and psychedelic-based treatment were considered.","['Psychedelics, Cognitive Flexibility, Trait Mindfulness, State Mindfulness, Set and Setting, Psychedelic-based Treatment']"
Motor Sequence Learning Abilities and Amyloid-β in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Dementia,"Ivorra Garcia, Uma","['Middelkoop, H.', 'Ruitenberg, M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are neurodegenerative conditions associated with cognitive decline. Previous research suggests that motor impairments are also present in individuals with MCI and AD. This thesis study aims to evaluate motor sequence learning abilities in patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and AD compared to healthy controls. This thesis study also explores the relationship between amyloid-β burden, a known biomarker for MCI and AD, and motor sequence learning to study whether such motor learning could also be a behavioral biomarker. This is because measuring amyloid-β is very costly and invasive, and thus the search for other biomarkers is important. Methods A cross-sectional design was employed, and participants included 28 AD patients, 33 aMCI patients, and 53 healthy controls. Motor sequence learning was assessed using a computerized task measuring reaction time and accuracy per trial, and with this information the rate and final amount of learning was calculated, i.e. how fast and how much information the participants are able to learn, respectively. Amyloid-β burden was measured using PET imaging, with higher burden reflecting more severity of the symptoms of aMCI and AD. Results The final amount of learning was not different amongst the groups, and the rate of learning was only significantly different between the AD and aMCI groups, with the AD groups showing a faster rate of learning. The AD and healthy control group did not, however, differ significantly in terms of rate of learning. The amount of amyloid-β in the brain was not associated with motor sequence learning abilities. Conclusion The findings suggest that motor sequence learning abilities are preserved in individuals with aMCI and AD, both in terms of how fast and how much they learn. In fact, patients with AD showed a faster rate of learning than patients with aMCI, although this was not found when comparing the AD patients with the healthy individuals. It is possible that this finding is because patients had more to learn by the end of the task than the aMCI group given that their memory is worse, and displayed a faster rate of learning due to this. This thesis study also suggests that motor sequence learning is not a behavioral biomarker for aMCI and AD. The search for less invasive and more easily measurable biomarkers continues to be imperative.",

In addition, it was examined whether the quality of the parent-child relationship would moderate the relation between the quality of the sibling relationship and aggressive behavior between siblings during conflict. These relations were examined with a sample of 26 families, of which two siblings aged 8-15 years old and one parent participated. The amount of aggressive behavior during conflicts between siblings, quality of the sibling relationship and the quality of the parent-child relationship were measured by questionnaires. The results of this study showed a negative relation between the sibling relationship quality and aggressive behavior during conflicts between siblings, a positive relation between the quality of the sibling relationship and the quality of the parent-child relationship and a negative relation between the quality of the parent-child relationship and aggressive behavior during conflicts between siblings. The quality of the parent-child relationship did not act as a moderator for the relationship between the quality of the sibling relationship and the degree of aggressive behavior in conflicts between siblings.

In order to provide the most effective assistance to children with ASD, understanding the cognitive foundation of this disorder is crucial. There are several theories on this subject, yet there is limited research delving deeper into the potential connections between these theories. This research focused on the Central Coherence Theory and the Executive Dysfunction Theory and investigated whether there is a relation between these factors in explaining ASD. For this purpose, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Task, Tower of Hanoi, Picture Span and Autism Spectrum Questionnaire were administered to 89 children aged between 8 and 11 from six different primary schools in the Netherlands. Correlation analyzes were conducted to examine whether performance on central coherence, planning, and working memory correlated with the level of ASD traits. Using the PROCESS Macro, a mediation analysis was conducted to investigate whether executive functions could mediate the relationship between central coherence and ASD characteristics. The results of this study indicated that neither central coherence nor planning nor working memory were associated with the number of ASD characteristics. Moreover, no mediating effect of planning or working memory could be found. The fact that the results were not in line with the expectations could possibly be related to the non-clinical sample used in the current study, among other things. Future research should continue to focus on further investigation into the relationship between central coherence and executive functions, carefully taking into account the heterogeneity of ASD.",
Get Beyond the Joke: Use of Cartoon Jokes in Theory of Mind Assessment in Dementia: A Dutch Cartoon Test,"Koster, Jiska","['Cuperus, A.A.', 'van den Berg, E.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Changes in social cognition, encompassing all cognitive processes that underlie social interaction, have been noted in various types of dementia. Theory of Mind (ToM) is a key aspect of social cognition, defined as the ability to understand the mental state of another person, including their emotions, intentions and beliefs. Cartoon tests aim to adopt humour using cartoon jokes to assess ToM. In this study, a new Dutch cartoon test aimed to be applicable in clinical assessment of dementia was developed and validated. The test includes 12 cartoons (6 requiring ToM to understand the joke and 6 that do not), which were collected through an extensive search and were rated by experts (n = 17) on content and funniness. Normative data for the selected cartoons was obtained by control participants (n = 39), through annotation of these, scoring categories were formed. The test was then validated in a clinical sample, including patients referred to a memory clinic for cognitive complaints and suspected dementia (n = 9), in an observational cross-sectional study with a case-control type selection of participants. Patients were expected to score lower on the cartoon test than controls. An ANCOVA with demographic variables as covariates was performed: no significant differences between patients (n = 9) and control participants (n = 9) were found (p > .05). Further, the internal validity (Cronbach’s α of .864 for the total cartoon test) and convergent validity of test was good. Divergent validity was found to be questionable. Regarding demographics: females were expected to score higher than males; older participants were expected to score higher than younger participants; and higher educated participants were expected to score higher than lower educated participants on the cartoon test. A Mann-Whitney U analysis showed no gender differences (p > .05); assessment of Spearman-rank order correlation coefficients showed age was significant in its negative relation to cartoon test performance (p < .05); and education level significant in its positive relation to test performance (p < .05). Future investigation with a larger patient sample including differential dementia diagnoses is recommended to substantiate the results and make the test clinically applicable.","['cartoon test', 'theory of mind', 'social cognition', 'humour', 'dementia']"
The presence of an attentional bias towards itch-related pictures: in people with chronic itch in comparison to healthy individuals,"Varenkamp, Michelle","['Becker, J.M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Itch is a somatosensory stimulus and could potentially alter performance of daily activities. Since itch stimuli will signal potential danger, one might want to protect oneself from potential harm by adapting ones behaviour. Pleading itch stimuli demands ones attention, which can be called the attentional bias (AB). Adapting ones behaviour might influence the effectiveness of treatment, due to not paying attention to the treatment. So far, an AB has been found in healthy individuals, but evidence is mixed. In addition, it is unclear if an AB is present in patients who experience chronic itch. Therefore, this study investigated attentional bias towards itch related visual stimuli in participants who suffer from chronic itch (N=34) compared to healthy controls (N=36). Attentional bias was measured in an online study with two attention tasks, the dot-probe paradigm and the spatial-cuing paradigm using itch-related pictures. During the dot-probe task, patients with chronic itch showed the presence of an AB. Yet, the results acquired from the spatial-cuing task showed the presence of an AB in every participant in disregard of the group they were in. This is not in line with previous research. However, previous research only investigated healthy individuals. Furthermore, all participants reacted faster on invalid trials once an itch cue was presented. One might interpret this as having an attentional avoidance of threat. Yet, also healthy participants seemed to react faster, which perhaps indicates that the itch cue is an overall negative cue regardless of having a past with itch. The discrepancy between the two attention tasks is remarkable, and could perhaps be ascribed to the different processing skills the two tasks ask from the participant. Therefore, future research should focus on the different components of attentional processing. This could eventually optimize current treatment/intervention options.","['Itch', 'Attentional bias', 'Dot-probe paradigm', 'Spatial-cuing paradigm']"
Amygdala Volumes in Conduct Disordered Juvenile Offenders with Callous-Unemotional Traits,"Bastian, Floortje","['Aghajani, Moji']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Conduct Disorder (CD) is a common psychiatric disorder of childhood and adolescence characterized by severe aggressive and antisocial behaviors that often result in impaired social, academic, or occupational functioning. The subtype CD with callous-unemotional (CU) traits has been suggested to be part of the developmentary trajectory of psychopathy, with both being linked to amygdalar volume deficits. Research into the neurodevelopmental perspective of CD/CU+ has been inconsistent due to methodological, demographic and cultural factors. Therefore, the current study examined amygdala morphology in two matched juvenile groups: CD offenders (N = 51) and healthy control subjects (HC; N = 36). In an additional set of analyses, the CD group was divided in two subgroups: CD with CU traits (CD/CU+; N = 26), CD without CU traits (CD/CU-; N = 25), and compared to HC participants. Additionally, the influence of CU traits on brain morphology was assessed in a dimensional manner across all participants (N = 87). Analyses revealed significant lower left amygdalar volumes in all CD youth compared to HC youth, while no significant differences emerged in the right amygdalar volumes. Furthermore, no significant differences in amygdalar volumes emerged between CD/CU- vs. CD/CU+ vs. HC youths. Moreover, the severity of CU traits did not relate to brain morphology in a dimensional manner across all participants. The current findings reflect the complexity and inconsistency of research into the relationship between brain morphology and CD diagnosis, and add to the research into the neurodevelopmental perspective of CD/CU+","['Amygdala, callous-unemotional traits, conduct disorder, morphology, psychopathy']"

The association of trauma severity with quality of life and health costs among outpatients diagnosed with a personality disorder,"Meuche, Annika",['J. D. Blom'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Individuals diagnosed with a personality disorder (PD) are often confronted with a low quality of life (QoL) and high health costs, both important outcome variables among cost-effectiveness studies. Several factors have been identified that are associated with a low QoL and high health costs in individuals diagnosed with a PD. The influence of trauma is unknown. It has been found that PDs are associated with both past trauma experiences and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their daily life. While several studies suggested that individuals with a Borderline PD (BPD) and comorbid PTSD suffer from a more impaired QoL compared to individuals with a single disorder, less is known about the effect of PTSD on PDs other than BPD and the relation between trauma severity and health costs. The current study investigates the effect of both childhood trauma and current PTSD symptoms on QoL and health costs in individuals diagnosed with a PD and the possible mediating role of QoL on the relationship between trauma and health costs. The sample consisted of 65 individuals, with a mean age of 38 (SD = 12.3), diagnosed with one or more PDs. Data was collected with several questionnaires (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, Treatment Inventory of Costs in Patients with psychiatric disorders, and the Mental Health Quality of Life questionnaire). The results show that severity of current PTSD symptoms (t(58) = -4.19, p < .001) but not childhood trauma was related to a decreased QoL in individuals diagnosed with a PD. Both current PTSD symptoms and childhood trauma were not significantly related to health costs. QoL did not perform a mediating role on the relationship between trauma and health costs. To conclude, severe PTSD symptoms represent an additional deprivation for QoL among personality-disordered individuals in this sample. This conclusion is based on a relatively small sample, thus should be further investigated with a larger sample.","['Personality Disorder', 'Quality of Life', 'Trauma', 'PTSD']"

This study aimed to research how adverse childhood experiences in a population of university students who report mood and stress problems are related to suicidal ideation and whether the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and suicidal ideation is moderated by attachment style. To target students at risk for suicidal ideation, purposive sampling was employed. An independent samples t-test with consecutive multiple regression (n= 234) showed that adverse childhood experiences, measured with the ACE questionnaire, predicted the presence and severity of suicidal ideation, measured by the BSSI. Consecutive ANCOVA showed that disorganized attachment to the mother and father, measured with the PBI, were found to predict suicidal ideation. Secure attachment was negatively associated with suicidal ideation, whereas for avoidant and anxious attachment there was no association found. A logistic regression analysis showed no moderation effect of insecure attachment styles in the relation between adverse childhood experiences and suicidal ideation. Gender, academic pressure, and nationality were controlled. Findings may be limited due to methodological and performance flaws. The results highlight the importance of early identification of adverse childhood experiences and disorganized attachment for intervention and prevention of later suicidal ideation amongst students.","['childhood trauma', 'suicidality', 'attachment', 'adverse childhood experiences', 'students', 'suicide risk', 'university', 'ACE', 'attachment styles', 'childhood adversity', 'suicidal ideation']"

The Effect of Virtual Reality Psychoeducation on Self-Stigma and Depressive Symptoms in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder,"Hees, Tessa van","['Schipper, N.', 'Cuperus, A.A.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Many patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) suffer from self-stigma. Self-stigma can lead to a decrease in recovery speed and treatment adherence. Psychoeducation for depression has shown to be effective in improving treatment adherence and self-stigma. In recent years, researchers investigated Virtual reality (VR) as a potential tool in the treatment of depression. Studies have shown that VR interventions can reduce, among other things, self-stigma and depressive symptoms. We investigated the impact of a VR experience combined with psychoeducation compared to traditional, non-VR psychoeducation on self-stigma and depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD. We expected the VR intervention to have a more positive effect in reducing self-stigma and depressive symptoms than non-VR. Methods: The 31 recruited participants, aged 18-65 years old, were randomized into two groups: VR and non-VR. Two 360-degree VR videos were developed to experience a day in the life of a patient with depression. Self-stigma and depressive symptoms were measured before intervention (T0), directly after intervention (T1, only self-stigma), after 1 week (T2), and a follow-up after 10 weeks (T3). A repeated measures ANOVA was used for comparing the treatment groups. Results: Contrary to the hypothesis, the repeated measures ANOVA results indicated no significant interaction effect between time and treatment group for self-stigma (p = .393). In terms of depressive symptoms, a repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between time and treatment group (p = .027), with a medium effect size (η2 = .095). Post hoc testing using Bonferroni showed that non-VR significantly decreased depressive symptoms across different time points compared to VR. Additionally, post hoc testing revealed that self-stigma and depressive symptoms may be positively correlated. Conclusion: No significant difference was found between the two treatment conditions in terms of decreasing self-stigma. However, the non-VR condition demonstrated a significant decrease in depressive symptoms compared to the VR condition. Additionally, positive correlations were observed between self-stigma and depressive symptoms, which emphasize the value of incorporating psychoeducation into treatment plans for people with MDD.","['Depression', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Self-Stigma', 'Internalized Stigma', 'Virtual Reality', 'Psychoeducation']"

Hieruit kwam dat de school kan werken aan positief klimaat, veilig klimaat, omgaan met ongewenst, sociaal-emotioneel welzijn en klassenmanagement. Er wordt aangeraden om aan alle componenten te werken, omdat bij alle componenten er ruimte is voor verbetering. De aanbevelingen aan de school zijn om hieraan te werken en dit schoolbreed te doen waarbij alle betrokkenen op school deelnemen aan het maken van beslissingen.","['Veilig schoolklimaat', 'basisschool']"

Trauma symptoms or PTSD can lead to significant disruptions in cognitive empathy and high levels of anxiety. The aim of the current study is to look into the relationships between PTSD, cognitive empathy and anxiety in Syrian refugee children, and to test for gender differences. Participants were 33 Syrian refugee children aged 10-18. PTSD was measured using CPSS, cognitive empathy was measured using the EmQue-CA and the EDG (three social conditions were used: neutral individuals, victims and offenders of intentional pain) and anxiety was measured using the SCARED. Results showed that cognitive empathy did not affect Syrian refugee children in social situations. Secondly, anxiety did not affect cognitive empathy levels. Thirdly, anxiety did not affect cognitive empathy differently for boys and girls. Lastly, cognitive empathy is disrupted within Syrian refugee children with trauma symptoms or even PTSD. Suggesting that cognitive empathy is a predictor of PTSD. The findings of the current study could potentially be important for future faster treatment of trauma symptoms or even PTSD by using cognitive empathy levels as a predictive factor.",

Aanleren van inferentievaardigheden met video’s in groep 6: invloed van technisch leesniveau.,"Veerman, Willemijn","['Venneker, D.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"This thesis describes an experimental study with a between-subjects and within-subjects design on the possibility to train inferential skills by using expository video. Over the past years the level of reading comprehension among Dutch students decreases. A low motivation may perhaps explain this downward trend. One way to increase the motivation of Dutch students could be by using digital resources. Inferential skills are crucial during reading to create a mental representation of the text. This is an important part of reading comprehension. This research focusses on the progression in inferential skills of students, when these skills are taught using expository video. The progression made is compared to the progression in inferential skills of students who were taught inferential skills using expository text, and students in the control condition. Furthermore, the relation between this progression and the level of reading fluency was studied. Participants were 105 Dutch student (age 8 to 11 years) in grade six from four different primary schools. They were randomly assigned to one of the conditions, namely video condition, text condition and control condition, where they received either eight trainings with expository video or text, or no training at all. The inferential skills of all participants were tested using a pretest and a posttest, before and after the training was given. Results show that the training, either with expository video or text, is not effective in teaching inferential skills to Dutch students in grade six. In addition was the level of reading fluency not related to the effectivity of the training with expository video or text.",
De Kwaliteit van de Broer-Zusrelatie: Het Verband met de Kwaliteit van de Ouder-Kindrelatie en de Rol van Differentieel Ouderschap,"Boddaert, Emma","['Berkel, S. van']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"According to the Family Systems theory, family members are part of an interdependent network in which individuals and relationships affect other family members or other relationships. This study examines the association between the quality of the parent-child relationship and the quality of the sibling relationship and investigates if perceptions of differential parenting mediate the association between within-family differences in parent-child relationship quality and sibling relationship quality. Sibling relationship quality, parent-child relationship quality and the magnitude of perceived differential parenting were assessed in a sample of 26 Dutch sibling pairs aged between 8 and 15 years old and their biological and/or legal parent, using the Parent-Child Interaction Questionnaire - Revised, the Sibling Relationship Questionnaire - Short version and the Sibling Inventory of Differential Experience. The results showed that older siblings and younger siblings reported the same relationship qualities and the same magnitude of differential parenting. In line with the Family Systems theory, the association between the quality of the parent-child relationship and the quality of the sibling relationship was significant for older siblings. Moreover, there was no mediating effect of differential parenting, but differences in parent-child relationship quality and sibling relationship quality were positively related. For younger siblings both associations were not significant. However, the associations between relationships of the older siblings were not significantly different from the associations for the younger siblings, in that both children reported a higher sibling relationship quality when the older sibling had a higher parent-child relationship quality than the younger sibling. This suggests that a spillover effect may exist from the relationship between parent and older sibling to other relationships in the family. Future research could investigate the underlying mechanisms of this association and could clarify the direction of the association between the parent-child relationship quality and the sibling relationship quality.","['broer-zusrelatie', 'ouder-kindrelatie', 'differentieel ouderschap']"

Zij adviseren vanuit het Neurosequentiële Model van Therapie (NMT), waarmee de ontwikkeling van een kind volledig in kaart wordt gebracht om te bepalen welke interventie het best bij dat kind past. Het onderzoek beschreven in dit rapport is uitgevoerd naar aanleiding van de tweeledige adviesvraag van TeamNEXT betreffende 1) het wetenschappelijke inzicht achter het NMT en 2) de ervaringen van behandelaren aan wie zij advies hebben verstrekt. Naar aanleiding van de adviesvraag zijn er twee specifieke, meetbare onderzoeksvragen opgesteld. De eerste onderzoeksvraag die beantwoord wordt in dit adviesrapport luidt als volgt: “In hoeverre is het verschil tussen de hersenontwikkeling van jongens en meisjes na jeugdtrauma relevant en zou het beschreven moeten worden in het Neurosequentiële Model (NMT)?”. Deze vraag wordt beantwoord aan de hand van een literatuuronderzoek. De tweede onderzoeksvraag is “In hoeverre zijn de adviezen van TeamNEXT aan behandelaren opgevolgd en wat zijn de voornaamste redenen voor het wel of niet opvolgen van dit advies?” en wordt beantwoord middels semigestructureerde interviews met behandelaren die advies hebben ontvangen van TeamNEXT. Uit het literatuuronderzoek is gebleken dat er zowel overeenkomsten als verschillen zijn tussen jongens en meisjes op het gebied van traumarespons en -verwerking. Daarbij zouden de verschillen uitgebreider kunnen worden beschreven in het NMT. In totaal waren vier behandelaren bereid om deel te nemen aan een interview. Drie daarvan waren al bekend met het NMT. De adviezen van TeamNEXT werden door alle behandelaren als positief beoordeeld. Zij gaven aan bevestiging te hebben gekregen van hun eigen handelen en nieuwe inzichten uit het advies te hebben vergaard. De ervaringen met de uitvoering van de adviezen waren echter wisselend. Sommige behandelaren kregen te maken met praktische belemmeringen, zoals een tekort aan doorverwijsmogelijkheden, weinig tijd, en ernstige problematiek, waardoor het niet mogelijk was om het advies volledig op te volgen. Toch zouden alle vier de behandelaren een adviestraject bij TeamNEXT aanraden aan collega’s met een complexe of vastlopende casus. Al met al kan er worden geadviseerd om de verschillen tussen jongens en meisjes wat betreft traumarespons en -verwerking mee te nemen in het advies naar behandelaren. Verder 2 zou TeamNEXT rekening kunnen houden met de haalbaarheid van de gegeven adviezen, waarbij voornamelijk meer rekening moet worden gehouden met de praktische belemmeringen. Concreet zouden er meer doorverwijsmogelijkheden gecreëerd kunnen worden, zoals het opstellen van een lijst van behandelaren die werken volgens de werkwijze van het NMT en de geadviseerde behandelingen van TeamNEXT uit zouden kunnen voeren.",

The relationship between overprotective parenting and childhood anxiety,"Sierat, Anouk","['Vreeke, L.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Part of the origin of anxiety comes from genetic heredity and the rest is explained by environmental factors. Parental and family characteristics play an important role in the environmental factors of anxiety. Specific parenting styles are linked to childhood anxiety. Several studies showed that parental overprotection can be linked to anxiety in children. However, there are some inconsistent results between the different studies. This inconsistency may occur because previous studies looked at parents and children in general and possibly, this relationship is mainly important in specific groups of parents and children. Therefore, in this study we look at parents’ socioeconomic status and the gender of the child as a moderator for the link between parental overprotection and anxiety in children. This study was part of a larger research project named Cool Little Kids. We used the pre-intervention, baseline data of the Cool Little Kids project in which 170 parents participated. Parents filled out several questionnaires regarding parental overprotection, child anxiety and demographic characteristics. The results showed that there was no significant effect between overprotective parenting and childhood anxiety that is moderated by SES of the parents and gender of the child. However, the results did point at the expected directions, although they are too small to give significant results. This means that overprotective parenting may not be as important as we assumed. Results of this study must be considered with regard to several limitations. The sample size of this study is small, parents with low socioeconomic status are underrepresented and the study is based on cross-sectional data. Further studies might focus on other parental and environmental factors such as an authoritarian parenting style that may have a larger influence on childhood anxiety and the influence of parenting styles on childhood anxiety in same sex parent-child pairs.","['Overprotective parenting', 'childhood anxiety', 'gender', 'socioeconomic status']"

Living with Neurological Conditions: A Comparative Study of HRQoL in ALS and Stroke Patients Using PROMIS-10,"Klok, Miryam","['Ghita, I.A.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. There is a growing body of research indicating the importance of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to evaluate quality of life. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is additionally of increasing interest when examining individuals with chronic conditions. PROMs can enhance patient care and monitor progress, possibly contributing to the improvement of HRQoL. The purpose of the current study was to compare the self-reported HRQoL of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and patients who were three months post-stroke. Methods. A sample of n = 419 patients with ALS (66.1% male, mean age M = 65) and a sample of N = 360 patients with a stroke (60.3% male, mean age M = 70) completed the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Global Health (PROMIS-10). Analyses were performed to compare the physical and mental HRQoL scores between the patient samples. Prior research has established Dutch reference norms for the PROMIS-10. Since the current study took place in the Netherlands, the results of the patient samples were also compared to the scores of the Dutch population. Additional analyses examined the influence of covariates such as age and sex. Results. The results showed that patients with a stroke reported significantly lower mental HRQoL than the general population, with a mean difference of T = -0.96 (p < .05). Patients in the ALS sample did not report significantly different mental HRQoL compared to stroke or the general population. Regarding physical HRQoL, ALS reported significantly lower scores than the stroke sample, with a mean difference of T = -2.69 (p < .001), as well as the general population (T = -5.71, p < .001). Age did not have a significant influence on the self-reported HRQoL. Finally, analyses revealed that the women (n = 285) of both patient populations reported lower physical and mental HRQoL than men, with mean differences of T = -2.11 (p < .001) and T = -1.47 (p = .015), respectively. Conclusion. Patients with ALS reported significantly lower physical HRQoL than patients who were three months post-stroke. There were no significant differences in the self-reported mental HRQoL. Compared to the general Dutch population, patients with ALS and patients with stroke both reported lower physical HRQoL, while patients with stroke also reported lower mental HRQoL. The findings of the current study provide support for the integration of HRQoL short-form measures such as PROMIS-10 into clinical care, to identify the need for intervention or for monitoring progress.","['patient-reported outcomes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, chronic neurologic conditions, health-related quality of life, PROMIS']"

Het perspectief van volwassen geadopteerden op de hulp van een ervaringsdeskundige,"Kluts, Denise","['Buimer, E.E.L.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek gaat over het perspectief van volwassen geadopteerden op de inzet van ervaringsdeskundigen. Een ervaringsdeskundige is in dit onderzoek als volgt gedefinieerd: iemand die op basis van persoonlijke ervaringskennis in staat is deze kennis, in welke vorm dan ook, in te zetten als hulp aan anderen zonder een opleiding te hebben in de hulpverlening. Er wordt onderzocht van welke problematiek sprake is bij volwassen geadopteerden en aan welke hulp van ervaringsdeskundigen zij behoefte hebben. Drie deelvragen zijn beantwoord aan de hand van literatuuronderzoek. Voor de andere twee deelvragen is kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd. Door middel van tien semigestructureerde interviews is de data verzameld. Uit het literatuuronderzoek is gebleken dat geadopteerden vaker psychologische hulp nodig hebben en vaker last hebben van internaliserende problematiek dan niet-geadopteerden. Daarnaast kunnen problemen in zelfbeeld, identiteit en hechting voorkomen die gerelateerd zijn aan de adoptie geschiedenis. Hoewel de vraag naar hulp vanuit geadopteerden groot is, bestaat er in Nederland momenteel nog geen centrale adoptiehulpverlening. Ondanks de afwezigheid van centrale hulpverlening, zijn er verschillende interventies beschikbaar die specifiek gericht zijn op de problematiek van geadopteerden. Over het algemeen sluit de professionele hulp niet volledig aan bij de behoeften van geadopteerden. Weinig onderzoek is nog gedaan naar de inzet van ervaringsdeskundigen, zeker op het gebied van adoptiehulp. Daarom is in het literatuuronderzoek ook gekeken naar de inzet van ervaringsdeskundigen op andere gebieden. Doorgaans zijn er positieve effecten gevonden voor de inzet van ervaringsdeskundigen in verschillende velden op de effectiviteit van behandeling. Toch zijn er ook risico’s verbonden aan de inzet van ervaringsdeskundigen, hierbij kan worden gedacht aan de beperkte inzetbaarheid van de ervaringsdeskundige. Deze persoon kan geadopteerden enkel met bepaalde aspecten helpen en is mogelijk niet voor iedereen even geschikt of wenselijk. De resultaten uit de interviews sloten deels aan op de verwachtingen die op basis van het literatuuronderzoek werden geschetst. Uit de interviews blijkt dat meer dan de helft van de volwassen geadopteerden behoefte heeft aan hulp. Er zijn verschillende drijfveren voor het zoeken naar hulp. Om die reden is de vraag naar hulp uiteenlopend. De reguliere hulp die momenteel geboden wordt, is voor een aantal participanten niet passend. Uit de interviews blijkt dat volwassen geadopteerden graag de hulp van ervaringsdeskundigen willen, als er gekeken wordt naar de aspecten: herkenning, begrip en het delen van ervaringen en emoties. Verder gaven participanten aan dat een ervaringsdeskundige een opleiding gevolgd moet hebben. De thema’s die ontbreken in de reguliere hulpverlening kunnen worden aangevuld door een ervaringsdeskundige. Op basis van de resultaten van het onderzoek wordt er geconcludeerd dat er behoefte is aan hulp van ervaringsdeskundigen voor volwassen geadopteerden. Een ervaringsdeskundige zou een verrijking kunnen zijn van de huidige hulpverlening voor geadopteerden die internaliserende problemen ervaren en die onder andere graag hun verhaal en emoties willen delen, behoefte hebben aan een luisterend oor of aan een buddy. Er wordt dan ook geadviseerd een ervaringsdeskundige in te zetten voor deze behoeftes. Echter wordt er aangeraden alleen ervaringsdeskundigen in te zetten die een passende opleiding hebben gevolgd.","['Adoptie, Ervaringsdeskundigen, Professionele hulp, psychische problematiek.']"

Both forms of aggression are correlated with internalising problems (such as anxiety and depression symptoms), although there has been found more scientific evidence for reactive aggression. However, internalising problems are less visible to the outside eye in comparison to externalising problems such as aggression, and therefore more overlooked in this sample. Consequently, the current study examined the relation between both forms of aggression and internalising problems in a sample of 28 male adolescents with conduct disorder and callous-unemotional traits (ages 15 to 19). These youths self-reported on their aggression and internalising problems through the YSR and RPQ and the callous-unemotional traits were established through the ICU. Inconsistent with previous research, all forms of aggression were not significantly correlated with internalising problems. This suggests that both constructs should be treated separately in interventions. This research offers a different view to the current knowledge of aggression and internalising problems in youth with conduct disorder and callous-unemotional traits. Further research with a larger sample and perhaps different research design is necessary to provide more insight and to draw better conclusions.","['reactive aggression, proactive aggression, internalising problems, conduct disorder, callous-unemotional traits']"

Research on potential correlations and moderators is relevant to gain further insight into the networks involved in the gut-brain axis. The findings can influence treatment approaches in the field of clinical psychology to a greater focus on the gutbrain axis. Two hypotheses were examined: 1) a higher microdiversity in the gut is correlated with less emotion regulation difficulties, and 2) there are sex differences in the correlation between microdiversity and emotion regulation. Methods: This research was an observational between-subjects design with a total number of 75 participants. The primary outcome was the alpha score, assessed with the Shannon Index, which gives insight into individual microdiversity. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale was used to assess self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation to have insight into individual cognitive reactivity. Sex was conceptualised as the moderator variable. A correlational analysis for alpha scores and DERS scores was carried out, followed by a multiple regression analysis, which tested for a moderation with the variable sex. Results: There was no evidence for a negative correlation between high microdiversity and few emotion regulation difficulties. Sex did not have a significant moderation on this correlation either. Implications: Further research is needed on the gut-brain axis and sex differences in gut microdiversity and emotion regulation to adapt the treatment of stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other anxiety-related disorders from a cognitive- to a more holistic approach.","['gut feelings', 'gut-brain axis', 'GBA', 'microdiversity', 'emotion regulation', 'ER', 'sex']"

To research this, this research had an experimental pretest-training-posttest design with two groups—dyslexic and non-dyslexic—as well as two conditions—training and no-training. The participants were children in primary school between the ages of 7 and 9. The study consisted of two sessions: a preliminary investigation and a dynamic test. The dynamic test used was the EPALE-NL. It consists of four subtests: phonemic awareness, prosodic awareness, sounds and verbs, and context words.  A significant difference was found between the group that was trained and the group that was not trained, in specific for the subtest prosodic awareness, with the trained group showing more improvement in accuracy. For the performance on the posttest by the dyslexic group and non-dyslexic group, no significant difference was found between the groups. No significant relationship was found between the gain score and fluid and crystallised intelligence. Dynamic testing of reading and writing has shown potential to be used in the classroom for its previously discovered benefits, as well as its ability to teach both dyslexics and non-dyslexics of varying intelligence.","['Dynamic Testing', 'Dyslexia', 'Reading and Writing', 'EPALE']"

Additionally, previous research has shown that emotional safety can play a mediating role in this relationship. As there is increasing attention to the complexity of trauma, such as how it can vary based on factors such as frequency of events, and limited research on emotional safety as a moderator in the relationship between partner violence and trauma symptoms, this study investigated whether emotional safety plays a role in the relationship between the frequency of partner violence and trauma symptoms in children. The study included 226 mother-child pairs, with children aged 10 to 17 years. The mothers and children were referred to Veilig Thuis after a report of domestic violence. The findings of the study showed that there was no direct relationship between the frequency of partner violence and trauma symptoms in children. Additionally, no significant interaction effect was found. However, the results showed that there was an association between emotional safety and trauma symptoms in children. Therefore, emotional safety may not play a moderating but a mediating role in the relationship between the frequency of partner violence and trauma symptoms in children. Additionally, it is possible that mothers may rate the frequency of partner violence more positively than it is. Further research could focus on children's data related to partner violence, as data collected through children is considered reliable. To make well-founded statements, further research is needed to include emotional safety as a mediator and to focus on children's data related to partner violence.","['Partner Violence', 'Trauma Symptoms', 'Emotional Safety', 'Children', 'Mothers']"

Het is bekend dat stress zorgt voor een verslechtering van de cognitieve functies, in het bijzonder het geheugen en het executief functioneren. Hoewel informatie verwerkingssnelheid valt onder de cognitieve vaardigheden, ontbreekt literatuur die expliciet gaat over de invloed van stress op de verwerkingssnelheid. In deze studie wordt daarom de vraag behandeld wat het verband is tussen stress en informatie verwerkingssnelheid bij volwassenen. In de huidige studie zijn 25 deelnemers onderzocht (M = 33.24 jaar, SD = 16.03; 14 vrouwen, 11 mannen) in het kader van het bachelor-project. De deelnemers hebben de ‘Perceived Stress Scale’ ingevuld om stress te meten en de ‘Symbol Digit Modalities Test’ voltooid om informatie verwerkingssnelheid te bepalen. Naast de hoofdvraag is er ook gekeken of er verschillen zijn tussen jongeren en ouderen, tussen vrouwen en mannen, en tussen gestreste en niet-gestreste deelnemers als het gaat om de relatie tussen stress en informatieverwerkingssnelheid. Correlatieanalyses hebben geen verband gevonden tussen stress en informatie verwerkingssnelheid of verschillen in dit verband tussen de verschillende groepen (p > 0.05). Mogelijke verklaringen voor deze niet-significante resultaten kunnen te maken hebben met lage stressniveaus, het niet meten van acute versus chronische stress en een te kleine steekproef. Toekomstig onderzoek kan zich daarom richten op een grotere en diverse steekproef, en het gebruik van experimentele opzet, waarbij bijvoorbeeld stressniveaus in een laboratorium gemanipuleerd kunnen worden.",
Unravelling the ties of self-destruction: A cross-sectional study of the relationship between object relations and suicidal ideation from a psychoanalytic perspective,"Ravenzwaaij, Jena van",['R. Bahamondes Álvarez'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Suicide rates have significantly increased in the Netherlands, particularly among adolescents. Suicidal ideation has been found a crucial predictor of self-destructive behavior, but existing theoretical frameworks lack consideration of the role of the self in these thoughts. The psychoanalytic theory, which acknowledges the agency of the ego in its own destruction, offers an alternative perspective. Object relations, an important concept within this theory, has been linked to psychopathology. Objective: This study aims to address object relations as a predictor of suicidal ideation to investigate the ego involvement in selfdestruction and enrich the existing models of suicidal ideation and attachment. It was hypothesised that the dimensions of Insecure Attachment, Egocentricity and Social Incompetence would predict whether a respondent would be a suicidal ideator or not, while the dimension of Alienation was expected not to be found in the non-clinical sample. Methods: 132 students in the Netherlands participated in this cross-sectional study by filling in the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale and the Bells Object Relations and Reality Testing Inventory, of which the data was analysed by means of a Multiple Logistic Regression. Results: The full logistic model containing all predictors was statistically significant (𝜒 2 (15, N = 116) = 52.670, p = <.001). Sexual orientation and the dimension of Insecure Attachment were found to make unique significant contributions to the model. Conclusion: High scores on insecure attachment and a non-normative sexual orientation predicted whether someone was a suicidal ideator, indicating the relevance of these risk factors in detecting early warning signs in students and further research into applying these findings to psychotherapeutic practice.","['suicide, suicidal ideation, psychoanalysis, object relations, students']"
Vrijwilligers dilemma aan de hand van (on)gelijkenissen,"Meijer, Stijn de",['Erik w. de Kwaadsteniet'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Bij een vrijwilligersdilemma is er een situatie waar er een maatschappelijke taak is, waar personen vrijwillig aan kunnen bijdragen.

Er is onderzocht of gelijkenissen tussen groepsleden leidt tot het vaker vrijwillig aanbieden bij het vrijwilligersdilemma. Deze gelijkenissen zijn de antwoorden op een aantal vragen en scoring van muzikale nummers. Het idee hierachter was dat de participanten een (versterkt) groepsgevoel zouden krijgen als ze op basis van hun antwoorden in een groep geplaatst werden en zich zo vaker vrijwillig zouden aanbieden. Er zijn drie groepen, de baseline, de gelijke groep en de ongelijke groep.

De ongelijke groep houdt in dat participanten juist niet op elkaar leken met de gegeven antwoorden en zo is er gekeken of participanten zichzelf minder aan gingen bieden hierdoor. De gelijke groep was de groep waar participanten op basis van gelijke antwoorden bij de vragen in kwamen. De resultaten die uit dit onderzoek kwamen waren niet in lijn met de hypotheses. De gelijke en ongelijke groep had precies evenveel mensen die zich vrijwillig aanboden, hier was dus ook geen significante uitkomst.",

The Role of Social Self-Perception in Social Feedback Processing,"Heemskerk, Luca","['Saygin, M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Being told by someone that you did a good or bad job can impact your self-esteem. More specifically, individuals can differ in the extent to which they preferentially process positively or negatively valenced social feedback. The present study looked at how the variables of social self-perception and gender influence this social feedback processing. Through previous studies, we know that, on average, most people seek valenced feedback that is in line with their current sense of self to maintain their self- image. It was, therefore, expected that high social self-perceptions would be related to preferential processing of positive social feedback, and that low social self- perceptions would be related to negative social feedback processing. As well, an effect of gender was expected. Using the SELF-Speech paradigm task adapted from Koban et al. (2017), 80 adolescent and 175 adult participants had to give a speech which, they were told, was evaluated by judges. They had to rate their speech performance, were given the judges’ feedback, and were then asked to indicate how they felt about themselves. The higher an individual's learning rate, the more likely they were to update their self-image in response to social feedback. No significant results of gender or social self-perception on social feedback processing were found. Our findings contribute to the current literature on social feedback processing in that it appears that social self-perception does not play an influencing role in this. Furthermore, our findings give us a better understanding of how we function in a social context, as well as, how social feedback processing plays a role in the emergence and maintenance of disorders like SAD and MDD.","['social feedback processing', 'social self-perception']"

The current study investigates the relationship between visuospatial working memory, strategy use, and autistic traits through the application of dynamic testing. The aim of the study is to acquire more insight into the strategies employed by children with autistic traits and the role of visuospatial working memory. This information can assist professionals in tailoring educational programs to the needs of this specific group. The sample consisted of 41 neurotypical children aged between 8 and 11 years, of which 46 percent were girls. Strategy use was measured using the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Task, visuospatial working memory through Picture Span, and autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Questionnaire. The results showed that there was no significant relationship between strategy use and autism traits. There was also no significant difference in progress in strategy use between children with low and high autism traits. Also, no relationship was found between visuospatial working memory and autism traits. A significant relationship was only found between visuospatial working memory and progress in strategy use when copying the Rey- Osterrieth Complex Figure Task, with greater working memory capacity causing more progress in strategy use. The results of the Autism Spectrum Questionnaire showed a limited distribution of autism traits, which could be a possible explanation for rejecting the hypotheses. The small sample size and other factors that may influence autism traits are also possible explanations. Strengths and other limitations of the study are discussed and recommendations for future research are provided. The present study has contributed to scientific knowledge about the cognitive functioning of children with autism traits.",

Inference making is an important factor in reading comprehension, it is also a factor Dutch students have great difficulty with compared to other important factors in reading comprehension. Therefore a new inference making training was conducted in which students in grade 4 learned these skills through either video or text. In this training looking for clues and the use of graphic organizers was used to teach students inference making skills in eight sessions of 30 minutes. Each week two sessions took place. One for instruction and one for practice. The study used a pre- posttest design with two test groups and a control group. The growth in general reading ability was measured through a maze task. Results indicated that even though the results in general reading ability increased between the pre- and posttest, there was no difference between the intervention groups and the controlgroup. Therefore it was concluded that this training was not effective for both conditions; video and text. When looking at the difference in growth for students with low and high reading motivation there was found no difference in growth for the different conditions. The attitude of the students towards the training was examined as well. These findings indicated that there was no different attitude towards the text training or the video training. When looking at the influence of reading motivation on these results there was a significant effect where students with higher reading motivation had a better attitude towards the training. Students motivation did not differ in text or video condition. This study is a good starting point for further research into inference making training.","['leesvaardigheid', 'inferentievaardigheden']"

One possible predictor of affective empathy is parents’ attitudes towards children. However, little research has been conducted on this relationship. Additionally, stress could play a moderating role in this relationship, via suppression of the positive role of attitudes on empathy. The aim of this study, therefore, is to gain insight into the relationship between attitudes towards children and affective empathy, and the moderating role of stress in this relationship. The main question is: “To what extent is there a relationship between attitudes towards children and affective empathy in female students between 18 and 25 years old and is this relationship moderated by stress?”. Affective empathy is measured by sympathy experienced when observing children in negative social contexts and positive affect experienced when observing children in positive social contexts. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: the stress condition (Trier Social Stress Test) and the no-stress condition. In both conditions, participants completed an experimental task measuring affective empathy and filled out questionnaires. Results showed that more positive attitudes were related to more sympathy and positive affect. Stress played no role in this relationship. From this study, it can be concluded that there is a positive relationship between attitudes towards children and affective empathy. This provides opportunities for interventions. Positive attitudes can be promoted through education and training, which in turn can be implemented to stimulate affective empathy. Finally, this research provides a starting point for further research into the predictors of affective empathy.","['affectieve empathie', 'attitudes tegenover kinderen', 'stress']"

The successful implementation of wind farms largely depends on the community acceptance of the wind project. Previous studies have shown that providing citizens with a voice opportunity results in higher levels of wind farms project acceptance via increase in the perception of fair decision making and trust in the project developer. The current study was conducted on a sample of UK citizens (N = 450). It used an experimental scenario to replicate these findings and additionally to examine whether the effects of voice opportunity on project acceptance depend on expectations regarding receiving voice opportunity. We manipulated voice expectations and voice opportunity, and found support that voice opportunity has positive effects on community acceptance of wind farm projects. Additionally, we found support for our prediction that these effects are mediated by perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer. We did not find support about the moderating role of voice expectations on the effects of voice opportunity on project acceptance. We discussed the implications of these findings for research and practice.","['Voice Opportunity, Perceived Procedural Fairness, Trust, Community Project Acceptance, Wind energy, Wind farms, Voice Expectations']"

Participants completed the Alexithymia questionnaire for children (AQC), self-concept clarity scale (SCC), and strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). Results showed a negative relationship between self-concept clarity and alexithymia. In addition, the relationship between self-concept clarity and emotional regulation was partially mediated by alexithymia, and this effect was stronger in females than males. Females demonstrated better emotional regulation, but contrarily to prior research, no significant gender differences were identified in alexithymia or self-concept clarity. In this study, the complexity of these psychological constructs is highlighted, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions for improving adolescent emotional regulation and self-concept clarity. Developing a better understanding of emotional disorders and improving adolescent mental health through further research into gender differences and alexithymia-focused interventions could be beneficial.","['Alexithymia', 'Self-concept clarity', 'Adolescence']"

Puberty, in turn is shown to be a driver of brain development and has been related to the onset and increase of internalizing symptoms. However, the relationship between puberty, brain development, and internalizing symptoms has not been studied using multiple pubertal measures in both sexes. Here we examine the mediating role of brain development on the relationship between puberty and internalizing symptoms. Pubertal status, timing, age at menarche, and internalizing symptoms were assessed based on self-reports in 160 adolescents between 10 and 25 using a three-wave accelerated longitudinal design. Structural MRI scans were only obtained in the first wave. Subsequently, the relations between the pubertal measures (status, timing, age at menarche) and internalizing symptoms were tested as well as their relations with grey matter thickness and volume in frontal, cingulate, and subcortical areas. Only age at menarche as a timing variable had a significant effect on internalizing symptoms at T1 in girls (ß = -.36, p = .002, 95% CI [-.68, -.17]). Mediation models revealed no significant mediation of grey matter thickness and volume in our ROIs. Other effects did not reach significance or became non-significant after Bonferroni corrections. These findings indicate that menstruating before one’s peers is a risk factor for developing internalizing symptoms. This highlights the importance of supporting early menstruating girls to possibly prevent them from developing internalizing symptoms. Replication studies are needed to assess the accuracy of our results.","['adolescence', 'puberty', 'brain development', 'internalizing symptoms']"
Tangled Trajectories: Exploring the Connections between Maternal PTSD Clusters and Young Children’s Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior in Dutch Domestic Violence Shelters.,"Luttikhuis, Tess","['de Haan, W.D.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study investigates the relationship between maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters and young children’s internalizing and externalizing behavior in Dutch domestic violence (DV) shelters. Children in these shelters are susceptible to behavioral problems due to the potential modeling of maternal PTSD symptoms and compromised caregiving as a result of maternal symptoms. Examining maternal PTSD symptoms on a cluster level is crucial as individual presentations of symptoms after intimate partner violence (IPV) exposure can vary significantly, and identifying the specific clusters that predict child behavior in this context can inform targeted treatment efforts. The study uses baseline data from experimental research on effective DV shelter interventions. Maternal self-reported PTSD symptoms (n = 29) and child behavior reported by mothers and social workers are analyzed. Findings reveal that higher maternal PTSD symptoms are associated with increased externalizing problems in children, as reported by mothers. Specifically, symptoms related to negative mood and cognitions, and changes in arousal and reactivity are linked to higher externalizing problems when analyzed in simple regressions. No associations were found between maternal PTSD symptoms and child behavior as measured by social workers or in multiple regression analyses. There were also no associations between maternal symptoms and child internalizing problems. These results underscore the importance of personalized trauma support for women in DV shelters, benefiting both mothers and their children.","['Maternal PTSD, domestic violence shelters, symptom clusters, child behavioral problems.']"
Celebration and insecurity after childhood cancer: parental distress in the first year after successfully coming off treatment,"Krouwel, Fredrieke","['Miers, A. C.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: The period after successfully coming off treatment (SCOT) following a childhood cancer diagnosis is known to be a vulnerable time for parents in which increased levels of distress can play a significant role. It is important to know more about the distress experienced by parents during this period to determine whether an intervention should be used to help parents return to ‘normal life’. The aim of this study was therefore to gain better understanding of parental distress and factors related to their distress during the first year after their child has successfully completed treatment. Methods: A sample of 283 parents of children who had successfully completed cancer treatment in the previous year were included in this cross-sectional study. These parents, who were part of the SCOT group, were invited to complete the Distress Thermometer for Parents (DT-P) within one year after treatment completion. The DT-P consists of a thermometer score to measure experienced distress and problem domains (practical, social, emotional, physical, cognitive, and parenting). Parents in the SCOT group were compared with parents in the general population (NORM group) to see if their distress levels were higher. In addition, the association between distress and the problem domains and child- or parent-related factors (time since the end of treatment, cancer type, child’s age, parental disease, and perceived support) was examined. Results: Parents (73.9% mothers) in the SCOT group experienced higher levels of distress in the first year after SCOT compared to the general population (fathers SCOT: M=3.5, SD=2.6 vs. fathers NORM: M=2.8, SD=2.5; p=.032; mothers SCOT: M=4.1, SD=2.7 vs. mothers NORM: M=3.5, SD=2.7; p=.001). Emotional (p<.001), practical (p=.016), and physical (p=.005) problems were predictors of higher distress levels. Parents’ perceived support from their environment contributed also to their level of distress (p<.001). Conclusions: Parents of children who have successfully completed cancer treatment experience increased levels of distress in the first year after treatment compared to parents in the general population. There may be value in developing an intervention to ease this transition that specifically addresses their emotional well-being and highlights the importance of their social network during this vulnerable period.","['Childhood cancer, parental distress, successfully coming off treatment']"

The elderly population affected by dementia is rapidly increasing, and this rise may lead to more requests for end-of-life interventions like euthanasia, a debated topic worldwide. Despite legal restrictions, studies show diverse views on euthanasia acceptability among Japanese and US physicians. Factors like country of practice, religious beliefs, and attitudes toward death have been associated with euthanasia acceptability. Thus, this research aimed to investigate the relationship between country of practice, religion, and attitudes towards death in relation to euthanasia acceptability, while accounting for the influence of age and gender. Methods. The study used a cross-cultural mixed-method design and included 75 participants aged 26 to 71 years. Three separate logistic regression analyses were conducted to measure the influence of these factors on euthanasia acceptability separately. Additionally, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis examined whether the relationship between country of practice and euthanasia acceptability was moderated by religion. Results. The results did not reveal any significant associations between country of practice, religion, attitudes towards death, and euthanasia acceptability. However, there was a significant association between gender and euthanasia acceptability, and results showed that males were more likely to not accept euthanasia as an end-of-life intervention compared to females. Moreover, results showed that the relationship between country of practice and euthanasia acceptability was not moderated by religion. Conclusion. In conclusion, this study suggests that country of practice, attitudes towards death and religiousness, may not be decisive factors in determining euthanasia acceptability, while gender could play a more influential role. These findings serve as an initial step toward understanding the diverse effects of cultural factors on euthanasia acceptability across different countries.",

It is important to know which constructs respond to parental sensitivity. This study investigated whether the child's temperament predicts parental sensitivity. In addition, it was investigated whether this relationship is moderated by the parent's perception of competence, consisting of reflective ability and self-confidence in parenting behavior. The sample consists of 21 parents, both mothers and fathers, with their child. The children were all between three and five years old. There were two measurement moments, two weeks apart, in which the parent performed a structured play task with the child. The parent was coded for sensitivity for both measurement moments using the Ainsworth Scale. Between the two measurement moments, the parents completed the Children's Behavior Questionnaire – very short form, Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire and Me as a Parent. The regression used to investigate whether the child's temperament predicts parental sensitivity did not show a significant result. The reflective ability of the parent appears to be a significant negative predictor of parental sensitivity. Reflectivity ability is a significant moderator between child temperament and parental sensitivity, but not in the expected direction. A high reflective capacity of a parent with a child with a difficult temperament was found to show less sensitive parenting behavior. Parental self-confidence in parenting behavior was found to be a significant negative predictor of parental sensitivity. Parental self-confidence in parenting behavior was not found to be a significant moderator in the relationship between child temperament and parental sensitivity. These results should be interpreted with caution as the sample size was very small and not very divers. Due to the large effect sizes and high explained variances, this study provides starting points for further scientific research into the relationship between these constructs.","['temperament', 'sensitiviteit', 'zelfvertrouwen in het opvoedgedrag', 'reflectief vermogen', 'moderatie', 'multipele regressie']"

Among others, young people are increasingly exposed to this type of media. They can be deliberately exposed, like searching for information about sex and watching pornography. We call this active exposure. There are also young people who accidently get exposed to sexually explicit media content. This is called passive exposure and can consist of, for example, pop-up advertisements or unsolicited sexually explicit messages. Several studies have been conducted on exposure to sexually explicit media, but the prevalence varies widely. The aim of this study is to get a clear image of in which extent young people are exposed to sexually explicit media. Therefore, the following research question was formulated: To what extent are young people actively and passively exposed to sexually explicit media, and are there differences based on gender and sexual orientation? To answer the research question, an online questionnaire was developed and distributed among Dutch respondents between the age of 16 and 26 years old. The results show that boys have a higher chance of being actively and passively exposed to sexually explicit media. Sexual orientation does not appear to influence either active or passive exposure. In addition, no interaction was found between gender and sexual orientation. Based on these preliminary results, it is recommended to make young people more aware of the risks of experimenting with online sexual behaviors, through education and counseling by experts. Future research should recruit a more diverse sample with a larger group of men, people from the LGBTQ+ community, medium and low educated people, and people who live outside the city. Further research could also focus on which forms of sexually explicit media young people encounter most and what effects these may have.","['Seksueel getinte media', 'Jongeren: Sociale media', 'Sexting', 'Gender', 'Seksuele geaardheid']"

This study investigated the effectiveness of dynamic assessment on reading and writing performance, specifically phonemic awareness, prosodic awareness and spelling, and whether there were group differences between dyslexic and non dyslexic children, and boys and girls. The participants included 91 children aged seven to nine, with 45.1% diagnosed with dyslexia. The participants were divided in an experimental condition with a pretest-training-posttest design, and a control condition with a pretestposttest-training design. It was found that the children in the experimental condition improved more over time than the children in the control condition on prosodic awareness.

Regarding the different mechanisms underlying Selective Mutism, the physiological component is largely unknown. However, this information can provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of children with SM. Method: The present study compared 27 children with SM (M = 5.11 years) and 40 typically developing children (M = 5.35 years) during a rest phase and two phases of a social interaction task. In both groups physiological arousal was measured using the BIOPAC acquiring system deriving two parameters, mean heart rate (HR) and mean heart rate variability (HRV). Results: Children from the SM-group experienced higher HR during rest (F (1,63) = 5.63, p = .021) and recovery (F (1,64) = 5.19, p = .026; F (1,62) = 8.74, p = .005) compared to typically developing children. Second, children from the SM-group experienced lower HRV during performance (F (1,65) = 4.47, p = .039; F (1,62) = 4.28, p = .043) and recovery (F (1,64) = 4.22, p = .044; F (1,62) = 5.10, p = .028) compared to typically developing children. Discussion: Current research replicates and extends research in children with SM. The findings from HR and HRV indicate a prolonged stress response in children with SM in different (social) situations. Children with SM seem to be limited in their ability to adapt their physiological responses in HR and HRV to the situation. The results seem to suggest an overactive sympathetic autonomic nervous system in children with SM.","['Selective Mutism, Social Interaction Task, Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability, Autonomic Nerve System']"

Exploring the differences in anxiety among children from The Netherlands and India,"Bissumbhar, Rajshri",['Rachel de Jong'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Anxiety and worry can cause great suffering and significantly impact one’s quality of life, especially for pre-adolescent children. Therefore, adequate treatment is necessary to minimize suffering and adverse outcomes. However, in order to adequately treat anxiety, the cultural background needs to be taken into consideration. Many differences concerning anxiety have been found among Western and non-Western cultures. However, previous research has primarily focused on children and/or adolescents in general, causing research about pre- adolescent children to be sparse. Since this particular period is signified by significant social and emotional growth, it has a great impact on the rest of the children’s lives. Therefore, receiving adequate treatment during this time can be incredibly beneficial. The present study explored the differences among Dutch and Indian children concerning the prevalence, manifestation and perceived causes of anxiety. In total, 140 pre-adolescent children between the ages of 10 to 12 years old were recruited by our researchers. Consequently, the participants were asked to complete a demographic questionnaire, the RCADS and the CFI. Contrary to our hypothesis, no significant differences were found regarding the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder among Dutch and Indian children. We did find that Dutch children were more likely than Indian children to mention psychological and somatic symptoms as a result of anxiety. Additionally, the perceived causes of anxiety were found to be different between Dutch and Indian children. Dutch children were more likely to attribute their anxiety to high personal achievement independent from interpersonal situations and moral values in line with individualism such as desiring uniqueness and sticking up for themselves. Whereas Indian children were more likely to attribute social factors such as disappointing others or bringing shame to their family, which are in line with collectivism, as causes of their anxiety. In conclusion, culture can significantly impact anxiety, particularly its perceived causes.","['Anxiety, prevalence, manifestation, perceived causes, India, The Netherlands, cross-cultural comparison, pre-adolescents']"

For this study participants (n=165; age-range 18 to 29 years old) filled out the Parental Bonding Instrument and the revised version of the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire. The results showed that providing care and support while children develop independence is important for their future ability to form healthy relationships. The study highlights the importance of avoiding overprotective parenting behaviors, as they may have negative effects on a child's ability to manage anxiety in close relationships later in life. Furthermore, this study found no significant difference between the influence of mothers' versus fathers' daily caregiving on their children's ability to form and maintain close relationships in adulthood.",
Comparative analyses into cerebral and midbrain processing of itch expectations using fMRI techniques during evocation of nocebo itch,"Brezovar, Christian","['Dr. Kaya Peerdeman', 'Dr. Judy Veldhuijzen']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Placebo effects are known phenomena in medical and psychological research. They illustrate how a strong belief can create positive effects regarding well-being and health. However, a strong enough negative belief may also have real effects on an individual. This phenomenon is known as a nocebo effect and research into nocebo effects, particularly related to symptoms of itch, has been sparse. Further understanding nocebo itch and its associated brain regions may help patients with chronic itch or psychosomatic afflictions. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of learning and negative outcome expectations on itch sensitivity. We hypothesized that participants would be conditioned to experience more itch in the presence of a sham electrical pulse compared to its absence, and that significant activity would be measured in the periaqueductal gray, insula, and rolandic operculum, which were studied using fMRI imaging techniques. Healthy participants (49) were involved in a two-phase task to acquire and evoke the nocebo itch. This process was reinforced through an on/off monitor and verbal instructions from researchers. In the acquisition phase, participants learned to associate itch stimuli with an electrical pulse (nocebo stimulus), expecting more itch during nocebo trials and less during control trials. Itch was induced using varying histamine concentrations for both types of trials and the electric pulse was never activated. In the evocation phase, nocebo itch was evoked using equal histamine concentrations in both control and nocebo trials. The nocebo itch was measured through subjective itch ratings and brain activity was measured with a 3T fMRI scanner. Evocation nocebo ratings were significantly higher than evocation control ratings, despite equal histamine concentrations (p < 0.001). However, no significant brain activity was found when data from the nocebo condition was compared with the control condition. The absence of conclusive fMRI data may be due to a possible extinction effect nullifying the measurement of nocebo activation, fMRI analysis of areas that were too broad, or overly conservative analysis methodology. These findings indicate the efficacy of the nocebo itch evocation methodology used in this study and future research into additional brain areas associated with nocebo itch.","['conditioning', 'fMRI', 'histamine', 'insula', 'neural correlates', 'nocebo effects', 'nocebo itch', 'periaqueductal gray', 'rolandic operculum']"
Parent-to-Child Transmission of Anxiety: The Influence of Parental Anxiety and Coping Styles on Children with a Specific Phobia,"Noordermeer, Amber","['Hagen, A.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Parental factors play an important role in the development and maintenance of childhood anxiety. However, studies show mixed results when exploring the relationships between parental anxiety, parental coping and the anxiety of the child. This study will further explore these relationships by looking at children with specific phobias and their parents. We will investigate if there is a relation between child anxiety and parental anxiety, if parental anxiety predicts the treatment outcome, if there is a relation between parental anxiety and parental coping, and if parental anxiety is a mediator between the parental coping style positive reinforcement and the treatment outcome. Methods: The study employed a longitudinal one-group pretest-posttest design with a correlational and experimental approach. Participants were 58 children between the ages of 7 and 14 years with a specific phobia. The treatment consisted of a 3-hour exposure session. The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV: Child and Parent Versions (ADIS-IV-C/P) was used to assess both the severity of the anxiety of the child and the treatment outcome. Parental anxiety was assessed using the Anxiety subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale – 21 (DASS-21). Parental coping styles were assessed using an adapted version of the Child Development Questionnaire (CDQ). The formulated hypotheses were analysed using spearman rank correlation tests, a generalized linear model and a mediation analysis. Results: There was no correlation between parental anxiety and the anxiety of the child at baseline, nor did parental anxiety predict the treatment outcome. Moreover, there was no correlation between parental anxiety and parental coping. Finally, parental anxiety did not mediate between the parental coping style positive reinforcement and the treatment outcome. Conclusions: No relationships were found between the anxiety of children with a specific phobia, parental anxiety and parental coping. These unexpected results and limitations are discussed. Further research is important to examine the potential ways in which parents could contribute to alleviating the anxiety of children with specific phobias.","['specific phobia, child anxiety, parental anxiety, parental coping, treatment outcome, positive reinforcement']"

Voorkomen is beter dan genezen: Een onderzoek naar de preventie van overlastgevend gedrag van jongeren in Leiden-Noord,"Braaksma, Tika","['Nas, C.N.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Rondhangen kan gezien worden als een normale bezigheid onder jongeren en maakt deel uit van de adolescentie, de overgangsperiode in de ontwikkeling tussen de jeugd en de volwassenheid. Toch kan het zo zijn dat rondhangen overslaat in overlast, gedragingen die jongeren vertonen en die door de omgeving als hinderlijk of overlastgevend worden ervaren. In dit onderzoek werd getracht antwoord te geven op de vraag: “Welke interventie- en preventieprogramma´s of elementen ervan zijn mogelijk werkzaam bij het voorkomen van overlastgevend gedrag van jongeren tussen de 12 en 16 jaar?” Deze vraag is ontstaan in opdracht van SOL, een jonge, brede welzijnsinstelling, en werd specifiek beantwoord voor de wijk Leiden-Noord. Er werd antwoord op deze vraag gegeven aan de hand van literatuuronderzoek en acht semigestructureerde interviews die zijn afgenomen bij medewerkers van SOL en ketenpartners die werken met overlastgevende jeugd in Leiden-Noord. In de literatuur is gezocht naar effectieve elementen van interventies. De dataverzameling, in de vorm van interviews, diende voor het scheppen van een realistisch beeld van de praktijk en de praktische onderbouwing in het beantwoorden van de vraag. Uit het literatuuronderzoek kwam naar voren dat preventieprogramma’s elementen bevatten die effectief kunnen zijn in het voorkomen van overlastgevend gedrag. Bovendien is het belangrijk om bij het kiezen van en gedurende de interventie rekening te houden met de persoonlijke omstandigheden en behoeften een individu. Uit de gevonden interventies bleek dat het opbouwen van een vertrouwensband met professionals, vrijetijdsbesteding in de vorm van positieve activiteiten, het verbeteren van opvoedvaardigheden van ouders en het aanleren van sociaal-emotionele competenties mogelijk effectief kunnen zijn voor de preventie en aanpak van overlastgevend gedrag. Gedragscontacten en modeling kunnen mogelijk ingezet worden om dit doel te bereiken. Uit de interviews met professionals kwamen veelal dezelfde aspecten naar voren, met twee aanvullende onderwerpen die in het literatuuronderzoek niet aan bod kwamen, namelijk groepsdruk en het creëren van meer ontmoetingsplekken voor jongeren. Deze worden door de professionals als belangrijk aspecten voor de preventie en aanpak van overlastgevend gedrag gezien. Beperkingen van dit onderzoek zijn dat tijdens de interviews niet bij elk gesprek elk onderwerp aan bod is gekomen, er sprake was van een beperkt aantal participanten en dat verschillende onderzoekers de interviews afnamen. Ook zijn niet alle gevonden interventies voldoende getoetst op effectiviteit. Voor eventueel vervolgonderzoek lijkt de ouderbetrokkenheid van de jongeren een belangrijke factor te zijn die verder onderzocht kan worden. Tevens kan een grotere steekproef en mogelijke uitbreiding naar andere steden ervoor zorgen dat er een meer gegeneraliseerd beeld verkregen kan worden van de werkzaamheid van interventie- en preventieprogramma’s ter preventie van overlastgevend gedrag onder jongeren.",

To gain more insight into the ageing process of people with intellectual disabilities, the current study investigated whether young people (30 years and younger) with intellectual disabilities and intensive care needs (VG 6 or VG 7) differed from elderly (55 years and older) with intellectual disabilities and intensive care needs on seven domains of received support, adaptive functioning, quality of life and problem behavior at M1 and at M3 of the SCORE-study. In addition, it was investigated whether the progression from M1 to M3 on these variables differed between young people and elderly with intellectual disabilities and intensive care needs. Method: The sample consisted of 39 young people and 29 elderly with intellectual disabilities and intensive care needs (n = 68), from four different care organizations from North and South Holland in the Netherlands. The received support was measured with a contextual interview, adaptive functioning was measured with the Vineland-screener, quality of life was measured with the San Martin Scale and problem behavior was measured with the Developmental Behavior Checklist for Adults. The data was analyzed using twenty independent sample t-test, and ten Mixed Model ANOVA’s. Results: The current study shows that young people and elderly with intellectual disabilities and intensive care needs do not differ from each other in the support they receive, in their adaptivefunctioning, in their quality of life and in their exhibited problem behaviors at M1 and M3 of the SCORE-study. In addition, there were no differences in progression between the two groups on these variables from M1 to M3. Implications: The results of this study imply that the needs of young people and elderly with intellectual disabilities and intensive care needs might be more similar than expected from the scientific literature. Future research, which should include participants with all indications, and which should have a greater contrast between the compared age groups, should confirm this.","['Elderly, Intellectual disability, intensive care needs, support, adaptive functioning, quality of life, problem behavior']"

This cross- sectional study consisted of an online questionnaire, completed by 158 MBO students and which measured academic stress, related constructs and coping strategies. Data was investigated through two multiple linear regressions: one investigating the whole sample and one investigating men and women separately. An independent samples t-test analyzed gender differences in self-compassion. Results indicated a positive association between academic stress and depressive symptoms in both the total sample and the two gender groups, as well as a negative association between self-compassionate coping and depressive symptoms. Self- compassionate coping was found not to have a moderating effect in the total sample, nor in either gender group. Moreover, no significant gender differences were found in either the amount of self-compassion students experienced, or its moderating effect. Findings showed that non- university students experience many of the same issues as university students do. Despite no moderating effect being found, a direct negative association between self-compassionate coping and depressive symptoms was established. These findings indicate that existing interventions for academic stress in university students need to be applied to non-university students, as such interventions could be of help in reducing this student population’s mental health issues. Additionally, interventions aimed at non-university students’ mental health should take self- compassionate coping into account as a possible protective factor for depressive symptoms.","['Academic stress', 'depressive symptoms', 'mental health', 'self-compassion', 'MBO students', 'non-university students', 'Netherlands']"
Selectief mutisme en de samenhang met sociale angst en communicatieve vaardigheden.,"Bleeker, Iris","['Swaab, J.T.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Selective mutism (SM) is a relatively rare childhood disorder characterized by a consistent failure to speak in specific settings, such as school, despite speaking normally in other settings, such as at home. Little is known about the etiology of SM, although some studies show evidence of social anxiety or problems in communication skills as underlying mechanisms. This study investigated whether some children with SM in the Netherlands have more social anxiety and more problems in communication skills than peers. Moreover, it examined which of these factors has the strongest association with the non-speaking behaviour characteristic of SM. Parents of 28 children with SM (Nboys=6; Ngirls=22) and 44 children without SM (Nboys=19, Ngirls=23) aged 4-9 years completed questionnaires on their child's speaking behaviour (Selective Mutism Questionnaire), communication skills (Children's Communication Checklist) and social anxiety (Social Worries Anxiety Index for Young children). Results show that children with SM have significantly more social anxiety and more problems in communication skills than peers. Furthermore, more problems in non-speaking behaviour are significantly associated with more social anxiety and more problems in communication skills. Non-speaking behaviour has a stronger correlation with social anxiety than with communication skills. A hierarchical regression shows that social anxiety is a strong significant predictor (80%) of nonspeaking behaviour. Communication skills have minimal additional impact (0.5%) on the variance of non-speaking behaviour. Finally, communication skills partly (11%) explain why some children with social anxiety do not speak and other children do. A limitation of this study is the small sample size, which did not allow to control for ethnicity. Possibly this affects the outcomes of communication skills. Nevertheless, we feel confident that SM is mainly related to social anxiety. Communication skills have a small influence on the outcome of SM. Based on this we recommend that treatment of SM should mainly focus on social anxiety and in addition we should be alert for problems in communication skills.","['selective mutism', 'social anxiety', 'communication skills', 'etiology', 'speaking behaviour', 'children']"
Geloven in vooruitgang: Een studie naar het effect van religie op het mentaal welbevinden van adolescent met meegemaakte emotionele verwaarlozingen met,"Kraanen, Nikki","['Buimer, E.', 'Harmelen, A-L. van']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"This study examined the relationship between religion, a history of emotional neglect and mental well-being in adolescents. The mental well-being of adolescents in the Netherlands has declined concerningly in recent years. An experience of emotional neglect can have a substantial impact on mental well-being. Despite the serious consequences that can follow, emotional neglect has received limited attention. Therefore, this study examines to what extent religion can be a protective factor for adolescents’ mental well-being. Religion can serve as a form of social support and can be an important source of identity-building. Adolescents (N=217) aged 16 to 24 completed an online survey, containing different questionnaires. Mental well-being was measured using the WEMWBS and emotional neglect using the CTQ-SF. Religion has been surveyed on two aspects: beliefs and religious practice, both using questions from an existing dataset. Results were obtained across three groups: Christians, Muslims and non-believers. First, a one-way ANOVA showed that there was no difference between nonbelieving, Christian and Muslim adolescents in their mental well-being. In addition, the regression showed that religious practice did not appear to significantly predict adolescents' mental well-being. Finally, the multiple regression did show a significant result: emotional neglect significantly predicts lower mental well-being. However, religion does not influence the effect between emotional neglect and adolescents' mental well-being. In conclusion, no evidence was found that religion has an effect on adolescents' mental well-being. Religion was also not found to be a protective factor after experiencing emotional neglect. However, this research has confirmed that emotional neglect has a negative effect on adolescents’ mental well-being. Therefore, emotional neglect and adolescents’ mental well-being deserves more public and scientific attention.","['Religie', 'adolescenten', 'emotionele verwaarlozing', 'mentaal welbevinden']"
"The Association Between Cognitive Complaints, Self-esteem and Quality of Life in Outpatients with Cluster C Personality Disorder","Nemeth, Leonora","['van Egmond, E.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Studies in various patient populations have found reduced quality of life, lower self-esteem and more cognitive complaints compared to the general population. Research indicates that similar tendencies are also observable in patients with personality disorders, however only a few studies have addressed these areas in patients with Cluster C personality disorder, despite the fact, that it is the most prevalent personality disorder type. The goal of the present study was to describe the most commonly occurring cognitive complaints in this patient population, as well as to examine the associations between quality of life, self-esteem and cognitive complaints. For this purpose, data from 347 outpatients with Cluster C personality disorder was analysed as part of a greater nationwide ongoing research. To operationalize the constructs of interest, the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale and the MHQoL-7D questionnaires were used, measuring cognitive complaints, self-esteem and quality of life respectively. Linear regression analysis as well as visual inspection of descriptives were the statistical methods of choice. Results indicated mild disability on the cognitive domain in the patient population. Furthermore, significant associations were found between more cognitive complaints and lower self-esteem (p ˂ .001) and lower quality of life (p ˂ .001). Additionally, higher self-esteem correlated with better quality of life (p ˂ .001) and higher age of the participants (p ˂ .001). Higher age was also associated with lower quality of life (p = .047). Nationality and gender did not have a statistically significant association with any outcome variable. These results were in line with findings of previous research in other patient populations. As these characteristics can potentially influence treatment outcomes, the findings of the current study can be considered an important contribution to the currently lacking knowledge base of patients with Cluster C personality disorder.","['Cognitive Complaints', 'Self-esteem', 'Quality of Life', 'Cluster C Personality Disorder']"

Victimized Children With Less Sensitive Parents Do Not Use Increased Social Media,"Nagy, Zsuzsanna",['Lina van Drunen'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social media use has become more and more popular in the last years for children and adolescents. There are mixed findings regarding whether social media use is beneficial (e.g., receiving social support) or detrimental (e.g., using avoidant coping) for the mental health of this vulnerable age group. Furthermore, it is also unclear what the factors are that lead to an increase in social media use. In the present study (N = 157; 52 % girls) we investigated whether there was an association between victimization at age 8-10 and social media use three years later. It was hypothesized that increased victimization would be associated with increased amount of time spent on media use. Furthermore, we included sensitive parenting as moderator, as it is expected to weaken the positive association between victimization and social media use. Results revealed no significant connection between the levels of victimization and social media use and no significant moderation effect by the level of sensitive parenting. Possibly, children’s media use is less dependent on their social connections as they are mainly interested in video content. Our sample represented low frequencies of bully victims and many parents showing sensitive parenting. Future studies should include a specific sample of bully victims and parents showing variances in sensitive parenting to possibly observe potential changes in social media use. Our study may be used in future prevention programs for problematic social media use. Since victimization did not predict social media use, future studies should investigate other factors, such as attachment style.",

There is still limited knowledge about prenatal attachment and its relationships with other maternal and child factors. For the present study, the following research question was formulated: How do maternal executive functioning, the prenatal attachment and the pregnancy that was/wasn’t planned influence child problem behavior at the age of 4? Data from the MINDS-Leiden research project (Smaling et al., 2015) were utilized. This study examined potential predictors of early behavioral problems in young children (0-4 years) through tests and questionnaires administered to 275 Dutch women. Using a demographic questionnaire, the mothers were asked if the pregnancy was planned. The BRIEF-A was used to measure the maternal executive functioning. The MAAS was used to measure the prenatal mother-child attachment. The CBCL was used to measure the internalizing and externalizing problem behavior of the child at 4 years old. Results showed that children whose pregnancies were not planned showed more (internalizing and externalizing) problem behavior at the age of 4 than children whose pregnancies were planned. Furthermore, better maternal executive functioning was related to lower (internalizing and externalizing) problem behavior. Maternal executive functioning was also positively related to prenatal mother-child attachment. Multiple regression analyses showed that maternal executive functioning was the only robust predictor of both internalizing and externalizing problem behavior. In conclusion, prenatal attachment is related to childhood behavior problems, but in predictive models including other factors associated with both prenatal attachment and problem behavior (in the present study: planned/unplanned pregnancy and, particularly, maternal executive function) it appears to lose its unique predictive value. Measurement of prenatal attachment could be improved or refined further to obtain the best possible representation of this construct.","['Probleemgedrag', 'Prenatale hechting', 'Executieve functies']"
The influence of Parental Self-Esteem and Alcohol Use on Parental Empathic Accuracy,"Entezar, Yalda",['W.G.M. Wentholt'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"According to existing literature, parental empathic accuracy is a crucial aspect of communication between parents and children. When children feel understood, they are more likely to develop a secure attachment, which subsequently can lead to better relationships with others and a reduced likelihood of developing behavioral problems. Parental self-esteem and alcohol use seem to have an association with parental empathic accuracy in the way that parents with lower self-esteem would have less empathic accuracy and parents who have more alcohol use would have less empathic accuracy. In this study, we tested whether parental self-esteem was positively related to parental empathic accuracy towards positive and negative emotions of their child, and whether this relationship was mediated by the parents’ alcohol use. These associations were investigated by Hayes’ process macro mediation analysis. For this, questionnaire data for self-esteem and alcohol use, and correlational data on the accuracy of parents’ indication of their child’s self-reported emotions during an experimental task are used. The study includes 119 parents and their 80 healthy adolescent children between 11 and 17 years. Contrary to what was expected, the mediation analysis showed no association between parental self-esteem and parental empathic accuracy for both positive and negative emotions and there was no mediation by alcohol use. There is also no association between alcohol use and parental empathic accuracy. We did find a negative association between parental self-esteem and alcohol use, suggesting that parents with lower self-esteem use more alcohol. This means that we cannot say that parents who have lower self-esteem have less empathic accuracy for both positive and negative emotions and because there is no association between these two, there is also no mediation by alcohol use.","['Parental self-esteem, parental empathic accuracy, empathy, alcohol use, adolescence']"
Prevalence and Predictors of Verbal Fluency Deficits in people with Multiple Sclerosis,"Nouweland, Michiel van den",['Hanneke Hulst'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Verbal fluency refers to the ability to generate words or speech in an efficient manner. Some literature states having a verbal fluency deficit is a core symptom of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), whereas other literature report no verbal fluency deficits in People with MS (PwMS). Therefore, the aim of the current paper is to investigate the frequency and underlying factors of verbal fluency deficits in individuals with MS. Data was retrospectively collected from patient charts. This data contained neuropsychological assessments that were performed to measure verbal fluency, depression, fatigue, and information processing speed. These were measured by the Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWAT), the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). A total of 224 PwMS were included in the study. PwMS had a mean age of 52.2, 164 were female (73%), 138 had Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS) (61.6%), 66 had Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) (29.5%) and 20 had Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) (8.9%). Someone is considered to have a verbal fluency deficit when they have a COWAT score of 25 or lower (5th percentile). Results show that 34% (76/224) of PwMS show verbal fluency deficits. Furthermore, verbal fluency is affected more severely in people with SPMS than in people with RRMS (t(186)= 2.094, p = .019). Information processing speed significantly influences verbal fluency (F(1, 188) = 59,734, p = <.001). No effect of fatigue or depression was found on verbal fluency deficits. The findings from this study contribute to a better understanding of the frequency of verbal fluency deficits in MS and their relationship with depression, fatigue and information processing speed. The finding of a relatively high occurrence of verbal fluency deficits in PwMS should encourage neuropsychologists to be mindful of this deficit to increase cognitive care for PwMS.","['MS', 'verbal fluency', 'COWAT']"
Self-compassion and psychological distress in patients with neuromuscular diseases: the mediating role of stigma,"Koper, Michiel",['Karin van der Hiele'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Living with a neuromuscular disease has a negative impact on quality of life, partly due to increased psychological distress. Previous studies suggest that more self-compassion is associated with less psychological distress. More stigma, specifically self-stigma and enacted stigma, is also associated with more psychological distress. The underlying mechanism of this relationship remains unclear. The objective of this study is to examine the possible mediating role of stigma on the relationship between self-compassion and psychological distress in patients with neuromuscular diseases. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 249 patients diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease (mean age 55.7 (SD = 15.8); 51% males). The patients completed online questionnaires on self-stigma and enacted stigma (Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness), self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form) and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between variables. Mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro outlined by Hayes. Results: In sum 249 patients (33,4% response rate) diagnosed with one of the four core neuromuscular diseases completed the questionnaires. Self-compassion was negatively associated with psychological distress (B = -3.740). Explained variance of self-compassion on psychological distress was .40. Self-stigma was positively associated with psychological distress (B = .362) with explained variance of .45. Enacted stigma had a positive relationship with psychological distress (B = .327) and explained variance was .15. Both self-stigma and enacted stigma partially mediated the effect of self-compassion on psychological distress Conclusions: Higher self-compassion and less self-stigma and enacted stigma are associated with less psychological distress. Part of the association of self-compassion on psychological distress can be explained by self-stigma and enacted stigma. The underlying mechanism of self-compassion seems to play an important role in relationship with stigma and psychological distress. It may be of clinical interest to focus interventions on self-compassion for patients with neuromuscular disease. However, future work on the feasibility and effectiveness of compassion-based interventions in neuromuscular disease samples is needed.","['Self-compassion, psychological distress, neuromuscular disease, stigma']"
The Effects of Communication on Clinical Cancer Patients' Chemotherapy Outcomes Over Time: A Randomised Proof-of-Principle Study,"Vourtsis, Katherina",['Dr. Liesbeth van Vliet'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Relevance: Efficacy of doctor empathy and nocebo education on treatment outcomes of people with cancer has been established across experimental and randomised-controlled trials (RCT). Objective: i) to test whether distinct effects of clinician empathy and nocebo information can also improve psychological and side effect outcomes of clinical advanced breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and ii) to explore whether potential positive effects are persistent over treatment time. Methods: In this 2x2 proof-of-principle study, before treatment start, a total of 23 Dutch, chemonaïve, female breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy were randomised (1:1:1:1) to short information videos on chemotherapy side effects. The four videos varied on levels of empathy (+ / -) and nocebo information (+ / -). During treatment, participants’ psychological (primary outcomes: anxiety, distress) and side effect outcomes were assessed by self-report questionnaires at 7-days, 21-days, and 52-days after treatment start. Results: Repeated linear mixed model analyses indicated that empathy generally did not affect the level of anxiety (p = .440) or distress (p = .056). Empathy increased overall intensity (β = 0.76, 95% CI [.07; 1.44], p = .032) and number of side effects (β = 0.78, 95% CI [.11; 1.45], p = .025).

Conclusions: In clinical settings, advanced breast cancer patients may not profit from empathy or nocebo information. Repeating the study with a larger sample is recommended to gain clarity on communication effects. The information videos may benefit training of clinical staff and treatment consultations.","['Clinician Empathy, Nocebo, Informed Consent, Breast Cancer, Chemotherapy']"
Social fear acquisition in children: the effect of parental verbal information and child temperament,"Gelder, Rosalie Kim van","['Aktar, E.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social fears are common in teenagers. Most are transient in nature, but some remain and convey a risk for the development of social anxiety disorder (SAD). A potential underlying mechanism is the parent-to-child transmission of social fears through social learning via the verbal information pathway. Previous research also suggests a role for behavioral inhibition (BI) in acquiring social fears. The current study investigated the effect of parental verbal threat vs. safety information on children’s social fear beliefs towards strangers and whether this effect is moderated by BI and gender. In this experimental study, a non-clinical sample of 64 children aged 9.5-14 years (M = 11.64, SD = 1.15; 35 girls) participated in a social performance task with a stranger about whom their parents communicated threatening or safety information. Children filled in self-reports regarding social fear beliefs about two strangers and BI. The results revealed stronger fear beliefs towards strangers about whom parents communicated threatening information. BI or gender did not moderate this effect. The current study provides additional support for the assumed importance of parental behavior in acquiring social fears through social learning, and in particular with regard to the pathway of verbal information transmission. To interpret the effect as a result of verbal threat information, future research might consider a baseline measure of social fear beliefs to compare changes in social fear beliefs as a result of parental verbal information. This study contributed to a better understanding of underlying mechanisms that place children at risk of developing social fears.","['Verbal information pathway, social fear, parents, behavioral inhibition, familial transmission']"
Does Pain Acceptance mediate the Relationship between Chronic Pelvic Pain and Depressive Symptoms in Females with Endometriosis?,"Storf, Natascha","['Ghita, I.A.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background. Endometriosis is a debilitating gynecological disorder, oftentimes accompanied by chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and mental health conditions such as depression. Previous research has established that CPP, which is unrelated to the occurrence of menstruation, is highly predictive of depression scores in females with endometriosis. In the context of patients with chronic illnesses, pain acceptance has been highlighted as playing a crucial role in psychological outcomes such as depression. Pain acceptance is determined by the extent to which a life-focus, or a pain-focus is maintained. The main objective of the study was to determine the interplay between CPP, pain acceptance and depression in participants diagnosed with endometriosis. Methods. The study had a retrospective, cross-sectional research design, using convenience sampling to recruit respondents. A final 232 respondents completed the survey, composed of an ad-hoc item to measure CPP (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS) and validated questionnaires to examine pain acceptance (Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire – 8, CPAQ-8) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire – 9, PHQ-9). A correlation between CPP and depression was conducted, and the mediatory effect of pain acceptance in this relationship was investigated. Results. Initially, a significant and positive, however weak correlation between CPP and depression was found. Subsequently, pain acceptance was determined as a significant mediator in the relationship between CPP and depression. Discussion. In comparison with previous research in the general population, the PHQ-9 scores were higher and CPAQ-8 scores were lower in this study, indicating more severe depression, and lower pain acceptance scores. The mediation model established that experiencing CPP negatively impacts pain acceptance, which negatively impacts depression in females with endometriosis. Further research on mental health vulnerabilities in females with endometriosis, and an increase in social awareness and professional support is required.","['Endometriosis', 'Chronic Pelvic Pain', 'Depression', 'Pain Acceptance']"
Does Language Influence the Way We See the World? The Influence of Combinatorial Language Abilities on Visual Perception of Children and Adults,"Brouwer, Carmen","['Poletiek, F.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Does language influence the way we see the world? This question has fascinated scholars from the fields of cognitive psychology, linguistics and philosophy for ages. In order to make sense of our surroundings, we have to analyse objects that appear into our visual field. This happens during visual perception, a process underlied by a mechanism of separation and binding of object features, according to FIT (Treisman & Gelade, 1980). When creating meaning with language, a similar process takes place. During linguistic combinatorial processes, words are analysed and bound together into grammatical structures. In this study, the link between the two cognitive systems is assessed. We compare visual memory and combinatorial language abilities of children and adults by using a memory game with stimuli with and without overlapping features (colour and shape). To assess grammatical abilities, a grammar test was designed to assess combinatorial language abilities. It was hypothesised that they outperform adults in tasks concerning visual memory and that their visual memory correlated negatively with their grammatical skills. More specifically, we presumed that children would suffer less distraction from overlapping features because of their tendency to analyse the field holistically, without interference of grammatical ‘cognition’. We find that adults outperform children on the grammar test. Furthermore, we found that adults outperform children on the overall memory game. We also found that participants perform better during non-combinatorial trials than during combinatorial trials, in line with the hypothesis of holistic perception in children. However, we found no evidence of an effect of combinatorial language skills on visual memory.","['combinatorial language abilities', 'visual processing', 'visual perception', 'language development']"

The mediating effect of climate change interest on self-efficacy and skepticism: A correlational study,"Ronner, Marthe","['Zadelaar, J.N.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Climate change is a severe threat to current and especially to future generations (IPCC, 2023), which indicates the importance of collective action and engaging younger people in the issue. A barrier to this action and engagement is climate change skepticism, which is the doubt of the existence or severity of climate change, its consequences or anthropogenic origin. This study aimed to research whether people low in self-efficacy concerning climate change will try to cope with this sense of powerlessness by avoiding the topic of climate change, which then evolves into a skeptic attitude towards or even denial of its existence, its consequences or anthropogenic origin. As such, we examined the relationship between self-efficacy and skepticism, mediated by climate change interest. We obtained correlational data with an online, self-report questionnaire, distributed among 16- to 24-year-olds (N = 408). The mediation analysis yielded a significant and negative full mediation, meaning that if self-efficacy is low, climate change interest is low, and if climate change interest is low, skepticism is high. This underscores the importance of increasing self-efficacy in older adolescents and young adults in order to increase climate change interest, which consequently influences the degree of skepticism. Thus, these insights can be used for designing techniques that foster climate change interest in this age group.",
How Guilt Moderates the Relationship Between One’s Need for Closure and Food Wasting Intentions,"pardo okamhi, belis",['ambra brizi'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Food waste is a detrimental issue around the world.

Results show a significant main effect of guilt on wasting intentions, indicating that experiencing higher levels of guilt is associated with a lower intention to waste food. Furthermore, the additional correlational analysis we ran shows that women score higher in feeling guilty, implicating the gender differences in food wasting intentions. The results and implications of the study are discussed in light of the literature and final suggestions for future research and campaigns aimed at reducing food waste are discussed.","['Need for Cognitive Closure, Guilt, Food Waste']"

Emotion recognition differences among primary progressive aphasia subtypes and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia,"Kester, Julia van","['Jiskoot, L.C.', 'Ruitenberg, M.F.L.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Individuals with different subtypes of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a common clinical presentation of frontotemporal dementia characterized by language disturbances, often show overlapping clinical symptoms, such that accurate diagnosis can be difficult. Prior studies indicate that social cognitive abilities, in particular emotion recognition, may improve the diagnostic process. Therefore, this study investigated emotion recognition deficits across different emotions and emotional intensities by means of the Emotion Recognition Task (ERT) among patients with a PPA subtype (semantic (svPPA), non-fluent (nfvPPA) or logopenic (lvPPA)), and behavioural frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The ERT is a neuropsychological test consisting of dynamic, naturalistic videos of the six basic facial emotional expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) across different intensity levels (40, 60, 80 and 100%). In total, emotion recognition abilities were assessed in 152 participants (10 svPPA, 20 nfvPPA, 6 lvPPA, 63 bvFTD, 53 controls). Results of an ANCOVA controlling for age, sex, and education level showed emotion recognition deficits in patients with a PPA subtype and bvFTD compared to controls. Among the patient groups, patients with bvFTD were poorer in overall emotion recognition than patients with nfvPPA. Among the PPA subtypes emotion recognition did not differ. Patients with svPPA were worse in recognizing anger than patients with bvFTD, nfvPPA and lvPPA. In addition, patients with svPPA and bvFTD were worse in recognizing disgust than patients with nfvPPA. Besides, patients with svPPA and controls were better in recognizing happiness, than patients with bvFTD, nfvPPA and lvPPA. Results of a three-way mixed ANOVA showed that emotion recognition abilities improved with higher emotional intensity and group differences were not the largest at the lowest intensity. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate emotion recognition deficits in PPA and bvFTD, and hint towards specific impairments for recognizing anger and disgust in patients with svPPA. These insights can help to improve clinical distinction among the PPA subtypes and bvFTD, which could ultimately lead to better differential diagnosis.","['Frontotemporal Dementia', 'FTD', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'PPA', 'Emotion recognition', 'Emotion Recognition Task', 'ERT']"

Interpretation Bias and Self-Image Bias as Predictors of Social Anxiety in Children,"Schot, Ilse","['Annelieke Hagens', 'Anke Klein']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between social anxiety, interpretation bias, and self-image bias and their ability to uniquely predict social anxiety. Children with an interpretation bias tend to interpret ambiguous situations negatively. Children with a negative self-image bias tend to estimate their likeability lower than what peers actually think of them. Social anxiety is the fear of social situations and negative evaluations by others. Due to the negative aspects in both biases, this study expects to see a positive relationship with social anxiety. In total, 491 children between 8 and 12 years completed questionnaires that measured social anxiety, interpretation bias, and self-image bias. To measure self-image bias, they had to rate their own likeability and how much they liked their classmates. Children who reported higher levels of social anxiety had higher levels of a negative interpretation bias (r =.491; p < .001) and more negative self-image bias (r = -.155; p < .001) than children with lower levels of social anxiety. Children who had higher levels interpretation bias had more negative self-image bias than children with lower levels of interpretation bias (r = -.175; p < .001). A multiple regression analysis indicated that both interpretation bias (β = 0.813; t (488) = 13.12; p < .001) and self-image bias (β = -0.066; t (488) = -2.12; p = .035) were unique predictors of social anxiety in children. However, gender differences were found: while girls exhibited a negative self-image bias (M = -0.02), boys reported a positive self-image bias (M = 0.13). Consequently, it was observed that the self-image bias does not act as unique predictor for social anxiety in boys (β = -0.032; t (238) = -0.73; p = .467). Only interpretation bias was a unique predictor for social anxiety in boys (β = 0.761; t (238) = 7.65; p < .001). These results stress the importance of focusing on several cognitive components during cognitive behavioral therapy and suggest a different treatment for social anxiety for boys versus girls. However, results of this study were modest. In order to draw stronger conclusions in future research, it is important to use a clinical sample with children who have diagnosed social anxiety. Also, a broader age range could be used in the future to include participants by whom social anxiety and negative self-image begins at adolescence.","['children, social anxiety, interpretation bias, self-image bias']"
The Social Dominance Orientation and Role Models of Adolescents: A Mixed Method Study,"Bakker, Kirsten",['Caroline Bokhorst'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A high social dominance orientation (SDO) can contribute to inequality in society, and while it may lead to discrimination, there is limited understanding of SDO among adolescents in the Netherlands. That is why this study investigated the relationship between the SDO of adolescent boys and girls and their role models. Based on data from a longitudinal study involving 136 families, a mixed method approach was employed to investigate adolescents’ SDO and their role models. First, SDO levels were compared between boys and girls using an independent sample t-test. Second, adolescents’ SDO was related to the social status of their role model by conducting a Pearson Correlation, and moderating effect of gender on this relationship were studied with a regression analysis. Furthermore, differences between adolescents scoring high and low on SDO and type and reasons for choosing this role model were exploratively examined. Additionally, differences between boys and girls with high/low SDO and their role models were investigated explorative. The hypothesis that boys scored significantly higher on SDO than girls (p < .001, d = 0.76) was confirmed. No relationship was found between adolescents’ SDO and social status of their role model. Both boys and girls, regardless of their SDO, were most likely to choose their parents as role models and gave mostly character traits as a reason. Adolescents high on SDO also chose friends/acquaintances and besides character traits mainly chose role models because of their financial status. Adolescents low on SDO also chose teachers as role models, primarily because of the interest in their occupation. Both boys and girls, regardless their SDO, mostly chose same-sex role models (Fisher exact test, boys: p = .002; girls: p < .001). Boys and girls mentioned different character traits they admired in their role model. It can be concluded that boys value social hierarchy more than girls, that parents are still role models during adolescence and that there are some differences between the type and reason for choosing a role model between high and low SDO. These findings can contribute to effective interventions to reduce SDO among adolescents and might counteract potential discrimination.",
Does Avoidance Learning Predict PTSD Severity and Treatment Outcome?,"Adi, Aliaa",['Rianne de Kleine'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Avoidance is a hallmark symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), yet the link between avoidance learning and PTSD severity and treatment outcome has not yet been explored. For this purpose, we administered a computer-based avoidance learning task to 144 treatment-seeking PTSD patients during the baseline assessment of a randomized clinical trial. The task consisted of a photo of blue or red colored lamps (conditional stimuli, CS+) followed by aversive photos (unconditional stimulus, US), while a photo of a yellow-colored lamp was followed by a black screen (safety stimulus, CS-). The US could be avoided by pressing a button during one CS+ (CS+ avoidable) but not the other (CS+ unavoidable). Participants were asked to fill in a threat expectancy rating after the CSs, and to report their relief after omission of the US. Participants were then given exposure therapy, and their PTSD symptoms were measured throughout 52 weeks. We predicted that higher rates of unnecessary or ineffective avoidance, higher expectancy ratings after omission of the US, and higher relief scores would relate to higher PTSD severity, and lower treatment gains. Results did not confirm any hypothesis; however, elevated threat expectancies (regardless of CStype) were related to PTSD symptom severity at baseline, and expectancies following CS- were related to PTSD severity across time points. Findings suggest general impairment in action-safety learning; however, it might be more relevant in light of PTSD severity to further explore the role of general threat expectancy. Furthermore, future studies should consider utilizing physiological measures, and adapting the task to include avoidance costs.",
The predictive value of nocturnal mentation for posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity,"Meijer, Maartje",['Dr. Joanne Mouthaan'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Approximately 10% of trauma-exposed individuals develop a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Restless rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is thought to be a vulnerability factor for PTSD. Thought-like nocturnal mentation has found to be related to restless REM-sleep. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of the general tendency for nocturnal mentation for early PTSD symptom severity within 60 days after acute civilian trauma. It was expected that nocturnal mentation and PTSD symptom severity are positively associated, that this association is stronger for women than for men, and that thought-like mentation is stronger associated than dream-like mentation. This study used data from the ongoing study ‘Towards Accurate Screening and Prevention (2-ASAP): PTSD Risk Screening Study’. The sample included n = 230 participants (mean age 45(8)), recruited via Slachtofferhulp Nederland. A confirmatory factor analysis, to test the validity of the two-factor-structure of the nocturnal mentation questionnaire in the current sample, indicated that thought- and dream-like nocturnal mentation are better as separate factors. Regression analyses showed that thought-like nocturnal mentation was, among dream- and total nocturnal mentation, the only significant positive predictor for PTSD symptom severity. No moderation effect was found for biological sex on the association between nocturnal mentation and PTSD symptom severity. These results add new knowledge on vulnerability factors for PTSD. This study shows that thought-like nocturnal mentation may be relevant for further studies on the sleep-mechanisms underlying the development of PTSD. This association should be investigated using a longitudinal prospective design, including gender identification as a variable.","['posttraumatic stress disorder, nocturnal mentation, biological sex, CFA, moderation']"

The outcome measure used for measuring processing speed is symbol coding. Theory of Mind was assessed using the hinting task. The sample had a relatively low symptom severity (M = 1.97, SD = 0.8). The average score for social functioning was 28.4 (SD = 9.6). A linear regression analysis showed a non-significant relationship between processing speed and social functioning (β = .019, p = .774).

Warming Up to Better Adolescent Sleep: How Do Parental Warmth and Criticism Affect Subjective Sleep Quality in Depressed and Healthy Adolescents?,"Borrelli, Sara",['Laura Pape'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Sleep is important, especially in a volatile phase like adolescence. Many changes occur in sleep behaviour and in the development of depression, and parent-child interactions play an influential role. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between parental warmth and criticism, and adolescent subjective sleep quality in depressed and healthy adolescents, and the mediating role of rumination. Methods: 115 adolescents (78 females) participated in the study (MAge =15.81; SDAge = 1.42). Eighty adolescents are without psychopathology, and 35 adolescents are with a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Dysthymia. The adolescents followed a 14-day Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Linear Mixed Models were built and post-hoc mediation analysis was used. Results: Parental warmth (B = 0.09, p = 0.045) and parental criticism (B = -0.08, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with subjective sleep quality in adolescents, as were depression severity (B = -0.06, p <0.002) and age (B = -0.18, p = <0.0001). The effect of parental warmth on subjective sleep quality differed between the depressed and healthy groups. Rumination did not mediate the relationship between subjective sleep quality and parental warmth nor parental criticism. Rumination was found indirectly associated with sleep quality. Conclusions: Parental warmth promotes healthy sleep, whilst parental criticism may be harmful for adolescent sleep quality. More emphasis is needed on the role parents play in their child’s sleeping patterns and depressive symptoms. The implications suggest that sleeping problems can additionally be treated from a parental perspective.","['Parental warmth, parental criticism, subjective sleep quality, adolescents, depression severity, rumination']"

Because of this rise, we want to gain a deeper insight into factors that might contribute to suicidal thoughts and possible differences between men and women. This is because gender differences are found in suicidal ideation. By exploring risk factors and possible gender differences, early gender-specific interventions can be made. The current study combines quantitative and qualitative data to reach insights by analyzing survey data (N = 1367) and talking with young adults (having suicidal thoughts in the past two years but no active ideation; n = 19) risk factors are explored and interpreted. The analyses conducted were univariate and multivariate LRAs. After a Holm-Bonferroni correction, problems in Mental Health (p < .001), Loneliness (p < .001), and Trauma (p = .001) were positively associated with suicidal thoughts and Social Support (p = .001) was negatively associated with suicidal thoughts. We tentatively conclude that these risk factors play a role in both men and women, and it is important to support all young adults in these fields. It is recommended in further research to separate young adults having recent and long-term suicidal thoughts to gain a deeper understanding of the increase in the past two years.","['suicidal thoughts', 'young adults', 'risk factors', 'gender differences']"
Threat learning in adults: the role of childhood maltreatment,"Claassens, Juul",['L.D. de Voogd'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Individual differences are thought to underlie how someone reacts to threat, some people tend to fight-or flight, others tend to freeze. These reactions to threat are often measured by looking at the autonomic nervous system response in a threat conditioning paradigm. There has been a focus in the literature on the sympathetic reaction, but now the importance of also looking at the parasympathetic responses has become more evident, especially with regard to resilience in developing anxiety-related psychopathology. Childhood maltreatment is likely to be an individual factor that can influence threat conditioning. In this study we used a large sample size (n=174) in which we included both sympathetic (skin conductance responses) and dominantly parasympathetic (heart rate) measures in a threat conditioning paradigm to test whether threat learning can be reflected in both branches of the autonomic nervous system. We also aimed to replicate the findings of Jaswetz et al., (2023) with regard to the coherence of these two branches. Additionally, we investigated the possible influence of childhood maltreatment on sympathetic and parasympathetic reactions within the same threat conditioning paradigm. Indeed, we found that threat learning is successful on parasympathetic measures. We were not able to replicate the findings of Jaswetz et al., (2023) in which a possible pattern of the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses was found. Furthermore, our results suggest that more severe childhood maltreatment does not affect responses in a threat conditioning paradigm, neither on sympathetic nor parasympathetic measures. In conclusion we can say that our study sheds new light on the influence of childhood maltreatment in threat learning since our results suggest that threat learning is not affected by prior experiences of childhood maltreatment when tested in a large sample size.","['threat conditioning', 'individual differences', 'parasympathetic', 'sympathetic', 'childhood maltreatment']"

The research was conducted within an existing social network of emerging adults (19-24 years, N = 23). Prior studies on social media intensity, social connection and FoMO have so far not examined the underlying relations within a pre-established group of individuals who are connected through various social interactions, such as friendships, acquaintances or being housemates. Based on previous research, it was hypothesized that individuals with greater social media intensity would exhibit higher levels of FoMO. Additionally, his study examined the relationship between FoMO and social connection. No relationship was found between social media intensity and FoMO. Three concepts of social connection were measured: friendship, likeability a popularity. A significant relationship between FoMO and likeability was found such that more likeable individuals experienced less FoMO; the other constructs of social connection did not show a correlation with FoMO. A positive relationship was found between popularity and likeability. This contradicts prior research but could indicate developmental changes in peer relations during young adulthood. Furthermore, individuals who were rated higher in social media intensity by their peers were also perceived to be more popular among their peers. Possible explanations for the above-mentioned findings are discussed.","['Social media intensity, social connection, FoMO, friendship, likeability, popularity, young adults']"

The participants were asked to recall a negative financial experience and were then presented with a fictional letter from an imaginary creditor, urging them to contact the creditor as soon as possible. The creditor letter was left unchanged from a standard creditor letter in the baseline group, while in the control group, the letter offered two possibilities to help repay outstanding debt. After reading the letter, participants were asked if they would be willing to contact the creditor. The study found that there was a significant difference in the participants' willingness to contact creditors. However, financial self-efficacy was not found to be a significant moderator.

Het effect van feedback op leesbegrip,"Nollet, Monique Nathalie","['Huijbregts, S.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Reading comprehension is an essential skill in life that one needs to be able to participate in today’s society. The latest PISA results showed that 1 in 4 of the 15-year-old Dutch children has too little reading comprehension to understand the written world around them. A meta-analysis of Swart et al. has clearly indicated that extensive feedback given after a reading task shows better understanding of the text than lesser feedback or feedback during the reading task. However, these studies were all conducted with students who study in University. In this thesis we investigated whether extensive feedback given after a reading task to children in Groep 7 (approximately 11 years old) in the Netherlands show a better understanding of the texts compared to children that were given no or less extensive feedback. No significant differences were found between any of the experimental conditions. However, due to low numbers in each experimental group, the outcome of this study should be interpreted with caution. It is also unclear at this moment if the texts that were used during the intervention were suited for these children. Furthermore, the motivation of the children to seriously participate in this study is questioned. It is suggested that further research should be done to investigate the best type and timing of providing feedback to students.","['Feedback', 'Leesbegrip']"
Motor learning and its association with hippocampal volume in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease,"Schade, Luisa","['Ruitenberg, M.F.L.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; a preclinical stage of AD) are mostly associated with cognitive impairments. These cognitive challenges have been linked to hippocampal decline. Prior work suggests additional motor impairments affecting fine and complex motor skills, motor coordination, and basic mobility. Recently impairments in motor learning have been proposed, concerning motor sequence learning (i.e., learning to perform a series of motor actions) and learning to learn (i.e., learning something about a learning process, which can be applied to another learning process). This master thesis investigates whether these two motor learning abilities are affected in AD and aMCI compared to healthy controls. In addition, we evaluate whether hippocampal volume, which is a known biomarker for AD, can predict motor sequence learning and learning to learn. Methods: A motor sequence learning task was performed by 28 AD patients, 33 aMCI patients, and 52 healthy controls. They were presented alternating blocks of randomly vs. sequentially ordered stimuli, to which they responded via button presses. The difference in reaction times of random vs. sequence blocks was used to measure motor learning. Two different sequences were presented, with one sequence measuring motor sequence learning in the first half of the task, and another sequence in the second half assessing learning to learn. Hippocampal volume was determined via a structural MRI scan. Results: Although patients with AD generally responded slower than individuals with aMCI and controls, no significant group differences were found in motor sequence learning and learning to learn. AD patients had smaller hippocampal volume than patients with aMCI and controls. Patients with aMCI displayed smaller volume than controls. However, hippocampal volume did not predict motor sequence learning measures. Conclusion: The findings indicate that motor sequence learning and learning to learn are intact in AD and aMCI. Hippocampal volume can be seen as a differentiating factor for the stages of AD progression of healthy individuals, aMCI, and AD. However, it did not predict motor learning measures. Rehabilitation programs should target on utilizing motor learning functions to improve activities of daily living in individuals with AD and aMCI.","['motor learning', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'mild cognitive impairment', 'hippocampal volume, biomarker']"

"Overprotective parenting and children’s anxiety: The relation between overprotective parenting and anxiety symptoms in children, with gender as a moderating factor","Rijnja, Antiene Ilse",['dr. Leonie Vreeke'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Anxiety symptoms are prevalent in childhood and adolescence, with negative consequences for children's emotional and social development. Research has identified overprotective parenting as a predictor of anxiety, as it restricts a child’s exposure to potentially threatening situations and hinders their development of problem-solving skills. There are several models and strategies why parental overprotection causes anxiety symptoms in children. Also, gender-specific parenting may play a role in this relation. This study aims to examine the positive relationship between overprotective parenting and anxiety symptoms in children, with a stronger effect for girls compared to boys. Understanding these factors has practical relevance for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies for childhood anxiety. Data for this study comes from a larger project called “Cool Little Kids” (CLK), which aims to assist parents managing and preventing anxiety and inhibition in children. The data sample used was from 113 parents with children aged between 2;2 and 6;11 years old when they participated in a preintervention study (T0). The parents completed several questionnaires, including the Overprotective Parenting Measure (POM) and the Preschool Anxiety Scale Revised (PAS-R), which assessed the degree of parental overprotection and child anxiety levels, respectively. This cross-sectional study examines the relationship between parental overprotection and child anxiety levels. A moderation analysis is used to determine whether gender has a significant impact on the relationship between overprotective parenting and anxiety symptoms and was performed to test the hypothesis. The results indicate no significant association between overprotective parenting and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, when including gender as a moderating variable, no significant relationship was found between overprotective parenting and anxiety symptoms. The non-significant association can be explained by several factors, such as the young age of the children, the measuring instruments used, the sample size, and the effect of unmeasured factors on the results.","['anxiety symptoms, overprotective parenting, gender, moderated model, Cool Little Kids project']"
Let’s talk about our feelings! The Association between Parental Emotion Discussion and DHH Children’s Psychosocial Functioning,"Vikström, Ida-Sofia","['Yuen, S.', 'Li, B.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Children’s psychosocial functioning in is known to be influenced by parental emotion discussion in early childhood. However, the associations between parental emotion discussion and children’s psychosocial functioning have mainly been studied in the typically hearing (TH) population of children. Little is known about this association in the deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) child population, who tend to be at risk of having lower psychosocial functioning. Our study investigated the impact of parental emotion discussion on three areas of DHH and TH children’s psychosocial functioning (externalizing behavior, peer problems, and prosocial behavior) with a cross-sectional study design using parent report data on 215 preschoolers aged 1–7.5 years (49.3% girls, 88 DHH). Contrary to what was previously reported in the literature, we found that DHH and TH children did not differ in psychosocial functioning, nor did their parents differ in their level of emotion discussion with their children. In line with previous research, our results indicated that more parental emotion discussion was related to less externalizing, and more prosocial behavior in their children, but no association was found between parental emotion discussion and peer problems in the children. Furthermore, the hearing status of the children did not affect the associations between parental emotion discussion and children’s psychosocial functioning in our study. Future studies should address the heterogeneity of the DHH population and their families, and clinical focus should be placed to optimize family based early intervention programs for DHH youth.","['DHH', 'preschool', 'parents', 'emotion discussion', 'psychosocial functioning', 'externalizing', 'peer problems', 'prosocial']"
Exploring the role of Loneliness as a Mediator between Insomnia and Suicidal Ideation in a Sample of Adults.,"Bor, Sijgje Jacobje","['Kivelä, L.M.M']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Suicide, a global concern, necessitates comprehensive research to identify its risk factors and facilitate effective prevention. While established predictors like depression and chronic stress are known, little is known about the acute warning signs of immediate suicidal ideation. This study investigates the acute warning signs of suicide risk, focussing on the relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation. This study aims to explore the mediating role of loneliness in this connection. The study sample included 82 adults, of which 77% were female; the participants ranged in age from 18 to 54 years. Participants underwent a 21-day assessment period. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and actigraphy were used in this study to collect the data. EMA were administered four times daily to collect self-reported data on suicidal ideation, loneliness, social interactions, and subjective sleep quality. Objective sleep data, including the parameter sleep efficiency, were gathered through the use of actigraphy. We hypothesized that insomnia would be related to increased loneliness and suicidal ideation and that loneliness will mediate this association between sleep and suicidal ideation. We used subjective and objective measurements of sleep and loneliness to test our hypothesis. Our findings support that subjective loneliness partially mediates the association between lower subjective sleep quality and suicidal ideation. No significant relationships were found between the objective measurements and suicidal ideation. Our results highlight the complex interplay between subjective sleep quality, loneliness, and suicidal ideation, shedding light on potential interventions helping suicide prevention.","['Suicidal ideation, Loneliness, Sleep']"
The influence of dog ownership on pupil mimicry in humans: What is the role of familiarity?,"Postema, Maxime",['M.E. Kret'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Pupil mimicry is a phenomenon where social species such as humans, take on the pupil size of the other person for various reasons. The objective of this research was to investigate whether human participants (N=48) would show pupil mimicry towards humans, bonobos and dogs, and if there would be differences in mimicry strength towards the species. Further investigation dove deeper into pupil mimicry towards dogs, and if this would be influenced by familiarity. Familiarity was measured in (prior) dog ownership experience through a questionnaire filled out by the participants, 27 participants had ownership experience. Results showed that participants had pupil mimicry towards all three species, but no interaction effect was found between pupil action (dilating/constricting) and species. The results focussing on dogs and familiarity did not find an effect of familiarity on pupil mimicry. Current research aimed to fill in the literary gap about humans mimicking cross- and conspecifics and providing more knowledge about the influence of familiarity on pupil mimicry. This research could not give conclusive answers to the research questions, however pupil mimicry towards humans, bonobos and dogs was found, though not influenced by the interaction of species with pupil action, or familiarity. It is suggested that future research keeps expanding in this field of mimicry and various species. Furthermore, it is suggested that stimuli get more testing prior to the study, since this might have influenced the results. Additionally, make the participant group bigger to ensure enough statistical power.","['pupil mimicry, familiarity, cross-specific, con specific, human, dog, bonobo, ownership']"
Talking About the Fight Against Cancer; Helpful or Harmful? Are war metaphors helpful or harmful in palliative cancer care?,"Claasen, Cindy","['van Vliet, L.M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: War metaphors are the most common used metaphors in cancer care to explain the illness and the treatment. While the use of war metaphors can be perceived as empowering or disempowering, it is still unclear whether patient and informal caregivers in palliative cancer care perceive war metaphors as helpful or harmful language and which background characteristics might influence the appraisal of war metaphors. The aim of this study was to determine if there is a difference between patients and informal caregivers in the perceived helpfulness/harmfulness of war metaphors in palliative cancer care, and whether the individual background characteristics gender, age, education level and immigration background influenced the perceived helpfulness or harmfulness. Method: A quantitative, online study design was employed. Data from two online surveys were used in this study, consisting of 49 patients with incurable cancer and 39 informal caregivers of patients with incurable cancer. Both groups answered a questionnaire consisting of background characteristics and questions regarding protentional harmful statements from oncologists. A question on war metaphors was included and could be answered with ‘yes harmful’ or ‘no not harmful’. Results were quantitatively analysed. Results: Both patients and informal caregivers perceived the use of war metaphors as harmful (81,6% and 74,4%), although these percentage were not significantly different 2 (1, N = 88) = .679, p =.410. Fisher’s exact test (p = .44)). Regarding background characteristics; gender (p=.76), age group (p=.66), educational level (p=.44) and ethnic background (p=.33) showed no significantly difference in perceived harmfulness of war metaphors. Conclusion: Most patients and informal caregivers believe war metaphors are harmful in the setting of palliative cancer care. Therefore, it’s important that war metaphors are used with care and individually tailored to prevent potential unnecessary harm.","['palliative cancer care, war metaphor, communication, harmful, patient, informal caregiver']"
The relationship between the timing of Adverse Life Events and Intelligence,"Goede, Anouk de","['Cuperus, A.A.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Objectives: Adverse Life Events (ALEs) are seen as a risk factor for both psychiatric and cognitive difficulties later in life. There is a growing interest in understanding the relationship between ALEs and their impact on the developing individual due to the various types of consequences of ALEs (e.g., anxiety, substance use, depression, attention deficits, or language impairments). This study aimed to identify the relationship between the moment of the occurrence of ALEs (i.e., age) and intelligence (i.e., IQ) in adolescents who have experienced one or multiple ALE(s). It was hypothesized that more experiences of ALEs endured during a lifetime led to lower intelligence as experiences of ALEs lead to lower intelligence. Furthermore, it was expected that ALEs during early childhood led to lower intelligence as these experiences may result in smaller brain volume, which is associated with decreased intelligence. Additionally, experiences of ALEs during late childhood were expected to predict lower intelligence as these children tend to have a more thorough understanding of their endured ALEs. This study also examined the moderating effect of marijuana use on the relationship between age and intelligence. Here, the expectation was that individuals who reported marijuana use had lower intelligence as substance use can have a negative effect on intelligence. Methods: In total, 713 adolescents were included in this cross-sectional study design. Adolescents with a high risk to develop psychiatric disorders were oversampled for the cohort used. During this study, ALEs were assessed with the Adverse Life Events questionnaire. Intelligence was assessed with the Snijders-Oomen Non-Verbal Intelligence Test-Revised. Marijuana use was measured by using a single item of the Self-Reported Early Delinquency scale. Results: Multiple linear regressions were conducted in this study. The analyses showed that more lifetime experiences of ALEs predicted lower intelligence (partial r = -.090, p < .001). This study did not find evidence for a decrease in intelligence when experiencing ALE at a younger age. The study did find evidence that experiences of ALE at an older age predicted lower intelligence (partial r = -.088, p = .019). However, when controlling for age, gender, and socioeconomic status this effect did not remain significant (partial r = -.019, p = .607). These confounders most likely confounded the effect. No evidence was found for a stronger relationship between ALE and intelligence among marijuana users. Conclusions: In line with the expectations, more lifetime ALEs seem to negatively affect intelligence. Contradictory to the expectations, this study found that the timing of ALEs did not play a role in the relationship between ALEs and intelligence. This may be attributed to the study design where all different ALE types were combined in a total sum score and were not examined individually.","['ALE', 'adverse events', 'intelligence']"
"Academic stress and mental health problems in MBO-students: The relationship between academic stress, the presence of negative life events and depressive symptoms","Bugter, Jaimie","['Kraaij, V']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The aim of the study was to examine if there was a relationship between academic stress and depressive symptoms in MBO-students (practical-orientated education) and if this relationship was strengthened by the presence of negative life events. The study had a crosssectional design with a sample of 158 students who were enrolled in an MBO-program. Students were asked to complete an online questionnaire. For statistical analyses, linear regressions were conducted in SPSS. Results showed that there was a positive relationship between academic stress and depressive symptoms. This relationship was strengthened when someone experienced more negative life events. This was especially in case the life events were experienced earlier in life (longer than 1 year ago). No significant interaction result was found for recent stressors (less than 1 year ago). There were no gender differences in the relationship between academic stress and depressive symptoms. However, in the relationship between academic stress, depressive symptoms, and negative life events it seemed there was only a main effect of life events for females. However due to a low sample size of females, gender results should be interpreted with caution. Previous research showed that there is a strong relationship between academic stress and depressive symptoms in university students. The current study showed that this applies to MBO-students as well. Moreover, when these students have experienced previous stressors in life, they seem extra vulnerable when they also experience academic stress. Life events and academic stress should be taken in account for mental health interventions in MBO-students.","['MBO-students, academic stress, depressive symptoms, negative life events']"
Comparison of Dropout Rates in RCTs Testing the Efficacy of Nutraceuticals and Antidepressants for Adult’s Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review and a Meta-Analysis,"Khodabakhsh, Bahar","['Molendijk, M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a significant contributor to global disability, projected to emerge as the leading cause of disability by 2030. While Antidepressants (ADTs) are a prevalent treatment option for MDD, their efficacy is constrained by low remission rates and undesirable side effects, prompting exploration of alternatives. In the last decade, the efficacy of nutraceuticals in MDD treatment has gained attention. However, there is a gap in research regarding direct comparison between the dropout rates in trials investigating the effect of ADTs and nutraceuticals on MDD. This study conducted a comprehensive comparison of efficacy and dropout rates among 17 types of ADTs and 3 types of nutraceuticals. Data were derived from RCTs included in the most recent meta-analyses on this subject. Due to a lack of previous studies on the dropout comparison of ADTs and nutraceuticals, no predictions were made in that regard. However, it was hypothesized that higher dropout rates would be associated with better treatment outcomes. The findings indicate that Nutraceuticals were more effective (Cohen’s d = -1.96, CI: -3.40 to -.53) in MDD treatment compared to ADTs (Cohen’s d = -.35, CI: -.39 to -.31). There were no significant differences in dropout rates between ADTs and nutraceuticals, except within control groups, where nutraceuticals demonstrated lower dropout rates (M =.13) compared to ADTs (M =.28). Furthermore, no relationship between dropout rates and treatment outcomes was observed, except within the ADTs control group where higher dropout rates corresponded to lower treatment outcomes (t (1,144) = -2.91, p = .004). This study shows the comparative efficacy and dropout dynamics of ADTs and nutraceuticals in the treatment of MDD.","['MDD', 'ADTs', 'nutraceuticals', 'metanalysis', 'RCTs', 'dropouts', 'treatment outcome']"
Stigmatizing attitudes from the general public towards people with psoriasis and the behavioural immune system,"Everard, Mirjam",['Sylvia van Beugen'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Psoriasis is one of the most common chronic skin disorders and is known for its substantial psychosocial impact. Stigma from the general public plays a significant role. Yet there is limited knowledge and research done regarding determinants and mechanisms that explain or predict these stigmatizing attitudes from the general public. Potentially the behavioural immune system (BIS) plays a role. Aims: The aim of the study is to gain insights into factors of the BIS that potentially influence stigmatizing attitudes of the general public, to facilitate the development of an appropriate intervention targeting the reduction of such attitudes. Methods: A sample of 150 participants between the age of 19 and 73 (M= 31.4, SD=13.1) where included. They filled in an online questionnaire after reading a vignette about an encounter with a person with psoriasis. Questionnaires measured perceived vulnerability to disease, knowledge of psoriasis and the personality trait openness to experience. Results: There was no significant association found between higher levels of perceived vulnerability to disease and stigmatizing attitudes towards people with psoriasis (p=.23). Furthermore, neither openness to experience (p=.24) nor knowledge of psoriasis (p=.25) mediated this relationship. Notably, individuals with lower levels of knowledge about psoriasis displayed greater stigmatizing attitudes towards people with psoriasis (p=<.001). Discussion: It is therefore recommended to focus on increasing knowledge about psoriasis in future intervention development. Next to this it is recommended to further investigate if the BIS affects stigma towards people with psoriasis with other determinants and methods and to evoke stigma with visual cues.",
The Influence of Socio-Economic Status and Ethnic Discrimination on Suicidal Ideation among International and Domestic College Students in the Netherlands,"Amin, Babo",['Bahamondes-Álvarez R.A.'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Suicide is a prevalent phenomenon among college students. Studies pointed out that international students in Western countries are more vulnerable for mental health problems and suicidal ideation than domestic students. Aim: This study aimed to conduct a comparative analysis of suicidal ideation between international and domestic students in the Netherlands; to broaden our understanding of the social determinants of suicidal ideation among college students; and to test a macro-micro integrated path model that could predict suicidal ideation among college students. Method: A mixed method strategy (explanatory sequential QUAN + QUAL design) was used among N = 198 domestic and international college students in the Netherlands. Cross- sectional data from questionnaires were gathered and analyzed. A comparative analysis was conducted among domestic and international students. In addition, three mediation models tested the pathways and effects of financial stress, perceived ethnic discrimination, subjective social status, and perceived burdensomeness. These mediations were also tested in an integrated pathway model. Afterward, N = 6 participants were interviewed to explain inconsistent results and to understand how students experience and reflect upon their suicidal ideation in relation to their subjective social status. Quantitative and qualitative data were finally integrated. Results: International students scored higher on suicidal ideation, financial stress, and perceived ethnic discrimination. Moreover, subjective social status and perceived burdensomeness mediated the relationship between perceived ethnic discrimination and suicidal ideation. Although family income was related to subjective social status and suicidal ideation, financial stress showed no significant correlation with the latter. The pathway model showed a good fit, but not all paths were significant. Qualitative results revealed two themes: self-image and social opportunities. Conclusion: International students in the Netherlands faced more suicidal ideation, financial stress and perceive more ethnic discrimination. Although financial stress was not linked to suicidality in this study, the importance of socio-economic factors is highlighted as family income was correlated to suicidal ideation. Lastly, while there was evidence for a relation between subjective social status and suicidal ideation, qualitative results indicated that higher subjective status might lead to risk factors for suicidal ideation as well.",
Werken met vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking: De mening van professionals,"Slootweg, Denise","['Lotz, A.M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking (LVB) worden in onderzoek naar vaders vaak over het hoofd gezien, terwijl de rol van vaders in de opvoeding in de afgelopen decennia veranderd is. Vaders zijn meer betrokken bij de opvoeding en in het leven van hun kind(eren) (Mesman & Vermeer, 2017). Wanneer vaders een LVB hebben, is het van belang dat professionals passende ondersteuning bieden (Van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2022b). Dit onderzoek geeft een overzicht van de ervaringen en knelpunten die professionals ervaren in het werken met vaders met een LVB. De volgende vragen staan in dit onderzoek centraal: ‘Wat is er in de literatuur bekend over de ervaringen van professionals in het werken met vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking?’ en 'Wat zijn de ervaringen en knelpunten van professionals die werken met vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking?'. Het onderzoek omvat een literatuuronderzoek en zeven semigestructureerde diepte-interviews met professionals die werken met vaders met een LVB. De bevindingen van de interviews zijn gecodeerd aan de hand van thema’s die in de transcripten naar voren komen. Uit de literatuur komen een aantal risicofactoren naar voren die aanwezig zijn bij vaders met een LVB. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn een slechte mentale en fysieke gezondheid en een lage sociaaleconomische status (SES) (Emerson, 2015). Ook worden kenmerken van vaders met een LVB benoemd die bijdragen aan de ervaringen en knelpunten van professionals die werken met deze vaders. In de literatuur wordt benoemd dat vaders met een LVB minder vaardig zijn in cognitief en adaptief functioneren en een laag IQ hebben (Pratt & Greydanus, 2007). Negatieve ervaringen die professionals hebben in het werken met vaders met een LVB, zijn gerelateerd aan de samenwerking tussen professional en vader met een LVB, maar ook tussen professionals onderling. Daarnaast worden het hebben van een lage mate van begrip en minder goede communicatievaardigheden van vaders met een LVB als lastig ervaren door de professional (Joha, 2004). Negatieve ervaringen die benoemd worden door vaders met een LVB zijn dat ze zich weggeduwd en buitengesloten voelen. Vertrouwen, positieve aanmoedigingen en goed georganiseerde hulpverlening kunnen deze negatieve ervaringen verminderen (Theodore et al., 2018). In het empirisch onderzoek hebben professionals een aantal ervaringen en knelpunten benoemd. Positieve ervaringen die professionals hebben in de samenwerking met vaders met een LVB, zijn de eerlijkheid en openheid van vaders met een LVB. Ook de emotionele expressie van deze vaders en de liefde en betrokkenheid die vaders met een LVB tonen naar hun kinderen vormen positieve ervaringen van professionals. Negatieve ervaringen die werden benoemd, zijn moeilijkheden in de communicatie, beperkt reflectievermogen, slechte emotieregulatie, lage intelligentiequotiënt en problemen in de samenwerking binnen het gezin. Ook benoemen professionals risico- en beschermende factoren van vaders met een LVB. SES, mentale gezondheid en omgeving kunnen bevorderend of belemmerend werken voor vaders met een LVB zelf en de samenwerking tussen de professional en de vader met een LVB. Daarnaast geven zij aan dat het bevorderen van betrokkenheid van vaders in het gezinsondersteuningsproces een manier is om het competentiegevoel van vaders met een LVB te versterken, waardoor de samenwerking tussen professional en vader met een LVB verbetert. Op basis van het onderzoek is geadviseerd om te kijken naar de rol van de vader binnen een gezin om knelpunten in de samenwerking tussen vaders met een LVB en professionals te voorkomen. Ook wordt geadviseerd om meer educatie te verzorgen voor professionals op het gebied van vaders met een LVB. Daarnaast is het van belang om knelpunten op organisatorisch vlak te voorkomen. Tenslotte is uit dit onderzoek naar voren gekomen dat het van belang is dat de juiste hulp geboden wordt aan vaders met een LVB.","['Professionals', 'Vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking']"

This decision regarding an investigation is a particular decision in the Netherlands which is made early in the process of child protection. When an investigation is necessary, the child protection services will further investigate if a supervision order, out-of-home placement or termination of authority is necessary. When an investigation is not necessary the families continue with voluntary youth care and the child protection services are no longer involved. To examine if certain family factors are related to the decision to start an investigation 84 documents filled in by the child protection services and other involved youth workers were analysed. This document contains information about the parents, children and family. For this research an own coding system was developed to code the documents. Family conflicts such as domestic violence, SES, divorce between parents and/or the number of children in the family were not related to the decision to start an investigation by the child protection services. For good decision-making in child protection all factors (family, child and parent factors) need to be taken in account, not only family factors.","['Family Factors, Decisions, Child Protection Services']"

Reducing food waste in households through phrasing of expiration date,"Jimmink, Laura","['Dijk, W. van']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Food waste is a big problem in the Netherlands. In an effort to find a solution to this problem, the present study examines the influence of expiration date labels on people’s intention to waste food. The current phrase “ten minste houdbaar tot” [“at least preservable until”] can be seen as definitive and thought to refer to food safety whereas it refers to food quality, thus this study proposes an alternative phrase “beste kwaliteit voor, vaak goed na” [“best quality before, often good after”]. The aim of this alternative phrase was to make clear that the expiration date refers to food quality and that the food could still be safe to consume after this date had passed. Participants were presented with dairy and pantry products that had an expiration date that had passed by five days. This expiration date was shown with the current phrasing or the alternative phrasing. Results showed that the alternative phrase led to a lower intention to waste dairy compared to the current phrase. Whereas for pantry products, there was no difference in intention to waste food between the two phrases. Moreover, results showed that the intention to waste dairy was mediated by perceived risk. Meaning that dairy products that were presented with the alternative phrase were perceived as less risky to consume, which in turn was associated with a lower intention to let the product go to waste when the expiration had passed. Thus, changing the phrasing of the expiration date label could help in reducing food waste in the Netherlands.",
Did the regular practice of physical activity impact adolescents' mood during the COVID 19 lockdown in the Netherlands and is it moderated by sex?,"Vandame, Nelly",['Dr. Marieke Bos'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"On February 27th, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the Netherlands, leading to a series of lockdown measures. These restrictions resulted in the closure of schools, restaurants, non-essential stores, and sports centers, forcing adolescents to adapt to social distancing and online schooling. Adolescence is a vulnerable developmental period characterized by emotional growth and social expansion. During this time, adolescents reported lower mood levels due to the social isolation and lockdown restrictions. Physical activity is a well-known coping mechanism that enhances mood and encourages social-cognitive development in children and adolescences. This study aimed to investigate the impact of physical activity on the mood of adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands, with a focus on potential differences between boys and girls. Data was collected via a daily diary study over four weeks between April and June 2020. The study included 60 participants, comprising 22 boys and 38 girls, who reported their daily mood state and minutes of physical activity. The daily mood questionnaire separated mood into four different qualitative categories of happiness, anger, sadness, and fear. Three hypotheses were tested: if there was a correlation between mood and physical activity over the different weeks of lockdown, if there is a difference between boys and girls in mood and physical activity, and finally if physical activity and sex can predict participant’s mood state. The results showed that both boys and girls had no difference in their mood averages over the four weeks and spent similar amounts of time in physical activity, which was lower than the recommended daily level. Another important finding was that adolescences reported a low score of anger, sad, and fear but also a low score of happiness. None of the previously stated hypotheses were proven, yet this study highlights a lack of physical activity and an absence of happiness in adolescences during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands.","['COVI-19, Adolescences, Physical Activity, Mood']"
Beyond Preferences: Assessing Accuracy and Bias in Students’ Choices Between AI and Human Answers: How Much Do Students Trust ChatGPT?,"Favetta, Matteo","['Walker, F.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This research explored students' trust in ChatGPT, in answering challenging trivia questions on an online multiple-choice questionnaire. Despite extensive research on ChatGPT's capabilities, a significant gap in the literature remains regarding human trust in this AI system, particularly in educational contexts. This study aimed to assess to what extent do university students trust this novel AI, uncovering biases towards or against AI-generated responses. Using a between-subjects design, we manipulated answer source transparency and correctness. Each question presented participants with one human-generated and one AI-generated answer option. The results were analysed through paired samples and independent two-sample t-tests, alongside Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression models. The findings revealed a distinct preference for human-generated content, which persisted even when answers were incorrect. This indicated a lower level of trust in ChatGPT among our participants, implying that they did not over-rely on AI-generated content. Surprisingly, the trend leaned towards an over-reliance on human-generated responses.","['AI', 'ChatGPT', 'Education', 'Trust', 'Reliance', 'Multiple-Choice Questionnaire', 'Bias', 'Students']"
De invloed van woordenschat en executieve functies op het pragmatisch taalgebruik van kinderen met Selectief Mutisme,"Blikman, Britt-Zoë","['Dr. S.H.M. van Goozen', 'Dr. S.C.J. Huijbregts']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The current study investigated the relation between the receptive vocabulary, executive functioning, pragmatics and selective mutism of children between four and eight years old. Selective mutism is a rare disorder and is characterized by the absence of speaking in situations like school which can lead to multiple problems in adulthood like reduced academic achievements, social development and mental health. The aim of this study was to acquire more knowledge about the relation between these constructs and selective mutism for future development of interventions so children with selective mutism get the support they need. This was investigated through a quantitative study using research data from Project Omilia. The Children’s Communication Checklist, Selective Mutism Questionnaire, Peabody’s Picture Vocabulary Test III and Minnesota Executive Function Scale were used to measure these constructs. Independent t-tests showed that the receptive vocabulary and pragmatics were less developed for the children with selective mutism. The multiple regression analysis showed a significant positive relation between severity of selective mutism and pragmatics. This indicated that an increase in severity of selective mutism leads to more problems with pragmatics. These results authenticate that it is important to conduct research on pragmatics for children with selective mutism. Pragmatics seem to be vital in the development and conservation of selective mutism and vice versa. However, research on pragmatics of children with selective mutism is scarce. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct more research on this matter for a more thorough development of selective mutism interventions so children with selective mutism get the opportunity to develop better pragmatic skills and hopefully less selective mutism severity.","['Selectief mutisme, executieve functies, pragmatics']"
Using Structural Equation Modeling to Assess Factor Theories of Machiavellianism,"Vijlbrief, Anna","['Simpson-Kent, I.L.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"A Machiavellian is someone who believes that the end justifies the means and who views other people as tools to achieve their own goals. The concept of Machiavellianism has attracted considerable theoretical inquiry into the underlying processes that give rise to the construct. During this process multiple theories on the factorial structure of Machiavellianism have come into existence and many of the factor theories have found support. This thesis compares the factor structure of Machiavellianism using the original Machiavellianism measurement tool, the MACHIV. We utilized a large open-source data set (N= 73,486) from the Open-Source Psychometrics Project. We used structural equation modeling to compare a one-factor (Machiavellianism), two-factor (Views and Tactics) and three-factor (Antagonism, Agency and Planfulness) model. We found that all three of the models fit the data poorly but the one-factor model fits this data and measurement tool best, with no significant difference between the two- and three-factor models. The one-factor model fit best when using the original data, positively recoded data and when compared to uncorrelated (orthogonal) factor models. The poor fit indices on the one-factor model indicate that although the one-factor model fits better than the alternative models, alternative factor theories are needed to better explain the variance among individuals on the MACH-IV.","['Machiavellianism', 'Confirmatory Factor Analysis', 'Structural Equation Modeling', 'MACH-IV']"

(Over)beschermende opvoedstijl hangt samen met angstklachten adolescent. Speelt cognitieve empathie een rol?,"Dona, Merlijn","['Tollenaar, M.S.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Er zijn steeds meer jongeren met angstklachten. Uit onderzoek blijkt dat opvoedstijl een voorspeller kan zijn voor de hoeveelheid angstklachten bij adolescenten. Met name een (over)beschermende opvoedstijl zou samenhangen met angstklachten bij de adolescent. Maar welke aspecten van deze opvoedstijl leiden tot verhoging van angstklachten is nog niet volledig bekend. Bij een (over)beschermende opvoedstijl ligt de nadruk wellicht minder op het aspect cognitieve empathie. Als ouders heel beschermend zijn, zijn ze zich mogelijk minder bewust van de gevoelens en behoeftes van hun kind. Ouders proberen de emoties van het kind te controleren en tonen zo minder empathie, door minder ruimte voor emoties te geven. In de huidige studie is daarom onderzocht of verhoogde cognitieve empathie het verband tussen een (over)beschermende opvoedstijl en angstklachten bij adolescenten medieert. Hiertoe hebben 115 adolescenten, waarbij 102 vaders en 114 moeders, als onderdeel van een grotere studie, een reeks vragenlijsten ingevuld om deze variabelen te meten. Met de Interpersonal Reactivity Index werd cognitieve empathie van de ouders gemeten, met de Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders de angstklachten bij de adolescent en met de Parental Bonding Instrument de mate van een (over)beschermende opvoedstijl. Regressieanalyses toonden aan dat een (over)beschermende opvoedstijl van de ouders inderdaad positief samenhing met de angstklachten bij de adolescent, maar deze relatie werd niet gemedieerd door cognitieve ouderlijke empathie.

The Impact of Workplace Cyberbullying and Traditional Workplace Bullying on Mental Health: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Weve, Jip","['Molendijk, M.L.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Bullying at the workplace has been shown to negatively impact employees’ mental health. Advancements in communication technology have opened the floodgates for workplace bullying to proliferate and continue online, which is referred to as cyberbullying. A consolidation of knowledge and research findings would aid in better understanding the impact of workplace cyberbullying on mental health. Thusly, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on cross-sectional data retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science in January 2023. Pooled analyses showed that both traditional workplace bullying (r = .405, 95% CI = .375 - .435, k = 148, n = 206974) and workplace cyberbullying (r = .266, 95% CI = .215 - .317, k = 10, n = 8870) are associated with mental health declines. Yet, the effect of traditional bullying was somewhat stronger (p = .013). Although significant associations were found, the effects appear to be weak to moderate. The small difference between traditional and cyber workplace bullying might be better explained by the general effects of online interactions displacing traditional face-to-face communication thereby possibly differentiating from the working mechanism of traditional bullying. A major limitation is the use of self-report questionnaires for bullying and mental health outcomes, resulting in possible reporting bias. Future research might benefit from using one universal and standardized questionnaire to assess workplace bullying experience. These findings emphasize the need for corporations to focus on the prevention of workplace bullying to safeguard employees’ mental wellbeing and promote a healthier and more productive work environment.","['workplace', 'bullying', 'cyberbullying', 'mental health', 'meta-analysis']"

The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between perceived financial stress among students, the actions they (intend to) take to resolve that stress and social support. 146 students from the UK with an age between 18 and 27 participated in the current study by completing an online survey. The results showed a positive relationship between perceived financial stress and the likelihood that they take action to resolve this stress. Two types of actions were found: adjusting income/expenses and seeking support from others. For both types of actions a gap between the intentions and actual actions taken was found. However, there was no significant moderating effect of perceived social support found on the relationship between financial stress and actions taken to resolve that stress. The results of the current study add knowledge to the topic of financial stress among students and can help researchers, policymakers and other professionals (e.g., social workers and counsellors) to understand the concept of the intention - action gap for students with financial stress.",
A study into information provision and patient satisfaction during diagnostic consultations in Parkinson’s disease,"Noorloos, Lisanne",['Kaya Peerdeman'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder. Because of the debilitating effects of PD, receiving the diagnosis is very impactful for patients. Patient satisfaction remains low regarding diagnostic consultations. Possible explanations are the clinicians’ information provision during these consultations, the fact that patients do not receive all the provided information, and/or clinician characteristics (e.g., gender, age, and profession). The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between information provision during PD diagnostic consultations and patient satisfaction. The aims were to determine if patient satisfaction is associated with (1a) the duration and (1b) content of information provided by clinicians, (2) patients’ report of the amount of received information, and (3) clinician characteristics. This study had an observational longitudinal design. Participants (N=33), patients referred to participating Neurology out-patient clinics, filled out questionnaires before and after their diagnostic consultations. Questionnaires assessed patient satisfaction (PSQ) and patients’ report of the amount of received information. The first and second diagnostic consultations were video-recorded. Researchers observationally coded these for the duration and amount of content of information provided by clinicians. Clinicians (N=21) completed questionnaires before their first included consultation, assessing their age, gender, and profession. Multiple linear regressions were used for the statistical analyses. The total possible range of PSQ scores was 0 to 500, the measured PSQ scores ranged from 220 to 500 (M ± SD = 397.8 ± 67.56). Duration of information provision (p=.233), amount of content (p=.543), and patients’ report of the amount of received information (p=.299) were not associated with patient satisfaction. An association between clinician characteristics and patient satisfaction was found (p=.005). Profession was the only significant predictor (p=<.001). Overall, information provision was not significantly associated with patient satisfaction. Since this is the first study to observationally code the duration and amount of content of information provision during PD diagnostic consultations, it is recommended to perform this study again with a larger and more diverse sample. It might also be interesting to follow the patients for a longer duration of time, to research if and how the patient satisfaction changes overtime.

An experiment was conducted (N = 306) in which participants read a scenario about help offered, by either a non-profit or for-profit organisation, with an ambiguous strategic motive, a non-ambiguous non-benign strategic motive, or a non-ambiguous benign strategic motive. As predicted, non-profit organisations were perceived as warmer than for-profit organisations. Additionally, when organisations were perceived as more hypocritical, organisations were perceived as less warm. Unexpectedly, the study did not find support for the interaction effect of organisation type and motive on perceptions of organisational hypocrisy and organisational warmth. The non-profit organisation was consistently perceived as warmer and less hypocritical than the for-profit organisation, regardless of the underlying motive. Consequently, the study did also not support the expected mediation effect. However, we did establish an alternative mediation effect. The findings of the current study are in support of earlier research by Van Leeuwen and Ter Mors (2023) and research on the stereotype content model.","['Intergroup Helping, Third party perception, organisational helping']"

Hiervoor is een vragenlijst afgenomen onder leerkrachten die minimaal één dag per week zelfstandig voor de klas staan. Na het uitvoeren van verschillende regressieanalyses komt naar voren dat de attitude van de leerkracht en het schoolbeleid niet samenhangen met de ouderbetrokkenheid in het onderwijs. Hierna is exploratief onderzoek uitgevoerd, waaruit blijkt dat duidelijke afspraken maken binnen het schoolteam én communicatieproblemen tussen leerkracht en ouder ten opzichte van ouderbetrokkenheid in groep 5 tot en met 8 belangrijk kunnen zijn voor de praktijk.

The influence of “Indulgence versus Restraint” on Ingroup Bias: A Dictator Game Experiment,"Hagemeijer, Sammie",['Andrea Fariña'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Members of a group often show ingroup bias: the tendency to favor one’s own group. An important factor moderating ingroup bias is culture. Hofstede introduced several cultural dimensions, of which indulgence versus restraint (IVR) is one. There has already been extensive research on most of these dimensions and their influence on ingroup bias and prosocial behavior, but less is known about the influence of IVR on ingroup bias. Due to this research gap, this paper aims to answer the question whether the degree to which an individual is indulgent or restrained affects their ingroup bias. Students (N = 75) participated in a three-part experiment. First, a minimal group paradigm was created. Then, a dictator game was played. Finally, participants filled in a questionnaire measuring personal IVR score. A significant ingroup bias was found using a simple T-test. However, no correlation was found between IVR and ingroup bias after performing a simple linear regression. This suggests that the degree to which a person is indulgent or restrained does not have an influence on the person’s ingroup bias. However, the results are inconsistent with previous research, so more research needs to be conducted.","['Ingroup bias, Indulgence versus restraint, Dictator game']"

Response shift is een verandering in de betekenis van iemands evaluatie van een bepaald construct, die kan optreden als gevolg van een significante levensgebeurtenis. Het wordt verondersteld dat het effect van een significante levensgebeurtenis op de response shift wordt gemedieerd door een toegenomen neiging om deel te nemen aan neerwaartse sociale vergelijking. In dit onderzoek werd getest of de tentamenperiode een response shift kan veroorzaken in het stressniveau van universiteitsstudenten, en of sociale vergelijking hier een rol bij speelt. 31 universiteitsstudenten met en twaalf zonder tentamens werden getest op hun stressniveau en mate van sociale vergelijking voor en na een tentamenperiode. Het stressniveau is gemeten met de Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) en de mate van sociale vergelijking met de Iowa-Netherlands Comparison Orientation Measure (INCOM). Om voor response shift in stressniveau te testen, werd er op hetzelfde moment als de nameting ook een toenmeting afgenomen, waarbij de respondenten hun stressniveau retrospectief beoordeelden. Een significant verschil tussen de toenmeting en de voormeting van het stressniveau zou wijzen op een response shift. In de gehele groep respondenten met tentamens werd geen response shift in stressniveau gevonden, maar in eerstejaarsstudenten met tentamens wel.

Expectations and predictions of others prosocial behavior do not depend on age and trait social anxiety,"Jansen, Lillian",['Ili Ma'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Significant to the adolescence is the ability to predict (pro)social behavior of peers. Research shows that there are many motivations underlying prosocial behavior but two are important for this thesis: selfishness (maximizing personal gain) and risk aversion (minimizing losses). The prediction of others’ prosocial behavior can depend on social motivations or choices of oneself. Research suggests this might be different in social anxiety disorders (SAD). The social projection theory (SPT) suggests that socially anxious adolescents expect others to be risk averse. Another theory suggests that the negative social expectations that socially anxious adolescents have, means they predict others to be selfish. Therefore, the current study focused on whether predicting risk averse and selfish behavior of others develops during adolescence as well as the question whether the development of social learning is different for adolescents with higher levels of social anxiety. The main effect of motive was explored as well as the effects of trait social anxiety and age on the difference of motivations and the number of correctly predicted motivations. Method: A total of 38 participants were recruited by Bachelor-and Master Psychology students (17 boys and 21 girls; age range 9 to 26, mean = 15.2, SD = 3.8). The study was a cross-sectional design using a social decision-making game, inspired by Van Baar et al. (2020) and the social anxiety scale for adolescents (SAS-A). Statistical analyses included a two paired sample t-test, and two consecutive multiple regression analyses (MRA). Results: No significant results were found, meaning that adolescents expectations about motivations behind their peers’ prosocial decisions do not depend on age and trait social anxiety. It is discussed that the lack of evidence is due to the age difference in this study compared to prior research, not including a clinical sample and having a small sample size. Future research is needed to further explore social learning and social anxiety.","['adolescence, prosocial behavior, social learning, selfishness, risk aversion, age and trait social anxiety']"

It examines the relationship between child abuse and neglect and traumatic complaints, including the possible moderating effect of cognitive functioning. Existing research in this field has uneven gender distributions, women are being researched more, which this thesis aims to balance. The study design is correlational, using a dataset (n = 241) obtained from Buisman et al.'s (2020) research. It has an even distribution of males (42.3 %) and females (57.7%), and the age ranges from 25 to 87 years (M = 50.97, SD = 13.43), comprising participants from the Netherlands with a mostly Western background. Participants were targeted if they had a history of experienced or committed abuse. Various measures were executed, including the RAVEN (cognitive functioning), a combination of the CTQ and CTS-PC questionnaires (experienced child abuse and neglect), and an interview using the PSSI-5 (traumatic complaints). The results showed that women have a significantly higher degree of traumatic complaints. Child abuse and neglect have a significant negative association with traumatic complaints. And lastly, cognitive functioning was not a significant moderator. The discussion stresses balanced gender research, as current focus tends to be on women. Understanding the reasons behind women's higher levels of traumatic complaints, as to how this imbalance can be levelled, is crucial. Even so, a balance in research into protective and risk factors is desirable, as the latter is being researched more. It is worth noting that a potential issue with internal validity arose; the main hypothesis was based on research on IQ, while cognitive functioning served as a possible moderator in this study. Further research is required to examine the moderating effect of general intelligence, measured through multiple variables, for instance cognitive functioning and IQ.","['PTSD, traumatic complaints, child abuse, child neglect, cognitive functioning']"
Effect of PE fit on emotional exhaustion: culturally dependent? The influence of person-job and person-group fit on emotional exhaustion and the moderating role of masculinity/femininity and collectivism/individualism,"Belt, Lianne","['Verhoeven, C.J.M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The match between a person and one’s work environment is important for work outcomes, such as emotional exhaustion in burnout. This is illustrated by the person-environmental fit (PE fit) model, which consists, amongst others, of person-job fit (PJ fit) and person-group fit (PG fit). The relationship between these measures and emotional exhaustion could be moderated by cultural factors. In this research two cultural values are considered on an individual level, as PE fit is a subjective measure and thus dependent on individual values. Also, cultural values can differ between individuals within the same country. Firstly, the dimension masculinity/femininity was considered as a moderator between PJ fit and emotional exhaustion. This entails amongst others the importance of assertiveness and whether there is a difference between what men and women should achieve in a career. Secondly, the dimension collectivism/individualism was considered as a moderator between PG fit and emotional exhaustion. This entails the amount to which the group is more important than the individual. Two regression analyses were done using a sample of 161 participants (20 to 65 years old) who work for at least 24 hours a week. Nine participants were not entirely Dutch. The results showed that low PJ fit significantly predicts high emotional exhaustion, but masculinity/femininity did not significantly influence this relationship. Next, the participants without a work group were filtered out, resulting in 136 participants. Then, the results showed that there is no significant relationship between PG fit and emotional exhaustion, and that collectivism/individualism had no significant influence. Thus, in the organizational field, PJ misfit can be used as a risk factor in the secondary prevention of burnout. In the Dutch population, the two cultural values do not seem to play a role in the specific relationships. In future research one should consider other cultural values, PE fit measures and work outcomes, to generate an overview of risk factors for negative work outcomes.",
"Screening of internalising disorders in youth with a substance use disorder using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21)","Jalink, Dora","['Bos, M.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a common disorder among the general population, but especially in adolescence. Just as with anxiety disorders, mood disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, the age of onset lies in this age stage. Comorbid mental health problems often result in more severe dependence and an increased risk of relapse following treatment. When these comorbid problems are treated simultaneously, which is possible, it results in a better treatment outcome than when they are treated separately. Hence, valid instruments are needed during the intake process in substance use treatment to screen for these internalising disorders. In this study the psychometric properties of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were investigated as a screening instrument for anxiety disorder, depression disorder, PTSD, or any of these internalising disorders in adolescent SUD patients. Methods: The study is part of a longitudinal prospective cohort study, with 441 adolescents aged 16 to 22 years. The DASS-21 was administered by research assistants, independent from treatment staff, and took place around start of the treatment. An independent t-test was used to compare mean DASS-21 scores of participants with and without a classification of a past-year internalising DSM-5 disorder. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off scores and the AUC gave the discriminative value of the DASS-21. Results: Participants with a past-year diagnosis scored significantly higher on the DASS-21 than participants without a diagnosis did (p < .001). The ROC analyses gave a significant AUC value for the depression disorder, anxiety disorder and total scale of the DASS-21 (p < .001). The total scale gave the best AUC score of 0.80 and a cut-off score of 44 gave the best balance between sensitivity (0.82) and specificity (0.62). Conclusion: The DASS-21 is a reliable screener for detecting internalising disorders in youths seeking treatment for substance use. Implications: The DASS-21 is a free, short and easy-to-administer questionnaire that is already widely used in general mental health care today. Combined with the results of this study, it makes the DASS-21 an appropriate screening instrument for internalising disorders in adolescents in treatment for substance use. This makes it easier to detect comorbid health problem so that they can be treated simultaneously with the SUD, resulting in better treatment outcomes.",
Predictors of memory impairment in people with Multiple Sclerosis,"Kamphuis, Pepijn","['Hulst, H. E.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"General cognitive decline has frequently been described in multiple sclerosis literature. Specific predictors of memory decline have yet to be determined. Furthermore, general cognitive differences between sexes have already been determined in MS. However, relatively little is known about sex differences in specific memory functioning and its decline over time. The aims of this paper were to identify sex differences in memory functioning in MS patients’ latest and second to latest visits to a MS clinic, and to identify predicting factors of memory decline in MS. This was a longitudinal cohort study of retrospective nature in which data was obtained from 253 MS patients (26.5 % male, 73.5% female, mean age in years = 53.9, mean disease duration in years = 17.3, SD = 10.2SD = 13.2, 8.8% had primary progressive MS, 30.3% had secondary progressive MS, 60.2% had relapse remitting MS, and the phenotype of 0.7% was unknown) in an MS rehabilitation center in Belgium. Verbal memory functioning was determined with the use of two subtests of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test. Visuospatial memory was determined with the Spatial Recall Test (SPART). To determine if patients were impaired in memory functioning at baseline, a cutoff score of 1.5SD or lower compared to the norm group was used. Patients that showed a decline in memory scores of >0.25SD per year were defined as “declining”. Our results showed that more women than men were impaired on all memory tests at their latest visit. Furthermore, patients declining on visual memory were found to perceive more pain and discomfort (p = .017, Cohen’s d = .730), problems in daily activities (p = .038, Cohen’s d = .632), and experienced more problems with selfcare (p = .035, Cohen’s d = .641). Moreover, patients declining on verbal memory showed more signs of depressive thoughts (p = .025, Cohen’s d = .816) and anxiety (p = .013, Cohen’s d = .828). The current research was successful in identifying differences between men and women at their latest visit, although we were not able to identify predicting factors of memory decline. Furthermore, we were successful in depicting cognitive differences between declining and non- declining MS patients. Future research should elaborate on the effect of depression, anxiety, quality of life, and possibly fatigue, on memory decline. Additionally, predictors of decline should be identified to eventually improve the care of MS patients and consequently decrease their rate of cognitive deterioration.","['Memory Impairment', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Sex differences']"
A Multiple sclerosis personal health record: The influence of a Multiple sclerosis personal health record on patients’ self-efficacy and experienced quality of care,"Kiveron, Léone",['Pam ten Broeke'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: A personal health record (PHR) is an electronic record for tracking and managing health information in patients with a chronic illness such as Multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, an MS-PHR was evaluated to improve the engagement of patients with MS in their own care. The main purpose of the study was to learn more about the MS-PHR’s usage and psychological effects. Consequently, the MS-PHR’s relation with self-efficacy and experienced quality of care was studied. Methods: This longitudinal research project used a mixed-method design consisting of quantitative and qualitative data. Participants of this study (N = 75), patients with MS of 18 years or older from the Alrijne hospital neurology department, could use the MS-PHR for two years and filled out multiple questionnaires each year. Descriptive analyses were performed to examine the MS-PHR usage and satisfaction. Linear mixed model were performed to examine the change of self-efficacy and experienced quality of care after using the MS-PHR for two years. Besides, a focus group interview was carried out (N = 7) for which the Framework-method was used to study the provided data. Results: The results showed a lower MS-PHR usage and satisfaction than expected. The use of the MS-PHR for two years did not result in higher self-efficacy (p = .667) or higher experienced quality of care (p = .252). Experienced quality of care was a significant predictor of self-efficacy (p = .015). The results of the focus group interview showed a low MS-PHR usage as well. Participants mentioned that the MS-PHR could contribute to self-efficacy via provided health information and to experienced quality of care via shared disease related information with the healthcare professional before consultation. Conclusion: This study showed that the MS-PHR usage was lower than expected. Besides, the MS-PHR did not result in higher self-efficacy or experienced quality of care. A possible explanation might be the multiple barriers that complicated the implementation process. Future research is needed to implement a better version of the MS-PHR, to optimize the implementation process, and to learn how the added value of the MS-PHR for patients with MS can be increased.","['Multiple Sclerosis, Personal Health Record, Self-efficacy, Experienced quality of care']"
The influence of positive modelling on social fear learning in infants and toddlers: A meta-analysis,"Caprak Uysal, Damla","['Evin Aktar', 'Cosima Nimphy']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In infants and toddlers, fears can be acquired through observational learning. Previous research suggests that positive modelling which is a form of observational learning can form positive inhibitory associations that can counter the effects of fear learning. This meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the empirical studies on the influence of positive modelling on social fear learning in infants and toddlers between 0-3 ages. Three procedures were identified as the effects of positive modelling, namely fear reversal, fear prevention and fear reduction. OVID (Medline), EBSCO and PsychInfo databases were searched and a total of 1715 studies were found of which 15 were included in the final analysis. A meta-analysis was performed for two outcome variable categories, affect and approach/avoidance. Meta-analysis results showed that positive modelling has a significant fear reduction effect for affect variables with 0.55 effect size and for approach/avoidance variables with 0.64 effect size. Two studies showed support for the fear prevention effect of positive modelling, whereas none of the studies matched the criteria for fear reversal effect. To conclude, responsiveness of infants and toddlers to positive modelling can be seen as an inspiration for developing interventions that could be implemented in the early stages of life for fear/anxiety related problems.","['positive modelling, observational learning, fear learning, social learning, social referencing']"

While cooperation has been extensively studied, this research delves into the less explored aspects of competition and peace. We hypothesised that Honesty-Humility would have a positive relation with cooperation and a negative relation with competition, while predicting a reluctance to invest in the peace pool. We used an experimental economic game study design, participants (N =198) played eight rounds of the Co-Peace Game. A regression analysis was used to test our hypotheses. As expected, individuals with higher Honesty–Humility tendencies, cooperated more compared to individuals with lower Honesty–Humility tendencies. Surprisingly, results did not find a significant relation between Honesty-Humility with competition or peace. The research emphasises the complexity of personality traits in influencing social behaviours and offers valuable insights for future research.","['Cooperation', 'Competition', 'Peace', 'Honesty-Humility, HEXACO, Economic Games,']"

Trainingservaring bestaat in deze studie uit plezier, uitdaging en tevredenheid. Van tevoren werd verwacht dat sporters die meer plezier creëren (het ludieke element), een andere trainingservaring (meer plezier, minder uitdaging en meer tevredenheid) zouden hebben dan sporters die meer competitie creëren (het agonistische element). Methoden: Om de hypothesen te toetsen is er een weekboekstudie uitgevoerd met volwassenen die minstens twee keer per week sporten (N=121). Over een vierwekelijkse periode zijn proefpersonen wekelijks bevraagd over hun sportontwerp en -ervaringen. Resultaten: Door middel van een multiple-regressie-analyse en independent-samples t-toetsen zijn de hypothesen getoetst. Hieruit is gebleken dat mensen die vaker het ludieke element tijdens hun trainingen toepassen dan het agonistische element, meer trainingsplezier ervaren (t (119) = 3.38, p < 0.001). In lijn met de verwachting werd er gevonden dat het creëren van competitie gerelateerd was aan meer uitdaging. Echter, niet in lijn met de verwachting, werd gevonden dat het creëren van plezier daarentegen gerelateerd was aan minder uitdaging. Groepsverschillen van de PSD-elementen in uitdaging werden niet gevonden. Ook werden er geen significante relaties gevonden tussen de PSD-elementen en de indicator tevredenheid. Conclusie: De bevindingen laten zien dat de groep sporters die relatief meer plezier creëert dan competitie, meer trainingsplezier ervaart dan de groep sporters die relatief meer competitie dan plezier creëert. Tevens lijkt het creëren van plezier juist samen te gaan met een afname in uitdaging en het creëren van competitie in een toename in uitdaging. Deze gevonden kennis kan wellicht bijdragen aan het verhogen van de sportparticipatie in de toekomst via PSD.","['Playful Sport Design (PSD)', 'ludiek element', 'agonistisch element', 'trainingsplezier', 'uitdaging', 'tevredenheid met training', 'trainingservaring']"
The domain-general cognitive control process in bilingual switching: evidence from midfrontal theta oscillations,"Cui, Ningjing","['Nieuwenhuis, S.T.N.', 'Zheng, X.Z.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Language control in bilingual speakers involves effectively switching between languages, inhibiting the non-intended language, and continuously monitoring speech errors. It has been a matter of controversy concerning whether language control operates in a comparable manner to cognitive control processes in non-linguistic domains (domain-general) or if it is exclusive to language processing (domain-specific). Midfrontal theta oscillations have been considered as an index for increased cognitive control, so examining whether a similar midfrontal theta effect is likewise evident in bilingual language will bring new insights to the ongoing debate. This study aimed to explore midfrontal theta oscillations in bilingual control with a specific focus on three fundamental control processes: language switching, inhibitory control, and speech monitoring. We reanalysed the EEG data obtained from two previous language switching studies where Dutch-English bilinguals named pictures based on colour cues. Theta power increase was observed during language switching, specifically in switch trials compared to repeat trials, and this effect was observed in the midfrontal region. Similarly, enhanced midfrontal theta power was observed during error monitoring, specifically when participants failed to select the intended language at a switch, compared to correct responses. However, no midfrontal theta effect was found during inhibitory control, reflected by a missing modulation in switch trials following a short run (i.e., a short sequence of same-language repeat trials) compared to a long run (i.e., a long sequence of same-language repeat trials). These findings largely support the involvement of domain-general cognitive control mechanisms in language control, particularly in language switching and speech monitoring, whereas inhibitory control remains unclear.","['Midfrontal theta, language control, bilingual switching, cognitive control.']"

OOK Pedagogische Expertise Groep (OOK) ziet dezelfde constatering in hun training ‘’OOK zo omgaan met elkaar’’, waarin leerlingen leren te reflecteren op het eigen gedrag en bewust te worden van het effect van het eigen gedrag op een ander. OOK heeft ons benaderd om te onderzoeken hoe de ouderbetrokkenheid binnen deze training verhoogt kan worden. Dit onderzoek komt tegemoet aan deze vraag door te kijken naar de samenhang tussen de attitude van de leerkrachten over ouderbetrokkenheid, het schoolbeleid omtrent ouderbetrokkenheid en de ouderbetrokkenheid in groep 5 tot en met 8 in het primair onderwijs. Hiervoor is een vragenlijst afgenomen onder leerkrachten die minimaal één dag per week zelfstandig voor de klas staan. Na het uitvoeren van verschillende regressieanalyses komt naar voren dat de attitude van de leerkracht en het schoolbeleid niet samenhangen met de ouderbetrokkenheid in het onderwijs. Hierna is exploratief onderzoek uitgevoerd, waaruit blijkt dat duidelijke afspraken maken binnen het schoolteam én communicatieproblemen tussen leerkracht en ouder ten opzichte van ouderbetrokkenheid in groep 5 tot en met 8 belangrijk kunnen zijn voor de praktijk. Op basis van deze bevindingen zijn de aanbevelingen gedaan aan OOK om effectief gebruik te maken van nieuwsbrieven en aandacht te besteden aan communicatievaardigheden van de leerkracht.

To expect the worst: The influence of gender and baseline anxiety levels on the nocebo effect,"Elsner, Kristin","['Nadinda, P.G.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this study the effects of gender and baseline anxiety on nocebo effects were assessed. The nocebo effect describes a mechanism in which negative expectancies lead to adverse outcomes. Both gender and anxiety have been linked to differences in nocebo susceptibility. High anxiety scoring women seem to be particularly receptive to negative expectancies. However, the link between gender, anxiety and the nocebo effect remains ambiguous. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate whether gender and baseline anxiety predict increased nocebo effects. The effect of negative expectancies was tested in two groups of healthy participants (n = 20) who rated electrical pain stimuli. In the condition group negative expectancies were induced through conditioning and verbal suggestion. The statistical analysis showed a significant influence of negative expectancies on nocebo scores (H = 5.593; p = 0.018). Gender and anxiety were not found to be significant predictors (F = 0.855; p = 0.465). The results indicate that negative expectancies lead to a nocebo effect which replicates earlier findings. The hypothesis of a relationship between gender, baseline anxiety and the nocebo effect was not supported. Since negative expectancies can increase pain perception, the findings indicate that reducing or counterconditioning the nocebo effect in clinical settings could improve pain management. Furthermore, patient communication guidelines should take potential nocebo effects into account. The results imply that men and women with varying baseline anxiety do not differ in their susceptibility to the nocebo effect. Gender might only be a significant predictor in clinical samples and other measures of anxiety might be more influential than baseline anxiety. Future research could be focused on different dimensions of anxiety and how they interact with gender in bigger samples.","['Nocebo effect', 'baseline anxiety', 'negative expectancies']"

Eerdere onderzoeken benadrukken dat financiële zorgen het subjectief welzijn negatief beïnvloeden, doordat financiële zorgen onder andere emotionele uitputting en psychische klachten veroorzaken (van Vreder & Thijssen, 2019). Eerdere bevindingen toonden daarentegen aan dat deelname aan vrijetijdsactiviteiten een positieve invloed kan hebben op het subjectief welzijn, en het subjectief welzijn dus kan verbeteren (Brajša-Žganec et al., 2011; Tonon et al., 2013; Sirgy et al., 2017). Echter verschillen mensen in de vaardigheid om te kunnen genieten (hedonistisch vermogen) en worden niet alle mensen op dezelfde manier (negatief) beïnvloed door financiële zorgen. De invloed van financiële zorgen op de ervaring van vrijetijdsactiviteiten is daarnaast niet eerder onderzocht, terwijl financiële zorgen de ervaring van vrijetijdsactiviteiten op een vergelijkbare manier zouden kunnen belemmeren als hoe financiële zorgen het subjectief welzijn belemmeren. Er is meer kennis nodig over hoe financiële zorgen en de vrijetijdsbeleving bijdragen aan het subjectief welzijn en de individuele verschillen hierin, omdat studenten steeds meer onder financiële druk komen te staan wat ten koste gaat van hun studie. Het doel van dit onderzoek was dan ook om een verklaring te geven over hoe financiële zorgen bij studenten een negatieve invloed hebben op het subjectief welzijn en de ervaring van genot tijdens vrijetijdsactiviteiten. De resultaten hebben aangetoond dat financiële zorgen een negatieve invloed hebben op het subjectief welzijn, maar er werd geen significante relatie gevonden tussen de ervaring van genot tijdens vrijetijdsactiviteiten met het subjectief welzijn en financiële zorgen. Bovendien bleek het hedonistisch vermogen geen significante moderator te zijn in de relatie tussen financiële zorgen en de ervaring van genot tijdens vrijetijdsactiviteiten. Tot slot was een tekortkoming van dit onderzoek was dat de twee metingen van de ervaring van genot tijdens vrijetijdsactiviteiten significant met elkaar verschillen. Vervolgonderzoek kan zich richten op het ontwikkelen van één maat van de ervaring van genot tijdens vrijetijdsactiviteiten.

Open questions were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis while the predictors were examined via multiple regression analysis. Results showed that important reasons for the students to not definitely do a CU program were preferring other sources of help, unfamiliarity with CU, the preference for self-management, dislike for online treatment, shame or difficulty with sharing, doubts about the effectiveness, and time constraints. Concerning the predictors, the preference for handling problems by oneself, doubts about effectiveness, and other barriers specified in an open text answer significantly decreased the likelihood of doing a CU program, while anticipating problems with time and scheduling increased it. Possible reasons why the other factors failed to predict the likelihood and future directions are discussed. To conclude, several barriers were identified that inform the development of implementation strategies.","['e-Health, implementation barriers, Caring Universities Program, student mental health']"

It was expected that commitment and self-concept clarity would be related positively with age, while reconsideration would be related negatively. In addition, it was assumed that commitment would have a positive correlation with self-concept clarity and that the relationship would develop positively throughout adolescence. Lastly, it was assumed that reconsideration would relate negatively with self-concept clarity and the relationship would develop negatively throughout the different time points. Adolescents (N = 198, M age = 16.6) completed the 12-item measure of self concept clarity (SCC) and the single-item version of the Utrecht Management of Identity Commitments Scale (U-MICS). A repeated measures ANOVA showed no evidence of development in the SCC (p = .46), commitment (p = .34), and reconsideration (p = .20). A Pearson correlation coefficient analysis performed a positive correlation between commitment and SCC (r = .19) and a negative correlation between reconsideration and SCC (r = -.21). Α nonlinear development in the relationship between SCC with commitment and SCC with reconsideration was found within the three different time points. Future research on the relationship and development between the above variables should include a larger and more diverse sample and questionnaire items that will provide more insights and detailed data about identity formation and SCC.

The first objective was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the E-diary to assess migraine characteristics, as the recent development of remote testing makes it fundamental to validate novel E-health instruments. Moreover, migraine has been associated with depression and anxiety. Previous studies found that they predict an increase in migraine frequency years later. The second objective was to examine whether depression and anxiety symptom severity are associated with an increase in migraine frequency three months later. Migraine patients fill in the headache E-diary on a smartphone application, which keeps track of headache attacks daily. It included thirteen items about migraine symptoms, aura characteristics, headache duration and triptan use. Psychometric properties were assessed by conducting an item response theory analysis (n = 1417). Depression and anxiety symptom severity were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A change in migraine frequency was defined as the difference in migraine days between the first and third month and was measured with the headache E-diary. Linear regressions were performed to test whether the depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with an increase in migraine frequency (n = 725). Twelve items had moderate to very high discrimination values and nine had sequential ordered and positive thresholds. The items properly differentiate migrainous headaches from non-migrainous headaches. The aura, aura duration and unilateral location items were the weakest items. Depression was not associated with a change in migraine frequency (F(1, 723) = 0.32, β = 0.02, p = .573, 95% CI [-0.06, 0.11]), and neither was anxiety (F(1, 723) = 1.07, β = -0.05, p = .301, 95% CI [-0.13, 0.04]). In conclusion, the headache E-diary measures migraine risk accurately and the findings of this study contribute to the validity of the E-diary. It could be that three months is too little time to show the relationship between depression, anxiety, and a change in migraine frequency.","['Migraine', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'E-diary', 'psychometric properties']"
The Volunteer’s Dilemma: The Influence of Framing and Social Value Orientation,"Bozok, Ali Yigit","['de Kwaadsteniet, Erik']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social dilemmas occur when there is a conflict between self-interests and collective interests within a group (van Lange et al., 2013). The volunteer’s dilemma (VoD) is a unique type of social dilemma which requires at least one person to cooperate to realize a public good (Weesie & Franzen, 1998). This study examines the influence of using gain frames versus loss frames on participant behavior in volunteer’s dilemmas. Additionally, this study looks into how the personality variable social value orientation (SVO), which determines if a person is prosocial or proself, impacts volunteering decisions. We expected that gain frames would result in more volunteering than loss frames, and that prosocials would volunteer more than proselfs. The VoD game was conducted online via the platform oTree. 102 participants took part in this study. The results showed no statistically significant effects for neither the framing conditions nor the SVO scores. For future research, it is advised that the VoD game offers a higher payoff to cause a more distinctive response between different frames. Also, researchers should acknowledge that framing effects differ for gender as well as the possibility that the risk assessment in many social dilemmas, including VoD, may be ambiguous. This results in not being able to see framing effects. Since the experiment mostly appeals to participants’ economic motives, more research is needed to determine how relational motives can also be triggered.","['volunteer’s dilemma, social dilemma, gain frame, loss frame, framing, social value orientation, prosocial, proself']"
"De mate waarin traumatische ervaringen van ouders het verwaarlozen van hun kinderen voorspelt, en hoe dit wordt gemedieerd door psychopathologie.","Jongeleen, Elise",['Stephan Huijbregts'],2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"This study focused on whether parents' traumatic experiences predict their children's neglect, and how this is mediated by (parental) psychopathology. Mediation analysis was performed with parents' childhood traumatic experiences as the independent variable, parental neglect of own children as the dependent variable, and parental psychopathology as the mediator. From 32 participating families, 237 fathers and mothers were selected for the current study. Outcomes were measured by the parent completed Interview Belastende Ervaringen (IBE), Adult Self Report (ASR) and a combination of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS-PC) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Although the association between committed parental neglect and childhood traumatic experiences (p =.593) and parental psychopathology (p =.059) did not reach significance, a significant relationship was found between parental psychopathology and childhood traumatic experiences (p <.001). Nevertheless, the mediation analysis revealed that the independent variable traumatic experiences in parents and the mediator psychopathology in parents together did not significantly influence neglecting their own children. In conclusion, given that few significant relationships were found, this study will have minor direct clinical implications. However, the results of this study suggest that monitoring children with traumatic events throughout their development might be useful because of an increased risk regarding later psychopathology.",
"The relationship between sleep disturbances, coping strategies, social interactions, and suicide ideation among adults","Hanenko, Nikita","['Kivelä, L.M.M']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Although there are many established risk factors for suicide ideation, there is also some literature that questions the use of individual risk factors, and argues for a more complex approach towards them. Current research delved into the interplay between activating coping strategies, negative social interactions, and sleep disturbances in relation to suicide ideation. Study employed a longitudinal design with the sample of 82 participants with a recent history of a suicide attempt or moderate to severe suicide ideation. The observations were collected four times a day via ecological momentary assessments for the duration of three weeks. The hypotheses were tested via multilevel modelling analyses. Activating coping strategies were not significantly associated with reduced suicide ideation. Then, negative social interactions were positively associated with suicide ideation, poor subjective sleep quality, and nightmares. Furthermore, poor subjective sleep quality and difficulty falling asleep were associated with suicide ideation, whereas nightmares were not. Lastly, a full mediating effect of subjective sleep quality was found on the relationship between negative social interactions and suicide ideation. Despite some limitations, such as self-report and a somewhat selective sample, the study's strengths lie in its use of ecological momentary assessments and multilevel modelling, which enable a comprehensive examination of daily fluctuations and associations. The study discusses possible reasons for and the importance of current findings, and calls for future research to explore complex relationships among suicide ideation risk factors, potentially offering a more nuanced understanding of their predictive power.","['suicide ideation', 'risk factors', 'ecological momentary assessment', 'mediation']"

Tot op heden beschrijft onderzoek echter tegenstrijdige resultaten, verzameld bij vooral oudere kinderen. De doelstelling van het hier gepresenteerde onderzoek was om (i) middels een paired samples T-toets te onderzoeken of de angstvermindering bij kinderen in de interventiegroep (n = 54) groter was dan die van de controlegroep (n = 38) en (ii) middels een moderatie-analyse te onderzoeken of de angst bij de ouder als moderator optreedt voor het verschil in angst bij de kinderen in de interventiegroep bij de voor- en nameting.

Therefore, a guided, digital Cognitive behavioral therapy ‘i-Sleep & BioClock’ was developed. This study investigated the effect of this intervention on insomnia symptoms, quality of life, and a potential moderating role of pre-test depressive symptoms. It was hypothesized that there would be a reduction of insomnia, an increase in quality of life, but no moderation of pre-test depression on insomnia change. The study was an online single-arm pilot trial, that included N= 216 students at the pre-test, of which N= 64 completed the post-test. Participants followed a five- week guided digital intervention. The questionnaires used before and after the intervention were the Insomnia Severity Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Mental Health Quality of Life questionnaire. Two paired samples t-tests and one linear regression analysis were conducted. The pre- to post-test differences of insomnia (t [63] = 7.821, p < .001, Cohen’s d = -0.98) and mental health quality of life (t [57] = -2.802, p = .007, Cohen’s d = 0.37) were significant. The moderation effect of pre-test depression on change in insomnia symptoms (b = -.041, 95% CI [-0.215, 0.297], p = .750) was not significant. Participants experienced a reduction of insomnia symptoms, which was not moderated by baseline depressive symptoms. Also, their quality of life improved throughout the study. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. The findings not only extend the existing literature on e-health interventions but also guide the direction in future research on accessible mental healthcare for students.","['insomnia, digital cognitive behavioral therapy, e-health, student mental health']"

Disclosure about online sexual unacceptable behavior is shown to be a useful act to overcome negative feelings. This study examines to what extend relationships with friends or parents predict disclosure of online sexual unacceptable behavior, and if this connection is mediated by negative consequences. Hypothesized was, that a stronger bond with parents and/or friends helps participants to disclose sooner and that relationship with peers is the strongest predictor. Also hypothesized, is that relationships with parents and friends are negative predictors for negative consequences. The last hypothesis states that negative consequences are a partial mediator between relationships and disclosure. To explore disclosure, 67 participants (8 men, 57 women, 1 nonbinary and 1 gender not shared) stated to have had experience in online sexual unacceptable behavior in an online questionnaire. The analyses used three methods; a binominal logistic regression, an ordinal logistic regression and a multiple regression. Results show that only friendships predicted negative consequences; the better the friendship, the lower the negative consequences. Also, when disclosure happened after a month, better friendships were a stronger negative predictor for negative consequences. Lastly, more negative consequences resulted in later disclosure. These results give more insight that can help teenagers disclosure of online sexual unacceptable behavior.","['Internet, youth, sexual unacceptable behavior, disclosure']"

This study examines the impact of parental mental health problems, children's social isolation and parents' access to social support on youth care decision making. In addition, an exploratory design is used to examine whether social support and social isolation has a mediating role between parental psychological problems and decision making. With the overarching goal of gaining a better understanding of the motivations that in turn influence decisions made in youth care. The theoretical framework of this study examines factors affecting child well-being and development. These elements are crucial to understanding the topic. The research question is as follows: ""To what extent are the experience of parental mental health problems, social support versus social isolation in children, related to a council investigation?” “To what extent is the relationship between parental mental health problems and the decision to initiate a council investigation mediated by parents' access to social support versus children's social isolation?” In This study documents were analysed and the sample consisted of families from the participating youth protection tables. There was a significant relationship between parental psychological problems and decision making. Decisions to refer for a child protection investigation were made more frequently among parents with mental health problems. The results of the study demonstrate the importance of parental mental health problems in the decision to request a child protection investigation. Recommendations for further exploration into the form and frequency is advised. In particular, supplemental research regarding the possible comorbidity of mental health problems and how that affects human behaviour. Overall, this thesis contributes to the existing literature in the field of youth care decisions by the provision of a greater insight into the values on which decisions are made.

The influence of “Indulgence versus Restraint” on Ingroup Bias: A Dictator Game Experiment,"Hagemeijer, Sammie","['Fariña, A.']",2024,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Members of a group often show ingroup bias: the tendency to favor one’s own group. An important factor moderating ingroup bias is culture. Hofstede introduced several cultural dimensions, of which indulgence versus restraint (IVR) is one. There has already been extensive research on most of these dimensions and their influence on ingroup bias and prosocial behavior, but less is known about the influence of IVR on ingroup bias. Due to this research gap, this paper aims to answer the question whether the degree to which an individual is indulgent or restrained affects their ingroup bias. Students (N = 75) participated in a three-part experiment. First, a minimal group paradigm was created. Then, a dictator game was played. Finally, participants filled in a questionnaire measuring personal IVR score. A significant ingroup bias was found using a simple T-test. However, no correlation was found between IVR and ingroup bias after performing a simple linear regression. This suggests that the degree to which a person is indulgent or restrained does not have an influence on the person’s ingroup bias. However, the results are inconsistent with previous research, so more research needs to be conducted.","['Ingroup bias', 'Indulgence versus restraint', 'Dictator game']"

Vascular retinopathy, focal neurological deficits, cognitive deterioration, and several other systemic features are indicative of RVCL-S. Moreover, the disease is characterized by white matter hyperintensities, which could contribute to cognitive deterioration observed in RVCL-S patients. Especially the cognitive domains working memory and processing speed are impaired during neuropsychological assessment, even though the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Consequently, this thesis examined whether TREX1 mutation carriers (n = 23) perform cognitively poorer on working memory and processing speed tasks compared to healthy controls (n = 47). In addition, it has been examined whether white matter hyperintensities, according to the Fazekas scale, are predictive of cognitive functioning in TREX1 mutation carriers. Contrary to the pre-defined hypotheses, TREX1 mutation carriers did not perform significantly poorer on the Digit Span test, the Letter Span test, and the Trail Making Test-B, compared to the control group. It can therefore not be concluded that working memory and processing speed performance are affected in TREX1 mutation carriers. Future studies are advised to use more sensitive neuropsychological tests to detect subtle cognitive changes.","['RVCL-S, TREX1 gene, cognitive functioning, working memory, processing speed, white matter hyperintensities.']"

Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd in opdracht van pedagogisch bureau OOK, zodat ze een effectieve training voor mentoren kunnen (door)ontwikkelen. De sociaal-emotionele behoeften van leerlingen zijn uitgesplitst in drie basisbehoeften; competentie, autonomie en sociale verbondenheid. Deze basisbehoeften zijn gebaseerd op de Self-Determination Theory van Deci en Ryan (2000). De volgende deelvragen zijn onderzocht: “Welke sociaal-emotionele behoeften van leerlingen op het gebied van autonomie, sociale verbondenheid en competentie worden momenteel vervuld door de mentor?”, “Hebben leerlingen het meest behoefte aan mentor ondersteuning op het gebied van competentie, autonomie of sociale verbondenheid?”, “Verschilt de mate waarin leerlingen behoefte hebben aan ondersteuning van de mentor van de mate waarin zij hierin worden vervuld?” en “Verschillen leerlingen op basis van onderwijsniveau en profielachtergrond in de mate waarin zij voorzien worden en behoefte hebben aan autonomie, sociale verbondenheid en competentie?”. Aan het onderzoek hebben 66 eindexamenleerlingen van de havo en vwo deelgenomen. Voor de participanten was een minimale leeftijd van 16 jaar vereist. De onderzoekspopulatie bestond uit 17 mannen, 48 vrouwen en 1 ‘anders’. De verdeling van het niveau van de populatie bestond uit 29 havisten en 37 vwo’ers. Het vakkenprofiel dat wordt gevolgd door de betreffende respondenten is een natuurprofiel of een maatschappijprofiel. In de onderzoekspopulatie volgden 36 respondenten een natuurprofiel en 30 respondenten een maatschappijprofiel. De scholen zijn geworven binnen het netwerk van de onderzoekers en door scholen op het internet te zoeken en deze te benaderen, waarbij alle scholen binnen de provincie Zuid-Holland of Utrecht lagen. De vragenlijst is gebaseerd op de Mentor Evaluation Tool en de Work-Related Scale for Basic Need Satisfaction. In de vragenlijst zijn de drie basisbehoeften van de Self-Determination Theory - autonomie, competentie en sociale verbondenheid - uitgevraagd. Daarnaast zijn ook de achtergrondvariabelen gender, school, onderwijsniveau en profiel en school uitgevraagd. De eerste deelvraag liet zien dat leerlingen op dit moment gemiddeld het meest voorzien worden in autonomie door hun mentor en het minst in competentie en sociale verbondenheid. De tweede deelvraag liet zien dat leerlingen gemiddeld het meest behoefte hebben aan begeleiding bij competentie en autonomie en het minste behoefte hebben aan begeleiding bij sociale verbondenheid. Hieruit volgde dat er een verschil is in constructen tussen de behoefte van leerlingen en mate waarin zij hier huidig in worden vervuld. Er zijn tegen de verwachting in geen significante verschillen gevonden in behoeften van leerlingen van havo of vwo en leerlingen met een natuur- of maatschappijprofiel. Het advies is om als mentor meer aandacht te besteden aan de ondersteuning van eindexamenleerlingen in hun autonomie en competentie en in mindere mate in de onderlinge sociale verbondenheid. Het is belangrijk dat de leerlingen het gevoel hebben dat zij zelf de vrijheid hebben om keuzes te maken en dat zij genoeg zelfvertrouwen hebben om hun eindexamens te halen. Hier kan OOK aan bijdragen door deze handvatten in trainingen aan te bieden aan mentoren, waarbij met verschillende modules kan worden ingegaan op de ondersteuning in autonomie en competentie. Hoewel de meeste leerlingen aangeven dezelfde behoefte voor competentie en autonomie te hebben, zijn er ook mogelijk onderlinge verschillen. Het is daarom interessant om toekomstig onderzoek te richten op de persoonskenmerken van leerlingen, zodat er mogelijk uitspraken kunnen worden gedaan over specifieke behoeften van een eindexamenleerling.","['mentor', 'eindexamenleerlingen', 'sociaal-emotionele behoeften', 'middelbare school', 'competentie', 'autonomie', 'sociale verbondenheid', 'self-determination theory', 'psychologische basisbehoeften', 'profielkeuze', 'onderwijsniveau']"

In the subgroup with low perceived online behavioral control, we found a pattern of results in line with our reasoning, namely that participants who experience more FoMO tend to check their smartphone more often (non-significant). However, in the subgroup with high perceived online behavioral control, we found that participants who experience more FoMO tend to check their smartphones less often (non-significant), which is against our line of reasoning. Possible explanations for this finding are discussed. Also, participants who are engaged in more group chats report more academic stress. Hence, the practical importance of awareness about strategies to regulate incoming notifications is discussed.

Individuals with higher level of Machiavellianism tended to invest more resources to competition, relative to cooperation. No association was found between Machiavellianism and choosing peace in the economic game. Lastly, performance in the game could, also, not be predicted by one’s Machiavellian inclinations. We can conclude that, even when given the possibility to compete and cooperate at the same time, Machiavellians still tend to exhibit a higher propensity towards non-cooperative responses and a slightly higher propensity towards competitive behaviours compared to low Machiavellians.","['Machiavellianism, cooperation, competition, individual differences, economic game']"

Burnout and work engagement among emergency department nurses: Which work characteristics best separate the burnout – work engagement profiles?,"Maagdenberg, Else van den","['van der Doef, M.P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Emergency department (ED) nurses are prone to develop burnout, however, they also tend to be engaged in their work. The goals of this study were twofold: (1) to establish the frequency of ED nurses in four burnout - work engagement profiles, and (2) to investigate which work characteristics best separated the four burnout – work engagement profiles. Method. A cross-sectional study was done among 967 ED nurses working in one of 28 hospitals in the Netherlands (response rate 74%). The data was gathered using an online questionnaire. A frequency analysis and a descriptive discriminant analysis were performed. Two separate analyses were done for emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Results. For emotional exhaustion, the engaged profile was most prevalent among the ED nurses in this sample, followed by the burnout, unengaged and engaged-burnout profiles. For depersonalization, the engaged profile was also most prevalent, followed by the burnout, engaged-burnout and unengaged profiles. Two functions were generated by the descriptive discriminant analysis: (1) the Job Demands-Resources (JDR) function and (2) the mastery function. The JDR function separated the burnout from the engaged profile. When nurses scored high on job demands and low on job resources, they were more likely to be in the burnout profile, and vice versa for the engaged profile. Work-time demands and autonomy were primarily responsible for group separation for burnout overall. For emotional exhaustion staffing was also primarily important, whereas for depersonalization, educational and developmental possibilities and (financial) appreciation were also primarily important for group separation. The mastery function separated the engaged-burnout from the unengaged profile. When nurses had educational and developmental possibilities, and experienced a higher frequency of emotionally demanding and conflict/aggression situations, they were more likely to be in the engaged-burnout profile, and vice versa for the unengaged profile. Conclusion. This study provided insight in the interplay between burnout, work engagement, job demands and job resources. This study shows the importance to improve the ED working environment as many nurses are burned out, and showed that ED nurses can be burned out and engaged simultaneously. The findings support the Job Demands-Resources Model, and show that enhancing job demands and job resources is important to facilitate engaged ED nurses.","['Burnout', 'emotional exhaustion', 'depersonalization', 'work engagement', 'Job Demands-Resources (JDR) model', 'emergency department']"
Risk taking and alcohol use in young adults,"Bhairosingh, Cindy",['N. Blankenstein'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Young adulthood is the phase of life during which the most alcohol is consumed. This can have negative consequences and long-term effects. These effects might be explained by risk taking behaviour. The association between risk taking behaviour and alcohol use has already been studied. However, to our knowledge, the relationship between alcohol use and the different domains of risk taking (health/safety, recreational, ethical, social and financial risks) has not been studied. Understanding these different contexts is essential to develop targeted interventions on the relationship between alcohol use and the specific domains to reduce excessive risk behaviours and alcohol use. Therefore, this research studies the extent to which risk taking in different domains is associated with, and predicts, alcohol use in young adults from 18 to 25 years old. The different domains of risk taking are measured by the Domain-Specific Risk Taking questionnaire and alcohol use is measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. This study was conducted cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The cross-sectional part consisted of 89 participants and studies the extent to which there is an association between risk taking in different domains and alcohol use. It is hypothesised that young adults who take risks in different domains also consume more alcohol. From the results, it can be concluded that young adults who consume alcohol are more likely to take health/safety risks, but they are less likely to take social risks. The longitudinal part consisted of 35 participants and studies the extent to which risk taking in different domains predicts alcohol use two years later. It is hypothesised that risk taking in different domains predicts alcohol use two years later. However, results show that risk taking is not predictive of alcohol use two years later. This result could be due to the small sample size of this study. Given these conclusions, it is important to continue with the interventions on health/safety risks and alcohol use and to target new interventions on social risks and alcohol use. In the future, this study could be repeated in other countries with an Eastern culture or in countries with different legal drinking ages.","['""Risk taking\', \'alcohol use\', \'young adults\'']"
De Intergenerationele Relatie van PTSS tussen Ouders en Kinderen,"Vogels, Luca",['J.N.M. Maas'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"There is evidence to suggest that child post traumatic symptoms (PTSD) develop within the family system where psychopathology exist. Existing literature indicates that parent and child PTSD are associated with each other. The present study aimed to examine the relation between PTSD-symptoms from parents and PTSD-symptoms from their children and whether boys or girls would experience more PTSD-symptoms with a sample of Dutch families (N = 1017). Additionally, it was examined whether quality of life (QoL) would influence this relationship. Mothers, fathers and children completed a questionnaire on trauma symptoms. The same children did also complete a questionnaire on QoL. The PTSD-symptoms from parents and their children were significant related. Furthermore, was there no significant difference between boys or girls in experiencing PTSD-symptoms. The addition of QoL to the relation between PTSD-symptoms from parents and children did not generate a significant result either, the relation became not stronger or weaker. It is possible that there were no significant results due the fact that PTSD is a complex disorder. The relation between PTSD-symptoms from parents and their children is influenced by multiple factors and this may have an impact on the results. It would be beneficial if future research would examine these factors.","['intergenerational transmission, trauma, PTSD, Quality of Life']"

Pyrronisme: Een eeuwenoude zoektocht naar gemoedsrust,"Koorn, Marieke","['Berg, T.A. van den']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie wordt de relatie tussen het eeuwenoude Pyrronistisch Scepticisme en gemoedsrust onderzocht. Aan de hand van Sextus Empiricus worden we meegenomen in de zoektocht naar ataraxia. Ataraxia oftewel gemoedsrust, is een staat waarin men vrij is van zorgen en angsten. Volgens Sextus is het bereiken van gemoedsrust niet alleen een therapeutische vaardigheid, maar ook een manier van leven. Deze Pyrronistische manier van leven houdt in dat overtuigingen ten aanzien van non-evidente zaken worden opgeschort om zo gemoedsrust te bereiken. In dit onderzoek is onderzocht of de filosofie van het Pyrronisme ons kan helpen in ons dagelijks leven met onze angsten en stress. Om Pyrronisme te meten is er een vragenlijst opgesteld met non-evidente stellingen (NE-Q). Voor het meten van angst is de GAD-7 gebruikt en voor het meten van stress is de PSS gebruikt. De eerste hypothese was dat sterkere overtuigingen een negatieve relatie hebben met gemoedsrust. De tweede hypothese was dat de relatie tussen sterkere overtuigingen en gemoedsrust verzwakt wanneer men aan mindfulness doet. De hoofdrelatie was niet significant met zowel de GAD-7 als de PSS als afhankelijke variabele. Ook was de moderatieanalyse in beider gevallen niet significant. Wel bleek bij verdere visuele inspectie dat het doen van mindfulness leidde tot meer angst en stress, in tegenstelling tot wanneer men niet aan mindfulness deed. Dit onderzoek wijst uit dat de filosofische stroming van het Pyrronisme als psychotherapie niet toepasbaar is voor de behandeling van angsten en stress in de hedendaagse tijd. Ook kan geconcludeerd worden dat mindfulness de relatie tussen het hebben van sterkere overtuigingen en gemoedsrust niet beïnvloedt.","['Pyrronisme', 'Scepticisme', 'Ataraxia', 'Gemoedsrust', 'Sextus Empiricus']"
"Exploring the Relationship between Child Maltreatment, Somatic Symptoms, and PTSD Symptoms in Children and Adolescents: Differences in Individuals with a PTSD Diagnosis versus without a PTSD Diagnosis","Theologou, Thaleia","['Verboon, K.E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Previous studies have indicated a robust association between child maltreatment and a plethora of symptoms, such as somatic and PTSD symptoms. More specifically, sexual and emotional abuse are linked to a higher likelihood of experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, neglect and non-sexual abuse (emotional and physical abuse) have also been significantly associated with the re-experiencing and avoidance symptom clusters of PTSD. Objective: Subsequently, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between the different forms of child maltreatment, somatic, and PTSD symptoms; and to identify whether differences exist in individuals with a PTSD diagnosis versus those without a diagnosis. Methods: Data were collected from 237 participants (mean age 15.6 years, SD: 2.07) between February 2012 and April 2015. The participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Children’s Somatization Inventory (CSI-35), the Children’s Response to Trauma Inventory (CRTI), and the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI), at baseline. Partial correlation networks were estimated from the baseline measure to investigate the association between child maltreatment, somatic, and PTSD symptoms. Results: Overall, emotional abuse emerged as the most central node within the network. Out of the five forms of child maltreatment, emotional abuse formed the strongest associations with gastrointestinal symptoms, and the avoidance symptom cluster of PTSD, while sexual abuse formed the strongest association with non-gastrointestinal symptoms. Among individuals with and without a PTSD diagnosis, discrepancies were present in regard to the interrelationships of child maltreatment, somatic, and PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: Consequently, individuals who experience emotional abuse may also experience other forms of maltreatment, thus, mental health professionals need to take into consideration that multiple forms of maltreatment are often present, and implement personalized interventions based on the forms of child maltreatment and the associated symptoms.","['emotional abuse, child maltreatment, PTSD symptom clusters, gastrointestinal symptoms, non-gastrointestinal symptoms, network analysis']"
Associations between interpersonal emotional regulation and childhood trauma severity: Implications for Borderline Personality Disorder: Implications for Borderline Personality Disorder,"BOMPOTA, ASIMENIA Mrs",['ANNE KRAUSE'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Emotions mostly depend on the context in which they are experienced. Given how important emotions are for our social life and relationships, they need to be understood and adequately regulated. However, not all people can regulate their feeling appropriately. In more recent research, emotions have been studied within their social context and regarding the impact they have on interpersonal relationships. This study attempted to examine if one of the reasons why people cannot regulate their emotions in interpersonal contexts may depend on the severity of childhood trauma and if these associations may contribute to borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms. Methods: Data from N=196 participants were collected via an online survey where they completed questionnaires regarding traumatic childhood experiences, interpersonal emotion regulation techniques and a self-report regarding borderline personality disorder symptoms. Results: Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that there was a statistically significant correlation between childhood trauma severity and interpersonal emotion regulation, aligning with the first hypothesis. The associations with BPD symptoms were different for each interpersonal emotion regulation factor. Conclusion: The findings suggest that childhood trauma can have lasting effects on emotional regulation abilities in interpersonal contexts and contribute to the manifestation of BPD symptoms.","['associations, emotional regulation, childhood trauma, borderline personality disorder']"
Thinking About the Other Now and in the Future: The Relationship between Social Mindfulness and Environmental Concern at Individual Level,"Schols, Sam",['N.J. van Doesum'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In an era marked by escalating environmental challenges and the imperative to address climate change, this study explores the relationship between social mindfulness (SoMi) and environmental concern (EC) on an individual level. It builds on previous research that identified correlations between SoMi and EC at a country level. This study hypothesizes a positive relationship between SoMi and EC, examining this relationship across three facets: attitude, intention, and behavior. Additionally, it investigates the connection between SoMi and concern for future generations. This study consists of a lab study with (N = 108). The results indicate a significant association between SoMi and environmentally concerned intentions, suggesting the significance of promoting social mindfulness to enhance pro- environmental intentions. However, no significant relationship was found between SoMi and EC across the facets of attitude, behavior, or concern for future generations. These non- significant findings align with recent studies emphasizing differences in the relationship between SoMi and EC at country level and individual level. Practical implications of this study include the development of educational programs to promote social mindfulness and enhance pro-environmental intentions. The study highlights the complexities of bridging the gap between intention and behavior in environmental concern and the need for future research to address this challenge comprehensively.",
Are You Sick Enough? Investigating Presenteeism in Working Millennials,"Engström, Emilia",['Chris J.M. Verhoeven'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Presenteeism has negative consequences for both the individual and the employer, such as increased levels of stress and poorer psychological health. It can be found across countries and in various professions. Millennials will soon comprise the majority of the global workforce, however, this costly phenomenon is poorly understood in this population. The predictors and the reasoning behind opting for presenteeism in working millennials (n=192) were investigated in this study. Self-reports were used to measure presenteeism, neuroticism, optimism, and job satisfaction. Relationships between the variables were explored using partial correlations and hierarchical regression. The moderation pathway was examined using PROCESS macro. The results showed that job satisfaction was able to predict presenteeism regardless of the employee's age, level of education, and general health. Neuroticism and optimism shared significant negative associations with presenteeism but were unable to predict it. Optimism was also not found to moderate the relationship between job satisfaction and presenteeism. A qualitative exploration suggested that the most likely reason millennials opt for working while sick is not feeling sick enough or feeling able to work despite their illness. The findings of this study suggest that being satisfied with one’s job plays a more significant role in presenteeism, while personality characteristics such as optimism and neuroticism might not. Predictors of presenteeism should be further investigated in the millennial workforce. Finally, suitable interventions should be explored in order to decrease the negative effects of presenteeism.","['Presenteeism', 'sickness presenteeism', 'millennials', 'neuroticism', 'optimism', 'job satisfaction']"
Strategic Helping: Differences in Perceptions of Warmth and Hypocrisy of Non-profits and For-profits With Varying Motives,"Grijs, Tristan de",['Esther van Leeuwen'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"When an organisation offers help, the underlying motive can be strategic. In essence, the act of helping can not only benefit the recipient, but also the actor. How an observer judges the act of helping in terms of warmth and hypocrisy, when it is clear that it is strategic, can fluctuate. This study aimed to investigate what happens when observers were presented with both ambiguous and non-ambiguous motives for strategic helping, offered by both non-profit and for-profit organisations. An experiment was conducted (N = 265) where participants read a scenario with either ambiguous or non-ambiguous strategic help motives, offered to a fictitious population by the different organisations. As predicted, non-profits were judged as warmer than for-profits, and perceived warmth was negatively correlated with perceived hypocrisy. Participants did not rate non-profit organisations as less warm and more hypocritical than for-profit organisations when the strategic motive for helping was non- ambiguous and non-benign. These results contradict our expectations. Our findings showcase the power of moral licensing and how it can affect the evaluation of strategic help motives.","['strategic helping, warmth, hypocrisy, ambiguous motives, moral licensing']"

The second hypothesis was that inducing power leads to more willingness to contact compared to baseline (H2). Results showed that both conditions scored significantly higher on willingness to contact compared to the baseline condition. We explored if the combined condition leads to more willingness to contact compared to the reduced feeling trapped condition (Exploration analysis 1).

More specifically, the focus was on the Russian Federation and its two ethnic republics: Republic Sakha and the Republic of Chuvashia. The cases were picked to represent a wealthy and a poor region of Russia. The analysis was conducted through qualitative content analysis of primary sourced speeches and secondary sourced interpretations of speeches given by ethnic elites such as heads of the republic, other political figures, or important business elites. The analysis was organized into two periods of democratization 1997-2000 and autocratization 2008-2011, and 4 sub-periods: 1997-1998 and 2008-2009 (economic contraction periods), and 1999-2000 and 2010-2011 (economic growth periods). The results found that Sakha as the wealthier republic is generally more secessionist during periods of economic contraction during both democratization and autocratization. Support was also found for the expectation that ethnic elites will prove more secessionist during democratization periods.","['Ethnofederalism, Authoritarian regimes, Yakutia, Sakha, Chuvashia']"
The effect of asking questions in negotiations: open versus closed questions,"Varenkamp, Yasmin","['Steinel, W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Negotiations are important processes that can happen anywhere from an office to a private setting. Previous research has already stated that information exchange can help to come to a so called integrative agreement (win-win situation), which usually leads to better outcomes for both parties. However, there is still little known about the strategies to seek information. One way of seeking information is through asking either open or closed questions. Therefore, the current research investigates whether there is a difference between open and closed questions on negotiation outcomes. The prediction was that open questions generate a higher integrative agreement, higher subjective value and higher trust in the other party than closed questions. The experiment consisted of 48 duos who negotiated about organising a teamday. Both participants took on a role which was connected to a certain point distribution system. It has been found that, contradicting the predictions, there were no significant differences found between closed and open questions on integrative agreement, higher subjective value and higher level of trust. Certain experimental factors like the roleplay, time pressure and a participation lottery, could have influenced the results. Therefore, more research is needed on this topic to check if the results can be confirmed or rejected.",

We asked 163 victims about their experiences through an online survey on Qualtrics. The independent sample t test showed that victims of workspace bullying who didn’t get help felt a stronger sense of not fitting in the group and a stronger sense of their life lacking purpose. Whether they got help or not didn't change how much they felt it was their own fault, how much they were feeling down and their need to have control over the situation and need to feel good about oneself.

Maladaptive Eating Behavior in Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder: How social factors can impact eating patterns,"German, Marie",['Dr. Annegret Krause- Utz'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The intricate interplay of social factors (loneliness, the need to belong, social connectiveness), and maladaptive eating patterns is still not entirely understood. Reduced social connectiveness may contribute to a greater prevalence of maladaptive eating patterns, especially in individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The current study aimed to explore these associations. Methods: In the current study N=62 women with BPD and N=47 healthy women completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the Need to Belong Scale, the revised Social Connectedness scale, and supplemental items of the Borderline Symptom List 23. Linear regression, group comparisons, and moderation analyses were performed to test within- and between-group associations. Results: The results revealed a significant positive association between loneliness as well as need to belong and maladaptive eating patterns. Conversely, a significant negative relationship emerged between social connectiveness and maladaptive eating patterns. Patients with BPD reported more loneliness, need to belong, and more maladaptive eating, while experiencing less social connectedness. At the same time, these associations were not significantly stronger in the BPD group than in the healthy group. Conclusion: These findings underscore that, in the whole group, experiences of loneliness, a heightened need to belong, and lower social connectiveness are linked to increased instances of maladaptive eating patterns. While social factors play a significant role in maladaptive eating patterns, the presence of BPD may not substantially alter these associations. More research including larger samples and prospective studies are needed in order to further clarify and understand the role of BPD in this context.","['Borderline Personality Disorder, Maladaptive Eating Pattern, Loneliness, Social Connectiveness, Need to Belong']"
De samenhang tussen traumasymptomen van moeders en de leeftijd waarop zij hun eerste kind kregen op het externaliserende probleemgedrag van hun kinderen in een post-huiselijk geweld context,"Veldhuis, Iris",['Mitch van Geel'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"This research focused on women and their children who have recently moved in to a women’s shelter after experiencing domestic violence. Women who have suffered domestic violence have a high chance of developing trauma-related symptoms, which can affect their mental health and parenting skills. Often, these women’s children are at risk of developing externalizing behaviour, which can lead to violent and criminal behaviour in the future. This research aimed to study the relationship between trauma-related symptoms in mothers and externalizing behaviour of their children. The age at which mothers had their first child was used as a moderator. Data was collected within the research project Samen Stap Voor Stap Vooruit, by visiting women in their shelter. There were three visits per participant, each consisting of a set of questionnaires being taken and video recordings being made of the interaction between mother and child. Data from questionnaires of the first visit were used for this paper. After performing regression analyses with trauma-related symptoms and age of first becoming a mother as independent variables and children’s externalizing behaviour as dependent variable, no relation was found between these variables for the total model. However, there was a positive relation between the age at which a mother had her first child and the externalizing behaviour of the participating child. Children of mothers who were older at first conception were more likely to score higher on externalizing behaviour. The idea of social timing can possibly explain this, with older mothers perhaps having a smaller social safety net, more health issues, less energy, or having stayed longer in the abusive relationship. Further research about the possible relation between being a relatively older mother and externalizing problems in the children is encouraged, as current literature about this topic is slim.","['trauma', 'externaliserend probleemgedrag', 'huiselijk geweld', 'traumasymptomen']"

The Moderating Effect of Peer Victimization on the Relationship between the Quality of Parent-Child Relationship and Emotion Regulation Strategies in Adolescents,"Koutantou, Rafailia Maria","['Schreuders, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Several studies have revealed that parents play a crucial role in shaping their children’s early emotional development and regulation. However, research on emotion regulation in adolescents and how peer victimization experiences affect it have been scarce on that field. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate if the effect of parent-child relationship quality on emotion regulation strategies was different in different levels of peer victimization exposure. A total of 87 students from two secondary Dutch schools, aged between 13-16 years old, participated in the study. Data about their peer victimization history, tendencies to regulate their emotions and the way they assessed their relationship with their primary caregivers were collected through self-report measures. The findings revealed that peer victimization effectively moderated the relationship between negative parent-child relationship quality and expressive suppression. Specifically, the effect of negative parent-child relationship quality on expressive suppression use was stronger for adolescents who experienced lower levels of peer victimization. A main effect of positive relationship quality on habitual use of cognitive reappraisal was also recognized. These results suggest that in general parent child relationship quality plays a significant role in the regulation of emotions in middle adolescence, whether peer victimization is involved or not. The limitations of the current study highlighted the need for further investigation with a longitudinal study design and heterogenous sample to examine how emotion regulation strategies and parent-child relationship are affected across the developmental period of adolescence and across different ethnicities.","['Cognitive reappraisal', 'Expressive suppression', 'parent-child relationship', 'peer victimization']"
To Accept Help or Embrace Autonomy? How The Need For Autonomy and Emotions Shape Coping With Financial Scarcity in Young Adults,"Koster, Selomi","['van der Weiden, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Financial scarcity is known to negatively affect well-being of young adults, leading to heightened stress and uncertainty about their financial future. Despite the availability of numerous debt relief and financial counselling programs, too little use is being made of this offered assistance. The reluctance to accept help may be influenced by a strong desire for autonomy. This study aimed to assess the association between the implicit need for autonomy and the willingness to accept help in young adults experiencing financial scarcity. Participants completed a survey that included a modernized Picture Story Exercise and a self-report questionnaire on help acceptance. Results from a multivariate regression analysis gave a marginally significant result showing that a higher implicit need for autonomy was associated with a slightly higher likelihood of help acceptance behavior, and with a more negative emotional attitude towards accepting help. Exploratory analyses highlighted that negative feelings about financial debt were a stronger predictor of help acceptance. These results underscore the importance of considering autonomy and debt-related feelings in improving interventions for young adults facing financial scarcity.","['Financial Scarcity', 'Young Adults', 'Need For Autonomy', 'Negative Feelings About Financial Debt', 'Help Acceptance']"

Disordered Eating – What Role do Hormonal Contraception and Self-Esteem Play?,"Beyer, Paula","['Proppert, R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Disordered eating is a predictor of clinical eating disorders, which have an increasing prevalence nowadays. Thus, it is important to understand risk and protective factors for the prevention of disordered eating. It has been shown that sex hormones affect eating behaviour, but research on how eating behaviour may be affected by hormonal contraceptives is scarce. However, self-esteem has been shown to be one of the main predictors or disordered eating in several studies. The association between hormonal contraception and self-esteem is less understood. The hypothesis of the study is that hormonal contraception is positively related to disordered eating and possibly mediated/moderated by self-esteem. To test this, a sample of 760 female participants filled out the Rosenberg Self-Esteem questionnaire, SCOFF and answered questions regarding their contraceptive use. A mediation analysis found out that there is no direct relationship, but a mediated one. In a moderation analysis a significant interaction between hormonal contraception and self-esteem has been found. This suggests that people taking hormonal contraceptives and having lower levels of self-esteem are potentially at a higher risk of developing disordered eating. Future research should focus on examining the different types of hormonal contraceptives and exogenous sex hormones, since this study was not able to make a differentiation.","['hormonal contraception, disordered eating, self-esteem, moderation, mediation']"
How does financial scarcity affect financial risk-taking,"Conde, Sofia",['Dr. Wilco van Dijk'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Poverty in the UK has increased, particularly after the Covid-19 pandemic. To prevent people from falling into a poverty trap, it is important to understand how financial scarcity affects financial decisions involving risks. This topic lacks consensus in the literature with some authors arguing for a tendency towards more risk-taking, while others arguing for more risk aversion. This study posits that the risk tendency is influenced by frames of gains and losses. More specifically, financial scarcity leads to more risky choices in the domain of losses (H1), whereas it leads to less risky choices in the domain of gains (H2). People in financial scarcity tend to experience negative affect that impacts their cognitive systems, leading to more reliance on System 1 thinking, which exacerbates biases, such as the reflection effect. To test the hypotheses an online survey was conducted and 200 participants from the UK were recruited via Prolific Academic. The participants were divided into two groups for the manipulation of financial scarcity using the household task. Half of the participants were in the debts condition (financial scarcity), whereas the other half were not (control). Subsequently, all participants were presented with six risky choices, where they had to choose one of two options (one risky, the other conservative) framed in both gains and losses and three combinations of probabilities. Results from a Generalized Mixed Model showed that the cognitive bias associated with the reflection effect was found to be equally present in everyone and was more pronounced for more extreme probabilities (e.g., 10%/90% and 20%/80%), but not for moderate probabilities (e.g., 40%/60%). Thus, the expected interaction between debts and frames was not confirmed. It is suggested that future studies use an intuitive decision-making manipulation with more extreme probabilities (e.g., 1%/99%), consider a field risk manipulation, an incentivized lottery and the same expected value within and between probabilities at the lottery.","['Financial Scarcity', 'Household task', 'Risky decision-making', 'Reflection effect', 'Magnitude of outcomes']"
Assessment of need-for-care levels for patients with common mental disorders: correspondence between clinical judgement and the HoNOS+,"Moerkerk, Anne van",['Prof. dr. E. (Edwin) de Beurs'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: With the introduction of the Care Product Model (in Dutch the Zorg Prestatie Model), the Dutch mental health sector has adopted the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales+ (HoNOS+) for determining the so-called care demand type (in Dutch ZorgVraagTypering). This care demand type is intended to reflect the care a patient requires at the time of admission. The final care demand type is determined by the clinical practitioner’s judgement. To date, limited research has been conducted on the accuracy of the HoNOS+ and its contribution to mental health care optimisation. The current study examined whether the care demand type assigned according to the HoNOS+ aligns with the care demand type assigned by the clinical practitioner. Additionally, the study explored features of discrepant cases and whether the Outcome Questionnaire-Symptomatic Distress subscale (OQ-SD) could enhance the predictive value of the HoNOS+ for the clinical judgement. Method: For this study, data was collected at PuntP, a clinic for clients with common mental disorders. For each participant a HoNOS+ score and a clinical evaluation of the care demand type was available. For the majority of cases, also an OQ-SD score had been obtained. Results: The main findings indicated a high agreement between the HoNOS+ recommendation and the clinical practitioner’s decision of the care demand type. An exploratory analysis revealed no factors that were related to discrepancy between the HoNOS+ recommendation and the clinical judgement. Adding the OQ-SD has provided additional predictive value over the HoNOS+. Discussion: Although, the results on this study are promising about the use of the HoNOS+ in Dutch mental health care, there are a number of limitations to consider. The value or validity of the Care Demand Type in the Dutch Care Product Model is mainly determined by how accurately it predicts the care that is actually provided. Further and more extensive research is needed on whether the Care Demand Type also corresponds to the care provided.",
Het effect van ouderlijk competentie gevoel en voortekenen van agressie op ontwikkeling van agressief gedrag,"Grijn, Maisy","['Huijbregts, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Aim. The aim of this research was to contribute to the necessary knowledge for preventive action in reducing the development of aggressive behavior. Currently, many trainings and interventions focus on dealing with aggressive behavior reactively. The literature discusses the origin of aggressive behavior and how it can be influenced by both biological and environmental factors. Increased insight into these factors might also allow for more preventive action. However, little is known about the risk factors that can influence the development of aggressive behavior, even though this knowledge is crucial for recognizing these signs and taking. Design. The data for this quantitative study comes from the Mother-Infant Neurodevelopment Study (MINDS). For the current study, 253 mother-child pairs participated. The participants completed several questionnaires for this study: the Cardiff Infant Contentiousness Scale (CICS), the Self-efficacy in the Nurturing Role Scale (SENR), and the Physical Aggression Scale for Early Childhood (PASEC). The questionnaires were about the precursors of aggressive behavior in the child, the mother's sense of parental competence, and the expression of aggressive behavior. Findings. To examine these factors, a multiple regression with interaction effects was conducted. Both the interaction effect and the individual factors were analyzed. It was found that there is no significant interaction effect. However, both the early signs of aggression and the sense of parental competence proved to be significant predictors separately for the development of aggressive behavior in the child. This suggests that if a child exhibits more early signs of aggressive behavior at a younger age (6 months old), the child is more likely to develop aggressive behavior at a later age (12 months). Additionally, this means that if a mother experiences a lower sense of parental competence when the child is younger (6 months old), it can also be a predictor for the development of aggressive behavior in the child. Conclusion. This study confirms that there are already risk factors visible at a young age that increase the likelihood of developing aggressive behavior. For this reason, it is essential to conduct more research on additional possible risk factors and how professionals in practice can identify these factors. Subsequently, interventions for these risk factors can also be explored to take preventive action in combating the development of aggressive behavior","['Agressie', 'Agression', 'Early signs of agression', 'Voortekenen van agressief gedrag', 'Sence of parental competence', 'Gevoel van ouderlijke competentie']"

The dynamics were investigated using an online platform involving 120 British participants. Surprisingly, it turned out that shame did not have a significant effect on the behaviour of participants. Moreover, the people in the financial scarcity condition tended to disclaim more about their economic situation than those in the financial abundance condition. Thus, peer relationships could be an assistance avenue or source of emotional relief for them. The study emphasises the complexity of people's financial journeys and suggests that the role of social support networks might help ease the pressure. Future research can explore the mechanisms through which identity signalling serves as a coping strategy in times of financial scarcity and how peer support can be harnessed to address economic challenges.","['financial scarcity, identity signalling, shame, social support, coping strategies']"
Intolerance of Uncertainty and Social Anxiety: The Possible Mediating Effect of Coping,"Peelen, Dayenne","['Ma, I.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a prevalent disorder in adolescents. It manifests itself in avoidance of social situations, difficulties forming relationships and an overall increased impairment in social functioning. In adulthood, individuals with SAD report an overall poorer quality of life. Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and coping strategies have been associated with SAD in recent literature. However, information on this subject is scarce in adolescents. This study investigates the relationship between IU and traits of social anxiety (SA) in adolescents, incorporating age as a moderating variable and adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies as a mediating variable. Data on SA traits, IU and coping strategies was collected within a larger study from a non-clinical sample using questionnaires. This study included 233 participants (Mage = 18.6, SD = 3.3) of which 81% were female. Results of this study show a positive relationship between IU and SA traits. This positive relationship weakens with age during adolescence. Additionally, maladaptive coping strategies mediate the relationship between SA and IU, strengthening this relationship. These findings indicate IU, age and coping are important factors to be considered in relation to the development and maintenance of SAD. Future research should continue on this subject to provide additional practical implications for the prevention and treatment of SAD","['Social Anxiety', 'Intolerance of Uncertainty', 'Coping', 'Adaptive Coping', 'Maladaptive Coping']"

"Investigating the relationship between Major Depressive Disorder, aggression and inflammation in adolescents: a cross-sectional study","Bauman, Sandy","['Tollenaar, M.S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Previous research in blood plasma has revealed a potential relationship between depression and the immune system. A similar relationship between aggressive behavior and the immune system suggests that the three phenomena are interconnected in some way. To date, this interaction has not been researched in adolescents. The current study investigates the relationship between adolescent depression and immune markers (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and CRP), and examines aggressive behavior as a potential moderator in this relationship. Immune markers were measured in salivary samples, contributing to the incorporation of a novel, non- invasive way to assess inflammation in mental health research. Methods: A total of 114 adolescents with and without clinically diagnosed depression were included in the present study (32 depressed, 76 healthy controls; 32.4% males; mean age 15.91 years old, ranging from 12-18). Participants provided 2ml saliva via passive drool, in which IL6, IL-1β and TNF-α were analyzed with the Luminex Human Discovery Assay (Bio-Techne), and CRP was analyzed with an ELISA Kit Generation II (Salimetrics). Parents of the participating adolescents filled in the Child Behavior Checklist-questionnaire on aggressive behavior. Results: In an analysis of covariance no significant associations were found between depression and levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and CRP. In addition, no significant moderating effects of aggressive behavior on this relationship were found. Conclusion: Despite earlier evidence nudging towards a relationship between depression and the immune system, this study has not obtained similar results. Future studies on the matter are warranted, preferably with simultaneous advancement of salivary measurement technologies.",

Welke rol spelen depressieve symptomen en emotieregulatie van moeders in de empathieontwikkeling van hun kind?,"Bootsma, Renée",['Stephan Huijbregts'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Introduction. Maternal depression is one of the most common mental disorders in The Netherlands. In earlier research, an association was found between maternal depression and disturbed development of empathy in their children. The main goal of this thesis is to examine the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and emotion regulation in mothers and infant empathy precursors. Methods. The current study is part of the longitudinal study 'Een Goed Begin’ by Leiden University. The sample consisted of 151 mother-child dyads, the mothers age varied between 17 and 27 years (M = 22.66 years, SD = 2.209). At 20 months post-partum, depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1996). Emotion regulation was measured with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (Gratz & Roemer, 2004). (Precursors of) empathy in children was measured by the Pain Task (Young et al., 1999; Zahn-Waxler et al., 1992) at 30 months. Results. A significant, positive correlation between emotion regulation and depressive symptoms was found, as expected. There is no main effect of maternal depressive symptoms on precursors of empathy, as well as no main effect of maternal emotion regulation on empathy and no interaction effect between the three variables. Conclusion. The results of this study suggest a significant and positive correlation between depression and empathy, where more symptoms of depression correlated with more empathy, contrary to what was expected. In addition, a trend is found between depression and empathy. Therefore, more research regarding this topic is recommended. Improving the understanding of this relationship can lead to the development of a risk profile when mothers suffer from depressive symptoms and targeted interventions for empathy development.","['Maternal depression, emotion regulation, (precursors of) empathy.']"

Until today, little research has been done on the negative physical effects that the use of VR can cause in children aged 8-12 years. The aim of the research reported in this paper is to determine whether the use of VR causes negative physical symptoms in children and to what extent gender, level of fun of the VR task and degree of media use are influencing factors regarding such symptoms. In this study, 64 children aged 8-12 years participated. Before and after playing a short VR game, the children completed a questionnaire (CSSQ) measuring cybersickness symptoms. The results showed that children suffered some degree of cybersickness symptoms after playing a short VR game. Nevertheless, the number of children in the study suffering from cybersickness was very small. The factors of gender, degree of media use and level of fun of the VR game did not seem to influence the development of cybersickness symptoms. In follow-up studies, larger subgroups could be examined to determine more accurately at what age cybersickness symptoms are most prevalent.","['vritual reality', 'cybersickness', 'children']"

TAKING RISKS OR TAKING CARE? Evaluating the Moderating Role of Power Construal on the Direct and Indirect Mediation Effects of a Sense of Power and Financial Risk-Taking Propensity Among Power Holders.,"Schaaff, Tijmen van der",['Prof.Dr. D.T. Scheepers'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This research explores why individuals in positions of relative (social) power over subordinates sometimes exhibit greater financial risk-taking propensity due to this power. This research proposes that a sense of power makes power holders more optimistic and perceive lesser financial risks associated with their actions, driving greater financial risk-taking propensity in investment decision-making scenarios. An experimental survey study was conducted with managers to test these predictions. Power holders who experienced a greater sense of power were more optimistic and perceived fewer financial risks associated with their decisions and actions, stimulating financial risk-taking propensity in financial investment scenarios. The findings suggest that financial risk-taking propensity exhibited by power holders arises from inflated financial optimism and consequent diminished financial risk perceptions. Encouraging power holders who occupy positions of relative (social) power over others to focus on their responsibilities could suppress the inflated propensity to take financial risks with potentially harmful consequences for others. Hence, this research sheds light on the psychology behind financial risk-taking among those in power.","['Power Construal', 'Sense of Power', 'Financial Risk-Taking Propensity', 'Financial Optimism', 'Financial Risk-Perception', 'Power Holders']"
"Measuring (dis)honesty in social interactions with humans, robots and avatars using a coin-toss task","Jansen, Dune",['Fabiola Diana'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"While honesty itself is a widely researched topic, most research has been done on human-human interactions. This laid the foundation for many similar studies and a rapidly expanding literature on honesty for human-avatar and human-robot interaction studies. This experiment builds on such research. In the current study, we intended to determine how much (dis)honest behavior participants would display during a coin-toss game with three agents: a robot, an avatar, and a human confederate. In all three conditions, the agents’ pupil size had been manipulated to be either dilated or constricted form. There were three blocks, with 18 trials each. The trials were counterbalanced. We hypothesized that the participants would be more honest with the agents with dilated pupils compared to constricted pupils, as previous studies have shown that people with dilated pupils are perceived more positively. Additionally, we hypothesized that overall, the participants would show more honest behavior when interacting with the confederate because human-to-human contact is familiar and not (yet) comparable to human-AI (Artificial Intelligence) contact. Curiously, results show that our first hypothesis is not met, as pupil size did not have a significant effect (p = .171). Our second hypothesis is partly met as there was a significant difference between the human condition and robot condition (p = .007), but not between human condition and avatar condition.","['Social-interaction, human-robot interaction, human-avatar interaction, human-human interaction,']"
Can People Distinguish Between Abstract Expressionist Art Made by Apes and Untrained Humans? A Comparative Study,"Blaauwen, Tijmen den","['Perea García, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Can people distinguish between abstract expressionist art made by humans and apes? Previous research indicates that people can distinguish between abstract expressionist art made by professionals and children/animals (Hawley-Dolan et al., 2011; Snapper et al., 2015).These studies suggest that people see more intention and organization in paintings made by professional human artists. However, based on these studies, it remains unclear whether these properties are exclusive to professional paintings, or extend to all human paintings. Here we explored whether the properties found in professional paintings can also be found in nonprofessional human paintings. In study 1, 72 participants were presented with sets of 10 human and 10 non-human paintings, and tasked with identifying the artist. Study 2 involved 102 participtans rating these paintings on several characteristics: intentionality, organization, balance and complexity. In line with our expectations participants: (1) successfully distinguished between human and non-human paintings, even after controlling for differences in artistic materials (2) perceived more organization, balance and intentionality in human paintings, (3) were affected by artist labels. Intriguingly, upon controlling for saturation and texture variations, we infer that some perceived perceptual differences between human and non-human artist paintings may be attributed to material differences. The results of this study indicate that paintings made by untrained human artists are anything but random, and highlight the importance of details in abstract expressionism.","['Abstract Expressionism, Intentionality, Ape Art, Art Perception, Low-level properties']"

Unveiling the Depths: Understanding Suicidal Ideation from a Psychoanalytic Perspective: Analysing defensive categories in relation to scores of suicidal ideation amongst university students,"Kuyper, Eva",['Ronald Bahamondes Alvarez'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Suicide is a pressing, global concern, with a growing number of adolescents affected. Present research tends to focus on external factors, for example, stressful life events. Internal factors, like defence mechanisms, remain understudied. This investigation aimed to explore variations between categories of defense mechanisms used by university students in the Netherlands, with respect to their suicidal ideation scores. A total of 115 participants engaged in the cross-sectional research design. The questionnaires used were the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS) and Defence Mechanisms Rating Scale-Self Report-30 Items (DMRS-SR-30). To assess these variations, a one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni Correction was applied. The expectation was differences being present between used defensive categories, regarding varying scores of suicidal ideation. Gender was acknowledged as a potential influential factor. Significant differences were found within Category 1: Mature and Category 2: Neurotic in relation to the SIDAS scores (p < 0.001, p = 0.002), indicating differing scores of suicidal ideation within these groups. Category 3: Immature, as well as the subgroups Non-Depressive and Depressive, did not exhibit any significant variations within the SIDAS scores (p = 0.341, p = 0.882, p = 0.406), suggesting lack of differences in suicidal ideation scores among individuals in these categories. Gender was found to play a role in the association between suicidal ideation scores and each defensive category (all p < 0.05). The analysis revealed variations within the categories, due to the unavailability of finding the differences between them. Consequently, although the research question and hypothesis were not entirely validated, valuable information and findings were obtained pertaining to this subject. Implications of this research regard both practical aspects, such as new prevention strategies being designed, and theoretical factors, including further comprehension on psychological mechanisms of defence.","['suicidal ideation, defence mechanisms, defence categories, adolescents, psychoanalysis']"

Self-Efficacy and Depression: the Possible Mediating Role of Behavioral Emotion Regulation Strategies,"Lagunaviciute, Luka",['Carlotta Rieble'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Depression prevalence is increasing worldwide, especially among young people. Alarmingly, the majority of individuals are likely to suffer from recurring episodes of depression. With treatment developments lagging behind, there is an increasing need for preventing depression from an early age by investigating protective factors. Specifically, the thesis aimed to examine how behavioral emotion regulation (ER) strategies might mediate the association between self-efficacy (SE) and depression severity over four months. Additionally, the yearly stability of behavioral ER use was investigated. The sample comprised 738 participants, (Mage = 22.56, SD = 3.88), 80.6% were female. Of these, 298 individuals completed a yearly follow-up. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess SE, behavioral ER and depression severity at baseline. Depression was reassessed after four months. A multiple mediation analysis revealed that behavioral ER strategies did not mediate the relationship between SE and depression severity over time. With the exception of ignoring, no behavioral ER strategies were significantly associated with depression over time. Higher baseline SE at baseline was linked to the use of more helpful ER strategies and lower depression severity four months later. The additional analysis demonstrated stability in using some behavioral ER strategies over 1 year. The findings emphasize SE as a relevant protective factor in depression. Future research should explore additional factors and employ longitudinal designs to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay among SE and behavioral ER in buffering against depression.","['Self-efficacy, behavioral emotion regulation, depression, prevention']"

Shyness is a personality trait known to influence the memory and testimony of adult witnesses. However, the influence of shyness on testimonies has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the case of underage witnesses. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent shyness of children is related to level of detail and accuracy of their statement during interrogation and whether these variables differed based on the type of recall during the interrogation. The sample consisted of eight to eleven year old children (mean age = 9.91 years, SD = 1.221). First, the children participated in a standardized online yoga lesson. A week later, the children participated in an online interview to talk about the yoga lesson. These interviews were transcribed and coded for level of detail and accuracy. The Emotionality, Activity, and Sociability Temperament Survey for Children (EAS), filled out by one of the parents, was used to measure the children’s shyness. Both Pearson correlations and repeated measures ANOVAs showed no significant relations between shyness and the level of detail and accuracy of children’s statements during an interrogation. No differences on the relations between shyness and the level of detail and accuracy were found between free recall versus cued recall. This suggests that shyness might not be the best predictor of the level of detail and accuracy of children’s statements and that shy children may be equally good witnesses as non-shy children. However, the sample in this study was too small (n = 11) to draw a firm conclusion and a replication study with a larger sample is necessary.","['kindverhoren', 'verlegenheid', 'verhoren', 'kinderen', 'getuigen']"
The Impact of Learning about Children’s Internalizing and Externalizing Behaviors on Young Adults’ Facial Mimicry to Children’s Sad Displays: The Roles of Implicit Gender Bias and Time Spent Caring for Children: Impact of Learning about Children's Behaviors on Adults' Facial Mimicry,"Namer, Laura Mélisse","['Biro, S.', 'Bos, P.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Children are known to rely on others’ facial expressions to guide their behavior and to use their own affective state to elicit desired reactions. Recent facial mimicry literature argues that automatic imitation of others’ emotional expressions can be altered based on social motivations. The present study aimed to explore the impact of learning about children’s internalizing and externalizing behaviors on young adults’ facial mimicry to children’s sad dynamic displays. Potential moderations of implicit gender bias and time spent with children were also investigated. Our final sample included 25 young adults (80% females) between the ages of 18 and 30. Participants’ frowning responses to primary-school aged children’s video displays of sad facial expressions were measured via facial electromyography (fEMG). Using a within-subject design, facial mimicry was assessed before and after learning about children’s behaviors. Participants additionally estimated a total weekly hours they spend with children and completed an adapted Implicit Association Task (IAT) measuring their implicit gender bias towards children’s behaviors. Results did not reveal any significant change in young adults’ facial responses after learning about children’s behaviors, suggesting that internalizing behaviors did not elicit increased mimicry compared to externalizing behaviors and baseline. An interaction of participants’ implicit gender bias was found with behavior and time (p = .04). Adults with greater positive bias tended to mimic internalizing children more than externalizing children. Lastly, no moderation of time spent with children was found, which might be a result of a lack of variability in the sample. The present study tentatively points towards a moderation of implicit gender bias on adults’ affiliative motivations. Prevention and intervention programs may be needed to increase caregivers and teachers’ sensitivity and responsivity to high risk children’s emotional expressions.","['Facial mimicry', 'facial electromyography', 'implicit gender bias', 'internalizing and externalizing behaviors', ""children's sad facial expressions""]"

This study aims to describe behavioural aspects, cognition, and epilepsy course and identify predictors for Quality of Life (QoL) in adolescents and adults two to ten years after achieving remission from epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep (EE-SWAS). Background. Children with EE-SWAS, a childhood epilepsy syndrome, often experience neurodevelopmental arrest or regression, which consists of a heterogeneous combination of behavioural and cognitive deficits. Three-quarters of the patients in EE-SWAS remission have permanent deficits. Long-term follow-up studies are scarce but suggest a relation between the aetiology, EE-SWAS duration, and use of corticosteroid treatment with neurodevelopmental outcome of patients in remission. Design. This study utilised a cross-sectional observational design with questionnaires and retrospective data collection. Methods. Parents or caregivers of patients digitally filled out the Epilepsy Questionnaire and the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire-55 (QOLCE-55). Results. A total of 35 adolescents and adults with a mean age of 18.2 (SD±3.76) years were included in the statistical analysis. The participants consisted of 18 male and 17 female adolescents and adults who were in ≥ 2 years in EE-SWAS remission. An established aetiology occurred in 19 participants, the median EE-SWAS duration was 4.3 (IQR 2.0-7.0) years, and 13 participants received corticosteroid treatment. The mean QOLCE-55 score for the sample size was 50.0 (SD±16.97). A significant difference of 10.3 points between the means of the QOLCE-55 score of patients with an established (M=45.3, SD±16.20) and an unknown (M=55.6, SD±16.65) aetiology has been found (t=1.841, df=33, p=.038). No difference was found in the QOLCE-55 means between patients with and without corticosteroid treatment (t=0.831, df=33, p=.226). Moreover, no correlation was found between the EE-SWAS duration and QOLCE-55 scores (ρ= -.298, p=.052 (n=31). No statically significant predictors of the QOLCE-55 scores were found in the multivariate regression analysis with an established aetiology (B=-4.5, p=.430), duration (B=-0.1, p=.108), and corticosteroid treatment (B=3.2, p=.595). Conclusions. Although no statistically significant predictors of QoL in EE-SWAS remission in adolescents and adults were found, an established aetiology and longer duration of EE-SWAS showed a potential trend as predictors of a poorer QoL. The study’s findings confirm the presence of cognitive deficits experienced in EE-SWAS remission, aligning with previous literature.","['EE-SWAS', 'Quality of Life', 'aetiology', 'duration', 'corticosteroids.']"

Participants completed self-report questionnaires to measure their self-concept clarity and level of social-evaluative anxiety. To measure body dissatisfaction, participants undertook an fMRI task measuring physical self- concept and completed the physical domain of the Competence Experience Scale for Adolescents (CBSA). A correlational analysis revealed that low self-concept clarity is related to higher body dissatisfaction, regardless of gender. The relationship was found to be partially mediated by social-evaluative anxiety. Gender comparisons did not reveal any significant gender differences. Findings suggest that targeting low self-concept clarity as well as social-evaluative anxiety might be an important part of interventions aiming to reduce body dissatisfaction among adolescents. In addition, the results underline the necessity to equally include both genders in future research and potential interventions.","['social-evaluative anxiety', 'self-concept', 'self-concept clarity', 'adolescents', 'body dissatisfaction', 'body image', 'fear of negative evaluation']"

Previous research has shown that child maltreatment not only can affect direct victims but also the children of parents who have experienced maltreatment. This study examines the relationship between mother’s experienced child maltreatment and their children’s behavioral problems, and investigates whether this relationship is moderated by maternal psychopathology. Based on previous research, it was hypothesized that a positive relationship would exist and that this relationship would be stronger for mothers with more psychopathology. The study focuses on mothers and their children residing in Dutch women’s shelters following domestic violence by the mother’s (ex-)partner. A sample of 29 mother-child dyads was recruited with the average age of mothers being 31.6 years (SD = 6.2 years) and of children being 3.2 years (SD = 1.5 years). The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) was used to measure mother’s experiences of child maltreatment in their childhood, with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) children’s behavioral problems were evaluated and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) was used to assess maternal psychopathology. The results indicated no significant main effect of mother’s experienced child maltreatment on children’s behavioral problems, and no significant moderation effect of maternal psychopathology on this relationship. However, significant main effects were found for mother’s experienced child maltreatment on maternal psychopathology and for maternal psychopathology on children’s behavioral problems, suggesting a potential mediation effect. Possible explanations for not finding the expected main effect and moderation are a low statistical power due to the small sample size and resilience. Therefore, replication studies are warranted. This study enhances the understanding of the complex interplay between child maltreatment, maternal psychopathology, and children’s behavioral outcomes, emphasizing the need for systemic interventions.","['child maltreatment, child behavioral problems, psychopathology']"
Online guided self-help Binge Eating Disorder treatment: Prognostic factors of treatment outcome,"Kasmi, Taninna","['Beurs, E. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Relatively little research has assessed predictors of both treatment outcomes and attrition in binge eating disorder (BED) treatment. Even fewer studies did so for digital forms of therapy. This study thus aims to contribute to the current pool of knowledge by examining the predictive value of various variables in a recently developed digital BED-treatment: BED-online. Methods: This study was part of a RCT into the effects of BED-online therapy. Participants were over the age of 18, Dutch-speaking and diagnosed with the DSM-V BED. A total of 180 participants were found to be eligible, of whom 40 (22.2%) dropped-out before the last session. Post-treatment measurements from an interview (EDE) and a self-report questionnaire (EDE-Q) were used to determine the immediate treatment effects. A follow-up (24 weeks post-treatment) EDE-Q measurement determined the long-term effects. These variables served as the dependent variables in three different hierarchical linear regression analyses. A fourth logistical regression analysis was conducted, where treatment-related drop-out formed the dependent variable. The following eight predictor variables were chosen based on literature research: ethnicity, age, gender, educational level, comorbidity, frequency of binge eating episodes, levels of BED pathology and treatment condition. The predictor variables served as the independent variables. Results: BED pathology at baseline was found to be the only significant predictor of treatment outcomes as measured by the EDE (β=.41, t=3.71, p<.001), EDE-Q (β=.57, t=8.23, p<.001) and at follow-up (β=.47, t= 6.24, p< .001). Attrition could be predicted by both ethnicity and gender, where males were 5.63 times more likely to discontinue treatment prematurely (OR=5.63, 95%CI [1.81, 17.53]) and participants born abroad were 3.91 times more likely to discontinue treatment (OR=3.91, 95%CI [1.43, 8.76]). Other independent variables did not significantly contribute to the final regression models. Discussion and conclusion: All predictor variables are discussed in detail, reflecting on the results found and comparing them to findings of previous studies. Limitations are elaborated in depth. Due to these limitations, and the modest number of previous studies, further research is encouraged, exploring both the current and other dependent variables",

This study aims to compare the effectiveness of the two learning strategies for memory recall, as well as consider the influence of age, the magnitude of the prediction errors, and the involved brain areas. It seeks to enhance the educational debate on these learning strategies by uncovering the strategies' mechanisms and guiding educators on their effective use. To accomplish this, 28 young adolescents and 46 young adults were scanned in an MRI scanner while learning numerical facts using both strategies: predicting and repeating. The study explored the influence of strategy, age group, and prediction error on memory recall. Furthermore, it investigated strategy-specific and age-specific differences in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), striatum, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). While it was expected that prediction-based learning would result in better learning for both age groups as it requires deeper processing, results showed that adults had improved memory for repetition compared to prediction, whereas adolescents did not show a significant difference between the two learning strategies. Within prediction-based learning, adults showed increased memory for small and large prediction errors, while adolescents only did for large prediction errors.

I Do Not Need Your Help: The Relationship Between the Implicit Need for Autonomy and Help Acceptance When in Debt,"Heuvel, Jane van den",['Anouk van der Weiden'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"May people are dealing with debts and this has negative consequences. Therefore, it is important that they seek out for help. However, not everyone seeks out for help. Research suggest that autonomy could be of influence. This study investigated the relationship between the need for autonomy and the level of help acceptance, of which was expected that a higher implicit need for autonomy was related to a lower level of help acceptance when experiencing debts. The PSE was used to measure the implicit need for autonomy in a sample of 91 (recently graduated) students. The level of help acceptance was measured with a self-developed questionnaire. The correlation analysis showed that autonomy and help acceptance were positively associated (r (91) =.180, p = .044). Future research should focus on investigating the relationship between autonomy and help acceptance in the specific debt domain. In general, more theoretical research is needed to understand the factors influencing the level of help acceptance. This study provides evidence that a higher need for autonomy is associated with a higher level of help acceptance","['autonomy, financial scarcity, debts, PSE, Picture-story exercise']"

"Developing a taxonomy of challenging therapy situations, and the influence of professional self-doubt","Bontenbal, Eva",['Dr. K. de Jong'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Therapists deal with a wide range of challenging situations that can affect therapy outcome. This study explores the nature of these situations, and develops a taxonomy of these challenging therapy situations. The findings contribute to therapist’s training and improve therapy outcome. Furthermore the study aims to examine the hypothesis that a higher score on the Professional-Self-Doubt-scale translates to a greater number of words used when describing a challenging situation. The last aim is to explore a potential difference between level of PSD and the type of situations. Methods: The study employs a mixed-qualitative design, using an online questionnaire. A total of 245 therapists participated (89%-female, average-age 41). Participants described 169 challenging therapy situations. Thematic analysis was applied to categorize the qualitative data. PSD was measured using the PSD-scale. Spearman correlation was used to correlate number of words and PSD-score. Chi-Square tests and a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to explore the relation between PSD-score and category of challenging situation. Results: The framework by Henkel et al. (2019) was used to categorize challenging therapy situations, not all situations fit the existing framework. Proposed changes include the introduction of three new subcategories. No significant correlation was found between PSD-score and wordcount. Furthermore no significant relation was found between PSD-score and category of challenging therapy situations. Conclusions: The framework of challenging therapy situations by Henkel et al. (2019) can be expanded and refined. More research is needed in order to examine the relation between level of PSD and category of challenging therapy situation.","['challenging therapy situations, professional self-doubt, thematic analysis, taxonomy of therapy situations']"

An Investigation into Deliberate Practice and its Impact on Challenging Therapy Situations,"Raaij, Dennis van","['Antypa, N.', 'de Jong, K.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Deliberate Practice (DP) is widely associated with positive outcomes in skill-based contexts, prompting an investigation into its role in psychotherapists' management of challenging therapy scenarios for possible future implications into therapist training. This study delves into the intricacies of challenging therapy situations as recounted by psychotherapists and examines the influence of Deliberate Practice (DP) on the themes of these situations and therapists' sentiments. A total of 254 participants engaged in the study via an online survey, facilitated by various psychotherapy organizations, each representing different therapeutic frameworks. The survey, utilizing a mixed-methods approach, encompassed closed and open-ended questions. Participants DP levels were assessed using the Deliberate Practice Scale, while thematic analysis provided a rich comprehension of the qualitative data. The results indicate that there is no relationship between the number of hours a participant spent in DP and the themes they describe as challenging. Next to this, a relationship between confidence and number of hours in DP was found. The nature of the relationship revealed that the more hours a participant spent in DP, the less confident they were. Participants regardless of their DP engagement, described similar themes as challenging. However, a negative relationship between confidence and DP hours surfaced, prompting speculation about potential explanations such as impostor syndrome, burnout, and perfectionism. This correlation underscores the complexity of psychotherapists' experiences and asks for further in-depth exploration.","['Challenging Therapy Situations', 'Deliberate Practice', 'Confidence', 'Psychotherapy', 'Thematic Analysis', 'Sentiment Analysis']"

This paper explores which demographic variables (age, gender) correlate with presenteeism in research which aims to reproduce previous studies’ results. We aim to identify factors which may increase an individual’s susceptibility to presenteeism. This paper also introduces collectivism, a measure of one's self conception in relation to one’s ingroups, as a possible moderator of the relationship of age and gender on presenteeism. The thesis is that collectivism moderates certain demographic variables, strengthening their relationship to presenteeism. Participants worked more than 20 hours a week and responded to a 15 minute survey offered in Dutch and English. Data was analyzed with Pearson correlations, ANOVA and linear regression models in R Studio. Conclusions were that gender had a significant relationship with presenteeism and when collectivism is added to the regression equation this remains significant. The interaction effect of gender and collectivism had more of an impact on a woman’s presenteeism score, especially at lower collectivism scores. A high collectivism score for men resulted in increased presenteeism, and the opposite for women. Between age*collectivism and presenteeism no significant interaction was found.",

This study focuses on how our need for autonomy may act as a barrier to demanding financial help when one is in debt to a person or company. Methods: A regression study was conducted, amongst 91 participants who were either currently enrolled in or had recently finished university (mean age = 22.64). A participant's implicit need for autonomy was measured with the Picture Story Exercise (PSE) and was used to predict whether a participant would accept help from a debt relief company, whilst being primed with a debt/financial scarcity scenario. Results and conclusion: The confirmatory analysis yielded non-significant results. Despite the results being non-significant a negative correlation was observed between the need for autonomy and help acceptance. A couple of methodological issues may have accounted for a lack of replication The confirmatory analysis did reveal a strong predictive effect of shame on help acceptance when indebt.","['Implicit need for autonomy, Picture story exercise, help acceptance']"
Does Bystander Non-Intervention Lead to Worse Psychological Outcomes for Victims of Workplace Sexual Harassment? A Vignette Study in a Workplace Setting,"Casey, Eve",['Dr. Marco van Bommel'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Recent research has demonstrated that an overwhelming 97% of women between the ages of 18 and 24 have been sexually harassed, and many instances of sexual harassment are known to occur in the workplace. The current study investigated whether bystander non-intervention leads to worse psychological outcomes, such as increased work-stress and lower fundamental need fulfilment, for victims of workplace sexual harassment. A vignette-based survey was conducted with three conditions; no bystanders, active bystanders, and passive bystanders. Based on a review of related literature, it was hypothesised that participants assigned to the passive bystanders condition would report lower scores of fundamental need fulfilment, exhibit higher work-stress scores, and greater acceptance of sexual harassment myths. Data from 159 participants were analysed and it was found that participants who were assigned the passive bystanders condition did indeed report lower scores in the fundamental needs of belonging, self-esteem, and meaningful existence. However, the other hypotheses were not supported. Strengths, limitations, and future recommendations are discussed.",
Beyond Preference: Assessing Accuracy and Bias in Student Choices between AI and Human Answers,"Hasker, Linde",['Francesco Walker'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study delves into the intricate dynamics of how students interact with ChatGPT, a new chatbot using machine learning algorithms, specifically examining whether they tend to place excessive trust in the information it provides. The study, involving 169 student participants, uses an experimental design to explore biases, trust perceptions and decision-making processes related to both AI-generated and human expert answers. Two different groups are examined in this study - the labelled group, with knowledge about the answer source, and the unlabelled group, which operates without information about the answer source. The study reveals a preference for answers from human experts, both in the overall sample and in the labelled group. Interestingly, this preference is absent in the unlabelled group, where students do not show a preference when unaware of the answer source. Furthermore, participants in all groups consistently show a tendency to choose correct answers over incorrect ones, indicating an inherent ability to distinguish accurate, high-quality information regardless of their awareness of the source. In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights into how students navigate and interact with ChatGPT. The notable preference for answers from human experts in the labelled group indicates a possible source bias. However, the consistent selection of correct answers in both groups underscores students' skill in identifying high-quality information. As such, this study highlights the trust dynamics in an AI-influenced society and emphasises the need for educating the new generation about the transformative role of AI.","['Artificial Intelligence (AI), Human-Computer Interaction, ChatGPT, Perceived Trust']"
From Shame to Success: Increasing Shame Resilience Improves Debtors' Willingness to Contact Creditors,"du Toit, Alé",['Elise Seip'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current study aimed to investigate the impact of shame resilience on debtors' willingness to contact their creditors to address their outstanding debts. Drawing on the self-determination theory and shame resilience theory, the study aimed to understand the psychological barriers to contacting creditors for people in financial debt. Specifically, the study aimed to test the effectiveness of four different versions of creditor letters, including a baseline letter and three letters based on increasing shame resilience, on increasing debtors' willingness to contact creditors. The results supported both tested hypotheses, as participants exposed to the inducing power manipulation as well as those in the reduced feeling trapped condition showed significantly greater willingness to contact creditors compared to those in the baseline condition. We also conducted two explorative analyses in order to further investigate these manipulations. The first explorative analysis indicated that combining the reduction of powerlessness and feeling trapped led to greater willingness to contact creditors compared to the baseline condition. However, the second explorative analysis revealed no significant difference between the combination condition and either of the single manipulations. These findings provide insights into which communication strategies are most effective in overcoming the avoidance tendencies caused by the experience of financial shame. The findings can be used by creditor companies to develop more effective communication strategies to help debtors regain control of their finances and reduce the cycle of shame and financial hardship.","['Financial debt, Shame, Willingness to contact, Shame resilience theory, Creditor letters, Self-determination theory']"

The Effects of Power and Motives: A Study on the Compensatory Means of Creativity,"Nussbaum, Sebastian","['Steinel, W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Within negotiations individuals differ in their motivation to reach certain outcomes over others (outcome orientation). These differences may exaggerate as asymmetrical power dynamics impose disadvantageous conditions for some individuals within a group. As such restrictions may limit an individual’s ability to realise its interest in certain outcomes, individuals may evoke compensatory mechanisms to alleviate these disadvantages. Building on previous studies (Van Tol & Steinel, 2019), we propose that creative cognitions (e.g., flexibility or originality) may qualify as such potential compensatory mechanism. Consequently, we predict that the effect of individual outcome orientation in relation to an asymmetrical dispersion of power within groups may motivate compensatory engagements in creative behaviours that aim to alleviate the effects of disadvantageous situational constraints. To this end, 150 participants took part in a three-person fictious face-to-face online study. Participants were randomly assigned to either a powerful, powerless, or equal power condition, whilst further differentiations ensured individualistic and collectivistic outcome orientations. Upon reading the instructions, participants completed both a flexibility and an originality task. Results of a 2 (social motive: pro-social vs. pro-self) x 3 (relative power: powerless vs. equal power vs. powerful) ANOVA, as well as a 2 (social motive: pro-social vs. pro-self) x 3 (relative power: powerless vs. equal power vs. powerful) ANCOVA (with individual knowledge about cooking as covariate) revealed non-significant interaction effects for both flexible (ANOVA) and original (ANCOVA) compensation. Across the possible combinations of powerless and powerful, and pro-social and pro-self, participants did not differ in their creativity scores, disconfirming our hypotheses. As these null findings stand in direct contradiction to previous literature, the need for further investigation of creative cognitions in negotiations is highlighted.","[': creativity, flexibility, originality, compensatory mechanism, negotiation, social motive, outcome orientation, power, power asymmetry']"
The Impact of Productivity Uncertainty on Cooperation in a Public Goods Dilemma: Is the Relationship Moderated by People’s Risk Propensity?,"Stevanovich, Sven",['Welmer Molenmaker'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Individuals often experience uncertainty about the productivity of Public Goods (PG), causing them to face the possibility that the PG is either high or low in productivity. This study examined the impact of such productivity uncertainty on cooperation and investigated whether risk propensity moderated this relation. It also explored the effect on cooperation when the productivity is so low that contributing would imply a loss. Participants (N=120) played public good games which varied in levels of uncertainty. Findings revealed that risk seekers (high risk propensity) contribute more than risk avoiders (low risk propensity) in games with uncertainty without potential loss than in games without such uncertainty (baseline game). Furthermore, both risk seekers and risk avoiders contribute less to games with uncertainty with potential loss compared to the baseline game. The potential for loss strongly impacts cooperation decisions, and risk propensity predicts cooperation in situations of uncertainty without potential loss.","['productivity uncertainty, cooperation, risk propensity, potential loss, productivity, uncertainty, public good, social dilemma']"

I specifically examined this within the context of Cyprus focusing on the Turkish-speaking Cypriot minority (N = 161) in relation to the Greek-speaking Cypriot majority, using a vignette experimental approach. As hypothesized, I found that participants who focused on inequalities with the advantaged outgroup reported greater support for social change, collective action intentions, and change motivation compared to those who focused on commonalities with the outgroup. However, the expected interaction with perspective giving was not found, as it did not make a difference whether the participants gave their perspective to a member of the advantaged outgroup or did not. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complexities of intergroup dynamics and extend on the possible effects of perspective giving on collective action intentions.","['perspective giving, collective action, social change, power dynamics, intergroup relations.']"

Building upon the concepts of the minority stress and minority strength models, this cross-sectional secondary data analysis aimed to identify further factors that impact the mental health of SMI. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) the higher the parental acceptance (PA), the lower the internalized homonegativity (IH), (2) the higher the parental acceptance, the higher the self-respect (SR), (3) the higher the IH, the lower the SR, and (4) the relationship between PA and SR will be mediated by IH. Self-identified SMI respondents - mainly young, educated, Western European women - filled out an online survey consisting of the Parental Acceptance of Sexual Minority Identity questionnaire, the Internalized Homonegativity scale, and the Self-Respect scale (n = 249; nbisexual = 131; ngay = 59; nother = 59; Mage = 21.6). Hypothesis one was rejected as there was no significant correlation between PA and IH (r(247) = -.06, p = .38). In contrast, there was a moderate positive correlation between PA and SR (r(247) = .34, p < .001) confirming hypothesis two, and a weak negative correlation between IH and SR (r(247) = -.17, p = .008) confirming hypothesis three. The conditions for a mediation analysis were not satisfied and therefore hypothesis four was not tested. These results provide preliminary support for relationships between different constructs that implicate mental health in SMI. Future research should investigate the causal relationship between these constructs before any interventions can be applied.","['sexual minority individuals', 'SMI', 'parental acceptance', 'internalized homonegativity', 'self-respect', 'LGB', 'LGBTQIA+', 'self-stigma', 'mental health', 'minority stress']"
The relationship of neural motor dedifferentiation and freezing of gait in Parkinson’s patients: an fMRI study in a VR paradigm,"Schmidt, Patricia Manuela Sofie","['Dr. Hall, J. M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a prevalent symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by difficulties in initiating movement or a sudden inability to step forward in spite of the intention to walk. FOG can lead to considerable discomfort for individuals with PD. However, the underlying mechanisms of FOG remain unclear. Previous research has indicated a decline in motor performance with normal aging, associated with neural dedifferentiation in the motor areas. In this study, our aim was to explore the potential role of neural dedifferentiation in gait variability and FOG. Moreover, FOG has been shown to increase in the presence of objects. Consequently, we sought to investigate the relationship between increased task load through obstacles and FOG. Lastly, gait variability has been associated with FOG, and we aimed to confirm this association as well. To assess neural dedifferentiation, we analyzed fMRI scans of 49 participants with PD. During these scans, patients viewed a virtual hallway on a monitor and could move forward within the virtual environment by pressing foot pedals alternately, mimicking gait. The VR game included obstacles such as doorways and turns to evaluate the impact of obstacles on FOG. To assess neural dedifferentiation in the motor areas, we selected several motor regions of interest (ROIs) and compared the activation between left and right stepping in the ipsilateral ROIs as a measure of neural dedifferentiation. However, our analysis did not reveal any significant neural dedifferentiation during stepping, gait variability, and FOG%. No neural dedifferentiation during obstacle presence and stepping was found either. Further, both correlations for neural activation and stepping and neural activation during stepping and obstacles with FOG% and gait variability were insignificant., However, we discovered a highly significant association between gait variability and FOG%, this positive association provides evidence for increased gait variability in individuals with PD and FOG and may relate to difficulties in maintaining stable walking rhythms. Nevertheless, we propose that alternative explanations for FOG exist beyond the dedifferentiation hypothesis, such as a processing conflict leading to a system overload involving compensation by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an inhibitory pathway in the basal ganglia, and disturbances in the motor areas.",
"The influence of perceived online behavioral control on the relationship between FoMO, the frequency of smartphone checking, and academic stress.","Dai, Serlina","['Wit, A.P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study investigated the influence of engaging in online regulatory behaviors in the use of one’s smart phone and the outcomes of those behaviors on perceived online behavioral control (PoBC). Additionally, the moderating influence of PoBC on the relationship between Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) and the frequency of checking one’s smartphone was investigated. We were also interested in the relationship between social media fatigue and academic stress. A convenience sample of Dutch-speaking students (N = 82) completed a 15-minute self-report questionnaire assessing FoMO, frequency of smartphone checking, PoBC, and online regulatory behaviors. Contrary to our expectations, PoBC does not weaken the relationship between FoMO and participants’ frequency of checking one’s smartphone. On the one hand, as expected, in the subgroup of participants with a weaker sense of PoBC, the correlation between FoMO and the frequency of checking one’s smartphone is positive, although not significant (r = .20), indicating that participants with higher levels of FoMO tend to check their phone more frequently. On the other hand, however, in the subgroup of participants with a stronger sense of control, the correlation is not weakened, but remains equally strong (r = -.20, again n.s.), but this time negative, suggesting that in this subgroup of participants, higher levels of FoMO tend to be associated with less frequent phone-checking. A possible explanation for this unexpected result is offered in the Discussion. Furthermore, unexpectedly, participants experiencing more social media fatigue do not experience more academic stress. However, individuals who believe that regulating their online behavior is effective to not be distracted, perceive a stronger sense of control over their online behavior. This study suggests that enhancing the belief that regulatory behaviors may help to prevent unwanted disturbances.","['FoMO', 'perceived behavioral control', 'regulating behaviors', 'smartphone checking', 'academic stress']"

Previous research on agreement regarding placement decisions shows inconsistent findings. Case factors have previously been investigated in studies for risk assessment instruments, risk factors and protective factors in families. In addition, the mindset towards change can play a role in making a placement decision. The current study investigated whether (1) there is a difference in the weight of the various case factors (child factors, professional support factors and family factors), (2) there is a relationship between the weight of the case factors and professional background and (3) there is a relationship between the weight of the various case factors and the mindset towards change. 22 children's judges, 31 youth care workers, 36 Master's students Youth Law and 38 Master’s students Pedagogical Sciences participated in the study. Participants read 4 vignettes and filled in questionnaires on the weighting of the case factors after reading each vignette. Mindset towards change was measured once with a questionnaire. The results showed that the weighting of case factors differed significantly. Child factors weighed most heavily in the decision, followed by professional support factors and family factors, respectively.

Parent-focused interventions for children with food neophobia: a systematic review,"Ioannidou, Sofia",['Shelley Van Veek'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Purpose Making sure that children eat adequate amounts of fruits and vegetables presents a notable challenge in child rearing. The purpose of this systematic review was to provide an overview of existing parent-focused interventions and evaluate their effectiveness in treating or preventing food neophobia. The review also examined the impact of these interventions on parental outcomes, such as feeding style and self-esteem, which are crucial in addressing feeding difficulties in children. Methods Databases-PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO-were searched. Selection criteria RCT studies on parental-interventions for children 1 to 6 years of age Results Seven RCT were included in our review. Half of the interventions incorporated behavioural techniques and the other half repeated exposure as their intervention method. Repeated exposure alone was found as not effective in preventing or treating food neophobia. Food familiarization before repeated exposure was found effective in preventing children from becoming neophobic and increase children’s intake of both fruits and vegetables. The studies that reported on parental outcomes, found improved parental confidence and an enhanced ability to manage problematic eating behaviours of children. Frequency of family meals was found to be positively associated with children’s intake of vegetables. Conclusions Our systematic review concludes that food neophobia is a multidimensional concept influenced by various factors. While addressing mealtime difficulties and implementing effective strategies are valuable, these is a need for easily implementable and enjoyable activities at home to encourage positive experiences for food. Introducing no-taste activities like picture books can foster comfort and curiosity in trying new foods. Future research could benefit from these recommendations, along with a comprehensive guide providing practical tips and recipes to aid parents in creating a positive feeding environment.","['food neophobia, picky eating, selective eating, vegetable acceptance, fruit acceptance, parent interventions, home, eating, repeated exposure, food familiarity, behavioural practices, safe exploration environment']"
Mastery Motivation in relatie tot sociale communicatie en stereotype gedragingen bij kinderen met het Coffin-Siris syndroom,"Straten, Merel van",['Mw. M.R.M.

CSS most frequently results from a mutation of the ARID1B-gene and is related to autism spectrum disorders as well. One of the core features that recurs in both disorders is impaired social interaction. Mastery motivation appears to predict social communication, among other things. This study describes mastery motivation in children with CSS and examines the question whether mastery motivation is related to ASD characteristics in children with CSS. The goal of the study is to prevent children from developing long-term difficulties in social communication by starting early with interventions that increase mastery motivation. Mastery motivation will help clinicians better understand people with CSS and improve on their treatment. This study consists of 9 girls and 6 boys between 49 and 216 months of age from the Netherlands or Belgium. In this study, the DMQ-18 and the SRS-2 were used to map mastery motivation and ASD characteristics. General cognitive functioning was measured by using an age-appropriate intelligence test. Correlations and single regression have been performed to answer the questions posed in the research. This study confirmed that there is a correlation between ASD characteristics and mastery motivation in children with CSS. There is also a correlation between the instrumental aspect of mastery motivation and ASD characteristics. Children with CSS show ASD characteristics. Many ASD characteristics, like social communication problems, are associated with less mastery motivation. Less mastery motivation will cause children with CSS to be less motivated to perform a challenging task. It is crucial children with CSS to engage in social persistence and social competence. Social interaction will be encouraged and this will ensure positive outcomes in life and school.","['Coffin-Siris-syndroom, mastery motivation, ASS-kenmerken, sociale communicatie en stereotype gedragingen']"

Oral comprehension, narrative production, and attempt to tell a story were tested. The relationship between comprehension and production in Dutch was examined, and whether a child's language background and attempt to convey a story influenced this relationship. Country of birth and amount of exposure to majority language Dutch were considered as the language background. Two hierarchical multiple regressions and a test of correlation were run. Results indicated that comprehension and production were significantly, positively associated. Neither country of birth nor attempt influenced this relationship. Based on comparison between correlations, the amount of Dutch majority language exposure did not strengthen the relationship between comprehension and production. Attempt was found to be a significant, positive predicter of production. These results indicate that language background should be more comprehensively researched in the future and that comprehension and attempt should be considered by educators and researchers to help support multilingual children’s successful acquisition of a second language.","['multilingualism, child second language acquisition, oral comprehension, production, language background, attempt']"

Eating problems and emotional eating can develop due to problems with mood and stress regulation or appetite regulation. External factors, such as maternal caregiving, can also play a role. Mood, stress and appetite regulation are regulated by the brain but also by the gut. In recent research, the gut has been linked to depression and anxiety, but more research is needed on its role in eating disorders and their precursors. In this study, we explored the link between two precursors of eating disorders, eating problems and emotional eating, and the gut microbiota as well as the moderating role of maternal caregiving. We analysed longitudinal data from the BIBO (Basale Invloeden op de Baby Ontwikkeling) study of Nijmegen university. The data was used to look at whether clusters of bacteria in infancy predict eating problems at 2.5 and 6 years old and emotional eating at 6 and 14 years old. Furthermore, maternal caregiving was added as a moderator to see its role in the potential relationship between the gut and eating problems and emotional eating. Results revealed that there were no significant differences in eating problems (at 2.5 and 6 years old) and emotional eating (at 6 and 14 years old) between the clusters. Furthermore, there was no moderating effect of maternal caregiving on the relationship between microbiota cluster and eating problems and emotional eating. This study suggests that infant microbiota does not predict eating problems and emotional eating in childhood and adolescence in this sample. However, these findings open new paths for future research; with higher taxonomic resolution rather than clusters of bacteria, larger sample sizes, and finally the addition of measures of relevant variables, such as emotion regulation strategies and measures of parent-child relations, such as attachment and parental feeding practices.","['Gut microbiota', 'eating disorders', 'eating problems', 'emotional eating', 'maternal caregiving,']"
De rol van executieve functies en interactief voorlezen van digitale prentenboeken op de ontwikkeling van woordenschat en printkennis,"Kerdijk, Marit","['Dijken, M. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Children with problems in the development of early literacy are at risk for reading difficulties in later life. Weak executive functioning might contribute to this. Therefore, fostering early literacy skills is of great importance. Digital books and interactive reading may support this development. The current study examines the impact of reading digital storybooks in a classroom setting using the interactive reading program e-Prent&ABC. This program involves reading techniques such as semantic consolidation and print referencing to stimulate early literacy skills, including vocabulary and print knowledge. The relationship between these components of early literacy and executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control is also explored. Based on previous research, it is hypothesized that reading using print referencing would result in more growth in vocabulary and print knowledge than reading through semantic consolidation. Additionally, it is hypothesized that working memory and cognitive flexibility would mainly contribute to growth in vocabulary, while inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility would contribute to growth in print knowledge. This within-subject design study used a sample of 85 children (41 girls, M = 63 months, SD = 6.1 months). Various questionnaires were employed to measure book-related vocabulary, print knowledge, visual working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility. The results show that print referencing does not lead to more growth in vocabulary than semantic consolidation, but it does in print knowledge, which implies that interactive reading is beneficial for the development of early literacy. Furthermore, it appears that visual working memory, cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control are not significant predictors of vocabulary and print knowledge, meaning e-Prent&ABC might compensate for the negative effects of lower levels of executive functioning. This study contributes to the advancement of inclusive education for children with diverse learning needs, levels of literacy and executive functioning.","['digital storybooks', 'early literacy', 'print referencing', 'executive functioning']"
Do adult facial responses to children's facial expressions of anger depend on child behaviour and gender?,"Sermpeniadi, Charikleia","['Vermeer, H.J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The imitation of someone‘s facial expression is considered an unconscious and automatic response. Preliminary studies suggest that it can be modulated depending on background information. This study aimed to investigate whether adults‘ facial responses towards facial expressions of children with anger could be affected based on children‘s gender and information about their behaviour (internalizing or externalizing). Method: The sample of the current research comprises N=25 Dutch adults (21 females and 4 males; mean age = 22.72). Bipolar electrodes were placed on the face of the participants to record their facial electromyography (EMG) reactions. Firstly, baseline adults' facial reactions towards facial expressions of children with anger were collected. Next, participants received information about the children‘s externalizing or internalizing behaviour. Lastly, participants observed the same children‘s facial expressions of anger to test the impact of children‘s gender and information about their behaviour (internalizing or externalizing) on facial mimicry. Results: The children‘s gender and information about their behaviour (internalizing or externalizing) did not influence participants‘ emotional responses towards the children‘s faces with anger. Conclusions: The statistical analysis showed that adults‘ facial reactions towards children‘s facial expressions did not alter based on children‘s gender and information about their behaviour. However, it would be interesting to replicate the study with a sample from a less liberal society and check if the results would be the same.","['facial mimicry, facial electromyography (EMG), children‘s gender, internalizing behaviour, externalizing behaviour, anger, Corrugator Supercilii muscle']"
Reaching Out for Debt Assistance: The role of Situational Control and Self-efficacy Beliefs,"Zalm, Tamar van der",['Elise Seip'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Financial hardship and debts can have a substantial negative effect on people’s overall well-being. However, when a creditor is reaching out, most people with problematic debts are reluctant to seek or accept help. To lower the threshold for debt assistance, research is needed to make contacting a creditor more accessible. This study examined whether induced situational control would positively influence people’s willingness to contact their creditor. Furthermore, the extent to which people’s financial self-efficacy beliefs affect this relationship was explored. An online survey was conducted in which a creditor letter was manipulated with induced situational control. Inducing situational control was found to significantly increase people’s willingness to contact their creditor compared to no situational control. This suggested that offering suitable solutions will increase mutual contact with people in debt. However, financial self-efficacy beliefs did not significantly strengthen the effect of situational control or the willingness to contact directly. The limitations of this study and suggestions for future research are discussed.",
De bruikbaarheid van een verkorte dynamische test: Instructiebehoefte bepalen door een verkorte dynamische test bij basisschoolleerlingen,"Groen, Saskia","['Veerbeek, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Testing the cognitive abilities of children in educational settings is mostly done with static tests. Research has found that dynamic tests can provide additional information to static tests. Dynamic tests can determine the learning potential and need for instruction of children, which are suggested to be good predictors for future academic results. Moreover, these dynamic tests are less subject to bias. Unfortunately, dynamic tests are often labour-intensive and therefore hardly used in practice. This study aims to investigate the use of a shortened dynamic test, with a graduated-prompts procedure, to determine students’ need for instruction. Participants were 66 regular primary school children (M = 10.89 years, SD = .53 years). The shortened dynamic test was a geometric analogies task, appealing to inductive reasoning. Teachers were asked to estimate the individual need for instruction of their students, for both math and reading comprehension, in levels of ‘no help’, ‘meta-cognitive help’, ‘cognitive help’ and ‘modelling’. The Cito scores for math and reading comprehension were obtained for every student. Only a few students needed modelling help during the shortened dynamic test. Therefore, the cognitive help and modelling were combined for the sake of reliability and usability of this study. Teacher’s perspective could predict the Cito scores to a large extent, especially for math. The results of the shortened dynamic test added slightly to this explanation, but only for math. Reading comprehension requires more than just inductive reasoning, such as vocabulary, which was beyond the scope of the shortened dynamic test. Regardless of the limitations of this study, the shortened dynamic test show promise as an objective ‘check’. For instance, for unexperienced teachers who are uncertain about the need for instructions for a student. Finally, this study may prove to be a valuable stepping stone to future research in the field of shortened dynamic tests.",['dynamic testing']

Methods: This observational study used data from bereaved relatives of patients with advanced cancer from the prospective, longitudinal, multicenter, observational eQuipe study. Openness of communication about illness and death was measured using the Caregivers’ Communication with Patients about Illness and Death (CCID) scale. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were used to assess the association between the level of openness of communication and (1) the a priori defined characteristics of the relatives, and (2) the level of bereavement distress, as measured by the Impact of Event Scale (IES). Results: A total of 160 bereaved relatives were included in the study and 65% (n=103) reported high levels of open communication about illness and death with their ill loved one during the last three months of the patient’s life. Higher levels of open communication were associated with lower levels of bereavement distress. No associations were found between levels of open communication and relatives’ age, gender, level of education, faith, type of relationship with the patient, or emotional functioning before the patient’s death. Conclusions: The majority of bereaved relatives in our study had few difficulties communicating about illness and death with their loved one with advanced cancer during the last three months of the patient’s life. Higher levels of open communication are associated with lower levels of bereavement distress and future research should investigate the causality of this relationship.","['open communication', 'relatives of patients with cancer', 'Caregivers’ Communication with Patients about Illness and Death', 'characteristics of relatives', 'bereavement distress']"

The current study examined the relation between the occurrence of domestic violence in a family and the decision to request a child protection investigation. Additionally, the moderating role of age and sex of a child is examined. This was investigated by anonymously coding the Request for Discussions files from various Youth Protection Tables throughout The Netherlands. Age, sex, and the decision whether to investigate was directly coded from the files. The occurrence of domestic violence was coded by ten coders, who followed an elaborative training (κ sex = .939 range = .856-1.00; κ domestic violence = .352 range = .211- 1.00). A total of 40 files were coded and analysed. The results show no relationship between domestic violence and the decision to investigate by CPS. Furthermore, no moderating role for age or sex of the child was found. Explanations for these results are possible under- or overreporting of domestic violence, the small sample size and awareness of employees on their stereotypes. Limitations and implications are discussed. Future research should focus on repeating the current study with a bigger sample size and establishing a format of the Request for Discussion that contains all essential information, which can then be implemented throughout the Netherlands.","['Jeugdbeschermingstafel', 'huiselijk geweld', 'besluitvorming', 'raadonderzoek']"

Receiving the Diagnosis: Influence of Coping Styles on Information Provision by Clinicians during Diagnostic Consultations with Parkinson's Disease Patients,"Jansen, Iris","['Hillen, M.A.', 'Kurpershoek, E.', 'Henrich, E.F.', 'Peerdeman, K.J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that severely affects patients’ lives. How patients cope with the stress of receiving this diagnosis is influenced by information-seeking coping style, which can be classified on two dimensions: monitoring (seeking information) and blunting (avoiding information). Patients’ level of monitoring and blunting may affect their perception of amount of information. Clinicians may not tailor the amount of information to the individual needs of patients, negatively impacting their recall. This study hypothesized that the amount of provided information by clinicians is equal for patients who score high on monitoring and patients who score high on blunting. Additionally, this study hypothesized that patients with high monitoring scores would report receiving too little information, and that patients with high blunting scores would report receiving too much information. Method: This study employed a prospective observational longitudinal design as part of the DiaMove Project. The sample consisted of newly diagnosed PD patients who completed questionnaires assessing their demographic characteristics, coping styles and perceived amount of information. Diagnostic consultations were video-recorded and subsequently observationally quantitatively coded for duration of information provision per topic. Statistical analyses included equivalence testing, independent t-tests and logistic regression. Results: This study found that the amount of information provided by clinicians is not equivalent for patients (N = 28) with high scores on the monitoring scale and those with high scores on the blunting scale (CI = [-0.26 – 0.37]; CI = [-0.20 – 0.43]). In addition, two independent t-tests were conducted, which showed no significant difference in the amount of information provided for high scores on the different coping styles (p = .288; p = .552). Furthermore, the likelihood of wanting to receive more or less information cannot be predicted by respectively high scores on the monitoring and blunting coping style (p > .05). Discussion: Patients’ level of monitoring or blunting was not a significant predictor for the amount of information provided and did not predict patients’ reported amount of information provided by clinicians. These findings may be influenced by limitations of self-reported questionnaires, such as the length and the small sample size of the study.","['patients', 'information provision', 'coping style', 'parkinson', 'hospital', 'blunting', 'monitoring', 'equivalence testing', 'logistic regression', 'clinicians', 'recall', 'diagnostic consultation', 'observationally coded', 'stress']"

The possibility to adapt reading material is what makes it interesting, especially for readers who suffer from different types of reading disabilities. High school students who are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder experience a variety of difficulties when reading, which can hinder their study progress. As of yet, there are no means available that can support them in their reading exercises apart from personal guidance by a teacher, parent or caretaker. Therefore, the purpose of this overview study is to analyze the theoretical and empirical research that is behind the design principles of Immersive Reader in order to find the possibilities and limits of this software for high school students with autism spectrum disorder. The main question is: to what extend can Microsoft Immersive Reader serve as an Assistive Technology for high school students with autism? The researcher has conducted a literature review as well as an interview with a special education teacher with the intention of creating a theoretical overview of the reading profiles of students with autism and the possibilities and limits of Immersive Reader. According to the literature, most of the design principles of Immersive Reader are effective tools in improving different kinds of reading processes. Some of the design principles potentially compensate the deficits that cause the reading problems of students with autism. This leads to the conclusion that Immersive Reader can function as Assistive Technology for this target group, because its design principles can resolve or reduce some of the reading difficulties, which might lead to improvements in their reading skills. However, the effectivity of the software depends on how and whether it will be incorporated in their homework routines.","['Microsoft', 'Immersive Reader', 'Insluitende lezer', 'autismespectrumstoornis']"

By using a vignette study, 159 female participants completed a survey and were allocated to one of three conditions (passive bystanders, active bystanders, and no bystanders). Afterwards, all participants indicated their agreement to statements representing the four fundamental needs of belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and control, self-, perpetrator, and bystander blame, work stress, and acceptance of sexual harassment myths. The results indicate that all four fundamental needs decreased, and bystander blame increased in victims experiencing the situation with passive compared to active or no bystanders. The study reveals important theoretical insights in bystander research combined with sexual harassment at the workplace and offers practical implications to avoid the negative impact of passive bystander presence during victimization in organisations.",
What’s in the eye of the beholder: The effects of pupil size and iris brightness in prosocial behavior towards non-human primates.,"Berris, Daisy","['Perea Garcia, J.O.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examines the effects of pupil dilation and iris brightness on the prosocial behavior of people and their attitudes toward primates. We hypothesize that these factors influence perceptions of primates and have an impact on monetary donations as well as ratings of attractiveness, friendliness, and cuteness. The study used a modified dictator game as the primary methodology, with 81 participants completing an online survey and meeting the criteria. Participants were randomly assigned to different iris brightness conditions, either dark or light. During the survey, participants were presented with a total of 64 image pairs, each containing facial portraits of 32 different primate species. We manipulated iris brightness and pupil size of the portraits. Analysis of the data, conducted using mixed repeated measures ANOVA, revealed that pupil dilation significantly influenced several variables. Primates with dilated pupils received higher donation amounts. Although the effects of iris brightness did not reach statistical significance, there was a notable trend indicating increased generosity toward primates with lighter irises. Interestingly, when the pupil was more visible, as shown in the light iris condition, the effects of pupil dilation tended to be more pronounced, although they did not reach the threshold for statistical significance. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex mechanisms behind prosocial behavior when exposed to specific facial features and provides insight into how humans perceive and interact with non-human species, particularly in the context of eye appearance.","['Prosocial behavior', 'Pupil size', 'Iris brightness', 'primates']"
"The Relationship of Trait-Anxiety, Attentional Control, and Attentional Bias","Frantzen, Laura","['Putman, P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Extensive literature demonstrated the relation of trait anxiety to attentional bias to threat. Several studies pointed to the moderating role of attentional control. This study investigated whether trait anxiety correlated with attentional bias to threat and if this relation was moderated by one’s attentional control ability. Participants (N = 56) were aged between 18 and 31 years. To measure trait anxiety, participants filled out the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory. Attentional control was measured using the Attentional Control Scale. A dual probe task was employed to assess participants’ attentional bias to threat. Based on previous research it was hypothesized that trait anxiety would positively correlate with attentional bias to mild threat when attentional control is low and that there would be no correlation between the two variables when attentional control is high. Further, it was hypothesized that trait anxiety and attentional bias to high threat would correlate negatively when attentional control is low while showing no association when attentional control is high. Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression analyses revealed that trait anxiety and attentional bias to mild threat showed a significant positive correlation, but attentional control did not moderate the association. Contrary to expectations, trait anxiety correlated significantly positively with attentional bias to high threat and attentional control did not moderate the association. It was concluded that trait anxiety was related to attentional bias to threat. It was unclear, however, under which conditions individuals showed engagement or disengagement from threat. The moderating role of attentional control was not replicated.","['Attentional bias, trait anxiety, attentional control, dual probe task']"

Does childhood trauma severity predict aggression in Borderline Personality Disorder and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder?,"Binnekamp, Mandy",['Annegret Krause-Utz'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Aggression is often described as a key feature of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Yet, it is not clear what contributes to aggression in these disorders. Previous literature proposes that experiences of childhood maltreatment might be an underlying cause. In this study, it was investigated if childhood maltreatment severity predicts aggression and if this depends on the diagnosis. Methods: The sample consisted of 96 women, diagnosed with BPD (N=30), ADHD (N= 28) or none of these disorders (N=30) based on semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) measured aggression and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) assessed childhood trauma severity. Hypotheses were tested with correlational, moderation and multivariate analyses. Results: Group differences in aggression and childhood trauma severity were observed. Both psychopathological groups reported higher aggression and childhood trauma. Severity of BPD correlating the strongest with childhood trauma severity, followed by ADHD. Furthermore, aggression and childhood trauma were correlated. Yet, childhood trauma was not a significant moderator for aggression in BPD versus ADHD groups. Discussion: Findings suggest that childhood trauma is a predictor for aggression but this does not differ between the psychopathological groups. Since aggression was linked to a diagnosis of BPD, higher levels of aggression in BPD might not be restricted to childhood trauma severity but also influenced by other factors, such as impaired emotion regulation. Future studies should investigate this further, avoiding current limitations such as the cross-sectional design, self-report questionnaires, possible multicollinearity between variables and the small sample size.","['Borderline personality disorder', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'BPD, ADHD', 'aggression', 'childhood trauma', 'moderation analysis']"

Does aversion of losing money motivate us to increase mobility? A real world evaluation of gamified deposit challenges and exploration of player characteristics,"Wolf, Larissa Ngozi Nnamani","['Breeman, L.D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Deposit contracts (i.e. financial incentives in which people deposit their own money and can earn it back contingent on proven behavior change) have been shown to be effective to promote health be- havior change. However, most research up to date has been done in lab settings, included few participants, and did not yet shed light on the characteristics (of challenges or people) that make them more effective. This also includes the nuanced assessment for winners and losers. Objectives. We assessed effectiveness of gamified deposit-based challenges on physical activity (PA) levels provided by the smartphone app StepBet. We also examine effects on PA-levels within early losers of a chal- lenge, i.e. who faced the irreversible loss of their deposit. Secondary, we explored on users’ characteristics possibly linked to PA-increase, or winning a deposit-based challenge. Hence, through our research, we aim to bring forward the personalization of such interventions. Methods. PA was measured as daily average step count. We retrieved data from StepBet users daily step count (N = 323). Once, users step count throughout the challenge period, second, from before challenge start (baseline step level), and third, their step count pre/post challenge failure. We measured changes in daily step count (step increase) by comparing users challenge step count to a personal historic step count. Bet amounts (deposits) of losers of a challenge are split evenly among the winners. Outcomes were, challenge success/ failure (dichotomous) and step increase (continuous). We only included adult first time players in their first challenge, characterized by 41-days duration and $40 deposit. We also surveyed on users psychological char- acteristics (motivation, self-efficacy, self control, risk proneness) and demographics (BMI, age, gender, in- come, education). Results. The daily average step count increased on average 46.0 % (or 3183 steps, SD = 3207) compared to a baseline mean level (M = 6916 steps, SD = 2833) in users. Across the entire challenge duration, winners (n = 256) significantly increased their daily step counts on average by 52.5 % (or 3730 steps, SD = 1489), com- pared to a baseline (M = 7109 steps, SD = 2837). Meanwhile losers (n = 67) significantly increased their dai- ly steps on average by 17.7 % (or 1094 steps, SD = 1610) compared to baseline (M = 6181 steps, SD = 2712) and across the 41-days. Prior to failure, losers showed an increase of 30.7 % (1870 steps, SD =1505), and post-failure a decrease by -28.7 % (-1738 steps, SD = 3265) on average compared to baseline (M = 6052, SD = 2644). Our exploratory results showed older age, male gender, higher scores on income, self control, and self-efficacy were linked to increasing one’s step count, and only older age to winning. Discussion. Results indicate that deposit-based gamified step challenge promote PA in the real world. We presume the key mechanism behind this is based on DCs because they capitalize on our tendency to be loss averse. We advise on scaling DCs up as a more economic, scalable, and more effective alternative to finan- cial rewarding. Though, we urge future studies to consider options of attenuating the found setback effect in losers.",['Deposit contracts • Financial incentives • Gamification • Monetary reward schemes • Commitment contracts • Behavioral contracts • Health behavior change • Physical activity • Mobility • eHealth technology']

Exhilaration: the Effect of Exercise on Positive Emotions,"Poma, Alberto A","['Vries, J. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract This study investigated the effects of exercise on positive emotions. It also inquired into whether sensory processing sensitivity moderates the strength of this effect, and whether emotional regulation mediates it. 134 participants were randomly assigned across three conditions: exercising, puzzling (our active control), and rear (our passive control). Before randomization, all participants underwent a negative-emotion induction task (an autobiographical recall task), which homogeneously reduced their level of positive emotions. Afterwards, they got to engage in their respective task for 30 minutes, while reflecting on the negative episode they had just brought back to mind. Participants in the exercise condition cycled on a at a self-chosen moderate intensity; those in the puzzling condition tried to assemble as far as possible a 1000-pieces puzzle; those in the rest condition sat on a chair. Both before and after their task, all participants filled up a questionnaire in which we measured their levels of positive emotion, sensory processing sensitivity, and emotional regulation strategies. The results were that exercise significantly increased positive emotions compared to rest (p = .002, 95% CI = .31, 1.68) but not when compared to puzzling (p = .98, 95% CI = -.63, .74). Contrary to expectations, emotional regulation did not mediate such effect (95% CI = -.42, .003 and 95% CI = -.26, .09), nor did sensory processing sensitivity moderate its strength (b = .02, SE = .61, p = .97 and b = .56, SE = .61, p = .37). Hence, exercise (and puzzling) can serve as a useful intervention to increase positive emotions subsequent to exposure to a stressor, and this effect is valid for all individuals independently of their degree of sensory processing sensitivity.","['exercise, positive emotions']"

The Pigeon and the Wolf: A multispecies ethnography of sharing space in North-western Europe,"Niemans, Floor","['Waltz, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"How do humans navigate sharing scarce space with animal others and what has that meant and still means for those animal others? In urbanising North-western Europe, humans are dominating increasingly more space, meaning that ‘uninhabited’, ‘undisturbed’ areas are slowly disappearing. This has repercussions for the animals this space is shared with. Throughout time, the place attributed to animals, and who they are allowed to be in this space, has changed alongside humans’ changing socio-economic realities. I will illustrate this idea through the example of two animals that have changed in attributed value in opposite directions: the wolf from villain to ecosystem engineer, and the pigeon from war hero to city vermin. These animals have made this transition across relatively similar time periods in the same area of the world, making them a great duo to serve as protagonists to the story of many others. By telling the story of the pigeon and the wolf I aim to encourage reflection on how humans project their own values and worldview on animals, and how that influences what life animals are able to live. In a world of ecological simplifications, knowing our influence on animal lives is crucial in decision and policy making.","['Multispecies ethnography, Anthropocene, ecological simplifications, urbanisation, land sharing, human-wildlife conflict, biocapital, animal rights.']"
Arctic Affective States: Constructing Multispecies Life-worlds in Times of Climate Change,"Oude Veldhuis, Maaike",['Miriam Waltz'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In times of climate change on a worldwide scale, weather patterns are rapidly changing. Entire ecosystems and their characteristic landscapes are affected, changing the life-worlds of animals, plants and humans. One of the areas that is most affected is the Arctic region, including countries such as Canada, Lapland, Russia and the US (Alaska). Due to climate change and melting ice, humans and nonhumans are forced to find different ways of surviving, not only physically but also emotional. As of today, the Arctic region forms the stage for geopolitical and economic developments. Human and nonhuman populations in the Arctic region are faced with an incoming stream of climate scientists, tourists and investors that all have a particular view of the Arctic. In this research project, I aim to find out how the systematic objectification and romanticization that depicts the Arctic region as a secluded wilderness, creates certain affective states within Arctic communities. In turn, I examine how this imagery relates to the construction of multispecies life-worlds in times of climate change. I look at how entanglements between humans and nature are influenced by changing discourses, including media representations, oral storytelling and political debates. Concurrently, I attempt to see how processes of oral storytelling relate to dealing with emotions within a society. The main research question of this project is: ‘How do discourses in and around Arctic communities and their implicated affective states relate to multispecies life-worlds in times of climate change?’","['multispecies ethnography, affect theory, ontology, the Arctic, sustainable life-worlds']"

"""I Don’t Want You to Panic, I Want You to Think”: An Anthropological Investigation of Climate Change Denial and Concern among European Youth on Social Media","Bernard de Fauconval de Deuken, Alice de","['Ochigame, R.K.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores the similarities and differences on social media of adolescents and young adults, in Europe, who are in denial or not regarding climate change. Also, the public figures’ online activism, Naomi Seibt (young German climate-denier activist) and Greta Thunberg (young Swedish climate activist), are rigorously studied to draw comparisons between non- deniers and deniers. Then, the research question addressed in this thesis is: What are the similarities and differences between the young individuals, in Europe, who are in denial or not regarding climate change, on social media? To compare both groups online, a contextualization background and a justification are provided to understand why some young individuals remain in denial despite a scientific consensus convinced on the existence and negative impacts of climate change. Also, it explores which social actors outside the scope of this thesis can benefit from the analysis brought. Additionally, the main social actors (non-deniers, deniers, and social media) are defined, and a theory is drawn to brainstorm this thesis’ puzzle. In terms of methodology, literature review and research on Seibt’s and Thunberg’s social media activities have been performed, and ethical considerations have been taken into account to not harm observed online users. Furthermore, similarities and differences between non-deniers and deniers individuals are extensively examined in four empirical sections. The first one explores the social factors and background that would lead one to express denial or not. The second one discusses the conceptualisation of science by both groups on social media. The third section talks about the identity formation regarding climate change online. The last one analyses the expressed mistrust on social media, individuals in denial or not have in wider societal structures and social actors. Finally, concluding remarks and further suggested research is detailed.","['Climate change', 'climate deniers', 'climate non-deniers', 'social media', 'digitalisation', 'youth']"
