Urban transport and social action. The Movimiento Furiosos Ciclistas and the right to the city,"Theodorou, Zois","['Isla Monsalve, Pablo']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"As in many large cities, rapid urbanisation in Santiago (Chile) has been accompanied by problems of urban sprawl, inequality, and issues with transportation. Since the late nineties social an increasing amount of social movements have emerged that advocate the bicycle as a healthier, more efficient, and non-polluting transport alternative for that city. This thesis investigates the first of these new social movements, the Movimiento Furiosos Ciclistas (MFC), using the concept of the right to the city, introduced by the French sociologist and philosopher Henri Lefebvre, and which has undergone a revival over the last decade as a critical approach to the effects of urbanisation under neoliberalism on societies and their cities. The applicability of Lefebvre’s right to the city as a citizen’s demand for inclusion to their city and a greater control over its space is tested on the MFC in Santiago in the period spanning its emergence in 1994 up to the present year of 2015.The study analyses, firstly, the history, actions, and the organisation of the Movimiento Furiosos Ciclistas as a response to problems of Santiago’s urbanisation; secondly, the movement’s success in making such a demand and the obstacles that hinder; and finally, it tests the right to the city’s unifying potential in analyzing the relationship of the MFC to similar New Social Movements.","['right to the city', 'new social movements', 'social action', 'cultural politics', 'neoliberalism', 'urbanisation', 'transport', 'movimiento furiosos ciclistas', 'Santiago', 'critical mass']"

Shikitei Sanba's Kojitsuke Nendaiki: A populary history of kusazōshi,"Schilling, Christiaan","['Smits, I.B.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Shikitei Sanba (1776-1822), a gesaku writer, has made during the height of his career the kibyōshi called Kusazōshi kojitsuke nendaiki: Mata yakinaosu, hachikatsukihime (1802). Kibyōshi are a genre of kusazōshi fiction, which were highly illustrated. The main goal of this work, is to depict the style of prose and illustrations of different eras in the history of kusazōshi both visually and verbally. What makes Kojitsuke Nendaiki interesting to study is that Sanba has taken the story-line of the story Hachikatsuki-hime as material to write a so-called mini encyclopedia of kusazōshi. This study will provide a translation of Kojitsuke Nendaiki. Furthermore it will place the text into its contexts, explore the importance of the work and analyze its content and visuals. The analysis of Kojitsuke Nendaiki’s content in this study will explore how the relationship between ukiyo-e schools has been expressed verbally. Although visual expressions of this relationship have been studied, verbal expressions haven’t. This is how this study will contribute to the studies of Kojitsuke Nendaiki and its contexts. We have also found that Kojitsuke Nendaiki is unique in its execution. The student of Edo-period literature and visual culture will value this material because it gives a wealth of information about the subject in an entertaining way.","['kibyōshi', 'kusazōshi', 'kusazōshi history', 'Shikitei Sanba', 'gesaku', 'ukiyo-e']"

Since the 1990's, Korean women who were coerced into sexual slavery by Japan during World War II have come forward to fight for recognition of the war crimes committed by Japan. The contestation of various nationalist historical remembering however has sidelined feminist issues regarding the brutality women faced in order to prioritize state nationalism. This article extends McClintock’s critique of the term ‘post-colonialism’ and historical linearity to analyze the restraints of a singular embedded history that does not allow space for other historical experiences to be legitimized. This article examines how the state, organizations, and 'comfort women' survivors propagate a specific historical rhetoric in the redress movement against Japan where they are constrained to a post-colonial ‘condition’ that does not look beyond the nation nor takes into consideration the harm done to women’s’ bodies themselves.","['post-colonialism', 'gender', 'nationalism', 'transnational feminism', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'historical linearity']"

This thesis examines how, why, and to what effect Cornwell demythologises Malorian elements in ""The Warlord Chronicles"", and proposes that these Malorian elements are inverted to the point where they do not detract from but add to the novels’ historical setting from a postmodern perspective. A selection of Malorian elements — and Cornwell’s inversion thereof — will be discussed in chapter one. The postmodern influence on the “Warlord Chronicles” trilogy — and the necessity of the postmodern elements in Cornwell’s writing considering Cornwell’s attempt at historical accuracy — will be discussed in chapter two in light of how the novels’ postmodern elements enhance the effect of the inversions of Malory on Cornwell’s narrative, which is historical rather than legendary. The postmodern narrative structure in particular emphasises Cornwell’s demystification of the Arthurian legend, as will be demonstrated in chapter three.","['arthurian legend', 'postmodernism', 'demystification', 'sir thomas malory', 'bernard cornwell']"

Tyranny as a Stereotype: King Jie and King Zhou’s Influence on the Depiction of Tyranny,"Gal, Francesco","['Wu, Yinghui', 'Weerdt, Hilde de']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Very few historical figures exerted such long-lasting and significant influence on the idea of tyranny as Jie of Xia dynasty (2207-1766 BCE) and Zhou of Shang Dynasty (1766-1122) did. Since their earliest mentioning in Chinese texts, they are identified as wicked rulers who, because of their lavish lifestyle and their ill-advised political conduct, brought about the demise of their dynasties. In this work, I tried to analyse the idea of tyranny as crafted on these two rulers. To what extent the figures of Jie and Zhou influenced the depiction of later Emperors; in other words, can we speak of a stereotypical representation of tyranny modelled on the two pre-imperial kings? These were my thesis’ main research questions. To investigate possible answers, I addressed the stereotypical depiction of Chinese rulers by analysing, as study cases, the figures of Emperor Qianfei (449–466) of Liu Song dynasty (420–579) within official historiography, and Emperor Yang (569–618) of Sui dynasty (581–618) in fiction. It turned out that the two emperors' depictions had clear allusions to and parallels with the two pre-imperial kings. In the cases presented, the aim of the historian, or of the fiction writer, to portray a tyrannical ruler adheres, quite precisely, to the figures of the Xia and Shang wicked rulers.","['Tyranny', 'Chinese Historiography', 'Chinese Vernacular Literature', 'Stereotypes']"
A win-win situation created by weibo for government and netizens,"Zhu, Yuqi","['Salmenkari, T.M.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"China is under one-party authoritarian regime which requires the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) to maintain legitimacy and social stability. In order to achieve that, the CCP and Chinese government has been controlling public opinions towards the government and the regime. Since the intervention and popularization of internet into China, internet has broadened Chinese netizens’ outlook and deepen the understandings of the world. Weibo, the Chinese microblog, among online communities, is one of the most popularized internet virtual platforms in China. As an epitome of Chinese society in network age, the development and functions of microblog has no doubt changed not only daily life of Chinese citizens but also substantially changed the way of public participation mode and supervision mode of public affairs. The impact of microblog on possible social transformation and democratization in China has been a hot topic discussed by scholars but the verdict is yet to be reached. In addition, Chinese government realizing the importance and impact of online public opinion also joined the tide of microblog development and is adapting to the digital era to guide public opinion and do propaganda on microblog. Whereas, comparing to microblog’s impact utilizing by netizens, the impact and efficiency of government strategy on microblog is seldom discussed heretofore.","['China', 'internet', 'censorship', 'microblog']"
"Revival or Invention? —— Young people and the""Modern Hanfu Movement"" in contemporary China","Yao, Xiang","['Pieke, Frank. N.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to explore the definition, motivations and characteristics of the ‘Modern Hanfu (traditional Chinese dress) Movement’ 現代漢服運動, which began around 2003. In so doing I will attempt to answer the question why young people promote the Hanfu movement. The advocates of this movement claim that it is about the revival of authentic Han culture and the protection of an important cultural identity in China. Others argue that this movement is inclined to cause new ethnic clashes and even Han chauvinism. This thesis will consist of four parts. The introduction will provide information about the scale and participants of the movement and look at some questions derived from the past and current situations of the movement. Associated with the history of Hanfu, I will argue, in the second chapter, that the meaning of Hanfu in this movement is already different from what it was when the movement started. In other words, participants are inventing it as they go along. After this, this thesis will investigate the reasons why participants promote Hanfu in modern Chinese society. In general, the cultural deficiency of Han identity and aspiration to express ‘self’ can be seen as the main reason behind this movement. At the same time, advocates seek to promote the awareness of cherishing ethnic culture when encountering other cultural forms. The fourth chapter will focus on different achievements by four kinds of Hanfu advocates and public opinions emerge in the process of movement. Still, the movement remains popular among young Chinese, for reasons I will set out through this thesis.","['Hanfu', 'Han culture', 'Invented tradition', 'Han identity', 'Ethnic clashes']"
Analysis of the different voting behavior of Latino sub-groups -On the example of Cubans and Puerto Ricans in the United States,"Schulze, Sophie","['Bader, Max']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Latino population in the United States has greatly increased in recent years, which consequently led to an influence on U.S. politics as the American electorate has experienced significant change. However, though Latinos share a common language and a cultural heritage, they cannot be considered a homogenous group. By using a pan-ethnic approach, that “assumes that members of a racial and ethnic group share political attitudes and patterns of behavior”, many scholars do not recognize the differences that exists between Latino sub-groups (Bishin and Klofstad, “Intra-ethnic diversity” 572). Yet, this is particularly necessary when considering that some sub-groups grow more rapidly than others and may differ considerably from each other when it comes to their political participation and the influences they have on the outcome of an election. The cases of Puerto Ricans and Cubans in the United States demonstrate how important it is to recognize these differences as both sub-groups differ significantly in their voting behavior. Puerto Ricans have always had a very low voter turnout compared to other sub-groups, while Cubans on the other hand have participated extensively in U.S. politics at all times. Besides that, Cubans affiliate with the Republican Party to a large extent, which is in contrast to the majority of other Latinos. The following research question therefore arises: “How can the different voting behavior of Cubans and Puerto Ricans in the United States be explained?”.","['voting behavior', 'Latino sub-groups', 'Cubans', 'Puerto Ricans']"

Resisting the West: What is the relationship between Putin’s ‘Eurasian’ Russia and Europe’s nationalist-right?,"Osman Mackenzie, Louis","['Gerrits, Andre']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The year 2014 was the year when a slowly simmering conflict between the West and Russia dramatically escalated. This conflict has been framed as a return to the hostilities of the Cold War; however the conflict has much older roots that pre-date the Soviet regime (1917-1991) by centuries. The relationship between Russia and its European rivals has been one of antagonism and grudging cooperation since the eighteenth century. Yet, it is not Russia’s historical foreign relations that are the focus of this study, but Russia’s current ambitions and the weapon it uses to undermine its Western rivals, namely encouraging the growth of nationalism and the far right in Europe, while Russia pursues an Eurasionist project with former Soviet states. Within the European Union anti-Western nationalism driven by the radical right and Russian influence is most visible in France, Hungary and Greece. This paper will analyse the extent and motivations of this relationship and how this relates to Russia’s Eurasian geopolitics.","['Putin', 'Russia', 'Eurasia', 'nationalism', 'far-right', 'Hungary', 'Serbia', 'Greece']"

Feasibility of the extra-territorial processing of asylum applications by the member states of the European Union,"Pyszko, Pavel","['Lodder, G.G.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis elaborates upon the political and legal feasibility of processing asylum applications in offshore centres operated by EU member states; this shall promote legal and safe migration of asylum seekers into the European Union. The legal feasibility is determined by member states´ ability to safeguard provisions under the 1951 Geneva Convention and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The key condition for the legal feasibility of offshore asylum processing is the ability to safeguard the principle of non-refoulement. Features of member states´ initiatives for offshore processing as well as those of the operational Australian asylum system are analyzed, and their incompatibility with this principle is confirmed. Ability to fully safeguard against refoulement extra-territorially is further discussed. By analyzing the situation within the territorial Common European Asylum System, the political feasibility for creating an effective and legally feasible extra-territorial asylum procedure is assessed; this involves resettlement of confirmed refugees into the EU and readmission of failed asylum seekers. It is concluded that offshore processing of asylum applications is politically and legally unfeasible at this stage; it would require pooling of national sovereignty much beyond the extent that it now politically feasible – also, member states firstly have to address current deficiencies of the territorial asylum system.","['asylum', 'extra-territorial', 'legal migration', 'non-refoulement', 'offshore', 'refugee']"

It examines how sympathetic treatment of artificial intelligence in this genre may induce empathy in its audience, and how could this sway the artificial intelligence debate when it enters the political sphere. The paper first provides discussions of the artificial intelligence debate, the effect on viewer emotion films can have, and the extent to which humans can empathize with artificial intelligence. The paper then uses three science fiction films – Interstellar (2014), A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) and Her (2013) – to demonstrate the effects such films can have on viewer emotion and discuss the possible repercussions sympathetic treatment of AI could have on the human race. The essay warns against this attitude due to the significant dangers the unchecked development of AI could pose to the human race, and suggests precautionary steps to be taken in the field of education.","['artificial intelligence', 'empathy', 'science fiction', 'identity', 'uncanny valley', 'emotion', 'film', 'willing suspension of disbelief']"

Han laat zien hoe de moderne maatschappij eigenlijk een onvrije maatschappij is, al verkeren we zelf in de illusie dat dit niet zo is. In dit bacheloreindwerkstuk zal worden aangetoond, dat de negatieve aspecten van de Transparenzgesellschafft voortkomen uit een rationeel systeem. Het is dit rationele systeem dat omslaat in negatieve gevolgen. Dit probleem werd eerder door Max Horkheimer en Theodor Adorno aan de kaak gesteld in Dialektik der Aufklärung. Met betrekking tot de diagnose van Han zal hun analyse van de rationaliteit dan ook relevant blijken. Door Hans diagnose op deze manier te belichten wordt zijn denken in een breed wijsgerig kader geplaatst. Via het verbinden van deze twee maatschappijanalyses is men instaat aan te sluiten bij de methode van de filosofie die door Michel Foucault gekarakteriseerd wordt als ontologie du présent. Tevens wordt hiermee de vitaliteit van het gedachtegoed van Horkheimer en Adorno duidelijk. De door Jürgen Habermas gegeven kritiek op dit gedachtegoed zal echter ook worden behandeld en er zal worden aangetoond dat door de overeenkomsten met de maatschappijanalyse van Horkheimer en Adorno deze kritiek ook toepasbaar is op de maatschappijanalyse van Han. Samenvattend is de stelling van dit bacheloreindwerkstuk: ‘Bij de negatieve diagnose die Han vaststelt van de huidige maatschappij speelt onderliggend altijd nog de problematiek van Horkheimer en Adorno met betrekking tot de instrumentele rede.’","['freedom', 'enlightenment', 'transparency']"
The Power of Buen Vivir: Scaling Up Ecuadorian Environmental Governance,"Fuhr, Thomas","['Carmody, Michelle']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The thesis argues that Buen Vivir (good living) proves to be a viable new form of environmental governance in Ecuador, which has undergone a significant process of norms socialization and shaped environmental governance on a national and global level. The thesis brings together discusses on development, sustainable development and on environmental governance, as well as works that have looked at the topic of Buen Vivir. Methodologically, a constructivist transnational approach has been taken, which enables the view at environmental governance across spatial and institutional borders. Theoretically, it draws on concepts of transnational networks, including epistemic communities and advocacy networks, to explain the transfer of ideas. In addition to these concepts, the theoretical model of norm socialization from Risse and Sikkink is applied. After giving a historical background, which highlights the emergence of indigenous movements during the neoliberal 1980s and 1990s, the second chapter shows how the environmental values of these local movements became embedded in national policy under the concept of Buen Vivir, which can be seen in Ecuador’s constitution from 2008 and its National Development Plan. Chapter 3 is a detailed investigation of the transnational networks involved in the Ecuadorian Yasuni-ITT initiative, which set the start for a norm socialization process of Ecuadorian environmental governance from a national to a global level.","['Ecuador', 'Environmental governance', 'transnationalism']"

Vrouwenbesnijdenis in Nederland: Een onderzoek naar de islamitische status van vrouwenbesnijdenis en de gevolgen hiervan voor het Nederlands recht en beleid,"Gersonius, Sanne","['Berger, M.S.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Religiewetenschappen (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek gaat over vrouwenbesnijdenis in Nederland. Het onderzoekt de islamitische status van vrouwenbesnijdenis en bekijkt wat de gevolgen hiervan zijn voor het Nederlands recht en beleid. Op basis van de Koran en hadith en meningen en fatwa’s van islamitische geleerden kan geconcludeerd worden dat er geen eenduidige opinie over vrouwenbesnijdenis bestaat vanuit de islam. Het kan daarom soms als religieus gebruik gedefinieerd worden. Volgens het Nederlands recht in meisjesbesnijdenis strafbaar, omdat het een vorm van mutilatie is. Religie kan hierbij niet als rechtvaardigingsgrond optreden, omdat mutilatie de vrijheid van religie beperkt. Naar mijn mening zou het recht wat betreft enkele lichtere vormen van meisjesbesnijdenis versoepeld kunnen worden. Het beleid van de Nederlandse overheid in de periode 2003-2014 is geanalyseerd aan de hand van het model van Wilson. Op basis van deze analyse en de voorgaande hoofdstukken kan ik concluderen dat het doel van de overheid moet zijn: het veranderen van de interne dynamiek van de gemeenschappen waar vrouwenbesnijdenis voorkomt. De overheid moet zich meer richten op de cultuur en religie van deze gemeenschappen met behulp van organisaties. Tot slot zou een lichte, symbolische inprikking van de clitoris als ‘tussenstation’ kunnen functioneren in het proces van het laten verdwijnen van vrouwenbesnijdenis.","['Islam', 'Vrouwenbesnijdenis', 'Beleid', 'Nederland', 'Recht', 'Cultuur']"
Physiognomy as a transcultural key to correctly understanding early modern figural art,"Bray, Rebecca","['Moore, Oliver']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Physiognomy, reading fate or character from a person’s face, is now discredited but was once seen as a teachable skill. This thesis presents a cross cultural study of physiognomic knowledge in three distinct early modern cultures (Europe, China and Mughal India), as represented in figurative art. Artworks studied are mainly paintings, but also some sculpture and printed material, including physiognomic manuals. Using Clifford Geertz’s anthropological approach of identifying how art functions within a “cultural system”, the subsequent interactions are divided into two categories: representations of the Self (elite male patrons, or the artist himself), and representations of the Other (women, the poor, and the foreign). Representations of the Self are found in portraiture. Given the largely unspoken nature of physiognomy, it is necessary to examine how its use may be recognized within portraits. Anxieties surrounding appropriate representations of physiognomy are also important in understanding how art and physiognomy interacted. Conversely, representations of the Other are found in genre paintings and some portraits. The overall impact of physiognomy in these artworks is to emphasise innate differences between the patron Self and his Other. Ultimately, the resulting prevalence of physiognomy in figurative art suggests its transcultural importance within the early modern world.","['physiognomy', 'China', 'Europe', 'Mughal India', 'early modern history', 'figurative art', 'manuals', 'Self and the Other', 'portraiture', 'genre art']"

The Role of Islam in Creating Communities for Central Asian Migrants in Moscow,"Cagliani, Federica","['Williams, Corey']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis discusses the relevance of Islam in creating communities for Central Asian migrants in Moscow. Drawing upon academic sources and Russian newspapers, the analysis of the role of Islam for migrants has focused on places frequently attended by Central Asian people in Moscow. It emerges that migrants attending mosques consider Islam as the main source to negotiate their identity while abroad, as well as the common denominator that helps them in developing personal connections. Moreover, the role of Islam in ethnic cafés and bazaars is described, showing that activities, behaviors and relationships developed in these places are often influenced by Islamic rules and values. In addition, a possible evolution of the role of Islam for migrants has been proposed through a comparison of the Muscovite situation with Vienna and West Berlin in 1950s and 1960s. Based on these analyses, it can be concluded that Islam plays a crucial role for migrants in various dimensions. Indeed, Islam may be helpful to tolerate their precarious living conditions, to provide norms and values, and to form communities based on the common religious background.","['Islam', 'Moscow', 'Central Asian migrants', 'community formation']"
Didactic irony and the realm of uncertainty,"Ferguson, Lea Maria","['Verstraten, P.W.J.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the present thesis, I explore the notion of didactic irony, irony’s teaching that enables a critical and responsible reading process. I explain how didactic irony manifests itself in different intensities and orientations but always in relation to the realm of uncertainty. In teaching and simultaneously questioning, didactic irony points to the underlying uncertainty of meaning, knowledge, and truth. I conceptualise literature as asking for and thereby stimulating the active participation of the reader in the process of reading. Didactic irony may be seen as an important means of creating critical distance and responsibility, in literature and life alike. The connection between literature and life here exists in the critical and responsible process of interpretation that precedes all acquisition of knowledge. Especially when reading the legend of Gregorius, this connection may be seen as a stimulating ‘lesson in reading’. I thus investigate three adaptations of the legend of Gregorius by analysing Hartmann’s von Aue medieval verse epic Gregorius (ca. 1190), Thomas Mann’s modernist novel Der Erwählte (1951), and Jörg Udo Lensing’s postmodernist film Gregorius auf dem Stein (2012).","['Didactic irony', 'Legend of Gregorius', 'Reader responsibility', 'Realm of uncertainty', 'Adaptation']"
New Social Movements versus Populist Movements: The Case of the Chilean Student Protest since 2006,"Döring, Alexandra","['Bader, Max']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Currently, there are social movements and protests all over the world, like the occupy Wall Street movement in the United States, the current student movements in Amsterdam or the Penguin Revolution (Student protests for free education) in Chile. The research paper analyzes the current student movement in Chile because it is important to conceptualize the characteristics of this movement in order to understand what motivates it. Therefore, the research question; ‘To what extent can the Chilean Student movement since 2006 be considered a populist movement, rather than a new social movement?’, is answered. The paper reaches the conclusion that the Chilean student movement could rather be considered a populist movement than a New Social Movement, as indicated by the fact that the Chilean case has 15 matching characteristics with the theory of populist movements. In Chapter 1, this article discussed the literature on New Social Movements and populist movement theories. Some characteristics are more important than others, like the organization or the charismatic leader. Those variables evolved over time, which means that the movement might have started out as a new social movement but is a populist one by now. The use of new social media is also very important for the Chilean protesters because this makes the movement very organized.","['New Social Movements', 'Resource Movements', 'Populist Movements']"

The Development of China’s Military and Balance of Power in East Asia,"Laparre de Saint Sernin, Theophile de","['Pieke, Frank']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the wake of the 20th century, China has emerged as a major power, both in Asia and the world. The country has been through tremendous economic growth, pushed by drastic reforms undertaken after the end of Mao’s regime. Today, China is developing new military capabilities, acquiring new technologies that have increased the country’s ability for power projection. In a region with strong interstate rivalries, China’s increasing military power is seen with defiance by its neighbors. Military power is one of the key aspects of hard balancing in the balance of power theory. After contextualizing China’s military development, by illustrating how external threats have urged the country to modernize its armed forces, we will thus use the balance of power theory to analyze how China’s increasing military capabilities are affecting its relations with other countries in Asia, and its relations with the US. Although regional tensions have been on the rise in the recent years, China has proven that it is willing to cooperate in supranational organizations, providing an element of discussion in forecasting the region’s future stability. This thesis provides an assessment of China’s military development, its impact on interstate relations with China, and aims to stress the importance of dialogue and cooperation through diplomatic channels in order to integrate China in the international community and appease tensions in the region.","['China', 'Military Development']"

Syncope in Lycian,"Kasteelen, Frank van de","['Kloekhorst, Alwin']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Syncope, or the dropping of vowels from within a word, is one of the most distinctive features of the Lycian languages within the Anatolian branch. The exact conditions for this syncope have long evaded linguists. This study aims to clarify the rules and restrictions regarding syncope in Lycian. The first chapter will briefly describe the Lycian language, as well as Lycia, the country where it was spoken. The second chapter will define the place of Lycian within the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family. Before undertaking the description of a certain feature in a certain language, it is wise to first narrowly define that feature. This will be done in the third chapter. The fourth chapter will first give an overview of the previous scholarship on syncope in Lycian, after which a detailed analysis will be attempted. This analysis will shed light on the stress patterns of Lycian and show that syncope had worked in a specific period in the past of the language, but that it had since ceased to operate. The fifth and last chapter will summarise the conclusions. This study found that verbs were stressed on the root, or on the suffix, and that nouns were stressed penultimately. Both pre- and post-tonic syllables were syncopated if they were short at the time that syncope took place. In many cases syncope was reversed by paradigmatic levelling.","['Lycian', 'Anatolian', 'syncope', 'Indo-European', 'comparative linguistics']"

Naast hoofdpersonage Jia Baoyu is de roman rijk aan vele andere hoofd- en bijfiguren. Er is één familielid binnen de traditionele Chinese familie dat men in het Westen niet of nauwelijks kent: de concubine, of de bijvrouw. Mannen hoefden met één vrouw niet tevreden te zijn, maar mochten met meerdere vrouwen trouwen. Dit was geen overspel, maar een officieel erkend fenomeen waar vele regels en principes aan verbonden waren. De echtgenote lijkt hier aan het kortste eind te trekken. De reacties van andere personages op concubines in De droom van de rode kamer zijn overwegend negatief, misschien zelfs negatiever dan wanneer er sprake is van ontrouw binnen het huwelijk. Waar ligt de grens tussen een concubine en een affaire? Zijn het twee kwaden, of is er ook een positieve kijk op de concubine te vinden?

Isolated in the Empire? Localism and Roman legislation on Judaism in Asia Minor and Alexandria,"Janssen, Karen P.S.","['Zangenberg, Jürgen K.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The legal and political position of the Jewish population of the Imperium Romanum is an oft-debated and exceedingly complex topic. After all, the attitude of the Roman state towards its Jewish subjects varied substantially over the course of the Judeo-Roman relationship, ranging from explicit legal advancement in the form of honours and exemption from military service to open military conflict in the form of three Judeo-Roman wars. A number of scholars have attempted to resolve the apparently contradictory evidence, and form a generalized picture of ‘the’ attitude of ‘the’ Roman state towards ‘the’ Jews. While their descriptions of this Roman attitude vary strongly, they overwhelmingly assume that centralized Roman policy was ultimately what determined the experience of Jews throughout the Empire. This thesis will discuss how local circumstances influenced the legal and political treatment of the Jews in the Roman Empire, focussing on the case studies of Alexandria and Asia Minor. By studying the inception, contents and implementation of Roman legislation on Judaism, this thesis will argue that local factors were of fundamental importance to each of these three phases, and that intervention of the central government occurred primarily to deal with extraordinary circumstances. Thus, while local and interregional events were often connected, the existence of a single, coherent Roman policy towards Jews throughout the Empire ultimately cannot be proven.","['Roman law', 'ancient Judaism', 'localized approach', 'Alexandria', 'Asia Minor', 'Jewish history']"

The Mill on the Floss: George Eliot on Imagination and the Art of Sympathy,"Matthee, Marielle","['Newton, Michael S.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The art of sympathy constitutes an essential element in George Eliot’s concept of authorship. Regarding her novel The Mill on the Floss (1860), this thesis examines the function of imagination and how George Eliot seeks to develop this function within the realm of the realist novel. The thesis starts with describing Eliot's view on the art of sympathy influenced by e.g. Feuerbach's concept of double-consciousness and Hazlitt’s discussion of Shakespearean sympathy and how she thinks it should be applied to the realist novel. A second section proposes a new reading of The Mill on the Floss based on one of Bakhtin’s theories, as explicated in his essay Discourse in the Novel (1975). This is done to distinguish the narrator's voice from George Eliot's own voice and to examine what Eliot implies with the narrator’s different shifts (and inconsistencies). The next two sections present the narrator and the difficulties he has when telling the story of Maggie Tulliver. First, the thesis discusses the difficulty the narrator is faced with when he discovers that Maggie's characteristics and circumstances go beyond his scientific comprehension of life. Second, the thesis illustrates that when seeking the audience's sympathy for his character Maggie, the narrator is confronted with the inaptness of the contemporary literary conventions to do so. These last two sections give insights on how Eliot both explores and expresses the limits of its omniscient narrator’s knowledge and style, and experiments with how she can replace it with the ‘art of sympathy’.","['George Eliot', 'Mikhail Bakhtin', 'The Mill on the Floss', 'Art of Sympathy', 'Narrator', 'Imagination', 'Realism']"

The water network supplied the neighborhoods of Kasımpaşa, Galata, Tophane, Fındıklı, and Kabataş, and was primarily financed from the privy purse of Saliha Valide Sultan. In addition, the queen mother selected a number of wealthy and loyal dignitaries to invest in the project by means of a monumental fountain. The fountain network confirmed the social contract that was negotiated between the sultan and his favorites, and put the social network of the former at the center of a ""negotiated empire"".

The Poe Phenomenon and Cthulhu Mythos - A Cross-Cultural Genre Comparison in the Japanese Afterlives of Poe and Lovecraft,"Hoogerbrug, J.E.","['Smits, I.B.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis illuminates the idea of a cross-cultural genre comparison within the field of Literary Studies. Commonly, this means focussing on a certain genre and its characteristics within the literatures of two or more different cultural contexts. However, as an experiment, this thesis assumes the narrative status of literature and contemporary popular culture to be similar. This would mean that it is possible to compare genres cross-culturally within literature and within other types of media. After discussing the field of World Literature and the existence of transcultural narratives, the thesis will move on to a case study between American and Japanese authors. To clarify the potential and usefulness of cross-cultural genre comparisons, three genres will be looked at: gothic, mystery/detective and Lovecraftian weird tale literature. The first two will be explored in short stories by American author Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) and those by three Japanese writers, namely Tanizaki Junichirō 谷崎潤一郎 (1886-1965), Akutagawa Ryūnosuke 芥川龍之介 (1892-1927) and Edogawa Rampo 江戸川乱歩 (1894-1965). The third genre will be used to see how the literary characteristics of weird tales by American author H.P. Lovecraft (1890-1937) have been used, not only in Japanese literature, but also in Japanese popular culture, like manga and anime. As such, it will eventually show how key conventions within the genres of gothic, mystery/detective and Lovecraftian weird tale literature cannot be explained from within one national or cultural context alone and how cross-cultural and cross-media studies add to the international potential of Literary Studies.","['America', 'Japan', 'Genre', 'Gothic', 'World Literature', 'Transcultural', 'Popular Culture', 'Weird Tales', 'Detective']"

Specifically, it looks into the recent changes in Russia’s energy policies towards Ukraine, most notably the increase in gas prices and the termination of discounts, that have led to a gas dispute between the two parties. In order to do so, a discourse analysis is conducted on speeches, interviews and other documents like news updates and transcripts of official visits that were issued by the Russian and Ukrainian governments. The results of this thesis show that different actors can have a significantly different perception of certain events, depending on the ways in which they ascribe meaning to them. It is shown that while the Russian official discourse surrounding the 2014 gas dispute has a strong commercial focus, presenting legal and economic arguments to justify Russia’s actions, the Ukrainian discourse frames it as an issue of politics and national security, perceiving it as part of the broader military conflict between the two states.","['Russia', 'Ukraine', 'energy', 'gas', 'discourse analysis']"
Among Sufi Saints,"Boccaccini, Enrico","['Seyed-Gohrab, Ashgar']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to add to our conception of the role of commentaries and the workings within the networks of medieval Muslim intellectuals, by analysing the way in which the Persian mystic Sayyid ʿAli Hamadani treats and defines the mystical symbolism of the Egyptian mystic Ibn al-Farid's Khamriyya. The translation and analysis of Hamadani's commentary (Masharib al-Adhwaq) supports the view that mystical authors often composed commentaries on poetry mainly to present and support their own theosophical system. Hence, the analysis of Masharib al-Adhwaq reveals many of the basic concepts of Islamic mysticism that can be traced back to such eminent scholars as Ibn ʿArabi or al-Ghazali. This thesis also seeks to contribute to our understandings of the way Persian authors employed prosimetry (i.e. the mixing of prose and verse). The analysis of the interactions between Ibn al-Farid's verses and Hamadani's prose and verse explanations suggests a dialectic between the prose and poetry passages that reflects both the explicit and the implicit intention behind writing a mystical commentary.","['Sufism', 'Sayyid ʿAli Hamadani', 'Ibn al-Farid', 'Masharib al-Adhwaq', 'Khamriyya', 'prosimetry', 'commentary']"

This development immediately raises the question of to what degree the Western conceptualization of happiness and related virtues introduced by positive psychology can be generalized and applied outside the western context. The concept of happiness in the Islamic tradition when no longer connected to any ontological, historical and cultural collective context can easily be transformed in meaning according to the contemporary socio-political and economic ideologies in a certain society. Therefore, in order to effectively benefit from the richness of Islamic religious wisdom, I think it is important to also have a perception of happiness within Islam’s own cultural, yet especially theological framework. This thesis attempts to examine, the underlying value system of humanistic, but mainly positive psychology related to happiness and presents an Islamic outlook on human potential and the associated objectives and values that the Quran regards as determinants of human happiness. The research question of this thesis reads: “What are the fundamental differences when the Western perspective on happiness in positive psychology is compared with the perspective on happiness from a Quranic understanding?”","['Happiness', 'Islam', 'Positive Psychology', 'Virtue of Justice', 'Human nature']"

Se comprenden las razones estructurales que causan el conflicto y el desplazamiento, que por ende repercute en la adaptabilidad a las ciudades. La agencia de los migrantes es relativa a razón de aumentar la seguridad, causa del viaje y cuya adaptabilidad varía según la resiliencia de los migrantes y del proceso de aculturación en los lugares de llegada. Las condiciones socio-económicas de los migrantes internos rurales-urbanos, tienden a decaer pues el cambio de un lugar de vida a otro, pese a ser una estrategia de sobrevivencia, no implica que la adaptabilidad sea exitosa, relativa a los recursos individuales sociales y de asistencia social y política. Las migraciones son efecto de conflicto, lo que en Colombia han sido históricamente ubicados en las periferias de las ciudades. Estos tienen causas políticas y sociales, sea de adquisición de los recursos de la tierra o de los recursos legales o ilegales en las ciudades. Se estudia el proceso de desplazamiento desde una óptica histórica, de “La Violencia” a presente pues con ello se puede hacer seguimiento de la migración forzada como una constante histórica y de las causas estructurales del desplazamiento. Posteriormente, se reconoce si hay o no traumas que los desplazados sobrepasan a corto plazo o al pasar el tiempo, o que sean resilientes. Los desplazados sobreviven a corto plazo en la ciudad si tienen recursos adaptativos, tanto individuales, comunitarias y de la asistencia económica y social del estado. Sobre todo, la migración a las ciudades implica una planeación urbana y economía, pues la demanda bienes y servicios genera un cambio social a largo plazo.","['Desplazamiento forzado', 'conflicto bélico', 'resiliencia', 'adaptabilidad', 'America Latina', 'Colombia']"
Riyadh Against the Spring: Shaping perceptions in the Middle East?,"Freitas e Costa, Francisco","['Warnaar, M.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This Thesis focuses on the regional effects of the Saudi regional foreign policy in reaction to the Arab Spring. Establishing the legitimacy of the Saudi regime in the transnational Wahhabi Sunni Islam, the Arab Spring is viewed as an ideological and existential threat to the regime in Riyadh. On the other hand, the transnational character of the regime’s legitimacy contains the important connection between its survival and its regional foreign policy. These theoretical assumptions justify the Thesis’ focus on the sectarian dimension of the Saudi policies’ effects. As the research shows, continuously blaming Iran for the protests in Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Yemen or Syria and, simultaneously, portraying these protests as a “Shi’a revival”, has reinforced Saudi and regional identification of Iran with Shi’a Muslims’ struggles. Consequentially, Saudi policies have inevitably facilitated the determination of any struggle mainly involving Shi’a, regardless of any sectarian dimension in its nature, as exclusively based on religion and, therefore, unquestionably supported by Iran. In this sense, as well, Saudi actions have determinately layered Middle Eastern conflicts after the Arab Spring with an increasing sectarian tone.","['Saudi Arabia', 'Middle East', 'Sectarianism', 'Arab Spring', 'Iran']"

When the decision was made of choosing Costa Rica and the national identity as object of study in order to execute the research that is part of the master, the matter of understanding the concept of national identity was the first major task; it is a rather comprehensive and difficult concept to clarify. The main ideas and theories discussed in this thesis concern the formation of the national identity of Costa Rica with regard to possible included white tendencies or whiteness. Elements such as these supposedly would have been incorporated in the identity of the nation; due to exclusion of minority groups within the country from the national image, such as the indigenous, Afro-Caribbean or Nicaraguan population. It is of importance to investigate if the presumed seclusion or segregation had already been integrated in the identity of Costa Rica or rather it emerged during its creation or modification.","['Costa Rica', 'national identity', 'minority groups']"

Although the extent to which the Mongol conquest has exerted influence on Russia’s institutions has been widely debated among scholars, no consensus has been reached so far. This thesis has sought to understand how the debate about the Mongol yoke evolved over the past two centuries in order to explain what this reveals about Russia’s current state of self-identification. Three periods proved to be key. During the first period Russian imperial historians formulated a so called ‘black legend’. The second period is characterised by a ‘white legend’ that was created by Eurasianists. The third period proves that the debate has become highly idealized for geopolitical goals. Such diverse outcomes acknowledge that Russians are in search for an identity that is not Western or European. Still, the Mongol legacy is no ideal solution either. The Mongol period solely forms an acceptable solution for the time being. However, since the identity debate is still undecided it is not likely that Mongol ‘yoke’ in academic circles will be lifted any time soon.","['Mongol yoke', 'Scholarly debate', 'Black and white legend', 'Russian imperial historians', 'neo-Eursianism', 'Eurasianism']"
Een mond om in te lijsten! Een corpusonderzoek naar framing in reclames voor tandpasta,"Smeenk, Eline","['Jansen, Henrike']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Er is al veel onderzoek gedaan naar de overtuigingstechniek framing. Met framing kunnen lezers beïnvloed worden, omdat met framing een bepaalde kijk op een onderwerp wordt geactiveerd. Er zijn verschillende theorieën die voorspellingen doen over de effectiviteit van overtuigings-middelen. In deze scriptie is nagegaan of resultaten over framing die volgden uit wetenschap-pelijk onderzoek, als kennis worden toegepast in het bedrijfsleven. O’Keefe en Jensen (2007) concludeerden uit hun meta-analyse dat bij teksten over mondhygiëne het preventieve positieve frame het meeste effect heeft op gedragsverandering. Bij een preventief positief frame wordt gedrag aanbevolen dat voorkomt dat negatieve effecten optreden (‘Als je met deze tandpasta poetst, voorkom je gaatjes’). Als een negatief effect wordt voorkomen, is dat positief. Behalve preventieve positieve frames, zijn er ook preventieve negatieve frames (‘Als je niet met deze tandpasta poetst, krijg je gaatjes’), maar ook detectieve positieve frames (‘Als je met deze tand-pasta poetst, wordt tandplak verwijderd’) en detectieve negatieve frames(‘Als je met deze tand-pasta poetst, blijft tandplak zitten’). Bij een detectief frame is er al sprake van een bepaalde situatie, die opgelost kan worden of die behouden kan worden. De laatste drie types van framing zouden minder effectief zijn. Frames die refereren aan de negatieve gevolgen van het gedrag, zogenaamde fear appeals, zouden zelfs averechts kunnen werken (Jansen et al. 2008). Tand-pastamerken zouden deze informatie goed kunnen gebruiken, om de verkoop van hun tandpasta te vergroten. Middels een corpusonderzoek is nagegaan of het type framing dat volgens het onderzoek van O’Keefe en Jensen (2007) het meest effectief is, namelijk preventieve positieve framing, ook het meest wordt gebruikt in teksten die de tandpasta’s van de acht grootste tand-pastamerken moeten promoten. Ook is geanalyseerd hoeveel procent van de teksten in beslag genomen werden door de verschillende types framing. Gebleken is dat in bijna alle teksten gebruik werd gemaakt van een positief frame. Het frame dat door O’Keefe en Jensen (2007) als meest effectief was bestempeld, preventief positief, werd echter niet significant vaker gebruikt dan het detectieve positieve frame. Het lijkt er dus op dat de schrijvers van tandpastateksten niet het advies hebben opgevolgd dat volgens de wetenschap het meest effectief was. Wanneer er een negatief frame werd ingezet, stond daar in alle gevallen minstens één positief frame tegenover. De schrijvers hebben dus waarschijnlijk wel rekening gehouden met angst voor tandartsen, en dat het niet effectief zal zijn om alleen nega-tieve situaties voor te spiegelen wanneer mensen al bang zijn. De tekstlengtes bleken nogal te verschillen, zowel tussen de merken als binnen de mer-ken, waardoor het om goed te kunnen vergelijken nodig was om niet alleen het aantal woorden per type framing te tellen, maar ook het totale aantal woorden per tandpastatekst. Door de tellingen in percentages te weergeven, kon beter vergeleken worden welk type framing het grootste deel van de teksten in beslag nam. Uit deze analyse bleek dat het preventieve positieve frame niet significant het grootste percentage van de teksten in beslag nam. Het percentage tekst waarin preventief positief geframed werd, verschilde niet van het percentage tekst waarin detectief positief geframed werd. Ondanks dat volgens O’Keefe en Jensen (2007:633) preven-tieve positieve framing het meest effectief is in teksten over mondhygiëne, is dat type framing niet het meest gebruikte type framing is in teksten over tandpasta’s gebleken.","['framing', 'tandpasta', 'reclame']"

The Genitive of negation in Latvian: theory and quantitative analysis of dainas,"Andrejevs, Ilja","['Helden, W.A. van']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The problem of the Genitive of negation is one of the most up-to-date in current Russian linguistic discussion. The nature of the Genitive Rule in Russian is still unclear and the register of papers devoted to this scientific question grows constantly. The Genitive Rule is also popular topic for researchers, whose scientific interest belongs to other Slavonic languages (for instance, Polish) or the same language family (for example, Lithuanian). Considering the relevance of the problem, it was decided to find out if the Genitive Rule also exists in Latvian language. During the theoretical part of the work, it turned out that, it is possible to use the negated Genitive in place of the Accusative with the transitive verbs, however, the use of the negated Genitive is rather archaic; it is stylistically marked, and, as a rule, it occurs in fiction. The negated Accusative shows dominance in modern literary Latvian. However, since literary Latvian is very young (about one hundred years), since the dominance of the negated Accusative in old Latvian was not proved, and, finally, since no special papers devoted to the Genitive of negation in Latvian exist, it was aimed to make a quantitative analysis of the situation in Old Latvian and Latvian dialects. For the above mentioned purposes, Latvian popular songs (dainas) were taken as a main source. The analysis of the work was carried out manually. After analyzing more than 20000 dainas, it was found out, that the negated Accusative was not unambiguously dominant before Latvian was codified. In additon to that, it was proved than in one region of Latvia (Latgale) the negated Genitive occurred even more frequent. The results and the corpus of current thesis could be very useful for further semantic and syntactic research.",['The genitive of negation in Latvian']

Onderwerpen die ter sprake komen zijn onder andere urbanisatie (verstedelijking), sloppenwijken (de barrios) en veiligheid en onderwerpen die daarmee in verband staan, zoals geweld en criminaliteit. Daarnaast wordt er een beschrijving gegeven van de ontwikkeling van de barrios in Caracas, waarbij aandacht is voor de sociale urbane geschiedenis en de huidige situatie van de stad.

Occupy Central: The Framing Contest of the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong,"Ho, Kimberley","['Salmenkari, T.M.', 'Robbe, Ksenia']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In July 2014, tens of thousands of protestors from various social groups took to the streets in what could be Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy protest ever after a number of pro-democracy movements in earlier years. In the following month, the Chinese government eliminates the possibility of a fully democratic election for a new Hong Kong leader in 2017, as the protesters claim has been promised to them by Beijing in late 2007. The new decision has made it impossible for politicians to take part in this election without prior approval by Beijing. September 28 marked the start of Occupy Central as students and supporters set up their tents on the streets. For weeks on end the occupation goes on in protest of the limitation of ‘real democracy’, with more than 100,000 people participating in the Occupy Central protest at its peak. This occupation came to an end only on December 15 when the Hong Kong authorities cleared the last occupation site – however, the Umbrella Movement has not yet come to an end and, from time to time, makes its way back into the local headlines. This paper aims to identify the ways in which the Hong Kong identity is framed by both the protesters themselves and the local news media in the context of the Umbrella movement. For this purpose a combination of content analysis and discourse analysis will be used to examine a selection of news excerpts from the period ranging from September until December 2014.","['Occupy Central', 'Hong Kong', 'Umbrella Movement', 'Framing', 'Content Analysis', 'Media Representation']"

The thesis aims at finding evidence that can either prove or disprove some of the many theories with respect to the evolution of the East-Slavic languages (these theories are also included in the thesis). The theories that are discussed in the thesis differ with respect to how much credit is given to the Polish language in the development of East-Slavic. Therefore, investigating whether or not Polish did play a role in the language development of the East-Slavic area provides us with material that can make certain theories more plausible than others. Various texts - the oldest dating to 1229 and the youngest texts to the 19th century - were analysed and scored on present and past verb inflection, the use of auxiliary verbs and the declension of the nominative adjective (thereby paying special attention to the possibility of gender distinction in nominative plural).","['East-Slavic', 'Linguistics', 'Language development']"

Onder invloed van moderne communicatie- en transportmogelijkheden lijkt er sprake te zijn van kosmopolitisme naast conventionele vormen van migratie. Met behulp van theorie van Peter Hallward en zijn begrippen ‘singulier’ en ‘specifiek’ onderzoek ik of er sprake is van een koloniale of postkoloniale benadering van migrantenliteratuur in de eenentwintigste eeuw. Daarnaast baseer ik mij op socioloog Ulrich Beck om globalisering en kosmopolitisme te vergelijken met het nationalistisch bepaalde beeld van migratie: hoe verhouden deze conceptualiseringen zich tot elkaar en welke literaire representaties levert dit op? Ik pas deze theorie toe in een analyse van het discours in de roman De asielzoeker van Arnon Grunberg. Hierbij kom ik tot de conclusie dat de afbakening van migrantenliteratuur aan een herziening toe is. Een uitbreiding van migrantenliteratuur tot geglobaliseerde literatuur (waarin zowel migratie als kosmopolitisme past) lijkt mij wenselijk in deze geglobaliseerde tijd.,"['Migrantenliteratuur', 'Kosmopolitisme', 'Arnon Grunberg', 'Peter Hallward', 'singulier', 'specifiek', '(Post)kolonialisme']"

2016 Market Economy Treatment for China? An assessment from a EU perspective,"Schaefer, Lisa","['Wang, Jue']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"“There’s no automaticity about the decision [to grant China market-economy treatment]. We need to make a formal decision and table a law.” Source: Interview with Cecilia Malmström, Wall Street Journal 2014 This quote by the European Union’s (EU) trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in 2014 represents the current state of affairs regarding the upcoming query on whether to grant China market economy status (MES) in 2016. Art. 15 (d) of China’s accession protocol to the World Trade Organization (WTO) stipulates that the ongoing non-market economy status (NMES) is no longer applicable after 2016. This pressures the EU to draft a proper decision on whether 2016 will be the year in which it recognizes China’s economy as a market economy, making it significantly more difficult to initiate anti-dumping duties against Chinese imports. This justifies the need to better understand the concept of MES and its influence on anti-dumping disputes between Europe and China. The WTO classifies dumping in Art. 2 of its anti-dumping agreement (ADA) and Art. VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 as “[introducing a product] into the commerce of another country at less than its normal value”. By definition the ‘normal value’ refers to a “comparable price in the ordinary cause of trade” between international traders which determine whether competition is fair. Thus, it ensures that products are not ‘dumped’ on another economy for less than the domestic price in its country of origin. In that regard, MES becomes an important tool because it determines the ‘ordinary cause of trade’. Accordingly, a comparison between different markets can only be fair, if they operate under similar conditions: that of a market economy.","['China-EU relations', 'EU foreign policy', ""China's Market economy treatment"", 'international relations', 'international political economy', 'WTO']"
Mexican Immigrants in El Paso: Integration and Political Influence Since 1965,"Aguirre Broca, Maria Fernanda","['Ballantyne, David T.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"For years, Mexicans have migrated to the United States in search of the American Dream. From the moment a Mexican becomes an American citizen, the immigrant is expected to assimilate to the country’s culture and politics. This thesis addresses whether these assimilating immigrants actually have any influence on local politics in Texas, specifically El Paso, since 1965. The research answers this question from an individual and local-level perspective of first person accounts in El Paso Texas on political discontent and influence, as well as a local perspective on the assimilation of Mexican immigrants in El Paso.This type of study has not been done before on the local level in El Paso and therefore helps contribute to research on Mexican immigration. Historians and sociologists have focused mainly on the difficulties Mexicans face when migrating into the US, but have not explored the after-effects of these migrations. Three main topics create the foundation of this research, namely assimilation, political representation, and immigration policies for Mexican immigrants in El Paso, Texas. By using literary research as well as interviews with Mexicans who live or have lived in, or close to, El Paso it was found that Mexican immigrants are assimilating to American ways, yet they remain distant when it comes to politics. Because of this distance and disinterest in the subject, Mexicans have little-to-no influence on the politics of the country. Because of the growth in their population, they have become increasingly powerful and have managed to increase their representatives in politics. Yet, when it comes to officially voting or changing policies, Mexican immigrants do not practice this power. Thus, it is very unlikely that there will be a lot of influence on politics by the Mexican community. There has been an increasing influence on the representation of Mexicans, which has empowered them slightly; however, the Mexican community is so detached from the local political system, that it is not likely to create major changes in politics in the coming years.","['Mexico', 'immigration', 'United States', 'El Paso', 'Politics', 'Assimilation', 'Representation', 'Influence']"

Two of these texts are from England and one of them from the Netherlands, and they all, will be argued, contain depictions of dementia. These texts were written in a time when dementia was still seen, more or less, as a normal part of ageing, and even if dementia is never explicitly mentioned in either of the texts, by comparing these texts and the descriptions therein with contemporary medical literature about the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) it will be shown that the behaviour as it is described in the texts warrants a qualification of the described behaviour as being a depiction of dementia. This analysis will also include the depiction of the attitudes surrounding the described behaviour as collateral evidence for the qualification of the behaviour as dementia. It will further be shown that these representations of the disease in all three cases have a function beyond a mere depiction of a developing process, and that through the ways in which the descriptions are shaped, the process I designate as dementia becomes a metaphor for an underlying topic. For this, use will also made of an analysis of how in contemporary fiction dementia is represented and used.","['Dementia', 'Hoult', 'Van Velde', 'Beckett']"

Cuba’s medical internationalism – Medical diplomacy as a way to wield soft power?,"Frömmrich, Sophie","['Child, Mike']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Global health diplomacy or medical diplomacy is a concept and practice that describes the relationship between global health and foreign policy (Feldbaum et al. 1). Cooperation among health officials and diplomats is becoming increasingly important in current times, as health issues are transcending traditional nation-state borders, which is largely due to the spread of epidemics such as Ebola, SARS and BSE. Medical diplomacy is a way to wield soft power, especially for small developing countries such as Cuba, which would never have the capabilities of superpowers, such as the United States, to gain power in traditional means through military force or economic supremacy (Feinsilver,” Fifty years of Cuba's medical diplomacy” 100). Cuba has been engaging in medical diplomacy for over fifty years, long before health became relevant on global agendas. Therefore Cuba makes an exceptional case study to investigate when assessing global health diplomacy. This thesis intends to understand Cuba’s unique healthcare system at home and abroad in order to understand ‘how’ and ‘why’ it has become what it is today. In order to assess this topic, first the concept of power will be examined, looking in particular at soft power. Following, a particular soft power policy will be examined: Global health diplomacy and its importance in International Relations. Then Cuba’s domestic healthcare system will be scrutinized to comprehend how it has emerged and why it has become so successful. Consecutively, Cuba’s efforts in medical diplomacy will be inspected, with a focus on the Cuban-Venezuelan oil-for-doctors trade agreement, to answer the central question of this thesis: What are Cuba’s intentions behind its policy of medical diplomacy?","['Cuba Healthcare', 'Medical Diplomacy', 'Global Health Diplomacy', 'Cuban Health System']"

Een analyse van de verschillen in interpretatie tussen Hugenholtz en Bölsche vormt de opstap naar een beknopte verhandeling over het ontstaan, de aard en de betekenis van een specifieke stroming binnen het modernisme, namelijk het ethisch-modernisme.

Conditionality in China’s Foreign Policy: Analysis of Two Case Studies Norway and Africa,"Bore Øverland, Mari","['Wang, J.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"China claims to be one of the main followers and protectors of the principles of non-interference and sovereignty. It often invokes these principles either in order to protect itself from interference from Western states, or to defend its alternative approach to aid engagement in African countries (Pang 244-245). However, China also violates the principle of non-interference by putting conditions on other countries’ internal affairs, such as demanding that the government does not support issues that China is against, in return for its continued bilateral cooperation. Therefore, China’s foreign policy approaches and especially its use of conditionality seem contradicting. Such contradicting foreign policy approaches can be challenging to understand and counter for other states if the motivations are not known. The academic debate on China’s use of conditionality and foreign policy in general has failed to take into account a wide enough range of foreign policy approaches, something I attempt to do in my paper.","['China', 'Norway', 'Foreign Policy', 'Conditionality', 'Africa']"

It is ever more important for the EU to have a coherent EU-wide policy approach towards China as it creates greater mutual benefits for all member states. With a trade volume of 428 billion€ in 2013 and annual trade growth rate of 6.8% since 2009, the PRC is one of the EU’s most significant partner in trade and vice versa. Moreover, both regions could potentially impact international relations altogether by jointly challenging conventional norms and US hegemony via international institutions. Yet, various disputes have previously hampered the success of the strategic partnership. These include uncertainty within the EU to what direction the partnership should take, and, the weak institutional mechanism of annual summits with no clear objective. The goal of this dissertation is therefore, to find out what has to change in the EU strategy and member states interest accumulation and perception of China that can make the relationship more effective. Accordingly, the following research questions were addressed: How can the EU-China strategic partnership be more effective and constructive in foreign policy making? 1. To what extent is the newly formulated Europe-China 2020 Strategic Agenda of 2013 an improvement of the EU-China strategic partnership? 2. Are British and German national foreign policies vis-á-vis China competing with each other, which ultimately hampers the effectiveness of the EU-China strategic partnership?","['EU foreign policy', 'China', 'strategic partnership', 'pragmatisim']"
Korean Minorities in the Japanese Educational System,"Almeida, Silvia","['Ezawa, A.E.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"An educational system is very complex and dynamic, that is why there are many differences in systems between countries, but it can also differ from school to school. Nevertheless, what most countries have in common when it comes to education is that they are aiming for educational equality. They want for everyone to have equal educational opportunities and to be able to make the best out of their education. Japan is no exception and has educational equality as a goal. Japan’s educational system in the period before World War II was different from the current one. School was used to create and strengthen a sense of nationalism and to produce the kind of people to develop Japan as a nation state (Okano & Tsuchiya 1999, Rohlen 1983). After World War II the Allied occupation of Japan changed this. The Allied Forces wanted the nationalistic society replaced by a democratic one and saw education as one of the best way to do so. Japan’s educational system had seen many changes and improvements towards educational equality ever since (Okano & Tsuchiya 1999). Education of the individual became important and compulsory years of schooling were increased to nine years to give more people a chance at a better education. Japan also improved the educational equality by making it a law that everybody should get equal educational opportunities, creating a national curriculum for public as well as private schools and making education accessible for everyone, regardless of one’s sex or ethnicity. However, even with such improvements, the goal of educational equality is still yet to be reached. Educational equality proofs to be difficult to acquire as inequality exists in many different forms, even some which are yet to be fully recognized and maybe some that have not even been recognized at all. In this thesis the focus will be on the inequality in educational opportunity as well as in educational attainment and outcome, that ethnic minority groups in Japan face because of their ethnic identity. Even though minority groups are technically able to have the same education, a significant difference in educational attainment and outcome exists between minority groups and majority Japanese (Okano 2011, Boocock 2011, Okano & Tsuneyoshi 2011). In this thesis I look more into this and answer why, despite the fact that Japanese education has become more accessible for everyone, a lower educational attainment and outcome exists among minority groups in Japan. To answer this question I will start in the first chapter with examining what the general existing explanations are for these educational inequalities that ethnic minority groups experience when it comes to attainment and performance. In the second chapter I will discuss the general situation of minority groups in the Japanese education and the educational equality they might be facing. Thereafter, in the third chapter I will try to look at it from the perspective of students themselves to identify factors related to their ethnicity that may have an impact on their education. I will use case studies from Yasunori Fukuoka’s research (2000), on young ethnic Korean people in Japan and their ethnic identity, and look at their school experience. I chose for this ethnic minority group because it is an invisible minority group as they physically do not differ from the majority Japanese and thus blend in well. Another reason for this group is, the fact that it is one of the largest minority groups in Japan and for a long time had been the largest group, and also because there are Korean schools in Japan. This can be used to compare the school experience at a Korean and a Japanese school and to get a better picture. Lastly, with the outcome of the previous chapters, I will come to a conclusion to answer the research question of this thesis.","['Education', 'Ethnic Minorities', 'Ethnic Koreans', 'Japan']"

(Rico)']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis concludes that Gabriel Marcel’s notion of the spirit of abstraction provides us with important insights regarding how and why the Republican army was able to repress the community of Canudos as viciously as it did. As put by Blundell, “The process of abstraction, which Marcel also refers to as primary reflection, “is, roughly speaking, purely analytical and (…) consists, as it were, in dissolving the concrete into its elements.””(p. 59). Once one of those elements is accorded, “isolated from all other categories, an arbitrary primacy, we are victims of the spirit of abstraction.” (Marcel, p. 155-156). By connecting his battle against the spirit of abstraction with issues such as fanaticism, the role of (communication) technology and the press, violence and war, religion and historiography, Marcel provides us with a unique perspective to use when analysing conflicts such as the Canudos War. Especially his emphasis on the role of language in the process of justifying war turned out to be particularly useful. As put by Johnson, “Naming, says De Certeau, is not “the ‘painting’ of a reality any more than it is elsewhere; it is a performative act organizing what it enunciates. It does what it says and constitutes the savagery it declares. (…) To understand subalternity thus is to side with the argument that it is a discursive effect.” (p. 30). Words, so it seems, are the primary vehicle through which the spirit of abstraction manifests itself.","['Brazil', 'Canudos War', 'Gabriël Marcel', 'Spirit of Abstraction', 'Visão do Litoral']"
Is he dead yet? Can I watch now? A study of immersion in three crucial death scenes in Homer's Iliad,"Clercx, Sebastiaan Godefridus","['Rademaker, A.M.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"How do you kill a hero? The deaths of Sherlock in the 19th century, and that of Eline Vere in Louis Couperus’ Eline Vere in the early 20th century stirred the hearts of their audiences to such a degree that people actually believed an actual person had died. In present popular culture, the death of a protagonist can still have a profound impact. Lord Eddard Stark’s death, the main protagonist in George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire: A Game of Thrones, comes rather unexpected and the very unorthodox way of killing the characters in the rest of this series has become a meme on the internet. The death of Brian the talking dog in the sit-com Family Guy (season 12, episode 6) even led to protest and Facebook pages to get him back into the series. Patroclus’ death is considered to be “terrifying”, and to have “great psychological depth” Janko (1992, p. 312). Together with Sarpedon’s death before and afterwards Hector’s, it is claimed by De Jong (2012, 13-15) to be the central death scene in the Iliad. With the modern examples in mind, the question arises how the narrator of the Iliad conveys the emotional charge these deaths have. To investigate how the audience is involved in their deaths, the study of immersion will be applied. This thesis will deal with the emotional involvement in the death scenes of three heroes: Sarpedon, Patroclus, and Hector. These deaths are knitted together. Patroclus kills Sarpedon, and against Achilles’ wishes, he rushes to the Trojan walls. There he is killed by Hector. In return, Hector is killed by Achilles to avenge his fallen friend Patroclus. Elements of Sarpedon’s death are repeated in Hector’s. Sarpedon is the leader of Troy’s allies, and second to Hector. In both scenes, Zeus deliberates on their deaths. In all killing scenes there are a dialogue, spoliation of armour, and threat of mutilation. There is a fight for Sarpedon’s, and Patroclus’ corpse; Hector’s is claimed by Achilles, and the Greeks only run around his body. The central question of this thesis will therefore be how these death scenes relate to each other and to other deaths in the Iliad. In order to substantiate judgments like “terrifying”, this research will assess scenes with the deaths of minor and major heroes. It can be expected that the former are less immersive than the deaths of major heroes that have a crucial role in the plot. Scene 6.1-24 will be assessed for minor heroes. Passage 16.394-867, Sarpedon’s and Patroclus’ deaths, and 22.90-404, that of Hector, are examined as examples of the deaths of major heroes. I will argue that visual and sensory immersion is present in most deaths, but that emotional immersion is used mostly in passages important to the development of the story. The continuation of the same mental space will be shown to be an important feature of visual immersion in death scenes. Allan, De Jong, & De Jonge (2014) have already argued for the immersive style of Homer’s epic. This thesis will add to this claim that, when larger stretches of narrative are taken under scrutiny, it is revealed the Homeric narrator does not just use these immersive elements at random: there is logic to his choices.","[""Homer's Iliad"", 'Immersion', 'Enargeia', 'Hector', 'Patroclus', 'Sarpedon', 'Vividness', 'Emotional Involvement', 'Narratology']"

Slavery and Diasporic Identity in Two Counter Travel Narratives: Caryl Phillips's The Atlantic Sound and Ekow Eshun's Black Gold of the Sun,"Schepers, Suzanne Jasperdina Klasina","['Kardux, J.C.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis two recent travel narratives are discussed in which diasporic writers of African descent return to Ghana to work through both their personal problems of identity and exile and the collective trauma of slavery: Caryl Phillips’s The Atlantic Sound (2000) and Ekow Eshun’s Black Gold of the Sun (2005). Regarding Ghana as their ancestral homeland, Phillips and Eshun use the genre of the travel narrative to trace the physical, but more importantly psychological journey they undertake in hopes of resolving the problem of diasporic identity and feelings of non-belonging they have encountered in Britain and America. Their journey to Ghana, however, dismantles the idea of a homecoming and the concept of a whole sense of self. The silence and contradictions they find about the slavery past in Ghana force them to tell, and imagine, stories about well known historical figures instead, such as Jacobus Capitein, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Judge J. Waties Waring, as well as less known historical figures such as Ghanaian business man John Emmanuel Ocansey. These stories function partly as a means to affirm a sense of identity. Despite the fact that there is no real closure, both authors stress the necessity to remember and acknowledge the history of slavery. The journey to Ghana, and even more importantly writing the travel narrative, is a process of self-discovery; it is in the writing process that the authors, to some extent, come to terms with themselves and work through their ancestors’ slavery (and slave trading) history. They find a resolution in embracing a fluid identity.","['transatlantic slavery', 'travel narrative', 'black diasporic identity']"

This thesis examines Worker Recuperated Enterprises (WREs) in Argentina as they might represent viable work alternatives fighting unemployment and helping workers to stabilise their living conditions. This work aims to, firstly, analyse whether WREs embody viable work organisations. Secondly, investigate how effective WREs are in stabilising and improving socio-economic situation of the workers and, lastly, explore the strengths and limitations of this work model. The thesis objectives are threefold, yet the main argument can be synthesised as followed. WREs are feasible small-scale alternative work establishments which can help the struggling workers in particular contexts. However, WREs have to withstand numerous obstacles, such as restrictive Argentinian legal system,lack of capital and limited access to credit as well as adaptation to cooperative work model and mentality, among other issues. It is concluded that WREs are viable and useful work organisations thanks to which workers can live a decent and dignified life; yet, working in a WRE is accompanied by many sacrifices, compromises and numerous challenges to be overcome by their members.","['Alternative Labour Models', 'Self-Management', 'Worker Control and Ownership', 'Worker Recuperated Enterprises in Argentina', 'Worker Cooperatives in Argentina']"

On trade and development: EU-ACP Economic Partnership Agreements and the implications for human rights,"Trifonchovska, Victoria","['Oster, Jan']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the onset of the European project, there has been a pronounced tendency to work with the African continent – from trade arrangements through development cooperation, and more recently incorporating intensified political dialogue and a human rights dimension. In the year of 2000 the Cotonou Agreement ushered in a new phase in the EU-ACP relations: the EU undertook negotiations on a new framework – Economic Partnership Agreements – for its relationship with the ACP region. The EPAs combine trade, development and human rights dimensions, but also work toward the ultimate goal of ‘eradication of poverty’. Adopting Normative Power Europe as a theoretical framework, the thesis includes a comparative politics methodology and investigates the EPA implications for human rights in three African states. The findings confirm that the EU holds regular dialogue and actively encourages human rights promotion in Africa but is wary to invoke essential elements clauses and suspend aid when it comes to its strategic partners or trading concerns.","['Economic Partnership Agreements', 'EU', 'trade', 'development']"

The Third Eye.

Understanding Raghubir Singh and Raghu Rai” is focussing on the work of two Indian photographers. The research revolves around the question whether the work of Raghubir Singh and Raghu Rai contains specific cultural characteristics concerning the selection of subject matter and photographic genre. This involves the purpose of their work, the influence of visual culture, and the technical approach. Chapter One offers a description of specific features of Indian visual culture and perception in order to put Singh and Rai in context and outline their distinctive position as photographer. Elements from Indian spiritual life and arts are being connected to findings in neuroscience research related to perception of people. This concerns the question whether the photography by Raghubir Singh and Raghu Rai contains specific Indian visual and cultural elements. The work of Singh and Rai is varyingly described as street photography and documentary photography. In Chapter Two various definitions and descriptions of these genres are analysed and compared. Researched is if Singh and Rai have an approach that can be identified as either street or documentary photography. Both photographers once met and were inspired by Henri Cartier-Bresson. Having determined the visual context and denominated the photographic genre of Raghubir Singh and Raghu Rai, Chapter Three investigates whether and how Cartier-Bresson influenced both photographers, in which the concept of the ‘decisive moment’ inevitably is a point of attention as well. The research indicates that Singh and Rai’s photographic work is authentic. They have adapted photographic genres developed in Western culture to suit the Indian context and the purpose of their work. The implications however are that not all viewers will perceive their work. Comprehension is dependent on the level of familiarity with Indian culture. Furthermore, researchers applying Western theories of photography should be aware of potential bias in these concepts. As specific Indian historical and comparative research and theorization regarding Indian photography is not yet initiated further research in this field is recommended.","['Raghubir Singh', 'Raghu Rai', 'Documentary photography', 'Indian characteristics', 'Indian visual culture', 'Darshan', 'Western photography theory', 'Western bias', 'Limitations Western theory', 'Indian eyes']"

Shared Authority: Local cooperation in the construction of colonial governance on Java in the early 1830s,"Manse, Maarten","['Schrikker, Alicia']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Colonial governance in the Dutch East Indies revived after Johannes van den Bosch launched the infamous cultivation system on Java in 1830. Portrayed as the Dutch pinnacle of colonial exploitation, this system has been the topic of heated scholarly and non-scholarly debates. But apart from a system of colonial agricultural production, it also posed a framework for colonial governance. Crucial in this framework was the collaboration of the Javanese administrative elite with the Dutch. This thesis examines the relation between the Dutch local authorities and the indigenous rulers on Java in the early 1830s. An in-depth investigation of power-division and political games in the residencies (the provincial units of colonial control), it analyzes the techniques and tricks the Dutch and Javanese used to cope with each other. Daily practice of colonial governance seemed not to have been motivated really by any centrally organized ideology, but by the personal skills and experiences of the Dutch officials, and their ability to make use of the traditional power of the Javanese rulers. Describing a system of men rather than rules or laws, this thesis attempts to showcase the paradoxical character of Dutch colonial rule in practice, to stress that in colonial Southeast-Asia it were not merely the colonizers who constructed the colony.",

Aan de hand van Dewey en Heidegger wordt een begrip van de structuur van de onderzoeksactiviteit ontwikkelt. Deze dient als alternatief voor het gangbare begrip, waarmee een onderscheid gemaakt wordt tussen verschillende takken van onderzoek (het bekendste: het onderscheid geesteswetenschappelijk en natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek). Dat gangbare begrip van de structuur van onderzoek ontvangen we van Dilthey, het onderscheid volgt bij Dilthey uit een fundamenteel onderscheid dat hij maken moet (onder druk van Kant) tussen twee wijzen van ervaren.

This design, what he calls the Geviert (Fourfold), seems to appear out of nowhere. But on second thoughts it becomes clear that it is a continuation of his earlier work, and it is an answer to the problems of the European thinking. The main question of my study: ‘What includes Heideggers Geviert?’ The thesis consists of four chapters. The first focuses on the conception of the design of the Geviert in Heideggers earlier works, such as Sein und Zeit and Urpsprung des Kunstwerkes. The second one talks about two spheres, the earth and the sky. The third one focuses on the other two spheres, the mortal and the godlike. The fourth chapter treats the relationship and the dynamic between the four spheres. One of the insights is that each sphere contains the dynamic of Heraclit’ phusis-concept. Herewith Heidegger harks back to the origin of the Western thought to address to problems that have sprung into this thinking at the root.","['Geviert', 'Heidegger', 'Metaphysics', 'earth', 'sky', 'mortal', 'godlike', 'Heraclit', 'phenomenology']"

Contesting Interests: Rice and Sugar in the Late Colonial Java,"Feng, Ying","['Lindblad, J. Th.']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This is a study of a colonial economy from an agricultural perspective, focusing on the interaction and conflicts between rice and sugarcane production in Java during the late colonial period. Rice is the most important staple food, while sugarcane has been the principal cash crop between 1870s and 1920s. Since the natural habitats for two crops are similar in many respects but large-scale intercropping was precluded due to different irrigation practices, rice and sugarcane have been competing for the limited resource of land since the dawn of mass production at the end of the nineteenth century. This thesis attempts to answer whether the proliferation of sugar plantation contributed to the rice shortage in Java, and how the shortfall in rice might influence the distribution and expansion of sugar plantation in the tropical island. Besides the quantitative analysis with agricultural statistics, it also investigates the process of policy-making, in which the colonial government exerted regulatory influence over different interest groups as far as the production of rice and sugar were concerned in the 1910s and 1920s.","['rice', 'sugar', 'Java', 'Dutch colonialism']"

The Suppression of Resistance to Japanese American Wartime Evacuation and Incarceration,"Konecny, Lukas","['Kardux, Johanna']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Literature on wartime removal and incarceration of Japanese American describes the opposition and resistance to the governmental policies mostly in terms of deficiency. This interpretative bias is characterized by privileging the governmental account of the removal and incarceration over the Japanese American accounts while disregarding any incident short of civil disobedience as unimportant. Moreover, Japanese Americans' cooperation is seen as contributing greatly to the success of the procedures that ultimately deprived them of their liberty. This view, though widely held, does not provide an accurate description of Japanese American attitudes and actions during the fateful months after the Pearl Harbor attack. I will argue that the number of strikes, the extent of community organization, and the scope of individual and group protest inside the relocation camps testify that Japanese Americans' reaction to their wartime removal and incarceration was anything but passive. Japanese Americans protested against the injustice of their evacuation and incarceration, but they were systematically silenced, intimidated, and punished by the government. Moreover, the relocation program officials and generations of relocation scholars contributed to the marginalization of Japanese American resistance by uncritically accepting the governmental account of mass removal and incarceration which refused to recognize evacuee resistance as legitimate protest.","['Japanese Americans', 'Evacuation', 'Incarceration', 'Resistance', 'Suppression']"

Law and Order in Ancient Egypt. The Development of Criminal Justice from the Pharaonic New Kingdom until the Roman Dominate,"Loon, A.J. van","['Naerebout, F.G.']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In one way or another, the civilizations who ruled over Egypt in antiquity could all boast a close connection to the concepts of 'law' and 'justice'. Balance, justice, and order - all personified by the goddess Ma'at - were the cornerstones of Ancient Egyptian religion and society. The Greek Ptolemies, who ruled over Egypt between 323 and 30 BC, would become famous for their advanced and intricate bureacracy, which also featured a highly effective law enforcement system. The Romans, more than any, prided themselves on their laws, which remain influential in modern societies to this day. This thesis sets out to discover the manner in which criminal justice in Egypt developed from the times of the New Kingdom, through the Ptolemaic era, and under Roman rule. Not only for the abovementioned anecdotal reasons, but also because the capability to deal with crime and to maintain order can serve as an indicator for a successful administration in general. Because criminal law forms an integral part of a legal system as a whole, which, in turn, is inseparable from the general administrative system of a country, all of these will be taken into account. The following questions will be answered in this thesis: how were the various legal and administrative systems organized?; which actions were considered to be crimes by the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans?; who possessed the legal authority to deal with these matters?; and in what manner were criminal transgressions dealt with in practice? In the end, the aim is to not only find out how criminal justice developed in the course of nearly two millennia, but also to offer an explanation as to why these developments took their specific course.","['Law', 'Justice', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'Law Enforcement', 'Criminal Justice', 'Pharaonic Egypt', 'New Kingdom', 'Ptolemaic Egypt', 'Roman Egypt']"

Counterterrorism within the European Union. Terrorism as an 'argument' for improvement,"Hartog, Annemarie den","['Oster, Jan']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The bombings in New York on 9 September 2001 (9/11) made the European Union (EU) realize that it would be necessary to change European policies to combat this form of terrorism. This asked for a strong cooperation between different elements of the EU, such as the EU self, Member States and the European Police Office (Europol). Although it is Europol’s role to gather information that comes from the Member States concerning terrorists’ acts or behaviour and to act as an umbrella organisation, the cooperation between Europol and the Member States is difficult. Even so, after 9/11 the EU was capable in creating the ‘Plan of Action on Combating Terrorism’ to create the first guidelines to prevent that the EU would also be a victim of this form of terrorism in the future. To understand what the effect was of this Plan, this thesis looks into the question to what extent the EU has been using arguments such as terrorism to incentivize the Member States to take action against terrorism. This thesis will argue that this Plan was not very successful. The member states should make more use of the EU’s and Europol’s capabilities and increase and improve the cooperation between them all and that the EU should enhance the capabilities of Europol. Furthermore, the Member States should not only act when there is a massive attack as on 9/11, because it is better to prevent certain attacks and to minimalize the consequences and victims.","['European Union', 'Europol', 'Member States', 'Counterterrorism', 'securitization', 'disocurse analysis']"

Los maltratos suceden en el ámbito íntimo del hogar mientras que la violencia social ocurre en el ámbito público, visible para todos, lo que facilita formar una opinión y tomar medidas de acción. Las victimas muchas veces prefieren guardar el silencio. Desde los años ’80 después de ser una práctica poca reconocida, en algunos casos hasta socialmente aceptada, la violencia doméstica se ha convertido en una violación seria de los derechos humanos mundialmente. Por presión internacional con una demanda de reconocimiento de los derechos de la mujer en Latinoamérica se han implementado políticas públicas contra la violencia familiar. En Perú estos cambios iniciaron bajo el gobierno de Alberto Fujimori. Ha resultado en la modificación de leyes en la región que protegen el ámbito familiar y en 1993 se implementó una nueva ley en Perú cual define la violencia familiar y la categoriza como una falta o agravante en el caso que sea un delito (Ley N° 26260 Perú). Se clarificaran estos conceptos y se analizaran teorías sobre causas y efectos de la violencia familiar. Se explicara el contexto político e histórico en cual han evolucionado los derechos de la mujer y los movimientos feministas en Perú. La investigación fue realizada en Lima entre mayo y agosto del 2012. Se hizo una revisión bibliográfica y documental de publicaciones de ONG e instituciones oficiales como la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Los datos cuantitativos se usaron para adquirir una vista realista de la violencia doméstica en Lima y las medidas de ayuda que existen en el momento. Se visitaron 5 casas de refugio en diferentes distritos de la municipalidad de Lima. Se entrevistaron 6 usuarias albergadas, 15 trabajadoras de ONG, el Ministerio de la Mujer y Poblaciones Vulnerables (MIMP), y municipalidad de Lima para servir como información de contexto social y judicial. Se documentaron las experiencias de las usuarias albergadas. El objetivo fue identificar los cuellos de botella desde el momento que ellas deciden dejar al agresor y buscar ayuda ofrecida por ONG y el MIMP. También se documentaron características de las entrevistadas y los maltratos sufridos.","['violencia doméstica', 'casas de refugio', 'violencia familiar', 'violencia contra la mujer', 'Lima']"

How does the establishment of Russian-Brazilian relations during the Putin-Medvedev era confirm the importance of identity in Russian foreign policy?,"Huizing, Kimberley","['Gerrits, A.W.M.']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The goal of this essay is to prove that national identity, as perceived by the Russian leadership plays an important role in the making of Russian foreign policy. The thesis is that Russian-Brazilian relations confirm this importance of identity in Russian foreign policy. Although Russia and Brazil share certain commonalities when it comes to the size of the countries and populations, the leadership potential that comes with that, the developments they have gone through over the past century, similarities in their economies and some of the social issues they face today, in a practical sense they do not have that much in common. Geographically, they are remote from one another, historically they have been on opposite sides of the Cold War and they have very different regime types, Brazil being a fully-fledged democracy whereas Russia boasts a hybrid regime with authoritarian traits. They could easily conduct their internal and external affairs without investing any time and effort in bilateral relations, as they more or less have done in the 1990s. Therefore, Moscow’s relations with Brasilia make an interesting case to explore the motivations behind, as they are neither self-explanatory nor indispensable. This essay does not aim to prove that Russian-Brazilian relations are essential to Russian foreign policy. As abovementioned, they clearly are not indispensable. The Russian leadership does identify Brazil as a key partner in Latin America and describes the relationship as being of strategic importance , and in recent years the Kremlin has attributed increasing importance to relations with Latin America, but there can be no doubt that the region takes a backseat to Europe, Asia and North-America in Russian foreign policy. This essay merely sets out to demonstrate that matters of national identity play a role in the making of Russian foreign policy, and aims to lend further credence to this thesis by analysing Russian-Brazilian relations. To this end, part I of this essay offers an analysis of Russian foreign policy in the 21st century, paying special attention to Realist tendencies and matters that seem to illustrate the importance of identity, whereas part II of this essay focuses on Russian-Brazilian relations and how these seem to indicate the importance of identity in Russian foreign policy.","['Russia', 'Brazil', 'foreign affairs', 'realism', 'identity', 'status', 'bilateral relations']"

Deir el Bahari is een archeologische site op de westoever van de Nijl in Egypte, waarvan de ruimte in de verschillende perioden op verschillende manieren gebruikt werd. In de faraonische periode werden hier de grote tempels van Mentoehotep II en van Hatsjepsoet gebouwd. Ook Thoetmosis III bouwde hier een kleinere tempel. In de Grieks-Romeinse periode hergebruikten de Ptolemaeën de tempel van Hatsjepsoet uit de faraonische periode voor hun eigen religieuze doeleinden en werden er aanpassingen gedaan. Onder de Romeinen werd de cultus van de Grieken in de beginperiode grotendeels voortgezet, maar in latere periode raakten de tempels in Deir el Bahari langzaam in onbruik als centra van de heidense religies en kwam het christendom ervoor in de plaats. In de christelijke periode werd de tempel van Hatsjepsoet gebruikt als het klooster van Phoibammon, gesticht door bisschop Abraham van Hermonthis. Hoewel Deir el Bahari altijd een religieuze functie had, veranderde de manier waarop religie werd beoefend voortdurend en dus ook het gebruik van de ruimtes van de tempels. De veranderingen door de tijd heen zijn hierin goed te volgen.","['Egypte', 'Deir el Bahari', 'Tempel van Hatsjepsoet', 'Ruimtegebruik', 'Faraonische periode', 'Grieks-Romeinse periode', 'Christelijke periode']"

RUSSIA’S IDENTITY FORMATION: PUTIN’S PROJECT,"Hermes, Inez","['Gerrits, André']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"A theory that can give us another perspective of the world we live in is the constructivist theory. Although constructivism, like realism, takes the state as the centre of its research, constructivism offers different insights in world politics. By analysing Russia’s policies through both theories, this research tries to offer new ways of understanding Russia under Putin and how Russia positions itself in world politics. This paper will focus on Russia’s policies under Putin, because Putin made several policy changes in Russia on both a domestic and international level.These policy changes raised questions about how to understand Russian politics and position in the world. Whereas these policy changes are often explained through a realist lens, constructivism can offer new insights. Furthermore, this paper will focus on Russia’s policies towards the Middle East, because the Middle East can be seen as a cockpit of confrontation in international politics between states. Events in the Middle East are often viewed from a realist perspective, which makes it interesting to shine a different light on the events in the Middle East. Consequently, the research question of this paper will be; “What does Russia’s position in the Middle East under Putin reveal about how Russia positions itself in the world.”",['Russia Putin Middle East Identity']

Current and future challenges in hacktivism regulation in the European Union,"Belenguer, Iria","['Oster, Jan']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the past five years, a variety of social movements have used the information and communication technologies (ICTs) in ways that were not foreseen in order to coordinate, debate, denounce and protest. The participants in these actions have brought publicity to practices of hacktivism, an integration of activism and ICTs (mobile phones, Internet, computers, and dedicated applications) which aims to expand political, social and economic freedom. The aim of this paper is to identify which aspects of hacktivism are problematic in regulatory terms, hindering the fulfilment of its positive effects. This study conducts a preliminary, descriptive and analytical account of these problems focusing, first, on hacktivism internally (its conceptualisation, typology and consequences), to proceed to the problems linked to its context (global Internet governance, EU multilateralism and self-regulated regulation). Lastly, these challenges are briefly categorised and attention is paid to how new directions in decision-making methods may be incorporated into EU Impact Assessment in order to systematically identify new problems that may arise in the future.","['Internet governance', 'Cybersecurity', 'Hacktivism', 'European Union']"

Is there a need to change accountability practices of the European Central Bank (ECB) now that it has new tasks regarding prudential supervision?,"Dashorst, Amparo","['Riel, Bart van']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Based on the legal base of the SSM, Council Regulation (EU) no 1024/2013 and a literature overview, this thesis will approach the main question: Is there a need to change accountability practices of the ECB now that it has new tasks regarding prudential supervision? This new Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will divide the European Central Bank (ECB) tasks into a monetary function and a supervisory function. Hereby the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of all Member States of the euro zone form the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The debate involving the ECB independence and its new integrated supervisory tasks alongside monetary policy raises a number of questions. This particularly relates to central bank independence, since the possibility of trade-offs between monetary policy and supervisory tasks could lead to conflicts of objectives. Hence, reputational risks are significant challenges and threats, which need to be overcome. Moreover, when executing the two tasks during crisis situations within the euro zone, the ECB must have a high incentive to improve its accountability practise towards the European public to strengthen its credibility. Therefore, the existing accountability framework of the ECB must be critically reviewed. Thus the ECB could take certain extra measures to maintain its high standard of accountability.",['European Central Bank Supervisory tasks accountability change European Union']

Van dat voetstuk af! Een onderzoek naar de social distance bij portretten van vrouwelijke leiders en politici in Opzij in de periode 1982-2010,"Bas, Merel","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De afgelopen decennia is het politieke domein langzaam door vrouwelijke politici en leiders veroverd. Dat gaat niet zonder slag of stoot; in de media krijgen zij het vanwege hun vrouw-zijn vaak flink te verduren. Afbeeldingen spelen daar een belangrijke rol bij; vrouwen worden bijvoorbeeld vaker dan mannen afgerekend op hun uiterlijk. Tegelijkertijd is het gebruik van portretten voor alle politici, dus ook voor vrouwen, een doeltreffende manier om een electoraal publiek te bereiken. Om te zorgen dat de kiezer de juiste boodschap krijgt worden de foto’s van (vrouwelijke) politici vaak tot in de puntjes geregisseerd. Ook in Opzij is dit waarschijnlijk het geval. De doelstellingen van dit feministische maandblad wijken echter wel wat af van die van de conventionele media. Het ligt in de aard van het blad om vrouwelijke politici in een positief daglicht te stellen. Maar tegelijkertijd sijpelen de heersende maatschappelijke (mannelijke) normen onbedoeld ook door in de inhoud van dit blad. In deze thesis wordt onderzocht wat het volgens de portrettering in Opzij betekent om een vrouwelijke politicus te zijn. Om dit te onderzoeken wordt er gebruik gemaakt van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse waarbij de resultaten vervolgens op een kwalitatieve manier worden geïnterpreteerd. De centrale vragen van deze thesis zijn: - Kan er in de periode 1982-2012 aan de hand van het analysemodel van Vinke (2012) een significante verandering in de gemiddelde social distance worden waargenomen in de portrettering van vrouwelijke politici/leiders in Opzij? - Is er in deze periode aan de hand van een gender-interpretatie van het model van Vinke (2012) een verschuiving op de schaal masculien-feminien waar te nemen? - Op welke manier passen de resultaten van deze analyses in het historisch perspectief van het Opzij-feminisme? Voor het onderzoek zijn in totaal 313 foto’s uit tien jaargangen van Opzij in de periode 1982-2012 geselecteerd. De foto’s zijn gescoord op variabelen die (gedeeltelijk) afkomstig zijn uit uit het analysemodel van Glassman en Kenney (1994). Uiteindelijk zijn er vijf variabelen onderzocht: point of view, ‘gezichtsuitdrukking’, image act, ‘interactie’ en ‘afstand’. Vervolgens is er in navolging van Vinke (2012) aan de hand van deze variabelen onderzocht of er een ontwikkeling was waar te nemen in de social distance (Hall, 1966). Ook zijn de variabelen van het model van Glassman en Kenney (1994) gekoppeld aan feminiene en masculiene waarden volgens de definities van Rosenkrantz et al. (1968, p.291) om te achterhalen of er een verschuiving in deze waarden is waar te nemen. Vervolgens is onderzocht in hoeverre de uitkomsten van deze analyses op een kwalitatieve manier zijn in te passen het een historische kader van het Opzij-feminisme. Uit het onderzoek vallen geen significante verbanden te destilleren, maar er valt wel te stellen dat resultaten in ieder geval sterke aanwijzingen leveren dat het mogelijk is dat de social distance is afgenomen en dat de feminiene waarden zijn toegenomen. Deze aanwijzingen passen goed in de ontwikkelingen van het Opzij-feminisme. Het blad was begin jaren ’80 nog radicaal feministisch, maar werd gedurende de jaren ’90 en ’00 steeds milder. Dat lijkt zichtbaar te worden in de portretten van vrouwelijke politici in Opzij doordat die gedurende de onderzochte periode steeds persoonlijker en ‘vrouwelijker’ werden.","['journalism', 'opzij', 'feminism', 'politics', 'visual communication', 'social distance', 'glassman&kenney', 'female politicians', 'semiotics', 'magazine', 'portraits', 'gender', '1982-2012']"

Discourse and the Shift in Social Democratic Ideology and Employment Policies: A Comparison of the PvdA and the SPD,"Simons, Jasper Paul","['Oude Nijhuis, D.M.', 'Oster, J.S.']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis is concerned with the question why social democratic parties in Western Europe have shifted their socio-economic policies towards the right of the political spectrum in the 1990s. In particular, labour market reforms that substantially conflict with social democratic ideology and conduce to the gradual erosion of the welfare state are under scrutiny. Building on the theoretical innovations of discursive institutionalism, it contributes to the academic effort of resolving the research gap on the motivation of social democratic parties legitimising this shift by focussing on the communicative discourse of social democratic parties governing in the Netherlands (PvdA) and Germany (SPD). Moreover, communicative discourse is posed as the independent variable explaining the strong difference in the degree of societal protest to the respective national reforms – within a timeframe of similar socio-economic challenges and with (ideologically) similar reforms. The thesis concludes, firstly, that the motivation of the PvdA and the SPD are generally alike in terms of their emphasis on the necessity to reform/modernise the labour market given internal and external challenges to the welfare state. Secondly, subtle but significant differences in the consistency, cognitive soundness and considerateness of the conveyance of the respective discourses explains why public protest in Germany was stronger than in the Netherlands.","['social democratic ideology', 'labour market and welfare state reform', 'discursive institutionalism', 'communicative discourse']"

The thesis focuses on photographs of the American road trip specifically as the road trip carries particular significance in American culture, as do both the car and the road. The research done establishes that the viewer’s relationship with (a) the photographer, and (b) the photograph can be affected by the use of the car. In each case, the photographic styles discussed link the road and the car, as two connecting and connected objects that are important for the American road trip. By using the car to either create an additional frame, or to create two contrasting images within the photograph, the viewer, among others, becomes more aware of the presence of the photographer. By using the car to blur the surface of the photograph, the viewer can no longer look through the photograph, but looks at it before he/she can consider the object photographed, the American road.","['Car', 'Frame', 'Blurredness', 'AmericanRoadTrip', 'Landscape', 'Viewer']"

This construction marks the object by inserting the morpheme ba, and preposes it to the front of the sentence structure. It has also been called a disposal construction, since it denotes how the object is affected by the subject. Taiwan Mandarin is heavily influenced by Southern Min, a language which is spoken by a large proportion of the Taiwanese population. The Southern Min ka7 construction is very similar to the ba construction: it marks the object as patient and preposes it in the sentence structure. However, its use is also quite different from the use of the ba construction. In order to find out if this ka7 construction has influenced the ba construction, I took spoken example sentences from Taiwanese television shows and written example sentences from Taiwanese Facebook pages. The data from these sources suggests that in some cases the ba construction in Taiwanese Mandarin does behave differently, and some of the differences can indeed be explained by the ka7 construction.","['Taiwan Mandarin', 'Southern Min', 'ba construction', 'ka construction', 'disposal construction', 'language contact']"

The function of Special Economic Zones in the modernization process of China,"Hummelink, Merel","['Landsberger, Stefan']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (CSPFTZ) has been established on September 29th 2013 in Shanghai. Shanghai has been the center of many historical events. In the 19th century, Shanghai was opened up to the outside world and forced to outside trade relations due to the Nanking Treaty of 1842 after the First Opium War (1839-1842) and was selected as a new port: the ‘Shanghai International Settlement’. The British, American and French settled in Shanghai and after 100 years Shanghai developed as the largest foreign trade port in China. Meanwhile, during the first Sino-Japanese War of 1895, China was mauled by a strong, Western influenced Japan. Attempts to reform China into a modern nation failed but after the 1911 Revolution, Shanghai emerged as a center of modern activities. The population doubled between 1895 and 1910 from 245,675 to 501,541 people as many Chinese were attracted by the city. During World War I (1914-1918) many people left while the diminished supply of Chinese export goods led to a higher demand of these export goods. Especially in the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai grew as many silk filatures, cotton mills, and chemical works emerged. In the 1930s, Shanghai’s Port served as the main shipping center in the Far East; the city was seen as a cosmopolitan city. However, in 1937 Japan bombed Shanghai and occupied parts of China again, which lasted until 1945. People lived under brutal circumstances under the occupation of Japan and the conditions to develop into a cosmopolitan city moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong. In 1949, the CCP, led by Mao Zedong, took power and focused on rural regions resulting in neglected cities; the nation controlled Shanghai and the city was forced to dispose of its cosmopolitan life. However, when Mao Zedong died in 1976, the balance of power changed: Hua Guofeng established the ‘Open Door’ policy in 1977 before Deng Xiaoping returned to power in 1978. The new policy led to the beginning of its modernization process and several Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were established mainly to attract foreign direct investment. Since the opening up until 1997, China attracted billions of foreign investment (US dollars) and by the mid-1990s, the economy moved away from a command economy to a functioning market economy. After 1978, China’s modernization process took off really quickly and created a gap between South China including its coastal regions and North-East China as the South and its coastal areas are developing much faster. Therefore, China can be divided into two different phases of modernization according to Rostow’s Five-Stages of Growth (1960). The South and its coastal regions can be assigned to the final phase of modernization while the North-East part of China can be assigned to phase three. The SEZs which have been established since 1978 are particular geographic regions in countries used to encourage export services, industry, and manufacturing. In China, initially four SEZs were established in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Xiamen and Shantou to test the new policies and new institutions for the market-oriented economy in order to improve China’s economy. The role SEZs, and especially Shenzhen, played in China’s modernization process was quite apparent as average annual growth has been 9.4 percent since the 1980s: the SEZs boost China’s economy and moved towards a more technology-intensive and higher-value economy. 34 years later, on 29th September 2013, a new SEZ was established in Pudong, Shanghai: the CSPFTZ. The CSPFTZ has been established to enhance China’s economic position globally and to develop a new, replicable financial and administrative system which can be implemented in every region of the country. Nevertheless, the privileged status of ‘special’ is diminished since there are already many SEZs in China. However, as analysis shows, the zone operates differently from the majority of the SEZs which enables the CSPFTZ to offer enough advantages to attract foreign investors to be successful. The chances of success nonetheless depend on the government. The government encourages so many aspects and is experimenting with so many measures that the chance of success is questioned. But, if the government is able to achieve its aims, the CSPFTZ can be successful and could contribute to China’s South and coastal regions’ modernization process as the leading sectors shift towards more durable consumer goods and services in Rostow’s final phase.","['China', 'Special Economic Zones', 'modernization process', '1978', 'Pudong', 'China Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone', 'Shenzhen']"

Het huidige onderzoek richt zich op overgeneralisatie en irregularisatie bij jonge volwassen moedertaalsprekers en tweedetaalleerders. De hypotheses zijn: (1) overgeneralisatie komt in zekere mate voor bij T1-sprekers en in sterkere mate bij T2-sprekers. (2) T2-sprekers maken irregularisaties bij zwakke werkwoorden die lijken op sterke werkwoorden. (3) Als een werkwoord een zwakke en sterke vorm heeft, kiezen zowel T1-sprekers als T2-sprekers de zwakke vorm. Vierentachtig werkwoorden in drie condities werden gekozen: sterk, zwak en met beide vormen. De woorden waren zo infrequent mogelijk omdat daarmee een grotere kans is op overgeneralisatie of irregularisatie. Tweeëntwintig Nederlandse moedertaalsprekers en 17 hoogopgeleide gevorderde tweedetaalleerders met diverse moedertalen namen deel. Iedereen kreeg een lijst zinnen waarin de verleden-tijdsvorm van de testwoorden (gepresenteerd als infinitief) moest worden ingevuld, zonder daarbij hulpmiddelen te gebruiken. Alle drie hypotheses worden bevestigd. Opvallend is dat moedertaalsprekers in enkele gevallen ook irregularisaties vormen bij zwakke werkwoorden (bv. optuigen – *toog op).","['Tweedetaalverwerving', 'Overgeneralisatie', 'Irregularisatie']"

The Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius: The Dependence of the Abdication Scene on George of Pisidias' In Restitutionem,"Alibertis, Demetrios de","['Gzella, Holger de']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Abdication Scene in the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius was influenced by George of Pisidias' In Restitutionem, the only major contemporary testimony to Heraclius' restoration of the Cross to Jerusalem in 630 C.E. The importance of Jerusalem and the centrality of Golgotha, the presentation of an idealized Christian emperor who is in conformity with the image of his righteous predecessors, the crown-Cross motif, as well as the subject of the Eschaton, are all crucial themes present in George's poem and which appear to have been adopted by the author of Pseudo-Methodius. Furthermore, the theological framework and the Byzantine imperial ideology within which Heraclius and the Byzantine Empire functioned, is also apparent in the Abdication Scene. This paper breaks from the traditional approach to explaining the scene on the basis of earlier Syriac texts such as the Alexander Legend and the Cave of Treasures. Although these older arguments have their strong points, they are based on the idea that a Syriac composition of the seventh century, must have received its influences from earlier Syriac sources. It does not allow for the possibility of external influences. Furthermore, these arguments attempt to show how themes and motifs found in earlier Syriac works, such as the centrality of Golgotha in the Cave of Treasures, are genuinely Syriac, when in fact they are to be found throughout early Jewish and Hellenistic writings. Thus, contrary to the previous assumptions made, this paper shows through a comparative analysis of the respective texts, that the pivotal scene in the Syriac Apocalypse was directly influenced by the poetical testimony to the restoration of the Cross.","['Syriac Apocalypse', 'Byzantine Studies', 'Emperor Heraclius', 'George of Pisidias', 'Byzantine-Persian Wars', 'Restoration of the Cross (the Restitutio)', 'Byzantine-Arab Wars', 'Arab Conquests of the Middle East', 'Syriac-speaking Christian Communities of the Middle East', 'Greek Literary Culture in Syria', 'Christological Controversies of the seventh century']"
Thumbs up! Een zoektocht naar de eigenschappen van 'sociaal nieuws',"Ast, Maarten van","['Opgenhaffen, Michaël']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Sociale media krijgen een steeds belangrijkere rol in de wereldwijde nieuwsconsumptie. Nieuwsorganisaties spelen hier op in door een selectie van hun content op sociale media te delen. Het publiek kan aan de slag met de content: sharen, liken en commenten zijn ingeburgerde termen. Maar hoewel er veel onderzoek is gedaan naar nieuwsselectiecriteria voor traditionele nieuwsmedia, ontbreekt onderzoek naar de eigenschappen die nieuwsberichten op sociale media ‘sociaal’ maken: berichten die veel likes, comments en shares ontvangen. Binnen deze masterscriptie is onderzocht in hoeverre de nieuwsselectiecriteria van Harcup en O’Neill (2001) invloed hebben op de mate waarin mensen interageren met nieuwsberichten op de Facebookpagina van de NOS. Berichten die voldoen aan de nieuwsselectiecriteria bekende mensen, entertainment, verrassing en goed nieuws leveren significant meer likes op. Het criterium verrassing levert ook significant meer comments en shares op. Voor de criteria slecht nieuws en magnitude geldt het omgekeerde: zij genereren significant minder likes. Berichten die voldoen aan het criterium entertainment leveren significant minder comments op. Foto’s, fotoalbums en hypertekst leveren significant meer likes op. Bovendien leveren foto’s en hypertekst ook meer comments en shares op. Slechts een aantal nieuwselectiecriteria kan verklaren dat een bericht als ‘sociaal’ wordt beschouwd, en zodoende interactie in de vorm van likes, comments en shares genereert. De nieuwsselectiecriterialijst moet dan ook herzien worden voor sociale media, indien interactie van het publiek met de content een van de na streven doelen is.","['social media', 'News organisations', 'social news', 'news criteria']"
Ideology and Trauma in Allen Coulter’s Remember Me and the Khaleej Times’ Anti-smoking Campaign,"Prins, Lisa","['Alphen, Ernst van']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Film- en literatuurwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Most research on the representation of 9/11 is focused on commemoration, trauma, patriotism and conspiracy theories on terrorism, mainly including research on ideological issues or the politics surrounding 9/11. These topics have been mostly discussed in reference to literature, but less attention has been paid to representation in film or commercials. It is however exactly these two media that address an important discussion in how media intrude the topic of 9/11 into an unexpected genre, and manage to shape this genre to convey a temporal interaction between the two. The viewers of these two media are being confronted with the image of the two towers, an image that reminds them of something that has already taken place. The suggestion is therefor made that in the film, when the protagonist is standing inside one of the Twin Towers, he is doomed. As it is also implied that if the smoker will not stop smoking after having seen the dramatic advertisement, he shall also be doomed. These two images therefore explore a complex interaction between past and future; between the already taken place attack on the Twin Towers and the continuous confrontation with it in the ongoing future. 9/11 is therefore not merely an event of the past, but is also used to construct a certain image of the future. It is this constant addressing of one and the same event, making it an applicable theme to different media items, that portrays how confused we still are by its unreal unexpectedness. Due to this need for constant repetition, as Derrida states, “for repetition always protects by neutralizing, deadening, distancing a traumatism” (7/8), media tend to apply the event of 9/11 to problematic frames in debatable constructs.",

"Omstreden anticonceptiemiddelen, het vernaculaire web en institutionele expertise","Karsemeijer, Liza","['Burger, J.P.']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie onderzoekt de frames in forumdiscussies en krantenberichten over de omstreden anticonceptiemiddelen, Diane-35 en Nuvaring, die van februari 2013 tot januari 2014 de gemoederen flink bezighielden omdat ze gevaarlijke bijwerkingen met zich mee zouden brengen. De verschillende denkbeelden worden in beeld gebracht met behulp van een kwalitatieve, inductieve framinganalyse. Het corpus is verzameld op het forum van Viva.nl en uit Nederlandse regionale en nationale kranten en magazines. Uit eerder onderzoek naar vernaculair en institutioneel discours blijkt dat er een aantal verschillen zijn tussen de twee soorten autoriteit: vernaculaire bronnen zijn vaak kritischer en leggen de verantwoording meer bij het individu dan nieuwsmedia; nieuwsmedia besteden daarnaast weinig aandacht aan alternatieve bronnen en denkwijzen. Ook theorieën over risicoperceptie wijzen op een afnemend vertrouwen in experts, waardoor het publiek individualistischer wordt en meer gebruik gaat maken van vernaculaire bronnen. Vergelijkingen tussen het vernaculaire web en institutionele expertise zijn echter nog maar beperkt vertegenwoordigd. Dit onderzoek hoopt deze literatuurlacune op te vullen. In het vernaculaire discours zijn vier verschillende frames aangetroffen: het technocratische frame, het individualistische frame, het anti-risicoframe en het anti-medicijnenframe. In het institutionele discours zijn drie verschillende frames aangetroffen: het technocratische frame, het falende-mediciframe en het commercieframe. Verder blijkt dat er inderdaad opvallende verschillen tussen vernaculair en institutioneel discours zijn: forumgebruikers leggen de verantwoordelijkheid bij ieder frame bij het individu; in kranten gebeurt dit alleen in het technocratische frame. Ook blijkt er in de krantenberichten sprake te zijn van eenzijdig journalistiek brongebruik: alternatieve denkwijzen, zoals het anti-medicijnenframe, worden in de media niet vertegenwoordigd en er wordt zelden naar de mening van een ""leek"" gevraagd. Dit onderzoek bevestigt dat nieuwsmedia niet alle denkbeelden vertegenwoordigen die in de samenleving aanwezig zijn, zoals in eerder onderzoek al naar voren kwam. Aangezien het de taak van de journalistiek is om alle kanten van een kwestie te belichten en alle betrokkenen een stem te geven, wordt in dit onderzoek de aanbeveling gedaan dat journalisten zich op meer diverse bronnen en invalshoeken gaan richten. Zij kunnen gebruik maken van vernaculair discours om een beter inzicht te krijgen in de verschillende denkbeelden en bijbehorende framevertegenwoordigers. Zo kan de journalistiek een meer representatieve afspiegeling van de huidige maatschappij worden.","['journalistiek', 'nieuwe media', 'frames', 'framing', 'framinganalyse', 'Diane-35', 'Nuvaring', 'kwalitatief', 'anticonceptiemiddelen', 'forumdiscussies']"
De Rabobank in beeld: van expert tot fraudeur,"Voncken, Harriot","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Veel mensen baseren zich op informatie uit de media om zich een beeld te vormen over bedrijven (Dowling, 1986, p. 112). In dit artikel wordt beargumenteerd dat het verhelderend kan werken om beeldvorming door de media vanuit een narratief perspectief te benaderen. Dit wordt gedaan door middel van een casus. Hierin wordt onderzocht welk beeld er over de Rabobank als personage wordt geschetst in NOS-berichtgeving en hoe dit beeld verandert door de onthulling van de Libor-fraude. Dit onderzoek combineert narratologische begrippen met specifieke begrippen uit corporate research om het personage zo volledig mogelijk te omschrijven. Het Rabobank-personage blijkt uit vier verschillende rollen te bestaan: bedrijf, slachtoffer, dader en expert. De expert-rol bleek het dominantst te zijn: in deze rol wordt de door Rabobank beoogde identiteit positief bevestigd door de journalistiek. Na de onthulling van de Libor-fraude wordt de bank niet langer als expert of slachtoffer opgevoerd. Opvallend is dat NOS de Rabobank pas neerzette als dader nádat de fraude werd bevestigd door officiële bronnen. Dit roept vragen op over het onafhankelijke en kritische karakter van financieel nieuws.","['Rabobank', 'narratief', 'journalistiek', 'beeldvorming', 'video', 'fraude', 'corporate identity']"

Sixtus V’s re-erection of the Lateran Obelisk seen in the light of Alfred Gell’s Anthropological Theory of Art,"Arenthals, Jeannette van","['Eck, Caroline van']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"The subject of this MA thesis is the re-erection of the Lateran obelisk in 1588 by Sixtus V (1585-1590). Sixtus had little regard for pagan imperial monuments, and had many destroyed and used as building materials for his urban construction plans. The question arises why, after moving and re-erecting two obelisks that were in plain view, he proceeded to actively have two more excavated and re-erected. Alfred Gell’s Anthropological Theory of Art (ATA) is applied in order to find an answer, and it is concluded that the ATA provides an excellent basis for an analytical approach. Based on the premise that an art object is an extension of the patron and can be assigned partial personhood, the ATA makes it possible to consider people in an object’s “social circle” as both agents and patients. Their relations with the object (which is called the index) and with each-other produce some unexpected insights which provide a partial answer. This thesis also demonstrates that it is possible to consistently apply Gell’s entire theory to a single art object. What is more: the index is considered from different perspectives, as if consisting of different parts, i.e., the technical ingenuity required to excavate and erect it, and its intrinsic sacredness. The analysis shows, among other things, that the obelisk is a representation of itself in imperial times, as if it were a portrait of itself in earlier days. This is another partial answer. It has been found theoretically necessary to alter the ATA’s four term system into a structure of five terms. The theory is stretched even more in the penultimate chapter, which provides some direct insights that are of crucial importance to the answer to the research question.","['Lateran obelisk erection SixtusV anthropological theory art', 'Gell']"
Een historische reis naar evenwichtigheid: de transformatie van sociale grenzen van twee generaties Surinaamse-Javanen in Nederland tussen 1973 en 2014,"Ottjes, Joska","['Meel, Peter']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,nl,"This research examines the migration history and social construction of ethnic identities of two generations of Surinamese-Javanese in the Netherlands from 1973 onwards. It incorporates the perspective that the creation of ethnic identities must be considered transformative processes of social boundaries. In this particular case, the social boundaries that are used to create a distinction between the Surinamese-Javanese community and the Dutch society as a whole, are mainly played out in the areas of citizenship, religion, and language. By having used oral history as methodology, two generations of Surinamese-Javanese, one generation born in Suriname, one in the Netherlands, have contributed to this research. Based on their accounts, ways are showed in which individuals partake in creating or challenging a collective identity. Furthermore, it reveals how the overall socio-political structures, and the colonial migration history, have been of continuous influence on the ways social boundaries are negotiated between and by both generations. In order to analyse these processes of continuous transformation and fragmentation, a historical point of view has been deemed necessary to uncover the long-term changes and continuities. In the end, this research aims to contribute to the theoretical discussion regarding ‘groupness’, the social construction of ethnicity, the power relations related to mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion, and the agency of migrants. Also, by taking on a different approach, it strives to gain new insights into the migration history of the Surinamese-Javanese, and into Dutch colonial history.","['social boundaries', 'ethnic identity', 'migration', 'colonial legacy', 'hybridisation']"

En outre, les linguistes ne sont pas non plus d’accord sur l’intonation habituelle de ce type de question. Dans ce mémoire, nous nous sommes demandé quelle était l’intonation par défaut des questions in situ et nous avons voulu savoir si l’intonation des questions in situ est différente de celle des questions à antéposition (Qui est-ce qu’il voit ?). A cette fin, nous avons fait prononcer des paires minimales des deux types de questions dans l’absence d’un contexte spécifique. Nous avons trouvé que la question in situ est caractérisée par une montée finale. La question qu- à antéposition est également prononcée avec une intonation montante dans la plupart des cas. Cependant, il faut faire remarquer que certains participants employaient presque toujours une montée finale dans les questions à antéposition tandis que d’autres participants employaient aussi bien des montées que des descentes dans ce type de question.","['french', 'intonation', 'wh in situ', 'questions', 'final rise']"

Sinking about and Working with Maritime Language and Terminology,"Sutherland, Ellick","['Foster, Tony']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Maritime English (ME), the international working language in the maritime industry, is a Language for Special Purpose (LSP) of which a spoken variant, SMCP, acts as a controlled safety language. Text-based studies of Maritime English, although scarce, point to a concise syntax and grammar, a formal and impersonal style and a preference for nouns and nominal groups. Using the theory of LSP, the thesis finds that depending on content, situation and subdomain, ME can firstly be seen as restrictive language mode; secondly as a deviant language mode; and thirdly as a preferred language mode. More corpus-based descriptive research into the linguistic features of written ME and of the spoken version (SMCP) is advised. As terms typically belong to LSP, the thesis looks into the theory and methodology of terminology. They can be of assistance in setting up a corporate Terminology Management System. The terminological principles of concept structure, precise concept/term definitions and source and context information help create a reliable knowledge database. Focussing on maritime terminology, the thesis concludes with a case study illustrating how a structured approach to maritime terminology processing with the help of a terminology management tool results in a consistent corporate terminology and more reliable information benefitting translation quality. These tools should be freely available, easy to operate and should use standardized database exchange formats. More research is needed on the use of pictures in terminology including their ""translatability"" and their role in the information exchange.","['Maritime English', 'SMCP', 'Language for Special Purpose', 'Terminology', 'Concept Structure', 'Term Extraction', 'Terminology Management System', 'Standardization']"

Onderzoek naar de invloed van het gebruik van beleefdheidsstrategieën en ontwijkingstechnieken op de beleefdheid van openbare excuses.,"Fles, Denise","['Jansen, Henrike']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek wordt de beleefdheidstheorie (Brown & Levinson 1987) gekoppeld aan ontwijkings- en verkleiningstechnieken ten behoeve van verantwoordelijkheid (Kampf 2009) door analyses van de taalhandeling ‘excuses’. In dit onderzoek worden twee zaken onderzocht. Allereerst wordt in de analyse nagegaan of er door sprekers die in het openbaar spreken op een of andere manier gebruik wordt gemaakt van beleefdheidsstrategieën of ontwijkingstechnieken. Daarnaast wordt aan de hand van dit onderzoek getracht te bepalen wat de invloed van beide technieken is op de beleefdheid van een openbaar excuus. De woorden uit drie excuustoespraken van politici, drie excuustoespraken van dienstverleners en drie excuustoespraken van sporters zijn gelabeld op plaatsen waar deze woorden een beleefdheidsstrategie of ontwijkingstechniek bevatten. Het gaat om toespraken van premier Rutte, minister Timmermans, staatssecretaris Teeven, ING directeur Jan Hommen, NS directrice Ingrid Thijssen met ProRail directeur Paul Dirix, BlackBerry directeur Stephen Bates, profvoetballer Erik Pieters, schaatser Sjinkie Knegt en profvoetballer Luis Suaréz. De toespraken bevatten allen een excuus, er moet sprake zijn van een excuus en moeten daarnaast zijn vastgelegd op video; om ook omgevingsfactoren te kunnen beoordelen. Tevens was voor de keuze van de toespraak van belang dat de excuustoespraak een korte toespraak bevat en niet louter het zeggen van het woord ‘sorry’ of ‘excuses’. Op basis van de vier manieren voor verantwoordelijkheidsontwijking van Kampf (2009) en de vier basis componenten voor een excuus (Deutschmann 2003) is een analysemodel ontwikkeld om ontwijkings- en verkleiningsmanoeuvres te detecteren en te labelen. Het analysemodel bevat vier strategieën waarbinnen technieken en wijzen zijn geformuleerd om verantwoordelijkheid te ontwijken of verkleinen: (1) de formulering van de remedie, (2) de belediging (het delict) en verantwoordelijkheid, (3) de beledigde en verantwoordelijkheid en (4) de belediger en verantwoordelijkheid. Met behulp van dat analysemodel en de ruim veertig beleefdheidsstrategieën van Brown & Levinson (1987) zijn de negen excuustoespraken geanalyseerd. Uit die analyse is gebleken dat alle negen sprekers gebruik maken van ontwijkingstechnieken waarmee zij verantwoordelijkheid proberen te ontwijken. Van de vier strategieën blijkt strategie twee de meest gebruikte ontwijkingsstrategie. Een mogelijke verklaring hiervoor is dat met het gebruik van ontwijkingen van het delict op een (in verhouding) onopvallende manier gemanoeuvreerd worden met de verantwoordelijkheid.","['taalbeheersing', 'excuus', 'beleefdheid', 'verantwoordelijkheid', 'ontwijking', 'betrokkenheid']"

From his appointment as ‘special’ ambassador to Spain, Sir Samuel Hoare’s personal appeasing initiatives quickly escalated into a systematic and well-organised propaganda organisation with headquarters at the Madrid embassy. With the help of the embassy staff, Hoare managed to establish an important network of contacts that ensured that British propaganda material breached Franco’s restrictions and reached Spaniards from all classes and regions. As this study argues, the embassy’s propaganda successes were mainly due to the fact that the propagandists knew how to adjust British interests to Spanish customs and norms. For instance, this thesis will give detailed account on the functioning of some peculiar methods of propaganda such as the so-called Religious Propaganda and the Embassy Medical Service. Lastly, this study will also analyse the propagandists’ constant exposure to violent aggressions at hands of the police and the members of the Falange, as well as their struggle to keep British opinion as neutral as possible regarding Spain.","['Francoist Spain', 'British Embassy', 'Second World War', 'World War II', 'Sir Samuel Hoare', 'Ministry of Information', 'Propaganda']"

"""Afwijkende Mensen."" Formulating perspectives on the Dutch ULTRA scene.","Foster, Richard James","['Storm, H.J.']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The post-punk period of 1979 to 1982 saw significant cultural transfer between elements of the Dutch, German and Anglo-American alternative music scenes. In the Netherlands, most of this cultural transfer revolved round the members of the ULTRA scene. ULTRA stood for “ultramodern” and promoted avant garde post-punk music that used new or unconventional instruments and performance modes. ULTRA was mainly based round weekly “ULTRA” nights at the Oktopus club in Amsterdam and the music released on the Amsterdam-based Plurex and Torso record labels; though similar scenes flourished in Den Bosch, Nijmegen and Eindhoven. ULTRA drew a great deal of its creative impulse from the art schools such as the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, and had close links to the both squatting and punk scenes then active in the Netherlands. However, ULTRA was transnational in outlook and often looked outside the Netherlands for inspiration and support. And a number of its most successful proponents, such as the Amsterdam band Minny Pops, garnered international critical acclaim. Using Simon Frith's principles for studying popular music (alongside content from the publication most associated with the ULTRA scene and its musicians, Vinyl magazine, as well as interviews with key actors in the ULTRA scene) the paper looks to evaluate ULTRA's cultural worth; and how its Dutch origins affected the scene in the wider rubric of international popular music.","['popular culture', 'popular music', 'The Netherlands', 'ULTRA', 'post-punk', 'punk', 'national identity', 'squatting', 'Vinyl magazine']"

The Accented Speech Act: When English Meets a Foreign Tongue,"Hui, Tingting","['Horsman, Yasco']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Non-native English accents, imprinted with the organic condition of a foreign tongue, sometimes can trigger harassment and violence from native speakers. Being a ‘scandalous’ linguistic performance of an alien body, non-native accents epitomize how the body demarcates the agency of speech, and at the same time how speech impinges on the bodily domain. To understand accent-related violence and the intertwined relation between body and speech, this paper examines accented speech within a hate speech paradigm, and seeks to add a further degree of nuance to this area by including a close reading of certain scenes depicted in literary texts. Accented English, often labeled as ‘broken’ or ‘fractured,’ determines to a large extent the social relevance of the speaking body. Moreover, accented speech functions not always as a voluntary ‘coming-out;’ in some cases, the accented speaker is not socially sanctioned to remain silent, but is forced to speak out his/her foreignness. However, accented speech does not necessarily point to passivity; it questions the native speaker’s ingrained perception of his/her ‘natural’ bond with the mother tongue, all the while giving rise to a different kind of survivability for the accented speaker.","['accented speech', 'violence', 'hate speech', 'broken English', 'silence']"

By analysing part of the photo collection of the French photographer Jacques Belin, who worked in Morocco between 1939 and 1961, I argue in what way these four domains were of influence in the production, construction, and use of Belin’s work. I state that these four collaborated and reinforced each other and resulted in the construction of Belin’s work. At times, France’s mission civilisatrice was the bigger picture holding the whole project together; at other times the aesthetic value or ethnographic interests were more dominant than those of the colonial mission. It is thus a much-needed contextualization of an individual photographer and the specific conditions to his work, to understand the workings of power within a larger context of photography and that of twentieth-century French colonialism.","['Morocco', 'Protectorate', 'photography', 'French colonialism', 'Jacques Belin', 'representation', 'mission civilisatrice', 'ethnography', 'tourism', 'native policy', 'politics']"

It is furthermore an effort to include and analyse recent reinterpretations from four Moroccan intellectuals (Mohamed Boudhan, Muḥamed Mūnīb, Hassan Aourid, and Maâti Monjib) who discuss this specific chapter in Moroccan history. By analysing and contextualizing their works I conclude that although these works have their academic value in contributing interesting viewpoints supported by first-hand information and academic knowledge, the accounts are often passionate and personal attacks on Moroccan nationalists and their post-colonial construction of an inaccurate historical narrative about the shaping of Berber identity and French Berber policy in support of their nation-building project. These Moroccan intellectuals are thus more intertwined with political interests than they often admit, resulting in an interesting parallel with colonial and post-colonial academic traditions in Morocco that take on the subject of Berber identity formation and are also subject to both academic and political loyalties.","['Morocco', 'Protectorate', 'Berber policy', 'Berber Dahir', 'French colonialism', 'native policy', 'identity', 'politics of identity', 'Monjib', 'Aourid', 'Boudhan', 'Mounib', 'dahir']"

Complementary Distribution of Metaphony and Raddoppiamento Fonosintattico in plural nouns in Airolano,"De Sisto, Mirella","['Oostendorp, Marc van']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In the southern Italian dialect of Airola (Campania) feminine plural and masculine plural are distinguished by means of two phonological processes: metaphony and Raddoppiamento Fonosintattico (RF henceforth). They appear to be in complementary distribution and to create gender distinction in the plural of nouns; in fact, metaphony takes place in masculine plural forms, while RF marks feminine plural ones. Therefore, two distinct phenomena, one being phonological, namely metaphony, and one being phono-syntactic, namely RF, happen to interact within plural noun formation. These two processes, which developed separately, acquired, synchronically speaking, a value of gender distinction. Metaphony is a well-known phenomenon of Italian dialects, which consists in the raising or diphthongization of a stressed vowel under the influence of a non-adjacent following high vowel (Rohlfs 1966, Fanciullo 1994, Ledgeway 2009, Maiden 2010). In the dialect of Airola, it only affects mid vowels, namely /ɔ, o, e, ɛ/, and its attestation is not limited to the nominal class; it occurs, in fact, in various word categories, such as adjectives, verbs and possessive pronouns. RF is an external sandhi phenomenon which consists in the gemination of a word-initial consonant under the influence of a preceding word (Rohlfs 1970, Leone 1984, Loporcaro 1997, Borrelli 2002). In Airolano RF is lexically triggered, differently from the RF attested in Standard Italian, which occurs to be stress-induced. The aim of this thesis is to describe the two phenomena, metaphony and RF, in Airolano and to give an analysis of them in order to explain their division of labor. To do so, the processes are first analyzed separately. Then, a unified analysis is elaborated aiming to shed some light on the difference between genders in the plural of nouns. The analysis of the two phenomena will be based on data from Airolano that were collected in December 2013 and April 2014 by the author.Ten informants were selected, which were classified into four different age groups. All the recordings were, subsequently, transcribed in IPA and they appear in this form in the text. The full set of data is stored in the Italian Dialect archive of Leiden University.","['Southern Italian Dialects', 'Metaphony', 'Lexically-encoded Raddoppiamento Fonosintattico', 'Airolano']"

This thesis focuses on the first section of book 17, consisting of a great praise hymn addressed to the earth. It strives to improve the previous Indian edition (Bhattacharya 2011), by collating additional manuscript sources, providing a rigorous critical apparatus that includes all the variants found in the manuscritps, as well as an edited text based on established text-critical criteria. In addition, an analysis of the poetic meter of each verse is also provided next to each stanza, as well as a translation and detailed commentary in which I discuss the interpretation of each stanza with notes on its ritual, literary and linguistic context. Given the limited extension of the extant corpus of Vedic texts, the edition of a new text is of extreme importance, as it not only adds new information to our knowledge of the Vedic language, but also furnishes new precious linguistic material for the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European and the study of the history of its Indo-Iranian branch. Moreover, the acquisition of a philologically reliable version of such a text is a fundamental step towards any future anthropological or religious study on ancient Vedic India.","['Vedic', 'Sanskrit', 'Atharvaveda', 'Paippalāda', 'Textual criticism', 'Manuscript studies', 'Philology', 'Indology']"

Just War or just war? Constructivist and Gramscian insights into the conflict in Kosovo and NATO's decision to intervene,"Leeuwen, Rob van","['Scott-Smith, Giles']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"On March 24, 1999, NATO launched Operation Allied Force, a bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in response to ongoing hostilities in Kosovo. US President Bill Clinton proudly called the intervention in Kosovo 'the first ever humanitarian war.'1 Others condemned the war, arguing that it was illegal and that NATO was acting on its own interests rather than on humanitarian motives. So why did NATO really intervene in Kosovo? This thesis draws on constructivist and Gramscian theory to explain why NATO intervened in Kosovo, and to shed light on the most salient issue: the relationship between and the relative importance of humanitarian values and strategic interests. Constructivists believe that state identities and interests are not given, instead, they are socially constructed. Interests are not only defined by material facts but also by social facts, like norms and ideas. Therefore, foreign policy decision making is more about defining national interests than about defending them. A constructivist analysis of the Clinton administration's decision to intervene in Kosovo reveals that this decision was shaped by social facts, like shared notions about the grounds on which it is legitimate to carry out a military intervention, and norms of behaviour, like human rights. These perceptions were shaped by social and cultural factors, like the memory of the two World Wars, the national trauma of the Vietnam war, previous wars in the Balkans and the Weinberger doctrine. An analysis of Clinton's rhetoric on Kosovo reveals that he was expanding previous understandings of what constitutes the national interest to include standing up to human rights abuses. In this sense, he was advancing humanitarian norms as a cause for action. These norms did not only influence the way in which the war was presented and defended, but also the way it was fought. The constructivist perspective therefore attaches great causal significance to norms and ideas. The neo-Gramscian school in international relations draws on the work of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, particularly the concept of hegemony. According to Gramsci, the hegemony of the bourgeoisie was not just based on coercive power, but also on their ability to construct a broad cultural and ideological consensus. A state can become hegemonic by constructing a world order which most other states accept or perceive to be in their interest. In the end, however, this order primarily exists to serve the interests of the elites. From this perspective, the notion of universal human rights is one element of a global civil society which is marked by a growing consensus on morals, values and rights. The end of the Cold War brought about an international order based on liberal values like democracy, free trade and human rights. Though not a complete hegemony, this world order certainly had hegemonic elements. Milosevic's actions in Kosovo were a transgression against these values. From this perspective, the war over Kosovo was essentially an international police mission, designed to punish Milosevic's deviation from international norms. The military component was supported by international institutions, like the UN Security Council, which, though it stopped short of endorsing the intervention, also failed to oppose it, and the IMF and the EU, which has already begun making plans for the reconstruction of Kosovo and the economic future of the region before the bombs had stopped falling. International civil society, represented by NGOs and the media, also played their part by promoting humanitarian values and calling attention to the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. The extent of this hegemony is demonstrated by the failure of opposing states like Russia and China to mount an effective counter-hegemony. For constructivists, then, the decision to intervene in Kosovo reflected changing perceptions of the national interest and foreign policy priorities. Clinton claimed to act in the national interest, and undoubtedly believed this himself, but his perception of the national interest was not necessarily based on objective facts. It was shaped by historical experiences, considerations of legitimacy and shared understandings about human rights. Clinton acted as a norm entrepreneur by advancing the notion that it is legitimate to use armed force against a sovereign state to stand up to human rights abuses. Gramscians would agree with the constructivists that Kosovo represented a normative shift and that the war was fought to defend a set of values. However, the Gramscians do not take these norms and values at face value. Instead, they trace them back to the material interests of the elites. They draw attention to the striking coherence between Western military power, its ideology and international institutions. The constructivist and Gramscian perspectives have proven to be useful here because of their ability to go beyond a simple understanding of values and interests as binary opposites. It is all too easy to fall into the trap of depicting these two categories as mutually exclusive. The two theories disagree on the exact relationship between the two: constructivists believe that norms, values and ideas define interests, Gramscians believe that they ultimately serve interests. Another point of divergence is that constructivism emphasizes change while Gramscianism is more interested in continuity. From a constructivist perspective, state behavior is based on social facts which are, by nature, fluid and continually changing. For the Gramscians, the basic characteristics of the international order do not change, they continue to favour the strong over the weak. This brings out a weakness in Gramscian theory: it tends to place everything in a grand narrative about the dominance of the economic elites. When applying theory to a historical event, there is always the risk of adopting the facts to fit the preconceived notions that are present in the theoretical framework. Theory is valuable when applied critically, because it allows us to consider the facts from different viewpoints. If this analysis has succeeded in revealing different ways of looking at and thinking about the facts, then it has been a fruitful exercise.","['Kosovo', 'NATO', 'constructivism', 'neo-Gramscianism', 'Gramsci', 'international relations theory', 'humanitarian intervention', 'US foreign policy', 'hegemony']"

In the first part the social-historic context related to the appearance of the town atlas is discussed: relevant elements for the interest in Italy in the second half of the seventeenth century were taken into consideration (Humanism, the collecting of antiquities, Grand Tour). The flourishing of Dutch publishing in this period has also been treated, in particular the emergence of the Blaeu firm in Amsterdam. In the second phase of the research focus was shifted towards the town atlas of Rome. Its goal, contents and intended audience, as well as the relationships with Italian sponsors and the collaboration of the Blaeu firm with their Italian contacts were discussed. After a description of the characteristics of the original Blaeu edition, in the final part of the thesis later editions by other publishers were treated. A conclusion was then reached about the development of a subtly changing perspective on Rome as witnessed through the various editions of the town atlas of Rome; the relations between the Netherlands and Italy in the second half of the seventeenth century were a guiding theme through the entire research.","['Humanism', 'Cartography', 'Grand Tour', 'Publishing', 'History', 'Golden Age', 'Blaeu', 'Rome', 'Amsterdam']"

The Lady and the Vamp: Exploring Types of New Woman in Rhys and Hemingway,"Hart, Janneke 't","['Newton, Michael']",2014,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“One needs a lot of courage, to live”, observes Jean Rhys in Good Morning Midnight (1939) (16). It may just be the credo of her protagonist, Sasha Jansen, but could as easily have been that of Lady Brett Ashley in Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises (1926). In fact, it is the very observation that implies the scorn and ridicule that the modern woman of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century faced as she pushed the boundaries of a male-dominated world. The ‘New Woman’, as she was called, spread out from the United Kingdom to Western Europe and the United States and demanded the right to vote, an equal share in jobs and education, and sexual freedom. She drove herself into public visibility and in turn made way for the ‘vamp’ and the ‘flapper’. In this essay I will take a closer look at the New Woman of the twenties and thirties and explore her different types through an analysis of Brett Ashley and Sasha Jansen. In doing so I attempt to determine where the New Woman could flourish and where she could not, what her internal, psychological problems were, which external challenges she met and how the texts represent these matters. Ever since their existence, Brett and Sasha have been critically and often acerbically labelled and categorised. “Bitch woman”, “prostitute” and “failure”, are just a few of a long list of derogatory terms that have been applied by their contemporaries and critics up to date. In this essay I will counteract such descriptions and argue that Brett Ashley and Sasha Jansen are, in fact, each in their own way, a late version of the ‘New Woman’ pushing the limits of their restrictions and struggling with the contemporary difficulties they encountered in this role. While the term New Woman is associated with a more serious and intellectual activist, concerned with education and politics, both the flapper and vamp connote fun. Both types take an aspect of the New Woman’s endeavours and magnify it. For the vamp this is seduction, for the flapper it is post-war hedonism in its broadest sense. It is no coincidence, then, that it is precisely this pursuit of pleasure that connects Brett Ashley and Sasha Jansen. Neither Brett nor Sasha pursues a structured path or noble purpose, neither aspire to a career, both, in fact, do whatever they want, whether society approves or not. However, in doing so Brett and Sasha do contribute to the process of women’s liberation. Not because they participate in feminist campaigns or operations – they don’t – but purely because they live how they choose to live. With their chosen acts both women rebel against male domination in general and the prevailing social norms of their respective decades. For Brett, the norms are a product of Victorian heritage, for Sasha they are the standards of a sober and sensible thirties conservatism.","['modernism', 'feminism', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'rhys', 'hemingway', 'vamp', 'flapper', 'brett ashley', 'sasha jansen']"

It can be stated that through time, increasing importance is given to her: the adaptations become increasingly feminist to suit modern-day concerns with regard to the position of women in society. For the reason that scholarship has focused predominately on the portrayal of Orpheus, the present study will explore the shift in focus from Orpheus to Eurydice by discussing Eurydice’s portrayal in a selection of literary works that covers the Middle Ages and the twentieth century. Eurydice’s subordinate position in adaptations written during the Middle Ages will be explained on the basis of the anonymous Sir Orfeo in combination with the ninth century adaptation of the myth by King Alfred found in his Old English translation of Boethius’ The Consolation of Philosophy. Eurydice’s portrayal in the feminist twentieth century will be discussed using Margaret Atwood’s Orpheus(1) and the poem Eurydice by Carol Ann Duffy. The reason for the decision to discuss adaptations from the Middle Ages and the twentieth century lies in the fact that the adaptations produced during these two eras are almost polar opposites when it comes to the portrayal of Eurydice. As a result, the shift from Orpheus to Eurydice is most evident when comparing works from these two eras.","['Orpheus', 'Eurydice', 'Portrayal', 'Feminism', 'Orpheus and Eurydice', 'societal changes', 'portrayal']"

This paper explores the various political missions of the Chinese television broadcast, and examines the modern type of propaganda publicized and disseminated throughout contemporary TV formats. Since its first introduction to China, the domestic digital box has become one of most efficient media for the spread of a new form of propaganda, thus helping the Party in its attempts to construct people’s identities. Given the findings that the media have always acted as mouthpieces of the government, this research points out that some particular television formats have been widely employed as thought work distributors. This thesis focuses primarily on TV serial dramas, which, despite often appearing to be the most innocuous and entertaining of broadcasts, are instead practically brimming with political discourses. More specifically, the main aim of this study is to explore the social and political contexts that have given rise to Dynasty dramas, which have emerged as the most conspicuous genre present on prime time TV thus far. Which sorts of political messages are concealed behind historical dramas? And for which reasons is the Party so committed to promulgating these types of ideas? Do these messages serve to legitimize the Party’s mandates? This research departs from the well-researched trend of exploring governmental media use in broad terms, turning its attention instead to television in particular. This essay widely examines the use of television in modern society, and epitomizes it as the new platform upon which the Party is able to construct or mold “politically educated” and “spiritually civilized” identities. Ultimately, the active engagement of dramas with cultural and political issues is proved, through the analysis of two of the most renowned contemporary Dynasty series “Yongzheng Dynasty” and “The Great Han Emperor Wu”-.","['China', 'Television', 'TV Dramas', 'Political Discourses', 'Thought Work', 'The Great Emperor Han Wu', 'Hu Jintao']"

The internet has enabled fans from all over the world to communicate with each other and form an online subculture of sorts. The abundant use of loanwords from Japanese in this online discourse is striking. Using data collected from various manga and anime related websites and message boards, and interviews with the fans who use this kind of language, this thesis aims examine the characteristics of fanspeak from multiple angles. First its origins and social functions are discussed; why does fanspeak exist? Next, the semantics of fanspeak are analyzed; are the borrowed words used in the same meaning as in Japanese, or have their meanings and connotations shifted in the adaptation for use in English? Lastly, the morphological properties of fanspeak are addressed; what kind of grammatical transformations do Japanese words undergo in their adaptation? By addressing these issues I hope to clarify to what extent Japanese fanspeak has been incorporated into English internet discourse, and why and how this is diversifying the subcultural language of English speaking manga and anime fans.","['fanspeak', 'computer-mediated communication', 'sociolinguistics', 'fan culture', 'Japanese loanwords']"

The main question is what the images in the projects Infra and The Enclave can address and what they can mean, and in more concrete terms how they relate to notions of truth and reality as used in photography at large and documentary, journalistic and art photography in specific, and what role the infrared film emulsion has in this relation. The first chapter explains that Mosse’s images turn pink because of using colour infrared, a film once designed for the US Air Forces to make the invisible enemy visible. Mosse uses it as a metaphor for making the invisible visible; the conflict in Congo is neglected, hard to grasp and invisible. Colour infrared also has a history of anti-military sentiments, because it was later appropriated by hippie musicians for album artwork. Mosse counters the seriousness and literalness of regular journalistic and documentary photography by using cross processed infrared film, which connotes kitsch and experiment. Mosse’s photography is a turn away from photojournalism as decisive moment and a dissociation from superficial videojournalism, technically by returning to an analogue, slow medium and conceptually by focusing on the aftermath rather than the event. The second chapter shows how Mosse’s images relate to the realism and truth claims of documentary and journalism, on the basis of indexicality and iconicity. Mosse counters the conventions of realism and supposed indexicality by taking the documentary subject out of its context of ‘truth’, both literally by taking it from the press into the museum, and figuratively by employing a totally different, and overt style. His open, ambiguous images are overtly staged, larded with a seemingly constructed beautiful pinkness, and show a distanced, still world, with neutral looking, hard to typify subjects. Mosse forwards how subtly deceitful the ‘truth claim’ of photography is, and contrasts it by openly showing beautiful pink lies. No image, whether indexical and seemingly objective or not, cannot convey anything ‘truthful’ about the abstract nature of war and the complexity of human experience. He draws attention to the iconic elements openly, which may render his images more ‘truthful’. The pinkness of the photos looks iconic, but is inherently indexical. It appears that it is hard to define ‘truth’ on the basis of indexicality, because it is apparently hard to make a clear distinction between indexical and iconic elements. Chapter 3 discusses truth from a meta-perspective. As an answer to the crisis of representation in war photography Mosse opts for more conceptual modes of representation. He deconstructs the possibility to objectively and immediately represent reality by drawing attention to the constructedness of the photographic surface: he makes us aware of the fallacy of photographic representation. The ambiguous and indeterminate meaning of the photographs leaves room for the viewer’s imagination and complicates the possibility to understand. This way, he does justice to the idea of truth, while actually deconstructing it. Mosse’s images carry a risk of losing touch with reality. Their deconstruction and estrangement may destroy any link to the real world ‘out there’ in Congo. The reversal between surface and horrible subject may be amplified by the extreme beauty of the surface, but it may also cause the viewer trouble to see or imagine past it. The viewer’s sense of surprise and puzzledness when seeing Infra and The Enclave derives exactly from the function of a photograph as an ‘image of reality’. Mosse’s images amaze because they give such a new, beautiful, different image of war.","['photography infrared theory war congo conflict richard mosse', 'index icon']"
