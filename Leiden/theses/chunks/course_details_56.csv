In the Penumbra of Meaning: The Probative Value and Meaningfulness of Ngurrara Canvas II and the Spinifex Paintings in Native Title Claims,"Harris, Elizabeth","['Shobeiri, S.A.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 1992, the High Court of Australia took the radical step of breaking with Australian legal precedent to determine that the continent was not, in fact, terra nullius at the time of British colonisation. As a result of this landmark case, Indigenous Australians became able to obtain recognition of Native Title over their traditional lands and waters. This fundamental change to Australian land law has required the legal system to accept Indigenous forms of evidence as claimants seek recognition of Native Title. In some instances, this evidence has taken the form of contemporary, acrylic paintings: specifically, Ngurrara Canvas II in Application of the Ngurrara People, and Women’s Native Title Painting and Men’s Native Title Painting in Application of the Spinifex People. While scholars from anthropology, art history, legal studies, Indigenous studies and cultural studies have examined the use of these paintings in Native Title claims, assertions by most of these researchers that the paintings constitute evidence in the legal meaning of the word have not been securely bedded in an appropriate interdisciplinary framework. Taking an interdisciplinary approach spanning the fields of art history and law, this thesis asks how the National Native Title Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia have determined the probative value of these acrylic on canvas artworks by Indigenous Australian claimants in Native Title claims. In doing so, it examines how Australian art historian Rex Butler’s concept of “meaningfulness without meaning” (drawn from a discussion regarding the relationship between Indigenous art and Abstract Expressionism) can clarify how decision makers treat painted evidence. The thesis concludes that when determining Native Title claims, decision makers may legitimately accept Indigenous artworks as evidence of continuous connection to Country which the law requires, without requiring an understanding of what an artwork ‘means,’ and that these artworks can be considered transitional objects which transcend legal understandings of tradition.","['Postcolonialism', 'Australian Art', 'Indigenous Art', 'Indigenous Australians', 'Native Title', 'Art Law', 'Abstract Expressionism']"

Genderstereotyperend taalgebruik in sportverslaggeving: Een inhouds- en transitiviteitsanalyse,"Dorhout Mees, Florine","['Boogaart, R.J.U.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Verschillende eerdere onderzoeken tonen aan dat er sprake is van genderstereotypen bij sportverslaggeving, maar voor het Nederlands zijn dit soort onderzoeken nog schaars. Het doel van dit onderzoek was om inzicht te krijgen in de mate waarin er bij sportverslaggeving sprake is van stereotyperend taalgebruik. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd aan de hand van een corpusonderzoek waarbij een inhoudsanalyse en een transitiviteitsanalyse zijn gebruikt. Er is gekeken naar 334 clauses uit sportverslaggeving uit het AD en de Telegraaf over mannelijke en vrouwelijke voetballers en mannelijke en vrouwelijke hockeyers. De inhoudsanalyse richtte zich op de benamingen die werden gebruikt voor vrouwelijke en mannelijke sporters en de transitiviteitsanalyse werd gebruikt om te onderzoeken welke soort processen er bij beide geslachten het meest frequent voorkwamen en of dit significant van elkaar verschilde. Uit de resultaten van de inhoudsanalyse kunnen vanwege de kleine aantallen geen duidelijke kwantitatieve conclusies getrokken worden. Bij de transitiviteitsanalyse is gekeken naar hoe vaak mannelijke en vrouwelijke sporters werden gekoppeld aan een bepaald soort proces, zoals een materieel of mentaal proces. De resultaten van de transitiviteitsanalyse waren niet significant en de resultaten voldoen dus niet aan de verwachting dat er bij vrouwelijke sporters meer mentale processen worden gebruikt en bij mannelijke sporters meer materiële processen. Er is dus, tegen de verwachting in, geen sprake van stereotyperend taalgebruik bij sportverslaggeving. In toekomstig onderzoek is het belangrijk dat er wordt gekeken naar een grotere verscheidenheid aan dagbladen en naar het geslacht van de auteur van het artikel. Daarnaast zou het interessant zijn om te kijken naar het verschil in hoe vaak mannelijke en vrouwelijke sporters zelf aan het woord komen in artikelen van sportverslaggeving. Ten slotte zou het interessant kunnen zijn om naar meer verschillende sporten te kijken en bijvoorbeeld eveneens naar een typische ‘vrouwensport’ zoals turnen.",['Genderstereotypering']

"Quare id faciam, fortasse reQUEERis: 'Queer' (Anti)normativity in Catullus and Isobel Williams's Catullus: Shibari Carmina","Nijveld, Evelien","['Wessels, A.B.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Catullus’s poetry is known for its freshness, for its potent mixture of sensuality, crude language and erudition, for its fast-and-loose playing with rules and norms both sexual and poetic. But how ‘antinormative’ is Catullus really? How much of his play with ancient norms can a modern reader understand? And can modern creative translation serve as an analytical tool to interpret Catullus’s poetry? With Wiegman and Wilson’s (2015) approach to antinormativity in the field of queer studies as guide, this thesis looks at the norm as not just a static limit, but rather as a dynamic average that generates potential for change. Thus, the first chapter examines the presence of (anti)normativity, that is a dynamic movement between acceptance and rejection of the poetic and sexual norms of his time, in five of Catullus’s poems through close reading. The second chapter examines the question of creative translation, in the form of Isobel Williams’s oft-praised translation, which according to reviewer Ed Bedford (2021) manages to grasp Catullus’s meaning more astutely than almost any other translation. Williams’s chosen context for her translations, that of shibari, or Japanese rope bondage, provides a unique perspective on Catullus that forces her to make changes that both emphasize and hide nuances in the Latin. A close reading of Williams’s versions of the same five Catullan poems proves that her creative translation does indeed provide opportunities as an analytical tool, in opening our minds to interpretations of Catullus’s poetry we would not have thought of otherwise. So this thesis shows that both Catullus’s writing and Isobel Williams’s mode of translation can be called (anti)normative. Both authors engage in a dynamic movement of both acceptance and rejection, and it is precisely this movement that gives them strength.","['Latin', 'Catullus', 'Queer Theory', 'Antinormativity', 'Poetry', 'Close reading']"
Monstrous Desires: The Negative Characterization of Women Close to Power in Cassius Dio’s Roman History,"Bazalgette Courrèges-Lacoste, Zoé","['De Jonge, C. C.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Cassius Dio's 'Roman History' contains multiple colorful anecdotes concerning women with significant political power. Dio depicts powerful women in the act of mutilating corpses, cheating on their husbands and pursuing money and power at all cost. The question I set out to answer in this thesis is: how does Dio characterize women close to the seat of Roman power? And, more precisely, what gender stereotypes does he deploy in depicting these women? The women on whom this thesis will focus are Messalina and Agrippina, who were both married to emperor Claudius at one point, as well as Fulvia, the wife of Mark of Antony. The characterization of women in Cassius Dio’s work and the part that gender norms play in Dio’s negative characterization of someone have received little scholarly attention so far. While Cassius Dio’s portrayals of Agrippina and Messalina have been compared to each other, Fulvia has not been compared to either of these women before, although there are grounds for doing so: both Agrippina and Fulvia are accused of defiling the heads of political opponents. Each chapter of this thesis is dedicated to one of these three women. The most important part of each chapter will consist of close readings of passages I have chosen to highlight because they contain Dio’s most preposterous claims about these women. Such close readings can highlight not just how ancient ideas of gender are expressed within a large narrative structure, but also how they are reflected on a small scale, such as the choice of vocabulary. We will see how Cassius Dio incorporates the previous historiographical tradition concerning these women in his own narrative, while also innovating this tradition by exaggerating certain claims and adding elements to his narrative that have no precedent in the extant literary tradition. Fulvia, Messalina and Agrippina are all portrayed as crossing the boundaries of their female gender because they were involved in politics to a degree that was not acceptable for a Roman matron. But whereas Agrippina and Fulvia are explicitly ‘masculinized’ and their political involvement is stressed, Cassius Dio’s Messalina appears as an apolitical woman in the grip of vices that were considered to be typically feminine.","['Cassius Dio', 'Fulvia', 'Agrippina', 'Messalina', 'gender', 'sexuality']"

A Place for the Unknowable: Opacity in Photographic Aesthetics of Environmental Despoliation,"Einden, Joris van den","['Shobeiri, S.A.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This written and visual research project sets out to consider how the notion of opacity marks photographs of environmental despoliation. It argues that opacity can be a critically potent framework in photographic practices that engage with the ecological crisis by means of its construction of more affective modes of communicating a phenomenon that is itself often marked by incomprehensibility. In doing so, it conducts a comparative visual analysis of two photographic series: Anthropocene by Edward Burtynsky and Oil and Moss by Igor Tereshkov. It concludes that Burtynsky’s series constructs an awesome visuality that pursues a revelatory approach but, in actuality, ends up reasserting a set of beliefs that are already widely known, consequently not inciting new, critical modes of contemplating the ecological crisis. Tereshkov’s work, on the other hand, works to recombine the aesthetic with the critical; focusing on the interactions between the images’ visuality and their tactility, this thesis argues that Oil and Moss’ critical potency is established by means of its destabilising, disruptive aesthetics of the opaque. The ecological crisis is also a crisis of imagination: as humans, we struggle to grasp and make sense of the scale and severity of the devastation that appears to be creeping closer and closer. As such, we are in need of new, innovative modes of imagining our physical environments and how we relate to them. Photography, in its simultaneous ability to remember the past, to contemplate the future, and to imagine alternative iterations of the present, is one itinerary through which that may be achieved.","['Opacity', 'environmental aesthetics', 'photography', 'transparency', 'ecology', 'pollution']"

Listening Space: a study on using transmission ecologies to visualize the invisible,"Minnes, Lars",['Ali Shobeiri'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This MA thesis explores the relationship between human experience, the interface theory of perception, and consciousness through the artistic project Listening Space. The project, conducted by Afroditi Psarra and Audrey Briot, involves intercepting and decoding NOAA weather satellite audiovisual transmissions using a DIY satellite tracking station and a weaving machine. This research employs a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from art history, neuroscience, philosophy, and physics, to investigate two dimensions of the human experience: the physical and the metaphysical. The first chapter focuses on the human physical experience, utilizing the reversed engineered methodology of Erwin Panofsky and iconographic analysis to explore the symbolic values and meaning of artworks. It examines the ecologies of Listening Space, such as human-centered computing, interface design prototyping, environmental sciences, information visualization, binaries, and weaving, in relation to Donald Hoffman's interface theory of perception. This chapter tests the extent to which Listening Space illuminates the physical human experience against Hoffman's theory. The second chapter delves into the metaphysical human experience and its connection to idealistic philosophical theories by Wayne M. McDonnell, Itzhak Bentov, and Bernardo Kastrup. It explores consciousness, space-time, energy, vibration, frequency, and the limitations of Hoffman's theory. Through an analysis of Listening Space's ecologies, the chapter investigates how the project can shed light on the metaphysical human experience and its relationship with idealistic perspectives. The research findings reveal that Listening Space effectively merges technology and artistic exploration, transforming invisible transmissions into tangible representations. It serves as a platform to explore the metaphysical human experience, highlighting cosmic consciousness. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of art, specifically Listening Space, to provide deeper insights into the human experience and the realities beyond. The project's ecologies align with philosophical theories on consciousness and propose a way of metaphorically portraying the human brain as a fractal antenna. By intertwining theoretical concepts with Listening Space, this study tries to enrich our understanding of the physical and metaphysical dimensions of human existence and invites contemplation of universal consciousness.","['art, interface theory of perception, human experience, consciousness, Listening Space, metaphysics, physical reality, idealistic perspectives, idealism']"
Performance art in Bulgaria’s transition period: Ivan Moudov’s socially engaged performance in the absence of a contemporary cultural institution,"Lyutakova, Lia","['Fedorova, K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"During Bulgaria’s transition period (1990-2007), contemporary artistic practices were not seen as valuable symbolic capital, causing friction between the state and the contemporary artistic community. A museum for contemporary art did not exist, marking contemporary artists as invisible. In response, the artist Ivan Moudov expressed institutional critique towards the scarce state funding and the absence of a museum through the staging of a fake museum opening (MUSIZ) at an empty railway station. Moudov’s action amassed over 300 attendees who were unconsciously organised into a community. This thesis will argue that by affectively involving the attendees of MUSIZ into participation and granting the audience agency in relation to the setting and the public, Moudov created a ground for social engagement that empowered his audience. The presence of affect and social engagement are crucial agents in achieving positive social transformation for the contemporary cultural community, as will be discussed through the outcome of this performance.","['performance art', 'socially engaged art', 'institutional critique', 'affect', 'post-Soviet']"
The Afterlife of Consumer Culture,"Man, Irene de","['Davis, L.B.', 'Noach, S.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Especially in our contemporary material culture with mass production and consumer culture playing big roles, a deceased loved one leaves behind many possessions. These possessions can range from their IKEA bedside table that cousin Maddie can put to good use in her new dorm room, to their last shopping lists scribbled down on a crumbled up, sticky note. Seemingly unimportant objects like these will be a red thread throughout this paper. Still-life paintings have the ability to invert seemingly unimportant objects. By putting the focus of the artwork on the material objects, these seemingly unimportant objects become important. Rachel Grobstein’s series Bedside Tables shines light on the often overlooked aspects of daily life exploring questions related to memory, routine and identity. In this consumer culture we have so many items around us and in our possession, that the importance of many of these is often forgotten. When they are -subconsciously- brought together by a person they can start to tell a story, the life story of an individual. Without the body being present in the artwork, it leaves just the story of a person, the memory of them. When we take a closer look at her work through the traditional Vanitas Tradition these artworks start to remind us of how irrelevant and unimportant these material objects are once we pass; we cannot take these with us anyway. Yet, as these material possessions might not be important for an individual once they pass, these possessions stay important to the people they leave behind, for their process of grief, for keeping their memory alive in this material world. It goes further than our physical world but represents this right through material objects from this very physical world. It is not about the physical presence of the body or corpse, but about the memory of the person. However, it is this memory that is represented through the material objects/possessions of the deceased person. The series Bedside Tables represents something outside of our physical world, but does so through the physical objects of our consumer culture. Can the contemporary work by Rachel Grobstein allow us to combine both the still-life Vanitas tradition and the theories surrounding death, memory and material culture? In this paper I argue that our contemporary consumer culture shines a new light on the well-known Vanitas tradition, focussing on the seemingly unimportant objects produced for consumer culture and their role in memory after death in a western society. At the beginning of this paper there will be an analysis of Rachel Grobstein’s series Bedside Tables as well as the traditional Vanitas tradition and how this tradition has been adapted in modern times through art movements like Pop Art. As a theoretical framework I will be using Elizabeth Hallam and Jenny Hockey’s Death, Memory and Material Culture (2001) and Jennifer Owen’s Distancing material effects to reconcile loss: Sorting memories and emotion in self-storage (2020), both of which will help me reveal the importance of material objects in experiences of grief, mourning and memorialising. As I take a deeper look into death and consumer culture and the notion of grief through the theory of Owen and Hallam and Hockey.","['consumer culture', 'mass production', 'afterlife', 'grief', 'Vanitas', 'still life']"

Het onderzoek concentreert zich met name op de jaren 1687, 1707, 1739, 1747 en 1782, waarin belangrijke troonswisselingen plaatsvonden. De centrale vraag van dit onderzoek luidt: Welke betekenis hadden de geschenken die onderling werden uitgewisseld tussen het hof van Kandy en de VOC tijdens troonswisselingen in de achttiende eeuw? Het onderzoek werpt ook licht op de symboliek achter bepaalde geschenken, zoals leeuwen, koetsen, kronen en zwaarden, die meer dan alleen economische betekenis hadden en diepe diplomatieke implicaties met zich meebrachten. Door de VOC-archieven te onderzoeken, wordt de diplomatieke aard van de uitwisseling van geschenken blootgelegd. Deze uitwisselingen van geschenken maakten deel uit van een complex diplomatiek spel, waarin de VOC haar status wilde bevestigen, maar tegelijkertijd de relatie wilde onderhouden en bevorderen. Het blijft echter onduidelijk of de VOC vooral haar superioriteit wilde tonen of daadwerkelijk investeerde in het bevorderen van relaties door middel van het geven van geschenken.","['VOC, Kandy, uitwisseling van geschenken, achttiende eeuw']"

In relation to the public space it means that monuments that are connected to racial oppression often have become the target of iconoclastic acts of activists. An example of such a contested monument is the statue of James Marion Sims. Instead of attacking the actual statue, which is usually done in iconoclastic acts, artist Doreen Garner responded to the controversies surrounding Sims by harming a replica of his statue in her performance Purge (2017). This research paper investigates how the usage of this replica problematizes the existing definitions of iconoclasm and to what extent it can shed a different light on iconoclastic practices. To answer this question, anthropological theories on voodoo will be used, as the creation of a representation with the purpose of harming it, reminds of voodoo practices. By investigating the concept of iconoclasm in relation to voodoo, this research reveals the significant overlap between voodoo and iconoclasm, as both concepts function on the basis that a representation is targeted for its similarities with the referent.","['iconoclasm', 'voodoo', 'performance', 'heritage', 'anti-racism']"

Frankl’s logotherapy establishes how humans are capable of being free. As I think there are valid parallels to be made with Kantian moral philosophy, I will show how Kantian-inspired concepts can help us understand in what way human beings carry responsibilities for their identity as persons. However, logotherapy’s ambiguous account of meaning will be re-interpreted to accommodate the subjectivist notion of wilfully striving into a hybrid notion in line with Susan Wolf. Objective formulae of evaluative standards of value constrain and inform the subjectively motivated grounds for actions that are a necessary part of being a person. I will opt for a Kantian formula of value because of its conduciveness to logotherapy’s assumption of human freedom and humanity as an end in itself. As for the notion of subjective striving, I will argue along the lines of Christine Korsgaard that being a person means acting in a way that endorses on what grounds we wish to define ourselves as persons. As such, meaning comes as a by-product of an agent taking responsibility for acting to constitute himself into a particular identity.","['Responsibility, logotherapy, meaning, identity']"

This paper introduces an intertextual analysis of Rafael França’s enigmatic video work Prelude to an Announced Death, concluded two days prior to the artist’s own death. The artwork’s ambiguity seems to welcome potentialities of interpretations, such as that of the AIDS crisis in a 1990s Brazilian context. Considering the influence of the Catholic Church in Brazilian society, especially a Marxist strain that arose within the Church’s institution in opposition to Brazilian military dictatorship, the possibility of analysing the artwork through the lens of Catholic symbols brings attention to the practices that constituted the meaning of AIDS in 1990s Brazil. In addressing the practices that revolve around the virus, this text suggests that the (video-)text by Rafael França can be understood through a web of historical, cultural, social, amongst others, texts.","['Death-Foretold', 'Intertextuality', 'AIDS', 'Meaning', 'Catholicism']"

However, for visually impaired people, the possibilities have not yet been explored. The method of 3D printing can provide haptic interactions with artworks for visually impaired people, yet museums have been hesitant in including 3D prints in their collection out of fear that the reproduction would threaten the authenticity of the original. This thesis explores the possibilities of using 3D prints of paintings in the museum space to achieve the inclusion of visually impaired people by using arguments based on studies in 3D printing technology, museum studies, authenticity studies and by reviewing previous exhibitions that include 3D prints. Eventually, the found results will be applied to design a 3D print of Girl with a Pearl Earring, creating a design that is not an exact copy of the original, but an interactive 3D print that triggers more senses than just touch to create an art experience as complete as possible.","['3D printing, haptic art experience, museum model, visually impaired people, authenticity']"

The aim is to focus on significance of the figure of the flaneur in relation to the differences of mobility between men and women. In addition, the specific role of and differences between public spaces as opposed to private spaces are discussed. In order to do so, the short story Street Haunting, written by Virginia Woolf in 1930, will be used to incorporate all these aspects. It is important to question these matters as these issues are still at bay in today’s society. The gap this thesis will fill is that it discusses the issue of having no explicitly gendered narrator, yet, almost all literature on the short story interpret the narrator to be female. This is due to certain social cues within the short story. The main question that will be answered is: How is the walker represented in Street Haunting and how does this relate to public and private spaces? The method used in order to arrive at an answer for this main question is close reading. This entails that every sentence of the short story will be examined closely and will be deconstructed and be read in its context in order to interpret the meaning of it. The aim of this thesis is to make readers aware that the power-related gender-mobility issues that are addressed in the short story, are still relevant today.","['Virginia Woolf, Street Haunting, Narrative, Gender-mobility, Flaneur']"

Löwensteyn'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op de betekenissen en invloed van het in het Uffizi tentoongestelde schilderij Judith onthoofdt Holofernes uit 1620-21 van Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1653) binnen verschillende historische, sociale en culturele contexten. De verschillende betekenissen die zijn ontleend aan het schilderij worden onderzocht door een interdisciplinaire benadering van kunstgeschiedenis, waarbij historische analyse, iconografische interpretatie en discoursanalyse worden toegepast. Het werk van Gentileschi wordt vergeleken met dat van haar mannelijke tijdgenoten en beschouwd binnen de opkomst van de feministische kunstgeschiedenis. Daarnaast worden de keuzes door museumconservatoren met betrekking tot de interpretatie van kunstwerken onderzocht aan de hand van de vertoning van Judith onthoofdt Holofernes van Gentileschi naast het in 2012 gemaakte schilderij Judith en Holofernes van Kehinde Wiley (1977-). Deze studie maakt onder andere gebruik van de theorieën van Roland Barthes, Mieke Bal en Michel Foucault om de beeldtaal en constructie van betekenis te begrijpen. De analyse van het schilderij en de contextuele benadering dragen bij aan een dieper begrip van dit kunstwerk","['Artemisia Gentileschi, Judith en Holofernes, Roland Barthes’ Mythe, transformatie betekenissen, feministische kunstgeschiedenis.']"

However, ‘crisis’ did not start there, as historical crises can be traced back to the very beginning of Christianity. At the turn of the first century, a certain bishop in Asia Minor wrote letters revealing of this turbulent start of a new religion. When literally being escorted to his martyr’s death (how turbulent do you want it), Ignatius of Antioch wrote several letters to communities of Christ believers. He shows a surprisingly independent, stylistically quite idiosyncratic and rhetorically brilliant voice on central issues, concerning the ‘humanity’ of Christ and his believers, which renders him indispensable for any analysis of the early Christian crises of his time. Writing right after the first generation of believers, he is in dialogue with apostolic heritage. He explicitly refers to Paul, offering insight into the mechanics of historical development, which involves debate and, as you will, ‘crisis’. This thesis takes Ignatius’ testimony to give meaning to the historical crises of the time.","['Early Christianity', 'Crisis', 'Paul', 'Ignatius', 'Antioch', 'Anthropology', 'Continuity', 'Coherence']"

The Domestication and Foreignization of Neologisms in Three Dutch Translations of Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,"Meij van Streefkerk, Laura de","['Valdez, S.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Despite SF’s general underrepresentation both in academia and the publishing world, there are scholars that have turned to this genre and studied it in relation to Lawrence Venuti’s concepts of foreignization and domestication, introduced in The Translator’s Invisibility (1995). Domestication has been considered “especially problematic due to its inventiveness of fictive worlds and the reliance of its estrangement function upon specific language” (Campbell, 2021, p. 6). One of the ways in which this inventiveness is expressed, is through neologisms, as Freedman (2000) explains, “this device being perhaps the most paradigmatic expression of science-fictional diction” (2000, p. 37). One of the scholars that has discussed neologisms in his work is Peter Newmark (1988), whom we will be discussing in this thesis. Newmark (1988) recognizes in his book, A Textbook of Translation, that translating neologisms is a challenging task, as he emphasizes that “neologisms are perhaps the non-literary and the professional translator’s biggest problem” (p.140). The aim of this thesis is thus to study neologisms within the SF genre in relation to Venuti’s concepts of domestication and foreignization. It will do so by conducting a case study on a SF text, namely Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (DADOES) by American writer Philip K. Dick. In the case study, three Dutch translations of DADOES will be compared to each other and the source text: De Elektrische Nachtmerrie (1969) by Frank Visser, Dromen Androïden van Elektrische Schapen? (1979) by Ivain Rodriguez de León and Blade Runner: Dromen Androïden over Elektrische Schapen? (2017) by Irving Pardoen. The research will focus on chapter three and the neologisms in it. The 26 neologisms were classified using Newmark’s (1988) nine categories of translation procedures, with an additional 10th (proposed category) and 11th category to cover instances of omission. The central research question of this thesis then, is whether the translation choices made by the three translators point to a foreignization or domestication-oriented approach, and which of the three translations can be considered the most domesticated based on the findings. As for the hypothesis, it is speculated that the 1969 and 1979 translations of neologisms will reveal a more domestication-oriented approach, whereas the 2017 text is expected to be more foreignized. In writing this thesis and conducting the case study, I set out to give insight into the potential that SF texts hold for academia and the translation field. Campbell (2021) emphasizes how SF is a “powerful means of communication, not only because it can serve to explore and explain the effect of technological developments, whether native or important, but also and more importantly because it can be a powerful means of social criticism” (p.2.). In a world that is constantly evolving as technology advances at a rapid rate, the subjects discussed in SF are more relevant than ever. Therefore, by studying the “inventiveness” (Freedman, 2000, p.37) of the SF genre in the form of neologisms and in how they are translated, we could learn more about the dynamics and developments in our own world as we speculate about the reasons for these translation choices.","['Translation', 'Vertalen', 'English', 'Dutch', 'Peter Newmark', 'Lawrence Venuti', 'Philip K.

Does Direction Matter? The degree of cultural transplantation in the translation of cultural references in modern literature from English to Dutch and vice versa,"Binnendijk, Sandra","['Zeven, K.L.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Translating cultural references (CRs) in literature is notoriously difficult and depends on context, significance of the CR in the text, and familiarity of the TT reader with the source language and culture. TT readers’ needs can be expected to be different depending on their knowledge of the source language and culture. This means that for one language pair, strategies for the translation of CRs still differ, depending on directionality of the translation. This study provides a quantitative analysis of the first 100 CRs from 5 novels translated from English to Dutch, and 5 novels translated from Dutch to English. The translation pairs were categorized by translation strategy (using Olk, 2001) as well as by type of CR (using Grit, 1997), analysing the degree of domestication or foreignization of the overall translation strategies as well as the strategies per CR type. The analysis shows that, overall, the strategies used for translating from English to Dutch are more foreignizing. The results from this study may be used to aid translator’s choices by providing insight into the effect of their individual choices, as well as future reader reception studies.","['CSIs, CRs, cultural references, realia, domestication, foreignization']"

"'A hideously complex and awkward issue' Opvattingen van het Conservatieve schaduwkabinet ten aanzien van de Europese Economische Gemeenschap, 1975-1979","Finelli, Donato","['Rieger, B.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Toen Margaret Thatcher premier van Groot-Brittannië werd in 1979, keken de lidstaten van de Europese Economische Gemeenschap (EEG) hoopvol naar het eiland om een betere samenwerking te bewerkstelligen dan het geval was onder de Labour regering. Zij kwamen echter bedrogen uit: Thatcher bleek vooral de confrontatie op te zoeken. Deze houding is opvallend omdat de Conservatieve Partij in 1975 tijdens het referendum nog veel pro-Europese geluiden liet horen. Deze scriptie kijkt als gevolg hiervan naar de tussenliggende periode, en stelt de vraag in hoeverre het Conservatieve schaduwkabinet van Margaret Thatcher tussen 1975-1979 een transitie heeft doorgemaakt in hun opvattingen over de EEG. Er wordt hoofdzakelijk gekeken naar drie vraagstukken: ten eerste de kwestie van directe Europese Parlementsverkiezingen, ten tweede een brede samenwerking van centrumrechtse partijen in het Europees Parlement, en ten derde de houding van het schaduwkabinet ten aanzien van het Europees Monetair Stelsel (EMS). Uit de analyse komt vooral naar voren dat het Conservatieve schaduwkabinet in deze periode in de oppositie een ambigue houding erop nahield. Aan de ene kant trachtte zij haar pro-Europese imago van de voorgaande jaren te bewaren, en zette zich daardoor actief in voor betere Europese samenwerking. Aan de andere kant speelde de soevereiniteitskwestie een belemmerende rol voor de partij. Bezien vanuit het principe van Britse parlementaire soevereiniteit, waar de Conservatieven zich aan vast klampten, was het nagenoeg onmogelijk zich te committeren aan grote Europese projecten die eind jaren zeventig werden voorgesteld. Daardoor zat het schaduwkabinet in deze periode vast tussen deze twee uitersten. Het gevolg? Het schaduwkabinet bleef zich openlijk graag etaleren als de pro-Europese partner, maar achter de schermen stapelden de kritische geluiden van Conservatieve schaduwministers zich op, onder aanvoering van de partijleider (Thatcher) zelf. Aan de hand van deze scriptie is een nuance geboden op de bestaande literatuur, en is een lacune gevuld in het historisch onderzoek naar deze periode. Verder heeft de scriptie laten zien dat veel confrontaties in de jaren tachtig onder Thatcher teruggevoerd kunnen worden op de problemen die de Conservatieve Partij al had ten aanzien van Europese integratie in de jaren zeventig. Uit de analyse valt te concluderen dat Thatchers' fameuze toespraak in Brugge (1988) niet uit de lucht kwam vallen.","['EEG', 'politieke geschiedenis', 'Groot-Brittannië', 'Conservatieve Partij']"

Voorverpakt nieuws in de Krimpenerwaard: knip- en plakjournalistiek op lokaal niveau,"Rook, Noah","['Jong, J.C. de', 'Burger, J.P.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek is getracht een antwoord te geven op de vraag: “in hoeverre worden de (online) nieuwsberichten van RTV Krimpenerwaard beïnvloed door pr-berichten en persberichten?” Hiervoor is een automatische inhoudsanalyse uitgevoerd om het percentage voorverpakt nieuws te achterhalen. Het is relevant om onderzoek te doen naar de hoeveelheid voorverpakt nieuws aangezien “redacties risico lopen betreffende hun betrouwbaarheid, transparantie, eigen karakter en onafhankelijkheid naarmate zij in hun algemene berichtgeving sterker afhankelijk zijn van persberichten” (Hijmans, Buijs, Schafraad, & d’Haenens, 2011, p. 90). Er is al veel geschreven over voorverpakt nieuws en over de effecten van dit fenomeen. Echter, de meeste onderzoeken zijn gericht op nationaal niveau. Dit onderzoek is een casestudy naar de Nederlandse lokale/regionale journalistiek. Met behulp van het computerprogramma Turnitin zijn de overeenkomstscores van ruim honderd artikelen berekend. De overeenkomstscore gaf aan in welke mate een artikel gebaseerd was op een pr- of persbericht. Hierbij waren de scores verdeeld in vier groepen (0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60% en 60% >). Deze categorieën waren gebaseerd op het artikel “Bronnen in het nieuws” van Scholten en Ruigrok (2009). Een score tussen de 0 en de 20 procent duidde erop dat het artikel een ander onderwerp had dan de bron. Tussen de 20 en 40 procent duidde op (waarschijnlijk) eenzelfde onderwerp. Een score tussen de 40 en 60 procent betekende dat het over hetzelfde (specifieke) onderwerp ging. Een score die hoger dan 60 procent was, betekende dat het artikel voor een merendeel was gekopieerd. Uit de automatische inhoudsanalyse bleek dat 37,1 procent van de artikelen bestond uit knip- en plakwerk. Oftewel, 37,1 procent van de artikelen had een hogere overeenkomstscore dan 60 procent ten opzichte van de geraadpleegde bron. Om een vergelijking te kunnen maken met voorafgaande studies over dit onderwerp, was het nodig om vergelijkbare criteria toe te passen. Bovendien zijn soortgelijke criteria nodig om dezelfde labels te kunnen gebruiken, zoals “gedeeltelijk” en “grotendeels gekopieerd"". Wegens deze redenen is de hoeveelheid gedeeltelijk gekopieerde artikelen eveneens genoteerd. We spreken van gedeeltelijk gekopieerd wanneer een deel van de tekst is gebaseerd op voorverpakt nieuws. Artikelen die dus tussen de 20-40 procent en tussen de 40-60 procent overeenkwamen met de geraadpleegde bron, vielen onder de categorie “gedeeltelijk gekopieerd”. Uit het onderzoek kwam voort dat 59,4 procent van de artikelen volledig of gedeeltelijk was geknipt en geplakt bij RTV Krimpenerwaard. Op basis van deze cijfers werd geconcludeerd dat de omroep afhankelijk is van pr-berichten en persberichten, dat ook wel “voorverpakt nieuws” wordt genoemd. Aan deze conclusie moet echter worden toegevoegd dat de artikelen van RTV Krimpenerwaard niet zomaar bestempeld mogen worden als gratis reclame. Dat komt door de aard van de bronnen, het merendeel van de persberichten waren afkomstig van niet-commerciële instanties zoals de gemeente, de politie, cultuur- en sportverenigingen en de GGD.",

In het Belang van een Toekomstgericht Geheugen: Post-seculier Feminisme in Literaire Representaties van Pope Joan,"Hoek, Phébe","['Hettinga, L.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Film- en literatuurwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Pausin Johanna is een figuur die al eeuwenlang een plaats inneemt in het westerse culturele domein, met name onder de Engelse naam Pope Joan. Ondanks het gegeven dat de legende van de pausin wijst op interessante spanningen binnen het feminisme ten aanzien van religie, zijn er niet veel lezingen die een specifiek feministische benadering aanhouden. Relatief recentelijke ontwikkelingen die plaats hebben gevonden binnen het feminisme bieden echter nieuwe potenties voor deze figuur. De zogenoemde postsecular turn in het feminisme belicht hoe het Europees feminisme gekenmerkt wordt door een zeker atheïsme en het pleit voor een discourse die rekening houdt met religieuze, feministische stemmen. Deze scriptie bestudeert meerdere representaties van de legende en achterhaalt hoe de figuur van pausin Johanna en de mogelijke betekenisgeving van verschillende representaties door de tijd heen transformeert in relatie tot de post-seculiere feministische theorie. Dit gebeurt aan de hand van analyses van drie verschillende representaties met het oog op hoe pausin Johanna vorm krijgt. De drie representaties die worden besproken zijn: The Female Prelate, Being the History of the Life & Death of Pope Joan a Tragedy: as It Is Acted at the Theatre Royal geschreven door Elkanah Settle (1680), Emmanuel Royidis’ Pope Joan (1866) (vertaald en geadapteerd door Lawrence Durrell vanuit het Grieks in 1954) en ten slotte Donna Woolfolk Cross’ Pope Joan: A Novel (1996). Hierbij wordt enerzijds aangetoond dat het theoretisch kader van het post-seculier feminisme voor nieuwe interpretatieve mogelijkheden zorgt die de spanning tussen feminisme en religie binnen de figuur van pausin Johanna niet alleen benaderbaar maar tevens inzichtelijk maken. Anderzijds vormt pausin Johanna een belichaming van de complexiteit van de intersectie van gender en religie en een model om verschillende post-seculiere theorieën mee op de proef te stellen in literaire context. Het blijkt dan ook dat de figuur van de vrouwelijke paus, die al zo vroeg als de 13e eeuw voor het eerst in documenten is verschenen, een unieke relevantie heeft voor het hedendaagse post-seculiere bewustzijn binnen het feminisme.","['Pope Joan', 'Post-secularisme', 'Feminisme', 'Literatuur']"

"A reappraisal of Schelling's attempt at a system of freedom in his 1809 Freedom Essay; on the meaning of system, freedom and necessity","Laurens, Christa","['Rozemund, R.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis I aspire to contribute to the existing literature on Schelling's 1809 Freedom Essay by providing an interpretation that explicitly focusses on the resulting view on freedom in connection with Schelling’s overarching attempt at a system of freedom. To this end, the thesis consists of three chapters. The first chapter aims to bring out the way in which the central problem of Schelling’s Freedom Essay – that is, the task of thinking freedom systematically – is not an isolated phenomenon but rather gradually emerges as the fundamental problem of the philosophical context to which Schelling belongs, that is, of German Idealism. The second chapter aims to introduce the essential elements of Schelling’s attempt at thinking a system of freedom through the lens of the question of a living, as opposed to a dead, philosophy. The third chapter aims to defend the central claim of the thesis, namely that Schelling’s attempt to think freedom systematically transforms the very meaning of system, freedom and necessity. On my interpretation, as developed in this thesis, the meaning of system is not to be understood as a closed totality, springing from a self-evident first principle from which everything follows with mechanical necessity. Rather, Schelling’s system is the whole, a whole within which every part is connected to every other part, grounded by the elusive groundless ground of grounds: the Ungrund. Within this system, human freedom is not merely freedom of choice, that is, the capacity to choose without a determining ground, merely because it is willed, between either A or B. Rather, human freedom is the capacity for good and evil. Each and every individual self-determines her own essence through an eternal act independent from temporal and causal relations. On such a view, freedom and necessity are one. We freely determine ourselves to be the kind of individual that we are, that is, must be. As such, it is not an estranged mathematical necessity that rules Schelling’s system. Rather, the contradiction between freedom and necessity, groundlessly grounded by a fundamental willing, forms the beating heart of Schelling’s living system.","['Schelling', ""Schelling's Freedom Essay"", 'German Idealism', 'a living system', 'system and freedom', 'freedom and necessity']"

The topics, discourse, and case studies are relevant today, as they highlight and question societal and cultural structures that uphold an unjust system that has actively been harming humans, animals, and the environment. A posthumanist and feminist approach is an attempt to view these issues from different angles and study whether the artworks of Hasegawa and Smrekar offer useful insights into tackling the nature-culture divide.","['Feminism, Posthumanism, Contemporary Art']"

Representation for Dynastic Legitimization: The Representation of King Saint Stephen I of Hungary (975-1038) for the Legitimization of the Dynasties of the Hungarian Angevins and the Hunyadi,"Koch, Robin","['Buc, P.C.H.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the thesis, the research focus was the use of representations of King Saint Stephen (r. 1000/1001-1038), the founder of the Hungarian Kingdom and member of the dynasty of Árpád, by the dynasties of the Hungarian Angevins and the Hunyadi to legitimize their own rule. Representations were divided into five categories - namely textual, visual, material, heraldic, and performative representation. A comparison was made between the two dynasties of the Hungarian Angevins and the Hunyadi, which lead to the conclusion that under king Matthias Hunyadi (r. 1458-1490), Stephen was represented more effectively and in new forms. This was in spite of the Hungarian Angevins being pioneers in the representation of Stephen, since they had had a greater urgency to legitimize themselves using representation after the previous Árpádian dynasty had ended in 1301. The thesis used a broad selection of source-types - (illuminated) chronicles, frescoes, coins, seals, altarpieces, and church interiors and exteriors - to trace the forms that were given to the representations of Stephen.","['Hungary', 'Medieval Hungary', 'Saints', 'Beata Stirps', 'Saint Stephen', 'King Stephen I of Hungary', 'Hunyadi', 'Matthias Hunyadi', 'Corvinus', 'Anjou', 'Hungarian Angevins', 'Charles Robert of Anjou', 'Louis the Great', 'Árpád', 'Representation']"

On the Limits of Conceptual Engineering and its Place within Philosophical Methodology,"Abshari, Fatemeh","['Lipman, M.A.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Filosofie (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"While Cappelen successfully argues in Fixing Language that conceptual engineering partially consists of making changes in the intension and extension of a term and partially on the object level, I will argue that the degree to which conceptual engineering is possible very much depends on the sort of term in question. Conceptual engineering depends on certain semantic and metaphysical factors, these factors are for example the way in which meaning and reference are fixed or to what kind of entity the term refers. The aim of this paper is to firstly point out that mere stipulation will not suffice to achieve semantic change. Secondly, that for a term t, depending on the sort of kind it refers to, natural kind or social kind, conceptual engineering is either metaphysically impossible or we have no real idea how to achieve it. Thirdly, I will argue that it is unclear how philosophical terms are to be understood, whether conceptual engineering is possible for philosophical terms depends on that. Finally, the importance of conceptual engineering as a philosophical methodology depends on how distinct it is from conceptual analysis. I will show that some cases labelled as conceptual engineering are part of analysis.","['Conceptual Engineering', 'Externalism', 'Natural kinds', 'Social kinds', 'Metaphilosophy']"
An Acoustic Phonetic Description of Ecuadorian Siona Monophthongs,"Damonte, Oleksandra","['Botma, B.', 'Bruil, M.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I provide the first acoustic description of Ecuadorian Siona phonemic vowels, six oral vowels and six corresponding nasal vowels. Two phonetic dimensions – vowel height, measured through the first formant frequency (F1), and vowel backness, measured through the second formant frequency (F2) – are taken as the descriptors of vowel quality. These dimensions are used to illustrate the target vowels in their acoustic space. Vowel quantity, which refers to vowel duration, is also measured. For each target vowel, the mean frequencies of F1 and F2, as well as the durational means, are presented. In addition, the effects of different phonological environment on the realization of target vowels are investigated. Ultimately, I construct the acoustic vowel space for oral and nasal vowels, and I compare the acoustic properties of the two types of vowels. The results for oral vowels demonstrate six distinct qualities, similar to the ones described by Bruil (2014), with the back vowels appearing consistently lower in the vowel space. Nasal vowel space shows more variability and a general shrinking effect of vocalic contrasts. The findings also demonstrate a nasalization effect whereby all nasal vowels are on average lower than their oral counterparts. Finally, the analysis revealed that the vowels /i, ɨ̃/ are phonetically long, at least in the context that they appeared.","['acoustic vowel space', 'vowel height', 'vowel backness', 'vowel length', 'formants', 'nasalization', 'Tukanoan']"

"Rewriting Narratives: Ghosts, Trauma, and Memory in Contemporary Anglophone Vietnamese Novels","Quispel, Chloë",['Ruth Clemens'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study analyses the representation of different ghosts in Anglophone novels taking place during Vietnam’s twentieth-century history and how the novels and ghosts challenge the dominant cultural narratives. Within this thesis, I argue that these ghosts are presented in different manners depending on how the novel challenges the dominant narrative and memory, whether the ghosts and characters in the novel enact the cultural norms in the United States or Vietnam, and which kind of haunting is observable in the novel. Regardless of these factors, the ghosts challenge the dominant collective narrative in a specific imagined community, a collection of communities as a whole, such as the dominant collective memory prevalent in the United States or Vietnam, or on a worldwide scale. The thesis focuses on the following three novels. The first of these novels is She Weeps Each Time You’re Born (Barry 2014), where ghosts are present as metaphysical entities that try to pass on into the afterlife through recounting their deaths whilst simultaneously introducing formerly silenced information and ghosts as unobservable entities where trauma and grief haunt the living. The second novel analysed is On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous (Vuong 2020), which presents the intertextual ghosts that serve as metaphors as trauma influences the character’s everyday lives and the family becomes similar to a ghost due to their invisible existence in the United States after immigrating. The third novel is The Mountains Sing (Phan Quế Mai 2020), where a character nicknamed Wicked Ghost is similar to a metaphysical ghost and haunts the neighbourhood and protagonist’s family. Alongside the character nicknamed Wicked Ghost are the unobservable ghosts of trauma and grief which haunt the protagonist and her family, as well as the ghost as a metaphor for the absent presence of historical events institutionally forgotten. These novels discuss events before, during, and after the Vietnam War from the perspective of a Vietnamese author and Vietnamese characters, and all three novels include a variety of ghosts that are either metaphysical or intertextual. Thus far, little research has been done on such novels, as their increased representation is recent. This study then serves as a starting point for other academic research that might surround ghosts’ function in Anglophone literature on conflicts in Vietnam.","['Trauma, Vietnam War, Ghosts, Contemporary novels, Literature']"

Spectatorial Experience in the Immersive Theatre Performance “The Burnt City”: Navigating the space of agency,"Gabor, Miruna Medeea","['Fedorova, K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper examines the notion of spectatorial agency within the immersive theatre performance ""The Burnt City"" by Punchdrunk. Immersive theatre is a form of artistic expression that seeks to dissolve the traditional boundaries between performers and audience members, inviting active engagement and participation. ""The Burnt City"" pushes the boundaries of spectatorial agency, offering a unique and thought-provoking experience. The study investigates the extent to which spectators can exercise agency and influence the narrative and outcome of the performance, and to which extent this agency is predesigned. The paper explores the strategies employed in ""The Burnt City"" to empower spectators and provide them with a sense of agency. It delves into the interplay between physical space, narrative structure, and participants' actions, highlighting how the structure of their choices and interactions shape the unfolding of their experience in a predesigned manner. The findings contribute to the evolving field of immersive theatre by shedding light on the limits of spectatorial agency. While ""The Burnt City"" offers a highly immersive and participatory experience, this study reveals the presence of constraints and limitations that shape participants' agency within predefined boundaries. These limitations may arise from factors such as predetermined narrative arcs, the influence of performers, or the structural constraints of the performance space that are acting as indicators of guidance. Understanding the boundaries and possibilities of spectatorial agency in immersive theatre enhances the audience’s role and potential impact within immersive theatrical contexts. This enriches their perception and appreciation of this innovative form of performance.","['spectatorial agency, immersive theatre, navigation system, physical space, immersive experience, fiction-reality, instinct']"

The Representation and Retrieval of Grammatical Gender in Bidialectal Speakers of Swiss German and Standard German: Evidence from a Picture-Word Interference Task,"Wölfle, Andreas","['Schiller, N.O.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In many languages, a noun’s grammatical gender is expressed overtly via its definite article. The languages of interest in this study were Swiss German and Standard German. While both languages have a high lexical similarity and share the same gender system, some nouns do not share the same grammatical gender in both languages. Bidialectal speakers of these languages must have different representations for these words. This provides an opportunity to investigate the representation of lexico-syntactic features in the mental lexicon and the process of gender retrieval in bidialectals simultaneously. In an experiment employing the picture-word interference paradigm, participants named a picture (article + noun) while ignoring a distractor word. Results showed faster naming latencies in Standard German when the grammatical gender of the picture and the distractor word matched than when they did not match. In Swiss German, we did not observe such an effect. We assumed that the gender ambiguity of some Swiss German varieties diluted the effect. In Standard German, we found markedly slower naming latencies for nouns with different grammatical gender in each language than with the same grammatical gender. We argued that Swiss German interfered in Standard German since erroneously used articles corresponded to the grammatical gender in Swiss German. This effect supported the Revised Hierarchical Model according to which bilinguals have a separate lexicon for both languages, and the lexical link from the second to the first language is stronger than from the first to the second language.","['gender congruency effect, picture-word interference paradigm, WEAVER++ model, Swiss German, Standard German, bidialectalism, Revised Hierarchical Model']"

Continuously On The Move: A Study on Senegalese Art: Depicting “Migration” Through an Artistic Lens,"Kay, Hannah",['Prof.dr. M.E. de Bruijn'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The arts have proven to be a transformative force for social change in the Senegalese context (Dimé, 2022; Gueye, 2013). This interdisciplinary study deploys an artistic lens to analyse the “migration” situation, as artists are an emerging actor in the Senegalese “migration” discourse. It adopts a more reflective stance in the study of “migration”-related art by exploring what knowledge Senegalese artists and artistic practices produce about “migration”. Through ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, this research includes a series of reflections on artistic practices and the stories voiced by artists. The analysis follows the storyline of the documentary Bataaxal and is divided into four parts. The first focuses on the feeling that is produced by the aesthetic elements of art and how this is relates to politics, by drawing on the work of Jacques Rancière (2003). The second subsequently focuses on the narrator’s memories, emotions, words, and phrases and how these are involved in the production of meaning. The third section then turns to a comparison between the broader thematic foci that are covered by the artists and their works. Conversely, the fourth section locates the role of place and time in the production of artistic practices. How these findings relate to existing academic work is then analysed in the discussion. Finally, the study concludes by reaffirming that artists are deeply rooted within “migration” discourses; however, the artists and their knowledge are intertwined with their milieu, as much as the created art is related to the construction of the phenomenon of “migration”. As a result, the transformative capacity of art is questionable, as the art may inadvertently reproduce dominant and problematic narratives that have been constructed by government policies and international organisations to frame people on the move as a problem.",

"James Bond and the Phenomenon of Gendered Language: How social norms, situational characteristics, and feminism influences the discourse of gendered language in sexually charged situations","Nieuwkoop, Michèle Alexandra van",['Dr.D. Smakman'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In sociolinguistic studies, researchers state that there is such a thing as gendered language. These studies looked at gendered language in discourse and came up with a list of stereotypical linguistic characteristics used by women and men. In other words, certain linguistic features such as emotional adjectives and tag-question are more feminine, whereas judgemental adjectives and directives are said to be more masculine. However, the findings are divided and do not always give a common consensus on the reason behind the phenomenon. The differences could stem from social norms, personal preferences, inherited schemata, or the social setting in which the discourse occurs. For example, specific situational settings could be more likely to induce gendered language than other settings. James Bond movies present settings that are potentially more likely to induce gendered language due to the sexually charged nature of the relationship between James Bond and his women. In these situational settings, men are more likely to behave like stereotypical men, and women are more likely to behave like stereotypical women. Therefore, this thesis will look at the specific sociolinguistic context of the potentially sexually charged relationship between James Bond and various female characters and investigate if the characters use stereotypical feminine versus masculine linguistic features and, therefore, contribute to the sociolinguistic corpus of gendered language and its origin. In addition, it looks at the change over time, taking into account the changing Western society in regard to social norms and gender roles. To summarize, this thesis will look at whether the language in discourse found in the movies reflect findings in previous studies, whether the use of linguistic features changes over time, and if the changes can explain the nature of gendered language. This thesis is divided into five chapters the introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and last but not least, the conclusion. In chapter one, the introduction will give a brief overview of the significant sociolinguistic theories present, their relation to gendered language, what research has been done regarding James Bond movies, and how this research contributes to current discussions of feminism. Chapter one also includes a literature review, which goes into depth about the aforementioned sociolinguistic studies. Last but not least, it will give an overview of the research question. Chapter two will discuss the methodology, how social and linguistic factors were chosen, and which difficulties were encountered. Chapter three displays the results found with the help of graphs and figures. Chapters four and five will discuss the findings, their relevance to the ongoing discussion of sociolinguistics and gendered language, and the study’s main takeaway.","['James Bond', 'Gendered Language', 'Feminism', 'Discourse', 'Social Norms']"

In deze scriptie is onderzocht of er nieuwe inzichten ten aanzien van het schilderij Sin Titulo (1970) van de Nikkei (Japans- Peruaanse) kunstenares Tilsa Tsuchiya (1928-1984) konden worden verkregen, door het te relateren aan de inheemse beeldtraditie in Peru, waaronder de precolumbiaanse verbeelding van mythen. Om deze vraag te beantwoorden, is onderzoek gedaan naar beeldtradities in de Peruaanse moderne kunst, zoals het Surrealisme, in combinatie met interdisciplinair literatuuronderzoek en interviews met Tilsa Tsuchiya. Precolumbiaanse kunst kent een rijk verleden en was geliefd onder schilders in de twintigste eeuw, hierdoor ontstond er een kunstbeweging genaamd Indigenisme. Tsuchiya heeft elementen uit de precolumbiaanse beschavingen gebruikt, die ze op een vernieuwende manier met elkaar heeft gecombineerd.

Other than simply functioning as a source of hunger gratification, food harbours an affective symbolism that is oftentimes left undervalued. From provoking nostalgia, evoking great happiness or sadness, to even possessing religious and spiritual meanings. The subject of food is also greatly translatable into varied cultural disciplines in its multi-faceted flexibility, from sociology to literature, as well as, being used as a metaphorical tool of cultural manifestations in artistic representations. Art and food share a distinct affability of being treated as a central zone of personal expression, and a mode of open communication. In their endless capacity of form differentiation, they can be moulded and transformed to fit an abundance of socio-cultural issues at a level of high familiarity that is widely reachable across many cultural planes. This thesis will explore the use of real food in three contemporary performance and installation artworks, which focus on using food as a universally recognisable instrument of non-verbal communication in order to open discussions on social issues such as, colonialism, climate change and political equality. By applying somaesthetic and affect theory methodologies to the chosen case studies, the aim of this thesis is to examine how food works in tandem with the senses to generate an intensified and extensive aesthetic experience.","['food, experience, somaesthetics, affect, sensorium']"

By utilising the Lviv-based digitalisation company Skeiron’s #SaveUkrainianHeritage as a case study, we investigate how these digital tools contribute to the conservation and dissemination of cultural memory in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian war (2022-). We employ a methodology based on interdisciplinary literature review and close analysis of primary and secondary texts, primarily building upon Jan and Aleida Assmann’s collective memory and Pierre Nora’s lieux de mémoire through a contemporary, digital-focused perspective. The digitalisation of cultural heritage objects is seen as a conservation strategy that ensures the retention of the memory value of heritage objects. The #SaveUkrainianHeritage project exemplifies how digital tools may effectively conserve and transmit cultural memory in the face of conflict, providing a platform for wider engagement and appreciation of cultural heritage.","['cultural memory, lieux de mémoire, Ukraine, 3D scanning, photogrammetry']"
The Translation of Racism in Literary Works: A Comparison Between Two Dutch Translations of To Kill a Mockingbird,"Kloe, Bridget de","['Zeven, K.L.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"After the Black Lives Matter movement started, racism has become strictly taboo in the United States. This increased political correctness has also spread to the Netherlands, whose government has only recently apologised for its contribution to slavery. As a result of this increased political correctness, taboo and offensive language has been a frequently studied topic in Translation Studies for the past few decades. While the translation of racial slurs has been studied frequently in subtitling, there has not been as much research into the translation of racist discourse in literary works. Moreover, publications that studied racism in literary translations have mostly focused on the translation of racial slurs or Black Vernacular, rather than analysing racist language in general. In this thesis, a comparative analysis is conducted in the form of a close reading of a selection of phrases that contain racist and racial discourse in To Kill a Mockingbird and its two Dutch translations. The first Dutch translation appeared in 1961 and the retranslation was published in 2010. The aim of this case study is to analyse how the translator of the Dutch retranslation was affected by changing social norms regarding racism in his translation choices. The results show that the 2010 retranslation generally contained fewer offensive terms compared to the first Dutch translation. While it is not always clear what motivated this translation strategy, the analysis shows that in some cases it is definitely the result of changing social norms regarding racism. It can therefore be argued that the 2010 retranslation is more politically correct than the 1961 translation. Furthermore, it can be concluded that while the retranslation hypothesis has been debunked, the 2010 translation does appear to be a more literal rendering of the source text than the 1961 translation.","['Racist discourse', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Literary Translation', 'Retranslation', 'Political Correctness', 'Changing Social Norms']"

Unveiling Qatar’s Hungry Strategies in the Corporate Food Regime Following the Blockade,"Salmon, Charlotte","['Henderson, C.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper explores the corporate food regime in Qatar. Existing discussions on food regimes have primarily focused on analysing corporations, the regime's neoliberal features and limitations. However, they have largely overlooked the influence of state-led capital, particularly in the Gulf, where it is gaining prominence. Qatar is developing as a prominent state actor in a multipolar global food system, challenging traditional Northern actors with considerable capital influence and supporting agribusiness acquisitions, new trade flows and innovation. This research argues that following the 2017 diplomatic crisis, the government strategically used the private sector to ensure food security in its arid country and reduce reliance on imports. These measures enabled Qatar to establish itself as a strong, innovative and legitimate state. This research aims to understand the changing relationship in the corporate food regime in light of state-led capitalism, agro-security mercantilism, and the role of agribusinesses. It analyses various dynamics, such as the Gulf region's geopolitical context, agribusiness political economy, and food consumption's social dimensions. It aims to shed light on how these factors shape the Qatari corporate food regime and its implications for food security.","['Qatar, corporate food regime, food security, state-led capital, agro-security mercantilism']"

L'obiettivo centrale di questa tesi è di esplorare come la letteratura ed il cinema italiano approcciano il tema dell’immigrazione. La domanda di ricerca è dunque la seguente: in che modo viene trattato il tema dell’immigrazione in generi letterari e cinematografici diversi? In particolare, verrà analizzato in che modo (e perché) le diverse modalità narrative e generi cinematografici e letterari degli ultimi anni (2015-2020) riescano ad approcciare questo tema. La scelta del genere narrativo, influisce sulla modalità di rappresentazione di personaggi e luoghi, ed influisce sullo spessore con cui il tema viene trattato? Inoltre, ha importanza se chi scrive abbia vissuto da vicino, o meno, il viaggio migratorio? Le opere vengono narrate da chi è partito dal proprio paese per emigrare in Italia, oppure da chi sia in Italia e “accoglie? Al fine di rispondere alla domanda di ricerca centrale, e le varie sotto domande nella tesi sono state analizzate tre opere diverse: il film comico Tolo Tolo (2020) diretto da Checco Zalone, il documentario Fuocoammare (2016) diretto da Gianfranco Rossi e il romanzo Adua (2015) scritto da Igiaba Scego.

De electorale ontwikkelingen van de jaren na de invoering van de Mammoetwet brengen KVP, ARP en CHU weer dichter naar elkaar toe. In dit onderzoek staan twee onlosmakelijke ontwikkelingen centraal. Ten eerste de positie en discussies over en van het bijzonder onderwijs in het Nederlandse onderwijsbestel vanaf de invoering van de Mammoetwet in 1963 tot aan de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 1977. Ten tweede de politieke ontwikkelingen binnen de confessionele partijen in de aanloop naar de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 1977, waarin KVP, ARP en CHU voor het eerst landelijk meedoen aan de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen met een gezamenlijke CDA-lijst. Deze met elkaar verbonden ontwikkelingen vormen de leidraad voor het onderzoek, waarbij de centrale vraag is: Hoe veranderde de visie op het bijzonder onderwijs van KVP, ARP en CHU op weg naar de vorming van het CDA in de periode 1963-1977? De onderzoeksvraag gaat dieper in op de ontstane tegenstrijdigheid van 1963. In 1963 zijn de drie partijen nog verdeeld over de invulling van de Mammoetwet, terwijl de drie partijen in de loop van de jaren 1970 steeds dichter naar elkaar toe trekken; met een gezamenlijk programma en lijst in 1977 tot gevolg.

Architectuur kan invloed hebben op de mens in de stad en hoe de mens zich hierin beweegt. Naast invloed kan architectuur ook een poging doen om autoriteit uit te stralen over de stad en zijn inwoners. In de kunststroming van het Modernisme zien we het bewustzijn van deze macht van architectuur terugkomen in architectonische werken en andere beeldende kunst. Modernisme is onder andere de stijl waarin de huidige Peak Tower is gebouwd. Deze is te zien in het werk van Cui Jie, wat centraal staat in dit essay. In dit essay wordt onderzoek gedaan naar de macht van architectuur door de geschiedenis te achterhalen van de afgebeelde Peak Tower in Hong Kong en de betekenis van de manier van weergaven in het werk van Cui Jie, waar culturele associaties zijn weggelaten. Dit onderzoek laat zien dat The Second Generation of Peak Tower een dubbele betekenis met zich meebrengt. Enerzijds verwijst de titel naar de Peak Tower wat het werk in een context plaatst, maar anderzijds is deze context niet terug te zien in het werk van Cui Jie omdat hier geen culturele associaties terug te vinden zijn. De Peak Tower wordt hiermee een neutraal object dat zich overal zou kunnen plaatsen.","['Cui Jie, Peak Tower, Modernisme, Internationalisme, Invloed van architectuur']"

Daarbij zijn drie deelvragen opgesteld die zich richten tot verschillende thema’s, coldcaseslachtoffers en de lengte van krantenartikelen. Aan de hand van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse zijn 59 krantenartikelen over zes cold cases geanalyseerd. De resultaten hiervan tonen aan dat drie verschillende informatiethema’s kunnen worden onderscheiden: Autoritaire en onderzoeksgerichte informatie, Persoonlijke achtergronden en informatie & Maatschappelijke betrokkenheid. Deze thema’s concurreren niet met elkaar, maar vullen elkaar aan. Aan de hand van deze thema’s is geconcludeerd dat de mate waarin een coldcaseslachtoffer de volledige en legitieme status van slachtoffer krijgt geen beslissende rol hoeft te spelen bij de wijze waarop over een zaak wordt geschreven. Het is niet zozeer het slachtoffer dat bepalend is: het zijn voornamelijk kenmerken van de zaak zoals de modus operandi. In hoeverre een coldcaseslachtoffer een status als ‘ideaal’ slachtoffer toegewezen krijgt, bepaalt dan ook niet zozeer hoe over hen wordt geschreven, maar eerder hoeveel.

By close reading a selection of stories that addresses both the issues of mobility and relocation and the subjective effects of migration, I study if and how the experience of migrating and living in the borderlands leads to the configuration of a border identity –that is, a decentered and multiple subjectivity– in a multilingual and intercultural context. Essentially, I argue that Berlin’s stories not only depict different individual experiences of migration and life at the borderlands, but also their impact on the protagonists’ sense of self. Furthermore, I contend that the borderlands are not just a physical place; they are also a state of in-betweenness where transformation of identity takes place and a new self emerges. Using postcolonial and feminist theories and drawing primarily on migration studies and identity studies, this thesis is theoretically inspired by Gloria Anzaldúa’s theory of the borderlands and, critically assessing some of its main concepts, seeks for additional meanings of what a borderland may be and what it is like to live there. In doing so, this thesis explores issues of culture shock, cultural and linguistic dislocation, belonging, and identity (trans)formation.","['migration, borderlands, identity, subjectivity, migrant women, Lucia Berlin']"

How does Afropessimism critique the effectiveness of the human rights framework in securing racial justice for individuals within the African diaspora? To examine the translatability of Afropessimism to a different cultural context other than that of the U.S., I researched whether this theoretical framework could also accurately explain the historical and contemporary experiences of Black individuals in Brazil. These questions aimed to evaluate the extent to which Afropessimism, departing from other racial theories, such as intersectionality, questions the efficacy of the human rights framework in transforming society and its social institutions, as a means of irrevocably achieving racial justice.","['Afropessimism', 'Black Diaspora', 'Human Rights', 'Racial Justice, Universality']"
The Harmonising Self-Image,"Hisschemoller, Jurriaan","['Chouraqui, F.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I will discuss what the self-image is and what it can tell us about the position of the self in intersubjective relations. I will do this by answering the question: What is the self-image? It is by its very definition, not an individualising image, which means it is a process that puts the self as being opposed to its surroundings but is a connecting and inherently harmonising mental process. It is inherently an image both of, and formed by, the horizon of the self. To explain this, I will use the understanding of a horizon given to us by Edmund Husserl. Even though this concept is found in a theory that gives us an individualising understanding of the self-image, it will show us that it is indeed not individualising but harmonising. By individualising I mean the affirmation of the identity of the self as a being moving through a space full of Others and objects alien to him. As such the self-experiences themselves as being opposed to them and in some cases clearly in a power struggle with the Other. Harmonising means that the world within the horizon appears as being inherently part of the identity of the self. As such it shows the self as not being surrounded by foreign things but by things that are already a part of it.","['Self-Image', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Phenomenology']"
Art: From Destiny to Desire,"Pagnes, Aisha R","['Siemens, H.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In 'The Man Without Content' (1994), an essay on aesthetics written by Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, the author asks wether works of the imagination will ever regain the existential power they once held. And if so, what conditions will enable this transformation in a way that accounts for the historic changes that shaped the face of art as we see it today. What is useful in Agamben’s essay, often wanting in the works of like-minded thinkers sharing a similar dissatisfaction with contemporary art, is the schematised overview he gives of the various internal scissions that befell the production and reception of art since the Renaissance. The former unity of the work of art has been lost, fragmenting into polarised coordinates of artist versus spectator, taste versus genius, form versus content. This disunity, Agamben maintains, finds its beginnings in the loss of tradition. We can no longer identify with the content of the work of art, for the content which made up traditional societies is no longer transmissible. As such, we are left with the free creative principle of the artist on the one hand, and the passive role of the spectator on the other. The work of art is no longer a shared space and has lost its original power. Agamben finds the solution to this impasse in an abstraction: the work of art is to transmit the 'untransmissibility' of tradition (content) and in so doing regains its 'poietic' power. Although Agamben touches upon fundamental issues that do help to make sense of our current artistic landscape, I argue that his diagnosis of modernity is too radical, that the implications for the work of art are untenable, and that the solution offered requires a price much too high to pay. Instead, we can take what is useful in Agamben’s essay and supplement it with a view that offers a more fruitful solution for re-imagining our relationship to the work of art and its value. This supplementation will come from Hamann’s Aesthetica in Nuce.","['Art, Aesthetics, German Idealism Aesthetics, Hans Georg Hamann, Giorgio Agamben, Hermeneutics of art']"

Problematising the China Threat Paradigm in Sino-Japanese relations: A post-structural analysis of Japanese foreign policy discourse vis-à-vis China in the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands territorial dispute,"Beckman Lapré, Suzanne",['L.O. Black'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The advent of Shinzō Abe and Xi Jinping in 2012 as respective leaders of Japan and China amidst a deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands launched a supposed new era in foreign policy that is typically characterised by ‘rivalry’ in much of the literature, thereby reinforcing the China Threat paradigm. Some examine Sino-Japanese relations through a material lens and focus on military strength or economic preponderance, whereas relational Constructivists centre on a Japanese ‘Self’ 'identity' in relation to 'Others'. However, these studies take subjects, discursive practices and meanings that are constitutive of foreign policy as a given and uncritically accepts these as true. This is problematic, because rather than questioning the status-quo, their ontological arguments reinforce it. A poststructural analysis on foreign policy discourse within ethical, temporal and spatial dimensions with due consideration for the margins of the political debate brings in an epistemological perspective.

Political Narratives In Cross-Strait Relations: A Multimodal Discourse Analysis Of Military Videos,"Koster, Mei-Lin","['Schneider, F.A.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research examines political narrative construction in Cross-Strait relations by analyzing Taiwanese and Chinese military videos on social media. Written amidst intensifying Cross-Strait tensions, this thesis seeks to understand how such moving images can contribute to shaping narratives, specifically the interplay between military displays and their online representation. Through a comprehensive application of Multimodal Discourse Analysis and Social Semiotic Analysis, this study qualitatively deconstructs these videos, paying close attention to how language, power, and ideology intertwine within the scope of international relations. The findings suggest that these videos create distinct yet intertwined narratives of national strength and military readiness. While China’s narrative underscores the ‘Chinese Dream’ and ‘national reunification’, Taiwan’s narrative leans more towards its unique identity, self-determination and democratic values. Hence, this thesis highlights the fundamental role of social media in influencing diplomatic perceptions. It also provides new insights by analyzing Taiwan's strategic self-promotion, enhancing our comprehension of the island’s role in international relations. Lastly, this research reveals the rising influence of military diplomacy in the Cross-Strait context, paving the way for future research in this direction.","['Politics, Cross-Strait, Taiwan Strait, China, Discourse, Multimodality']"

Stabilizing the domino: US economic support to Singapore during the Cold War,"van Ette, Martijn","['Wang, J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focusses on the relation between Singapore’s economic development and US geopolitical interests. Problematically, Singapore’s economic development has been predominantly analysed through an inward-centric and economically-oriented lens, which has prescribed a neglect of external geopolitical drivers. This thesis aims to fill this gap by researching Singapore’s post-war industrialization from an approach that considers external geopolitical influences as an important driver of economic development. In line with this approach, I focus on the relation between US geopolitical interests and Singapore’s post-war industrialization by building on the main theoretical insights from hegemonic stability theory and economic statecraft. Interestingly, the empirical findings of this thesis establish a substantive relation between US geopolitical interests, channelled through capital support to the city-state, and Singapore’s economic development. This is based on the empirical finding that Singapore received economic aid in the late-1960s when US geopolitical interests were threatened by suddenly emerging Singaporean instability. Accordingly, by having connected Singapore’s economic development to US Cold War interests, this thesis has complemented the contemporary state of the literature.","['United States', 'Singapore', 'dependent development', 'political economy', 'Cold War', 'economic statecraft']"

Understanding Russia’s ‘Predatory Power’ in Africa: The Case of Mali,"Singhvi, Simran",['Dr. W. Nkwi Gam'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Russia’s influence in Africa, particularly the Sahel, has been on the rise for the last two decades. On the one hand, it uses official tools of engagement including, diplomatic, economic, military, and political methods. And on the other hand, it uses unofficial tools to pursue its foreign policy objectives. This thesis focuses on the various ways in which Russia utilises its Private Military Companies as an unofficial tool, to gain maximum benefits. The theoretical framework of the ‘Racket of Predatory Power’ is used to elucidate the strategies employed by Russia through its PMCs. These strategies include leveraging historical elite ties, security partnerships to secure mining concessions, and conducting disinformation campaigns to gain elite favour. By using Mali as a case study, the thesis examines the key elements of the theoretical framework, including rent control, weakening accountability and legtimisation, to understand Russia’s use of PMCs as a foreign policy tool. The thesis concludes that Russia’s influence on African states is predatory, in the sense that it uses shadow actors like PMCs to repurpose state institutions and derive maximum benefits out of elite relationships.",
Climate policy and populism in France: The European Green Deal and the Gilets Jaunes,"Régibeau, Céline","['Scepanovic, V.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The European Green Deal has sparked my interest as the deal became increasingly present on the European political stage. As a French speaker, I remember the Gilets Jaunes movement that went against announced carbon taxes in 2018 very well. I wanted to know what the Gilets Jaunes, a movement previously against a national climate policy, thought of the European Green Deal. I realised that there was no research yet on that specific subject. I therefore decided to focus my thesis on this topic by posing the following research question “What do the Gilet Jaunes think about the European Green Deal?”. After a first attempt to understand the movement's stance on the EGD through social media, I interviewed three affiliates of the GJ and asked them about their opinions on the EGD. In general, the participants were very keen on the idea of a climate policy that would, for instance, make European cities less polluted. However, the participants did not agree with the current implementation of the EGD by the European Union. They find that the new EGD laws are difficult to apply for the commoners (i.e., not everyone can afford an electric car) and that there is too much disconnect between the population and the decision makers in Brussels.","['climate policy, gilets jaunes, yellow vests, EGD, European Green Deal']"

No peace without justice? The motivations of The Netherlands for hosting a special tribunal for the crime of aggression by Russia,"Sturm, Isabel",['Karen Smith'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The war between Russia and Ukraine that started in 2022 came as a shock to most of the world. While the war is still in progress, attempts to prosecute the aggressor have already been set in motion. The crime of aggression, which refers to Russia initiating the war, currently falls outside of the prosecuting options within international law. Therefore, the idea was created to set up an ad-hoc criminal tribunal to prosecute Russia’s high officials for starting the war. This thesis examines the factors that influenced the Dutch government’s offer to host a potential criminal tribunal to hold Russia accountable for the crime of aggression. Government documents, policy reports and literature on the interplay between international law and international relations were analysed and provided a basis for the semistructured interviews. The interviews with government officials and professors in international law and foreign policy show that there are multiple factors that influenced this offer. It was found there is a strong relationship between the history of the Netherlands and the foreign policy identity that exists today. The focus on accountability and the fight against impunity strongly influenced the Netherlands’ commitment to aiding the international community, by focussing on their specialty: hosting an international tribunal. The most important factor that could be identified which influenced the offer is the aspiration of the Netherlands to project a foreign policy identity that is linked to hosting international tribunals.","['Crime of Aggression', 'Russia', 'Dutch Government', 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs.']"
The Effect of Identity-Derived Value Competition on Foreign Policy: A Study of India's Act East Policy using the Value-Action Framework,"Vermariën, Charlotte","['Black, L.O.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In November 2014, India’s newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the “Act East Policy” (AEP), which aims to increase economic and strategic cooperation with Indo-Pacific countries and deepen cultural relationships. It does so on a regional, multilateral, and bilateral level. Although there is academic literature on this policy, most of the literature looks at the AEP through a realist lens, thereby considering it a mere “balancing” effort against China’s increasing influence in the region. This thesis opts to diversify the literature on the AEP by taking a constructivist approach. In doing so it seeks to understand how the ruling Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) conceptions of India’s state identity have shaped the AEP. Using the value-action framework and process-tracing method, this thesis finds that there are three identities which create values that shape the BJP’s preferences for the AEP. Firstly, the “challenged state” identity gives rise to the ‘increasing national security’ value. The second identity, a “once-thriving civilization”, gives rise to two closely connected values: ‘creating an economically stronger India’ and ‘ensuring India gets its rightful place in the comity of nations and international institutions’. Lastly, the “democracy shaped by Hinduism in a changing Asian landscape” identity gives rise to the ‘establishing a democratic and rules-based international order’ value. However, through assessment of India’s wider foreign policy behaviour this thesis finds that these values do not all carry equal weight. It argues that the pursuit of national security, prosperity and indirectly the pursuit of India’s “rightful place” on the international stage were the main factors leading to the establishment of the AEP. Thus, concluding that the “challenged” state and “once-thriving civilization” identities have more influence on the AEP under BJP rule than the “democracy shaped by Hinduism in a changing Asian landscape” identity.","['constructivism', 'India', 'identity', 'Act East Policy', 'process-tracing', 'value-action framework']"

Regulating the Business of Pleasure: Hybrid regulatory regimes and transboundary influence of payment intermediaries in governing online sex work,"Jager, Elizabeth de",['Crystal Ennis'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Online sex work is often cited as a way to liberate sex workers by giving sex workers more control. But does the movement to digital spaces and the formal financial sector simply trade of one form of dependency and vulnerability for another? This paper seeks to understand the specific mechanisms employed by financial actors to target sex work and the relationship between state and private actors in the development of exclusionary policies. Furthermore, in light of the global dominance of the American financial sector, this paper examines the transboundary influence of US corporate financial regulation through its impact on sex workers outside the United States. The influence of government pressure on the corporate policies is examined through the policies of three financial service providers (Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal) in the context of two state policy changes: the Obama Administration’s Operation Choke Point and the 2018 FOSTA/SESTA law. The international influence of these policies is explored through the experiences of Pornhub performers operating outside of the United States following the 2019/2020 suspension of services to the platform by PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard. This paper identifies two mechanisms employed by financial service providers which result in the exclusion of online sex workers: 1) direct prohibition of adult-related industries and 2) indirect exclusion through the incentive structure created to by financial service providers to monitor and regulate merchants which disincentivizes businesses to work with merchants involved in adult-related industries. This paper also finds that the dominance enjoyed by the US in the global financial system and its subsequent influence in foreign markets creates a system through which the problematic and exclusionary policies of US-based corporations are exported to countries regardless of their own legal frameworks governing sex work.",

Guided by Actor-Network Theory’s translation process, this thesis builds on ethnographically grounded and comparative research on disinformation producers in the Philippines as it looks at the two most recent presidential elections in 2016 and 2022. Drawing from netnographic observations across social media platforms Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Twitter, as well as published media interviews, I propose that disinformation networks under Rodrigo Duterte and Bongbong Marcos proved deeply complex, hierarchic and exploitative. The empirical material illustrates how different actors came together under one voice, mobilising a network of entities to promote each presidential candidate’s election. By making visible the organisational relations and labour arrangments underpinning political disinformation campaigns, as well as the mechanisms of control exercised over them, the following paper aims to deepen an understanding of these harmful networks in order to prevent their future occurrence.","['disinformation', 'Philippines', 'actor-network theory']"

Sharing is Caring: Intercultural Health Systems and Women’s Participation in Global Health Policy,"Ginap, Caroline","[""O'Malley, Dr. A.M.""]",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"There is a general consensus in the academic and non-academic sphere that women should participate in health systems strengthening. Yet, implementable models that can facilitate this remain absent. Amidst attempts to open up International Relations (IR), intercultural health systems present compelling cases to examine what could impact women’s agency in health policymaking. This contrasts with approaches centered on theoretical human rights rhetoric. This thesis analyzes how the Holistic Care Model, developed by the dr. Denis Mukwege- and Panzi Foundation, impacts women’s participation in global health policymaking. An exploratory qualitative primary source analysis was conducted with postcolonial theory. The findings show that through developmental innovation and knowledge facilitation, the Holistic Care Model enhances the agency of women treated by it. The creation of agency has a multiplying effect: women actively tailor the model according to their health needs, which in turn makes them participants of the health system’s development. The evidence also highlights health systems’ relevance for postcolonial debates on international health governance. Though the research only analyzed one case, the findings provided an in-depth understanding of how a healthcare model can implement what theoretical formulations lack to execute. This makes the present singular case relevant for future innovations and shows that knowledge concerning health from the global South should be examined increasingly in IR and Women, Peace, and Security studies.","['global health governance', 'health systems', 'gender', 'agency', 'policymaking', 'post- colonialism']"
Musicians for Peace: How Israeli-Palestinian Music Coproducers Aim to Contribute to Conflict Transformation,"Pontecorvo, Guido","['Schonmann, N.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the aims of Israeli-Palestinian musical coproducers while contributing to conflict transformation. Inspired by the growing number of collaborative and multicultural artistic initiatives in conflict contexts, this thesis will seek to establish starting empirical evidence of musicians' intentions in disputes. Through the conceptual lens of conflict transformation, it will focus on the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, using the first account of the Dugri Duo to investigate the musicians’ aims. These aims’ plausibility will be checked by analysing if they resonate with other musical coproducers’ work. It conducts an exploratory study aiming to examine the claims made by the theoretical literature and possibly provide fresh insights. The research will start with three hypotheses drawn from the literature: musicians aim to challenge conflictual narratives, leverage trauma, and inspire to educate their audience. By engaging in an interview and a qualitative content analysis of the most relevant musical coproducers in Israel-Palestine, the thesis will investigate the plausibility of these hypotheses, leaving spaces for new revelations.","['Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Coproduced Music, Conflict Transformation, Music in Conflict']"

The research question explores the differences and similarities between the two ceremonies to shed light on China's changing position in the global system and its approach to projecting soft power. The analysis employs semiotic analysis and explores themes such as the past-future dichotomy and the appeal to norms and values.The study finds that the 2008 ceremony was part of China's ""Olympic coming-out party"" and focused on establishing the country as a rising power on the international stage. It emphasized China's development, heritage, and cultural identity, primarily for viewers unfamiliar with the country. In contrast, the 2022 ceremony demonstrated China's response to foreign criticisms and aimed to align itself with Western-centric norms and values. It showcased China's commitment to the international community and inclusivity by incorporating non-ethnically Chinese elements into the ceremony. The findings suggest that China's evolving soft power strategies align with its changing role in the global order. China's rise to a dominant player in the international system allows it to express its vision for the future and create a nation brand that portrays itself as modern, outward-looking, inclusive, and peace-promoting. However, China's exclusive nationalism and the Western-centric Olympic values of harmony and unity create a tension that challenges the believability of its nation branding attempts.","['Olympic Games', 'International Relations', 'Soft Power', 'Public Diplomacy', 'China', 'Visual Diplomacy']"
Ideological motivations or pragmatic interests? Toward a better understanding of the motivations of Russia-friendly populist radical right parties in Europe,"Oldenburger, Anke",['Dr. J.

These linkages were brought to the fore following the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which demonstrated the necessity of mitigating the long-term risks posed by these linkages. No conclusive answer to the question of parties’ motivations can be given, as parties are driven by a combination of ideological and pragmatic motivations. In the first case study about the Dutch Party for Freedom, pragmatism prevailed; in the second case study about the Dutch Forum for Democracy, ideology dominated; and in the third, on the Belgian Flemish Interest, evidence pointed to pragmatism, but the evidence was weak as the party appeared mostly neutral. A policy recommendation is given to invest in strengthening democratic values to mitigate the long-term risks of the linkages between European PRR parties and Russia.","['Russia, populist radical right, motivations, ideology, pragmatism']"

From Pawn to Player: An Analysis of Weak States’ Sovereignty in Foreign Policy Decisions,"O Flynn, Emily",['Soledad Valdivia-Rivera'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Weak states are traditionally portrayed as ‘objects’ rather than ‘subjects’ in international politics. This would suggest that, although they are sovereign in nature, their ability to practise their sovereignty is restricted by their inherent weaknesses. Using Honduras as a case study, I seek to challenge this narrative by exploring if and how weak states can exercise agency in the international system - regardless of their size and strength. I argue that Honduras is strategically altering its foreign policy position vis-à-vis the One-China policy as an expression of sovereignty to achieve maximum economic and political gains for the weak state. In doing so, I simultaneously highlight the complex nature of sovereignty in the increasingly interconnected global environment. Questioning the traditional understanding of sovereignty as being absolute and indivisible is intended to open up potential avenues for weak states to be recognised as players – rather than pawns - on the international stage.",

Specifically, I analyse William Faulkner’s Light in August, John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, and Sinclair Lewis’s It Can’t Happen Here. The former two novels do not explicitly engage with fascism, but aspects of the texts were linked to fascism by their authors. Faulkner retroactively referred to the character Percy Grimm from his book as a fascist, and Steinbeck linked the agriculture sector in California, which features heavily in his novel, to fascism. Lewis engages with fascism directly in It Can’t Happen Here as he envisions a fascist dictatorship in the United States. These texts are relevant today as fascism is not a concept of the past. They can be used to discuss visions of fascism in 1930s American Literature and what fascism may look like in the United States. I use a combination of close reading and the theory provided by Robert O. Paxton in The Anatomy of Fascism, as well as additional sources for necessary historical context to analyse each of the novels. I will argue that while only one of the novels explicitly engages with fascism, all three texts portray fascism to some extent and can be used to identify possible bases of fascist action.","['Fascism', 'American Literature', '1930s', 'Paxton', 'Faulkner', 'Steinbeck', 'Lewis']"

It therefore presents Adorno’s philosophy of negative dialectics and his theory of constellation in order to look at their interconnection and refutes the arguments for the beforementioned allegation. The thesis claims that Adorno’s constellation is not aesthetically, but philosophically motivated, more specifically ethically, because Adorno’s philosophy in its entirety is an ethically motivated theory of concepts. It further claims, that his constellation is grounded in the old philosophical tradition of performativity and the young tradition of performative writing; and that his philosophy as a whole, as a ethically motivated theory of concepts, as well the ethical motivation of the performativity of his writing, is grounded in what Brandom calls Kant’s ‘normative turn’.","['Theodor W.

AD 412-485) and the pseudonymous ‘Dionysius the Areopagite’ (fl. c. AD 485-528). I propose that the systematic coherence of either of these philosophers depends upon a logic originating in and dependent upon a theological grammar revealed by a First Principle beyond Being. This is accomplished by first establishing the Parmenidean identification of logic and Being with its various implications as necessitating a First Principle beyond Being. From this foundation, I reconstruct Proclus’ and Dionysius’ deductive account of the declension of Being from this Principle. I show that in both cases an aporia arises with respect to reconciling the absolute unity of the One and the multiplicity of Being. This, I argue, can only be resolved through recognizing the common revelatory source of logic and a theological grammar that permits speech about a multiplicity beyond Being. In doing this, I outline the differing forms this takes for the Hellenic Pagan Proclus and the Christian Dionysius as well as the implications that this bears for the relation between philosophical reason, revelation, and theurgic activity.","['Proclus', 'Dionysius the Areopagite (Pseudo-Dionysius)', 'Neoplatonism', 'metaphysics', 'Platonic logic', 'classical theology', 'Henadology', 'Trinitarian Ontology']"

Lucian on Cultural Interaction: A Migrant's Perspective on Migration and Acculturation in the Roman Empire,"Bakker, Marianne","['Jonge, C.C. de']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The Roman Empire of the first and second centuries AD was a multinational society that was characterized by migration and mobility. In this multicultural society, people of many different ethnical and cultural backgrounds had to find a way to live together and deal with cultural differences. One of these people was the satirist Lucian of Samosata (ca. AD 125-180). Although this Hellenized author lived in and travelled through the Roman Empire, he was Syrian by birth and had enjoyed Greek education. Therefore, he could be considered a migrant author who moved in-between multiple identities. Lucian’s status as a foreigner and migrant appears to have influenced his writings. He frequently stages foreigners who try to find the best way to relate themselves to other cultures and deal with the negative sentiments of host cultures. In this thesis, I argue that Lucian in his works provides different perspectives on such challenges of travelling and migration. Approaching Lucian’s 'Assembly of the Gods', 'On Hired Companions', 'Scythian', and 'Anacharsis' as migrant literature, I use the acculturation theory of Berry (1992; 1997) to analyse how Lucian in these works reflects on cultural interaction in the Roman Empire of his own time. In the first chapter, I argue that Lucian’s 'Assembly of the Gods' can be read as a parody of Roman criticism of (Greek) foreigners, and I discuss how Lucian uses this parody to plea for cultural tolerance and prevent cultural segregation. In the second chapter, I argue that Lucian in his 'On Hired Companions' uses two different perspectives on the interaction between Greeks and Romans to advocate for cultural separation and to discourage Greek attempts to integrate into Roman households. In the last chapter, I argue that Lucian in his 'Scythian' and 'Anacharsis' provides three different examples of acculturation and presents his own autonomous integration as the most desirable acculturation strategy. In this chapter, I also explain how Lucian’s various perspectives on integration and separation can be reconciled, arguing that the four works together guide both foreigners and host cultures in the creation of a culturally tolerant society.","['Lucian of Samosata', 'cultural interaction', 'migration', 'acculturation', 'Deorum Concilium', 'De Mercede Conductis', 'Scytha', 'Anacharsis']"

Promoting Extractivism as Sustainable Development? An Analysis of Morocco’s Renewable Energy Strategy,"Roekens, Olivier","['Henderson, C.J.V.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The importance of renewable energy (RE) in the global economy is increasing. This provides great economic opportunities for developing countries with a high RE potential, but simultaneously risks exposing these countries to an unjust energy transition as a consequence of energy production. Therefore, this thesis investigates the political-economic implications of RE on extractivism, to better understand the potential costs and benefits of RE developments for developing countries. Hence, the research question is; In what ways does Morocco’s renewable energy strategy reinforce patterns of extractivism, and how does energy extractivism reproduce existing power dynamics? This is examined through a within-case study analysis of Morocco’s renewable energy strategy by developing a framework of energy extractivism. It finds that Morocco’s energy strategy reinforces patterns of extractivism at two different junctions; Firstly, the international/national level that is formed by an underlying interdependence of (financial) resources and energy that sustain neo-colonial dynamics. Secondly, the national/local level that promotes extractivism as development in peripheral zones by transferring socio-environmental costs to local communities. Energy extractivism reproduces power dynamics through these junctions as it reasserts the influence of the elite on development and maintains social hierarchies at the local and national levels. However, a similar process is not (yet) present at the international level although some patterns of extractivism are. The study is relevant to broader literature on extractivism and RE development since it addresses the roles of both national RE strategies and international structures on energy appropriation. It is critical to assess these potential risks and opportunities early in the energy transition in developing countries before any adverse extractivist effects occur.","['Extractivism', 'Energy Strategy', 'Renewable Energy', 'Sustainable Development', 'Morocco']"
An International Issue with Domestic Responses: A Comparative Study of Norwegian and Swedish Judicial Approaches to the Return of the Women of ISIS,"Malmborg Sørby, Julia Linnea","['Regilme, S.S.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"After a brutal war, ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) lost its significant territorial areas. How to deal with the organization’s members returning back to their home countries, has been subject to heated debate. By focusing specifically on the role of the organization’s female members this paper explores the differences in the judicial approaches to the returning ISIS-women, through a case study analysis of Norway and Sweden. By discussing the differences in the expansion of national terror legislation, its implementation in relation to the women of ISIS, and the possible contributing factors to the different approaches, this paper answers the following research question: how do Norway and Sweden differ in their judicial approach to the Norwegian and Swedish women of ISIS returning back home between 2012-2022? Moreover, what are the main contributing factors leading to the differences in the approaches? The paper argues that Norway is more punitive towards returning women than Sweden. This is due to Norway’s legislation on terrorism participation, which allows for prosecution without classifying which actions count as participation. Furthermore, the paper argues that this differs from Sweden’s legislation on participation, which requires evidence of grave terrorist crimes committed in order to prosecute. This, the paper demonstrates, results in Sweden lacking the legal framework to prosecute its female nationals returning from ISIS. Lastly, the paper explores possible factors contributing to the different judicial approaches and highlights the Swedish legislative council, the effect of recent terrorist attacks, and loud critics as the most significant. Through the use of the case study, this paper contributes to knowledge on the implications domestic judicial differences can have in combatting transnational threats like terrorism.","['ISIS', 'Female Terrorism', 'Legislation', 'Prosecution', 'Agency', 'Participation', 'Critical Terrorism Studies']"
Populism in the European Union: The differences and similarities between left-wing and right-wing populist parties’ Euroscepticism in the Netherlands,"Wijk, Thirza van",['M.

As the growing support for populist parties within Europe could have negative consequences for the future of the EU, this thesis is concerned with the Eurosceptic behaviour of populist parties in one member state of the EU, namely the Netherlands. This thesis conducts an analysis of the discourse and voting behaviour of a Dutch left-wing populist party, the Socialist Party, and right-wing populist party, the Party for Freedom, regarding the European Union in order to find out to what extent populist parties with different ideological persuasions share a Eurosceptic stance due to their shared populism. As a result, the research question of this thesis is: In what ways do populist left-wing and populist right-wing parties’ discourse and voting behaviour on the issue of the EU differ in the Netherlands? Based on the analysis of the chosen sources, which include party manifestos, parliamentary debates and votes in the Dutch House of Representatives, the final results of this analysis reveal that the left-wing SP and right-wing PVV do have some similar stances on the EU due to their populist background, but predominantly have different motivations for their Eurosceptic stance due to their ideological persuasions. Therefore, this thesis concludes that we cannot speak of a unified populist Eurosceptic narrative.","['Euroscepticism', 'European Union', 'Populism', 'the Netherlands']"

When Nature and Culture Collide: Exhibiting Java Man in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center,"Schaffels, Max Mathijs","['Cosmo, L.K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Dubois Collection, currently patrimony of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden (the Netherlands), is a contested assemblage of fossils and personal archival material pertaining to the Dutch palaeontology and paleoanthropologist Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois (1858 – 1940). Most notably, the collection contains a skullcap and femurs belonging to the ancient hominid ancestor Homo Erectus. These finds were dubbed ‘Java Man’ and constitute the earliest physical evidence that the human lineage has been subject to evolution according to Darwinian principles of selection and adaptation. While these have always been a subject of great interest to the scientific community, the historicity of the Collection and particularly the contested status of these fossils have attracted much less academic interest over the last 12 decades. This changed when a formal request by the government of Indonesia for restitution of the Dubois Collection was filed with the Dutch government in October 2022. A state commission is now deliberating on the rightful place of residence for the Dubois Collection. Because there is a possibility that the Java Man fossils may remain with their current stewards at Naturalis in Leiden, it is worthwhile to examine their exhibition history and investigate how the current permanent exhibition seeks to educate the public about the historical context in which these fossils were acquired. This text questions whether the permanent exhibition on Dubois and Java Man in Naturalis Biodiversity Center reflects a commitment to researching and informing the public about the historical context in which the Dubois Collection was acquired. It describes the exhibition history of the Dubois Collection and particularly the Java Man fossils and critically examines the narrative that has been presented in these exhibitions. Particularly, this text argues that the perceived differences between natural history and material culture collections are instrumental in explaining why the current permanent exhibition falls short of educating the public about the historical context in which the Java Man fossils were acquired. It also elaborates on the public statements made by museum staff to further contextualise the possible motivations for making certain design choices in this exhibition.","['Eugène Dubois', 'Java Man', 'Naturalis Biodiversity Center', 'Dutch East Indies', 'Trinil', 'critical heritage studies', 'natural history', 'material culture', 'colonial history', 'politics of natural history']"

Breaking the Chains of Dependency: Investigating the Political Economy of Economic Diversification in Algeria,"Bakker, Rob","['Englert, S.P.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Scholars ever more agree that economic diversification is becoming a vital strategy to ensure future stability in fossil fuel-export dependent states. This is the reason why, in recent years, grandiose development plans and modest efforts to achieve economic diversification have been initiated by some MENA states, particularly by those in the GCC. In Algeria, neither plans nor serious efforts are undertaken by the country’s ruling elites towards achieving this goal. Traditional rentier state literature cannot explain these visible differences in approaches between rentier states. Therefore, by studying contemporary Algerian history, this paper argues that the unwillingness of Algerian elites to diversify the Algerian economy is a result of an interplay between the nature of domestic institutions, international interference and oil. This case-specific approach enables a more accurate explanation for Algeria’s persistent political economic development. Moreover, by connecting rentier state theory with insights from postcolonial studies, and statist and critical political economy, this paper also appeals to the growing demand for an internationalised conception of the rentier state.","['Algeria', 'Economic Diversification', 'Oil and Gas', 'Political Economy', 'Rentier State']"

After unpacking the events, actors and factors that have shaped this relationship over the years, this thesis will argue that the relationship between the two parties is closer and more interlocking than what is generally depicted, with the state having substantial influence over Aramco’s operations and governance. The findings provide insights into the changes and continuity of the investigated relationship, as well as contribute to an in-depth understanding of the governance dynamics and implications to the larger Saudi Arabian landscape.

Packs and Lone Wolves: Explaining the Changes in Terrorism Beyond Tautological Reasoning,"Radeck, Mats","['Maat, E. van der']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Tangible explanations for structural changes in terrorism over time are missing. Furthermore, attempting to explain such changes as ideological is problematic in that it reinforces a tautology, considering that terrorism itself is often conceptualised as inherently ideological. Problematising the notion of ideology in the definition of terrorism and the typology of changes in terrorism, therefore, offers an exit from such continuous circular reasoning that focuses on ideology. A tangible change in terrorism is that from pack terrorism, i.e. group terrorism, to lone wolf terrorism. Three rival explanations potentially account for this change. An ideological explanation that focuses on the capability of ideology to spark violence, as well as a contextual explanation that argues that changes in the living environments of perpetrators lead to changes in the characteristics of terrorism, cannot stand firm when taken to the test. Meanwhile, a processual explanation according to which terrorist and counterterrorist forces continuously exploit the other side’s disadvantage does. Ultimately, changes in terrorism can be conceptualised using the analogy of a cat-and-mouse game in which learning and adaptation processes on the side of terrorists and counterterrorist forces likewise cause terrorism to change structurally.","['terrorism', 'lone wolf', 'changes', 'cat-and-mouse game', 'terrorism waves']"

As a result, individuals within this diaspora have developed a transnational Black consciousness, wherein they confront their identity while grappling with the pressure to conform to Eurocentric norms regardless of territory. This complexity is further heightened by the experience of hybridity, as diaspora members navigate the challenges of adapting to new environments while striving to maintain their ancestral roots. The trauma endured by the diaspora has served as a wellspring of inspiration for expressing their narratives through various cultural mediums, including theatre, music, literature, and visual arts. The objective of this research is to shed light on the deep importance of visual art as a medium through which the African diaspora can express their experiences, question dominant narratives, and assert their autonomy, both within their local contexts and on a global scale. By examining the artworks of Rosana Paulino from Brazil and Arnaldo Roche Rabell from Puerto Rico through the lenses of postcolonialism and semiology, we can delve into the intricate dynamics of power, identity, and resilience that arise from the creative expressions of the African diaspora.","['Double consciousness', 'shared identity', 'transnationalism', 'African diaspora', 'Afro-diasporic art', 'semiology']"

Aansluiting of Uitsluiting: Een onderzoek naar de ervaringen van jonge journalisten van kleur rond diversiteit en inclusiviteit op hun redacties,"van Benthem, David Chi-An","['Pleijter, A.R.J.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie is onderzoek gedaan naar hoe jonge Nederlandse journalisten van kleur diversiteit en inclusiviteit ervaren op de redacties waar ze werken. Beide thema’s krijgen in het medialandschap de afgelopen jaren geregeld aandacht, maar toch slagen veel redacties er niet in om hun berichtgeving en personeelsbestand representatief in te richten in overeenstemming met hun doelgroep. In deze context is het nog niet eerder voorgekomen dat specifiek jonge journalisten, van 35 jaar of jonger, aan het woord komen bij dit onderwerp. Deze groep journalisten van kleur heeft een kwetsbare positie, aangezien ze over het algemeen nog weinig werkervaring hebben opgedaan in het medialandschap. Dat neemt niet weg dat juist deze groep over een unieke vorm van kennis beschikt die een wezenlijke toevoeging kan zijn aan de oplossing om het Nederlandse medialandschap succesvol te diversifiëren en inclusief te maken. Door juist met de mensen in gesprek te gaan die vaker worden uitgesloten en overgeslagen of zich vaker moeten aanpassen, kan in beeld worden gebracht op welke manier redacties terreinwinst kunnen boeken. Door twaalf semigestructureerde diepte-interviews met jonge Nederlandse journalisten van kleur af te leggen, is laten zien hoe deze journalisten kijken naar de diversiteit en inclusiviteit op hun redacties. Deze ervaringen lopen sterk uiteen en zijn in vijf categorieën ondergebracht. Elke categorie wordt besproken aan de hand van verschillende ervaringen. Door te laten zien waar het bij de negatieve ervaringen tekortschiet, kan worden blootgelegd hoe machtsverhoudingen bij deze tekortkomingen een cruciale rol spelen. Dominante redactieculturen kunnen er op deze manier voor zorgen dat een deel van de geïnterviewden zich uitgesloten voelt en zich genoodzaakt ziet om zich continu aan te passen. Dat is op zijn minst zorgwekkend te noemen en daarom is er actie nodig.","['Diversiteit', 'Inclusiviteit', 'Journalistiek', 'Bourdieu']"

Subjugating Sympathy: The Rhetoric of Sympathy and Compassion in French Atlantic Pro-Slavery Discourse (1640-1789),"Gaffey, John","['Dr. Felicia Rosu, Dr. William Clement']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"John Gaffey’s intellectual history of emotions across the French trans-Atlantic slave trade suggests a connection between the emotional rhetoric of socially-directed emotions and the legitimisation of slavery in the thoughts of pro-slavery writers. Despite historians’ belief that apologists of slavery were unconcerned with the ethics of their actions, this thesis argues that slavery’s apologists throughout the seventeenth- and eighteenth-centuries acknowledged the need to demonstrate that they stood on the side of humanity. To these ends, they relied on the emotional rhetoric of sympathy and compassion to frame the master-slave relationship as one of hierarchical, condescending pity. This work has drawn on a broad selection of authors from varied geographic, temporal and personal backgrounds, including missionary accounts, merchant manuals, political pamphlets and intellectual treatises. These demonstrate that authors used sympathy and compassion to argue that slavery was a benevolent practice for the enslaved and that French colonisers were particularly equipped to be compassionate masters. However, these authors were never straightforward in their commitment to benevolence. Their writing could turn to limit the perceived need to sympathise with the enslaved. In this way, sympathy and compassion were not universal emotions spread equally towards all people. Far from uncovering a tale of compassionate masters and dependent slaves, this thesis exposes the emotional manipulation and self-interest embedded within the writings of slavery’s apologists. It adds to the growing historical knowledge which demonstrates that sympathy and compassion could open the gap between social groups as much as they could close it. Emotions proved to be a powerful tool for pretexts to violence.","['Slavery, French-Atlantic, Emotions History, Sympathy, Compassion']"

Establishing a New Framework for Assessing Contemporary Forms of Covert and Semi-Covert State Interventions in Foreign Information Spaces,"Zinke, Aramis",['Lukas Milevski'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to address the academic debate surrounding the intervention of state actors in foreign information spaces, as this discourse lacks a coherent framework, allowing researchers to identify, compare, categorize and hence explain acts of Information Intervention (II). To initiate a solution for this problem, this thesis aimed to create a typology of common contemporary types of covert and semi-covert state IIs beyond the means subsumed by the soft power and public diplomacy concepts. This process was facilitated by Kluge’s (2000) framework for the empirically grounded construction of types and an empirical research process, which was based on the identification of sources by employing keyword configurations and the search engines Google/Google Scholar. Given the scope of this project and the public unavailability of certain II practices, it was not possible to cover all acts of II for the given typology. Rather, the goal of this thesis was to guide future research in the field of Information Interventions, by providing a notion of the dynamics in the given field, on which future research can be built on. Therefore, while the typology presented in this thesis cannot be determined as universal, it made the first step towards the establishment of such framework, allowing researchers to systematically analyze IIs.","['Information Warfare', 'Hybrid Warfare', 'Influence Operations', 'Information Operations', 'Disinformation', 'Propaganda', 'Typology']"

The research specifically focuses on whether public statements made by Azerbaijani and Chinese politicians – asserting that the BRI has promoted Azerbaijan's economic growth – align with economic realities. This is examined through four facets: the BRI’s role in Azerbaijan's emergence as a transit hub, economic diversification, overall economic growth, and Sino-Azerbaijani cooperation beyond the transport sector. The results seem to suggest an association between BRI partnership and positive economic changes, such as economic diversification and GDP growth. However, the assertion that the BRI is the sole driver of these changes is premature, considering other influencing factors and the recent establishment of the BRI. Therefore, while political rhetoric may not entirely match the economic reality, the findings suggest potential for future bilateral benefits and economic growth. A need for further long-term research is needed to solidify any of the conclusions.","['Azerbaijan', 'China', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'BRI', 'Economic Growth and Development in Azerbaijan', 'Diversification of the Azerbaijani Economy', 'Azerbaijan as an International Transport Hub', 'Sino-Azerbaijani Relations', 'Post-Soviet Economy']"

Exploring the Aura of NFTs: The Transformation of Physical Street Art into Digital Tokens,"Happle, Kyra","['Wild, K. de']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the NFT artwork TRIP to explore the transmission of its aura from physical to digital art, with a focus on the role and value of NFT art in this transformative process. Inspired by Walter Benjamin's concept of aura, the research investigates how TRIP's remediation from a location-specific graffiti to an NFT artwork deepens our understanding of aura in the digital age. Through a comprehensive analysis, it becomes evident that TRIP exhibits a unique, fluid aura that transcends traditional categorizations, existing in a state that fluidly moves between the physical and digital realms. The artwork's transformative journey, involving AI-generated imagery, a site-specific mural, and its manifestation as an NFT, contributes to its evolving aura. The research highlights the amplification of TRIP's aura through its physical presence, location specificity, and integration into the digital realm. TRIP exemplifies a shifting aura, challenging fixed categorizations and highlighting the dynamic nature of aura in the contemporary art landscape.","['Aura', 'Digital Art', 'NFT', 'Transformative', 'Remediation']"
"The development of lateral obstruents in Nguni languages (S40, Southern Bantu) A diachronic study","Vlugt, Nina van der","['Gunnink, H.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This study investigates the development of the following lateral fricatives and affricates (obstruents) in Nguni (S40) languages, spoken in Southern Africa. These lateral obstruents (/ɬ, ⁿɬ, ɮ, ⁿɮ, k͡ʟ ̝̊/) are rare in the Bantu language family, but occur in three subbranches of Southern Bantu: Sotho Tswana, Nguni, and Tsonga. Given the rarity of these sounds, in Bantu and crosslinguistically, the question arises how Southern Bantu languages have incorporated lateral obstruents in their phonologies, as they are not reconstructed for Proto Bantu. To answer this question, I analyze secondary data from 10 Nguni languages to study which lateral obstruents are used and how, leading to the conclusion that both inheritance and contact played a role in the development of lateral obstruents in Nguni languages. The data shows that alveolar lateral obstruents can be reconstructed to Proto Nguni and derive from a regular sound change from Proto Bantu palatals /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/. The velar lateral affricate finds its origin in loan words. I evaluate existing theories that proposed several contact scenarios, which at this point are not plausible explanations for the development of Nguni lateral obstruents. The findings from this study make several contributions to the field. It is the only empirical study to date to collect and reinterpret data from a large number of secondary sources, leading to a better understanding of not only the distribution of lateral obstruents in Nguni languages, but also the hypothesized ancestor of these related languages, Proto Nguni. Further, this thesis lays the groundwork for future research into lateral obstruents in Southern Bantu. If we expand our focus from Nguni to the other subclades that feature lateral obstruents, we can combine that knowledge of lateral obstruents in Southern Bantu with other innovations and patterns to gain insight into the diversification of Southern Bantu languages and understand how the subgroups relate to each other","['Historical linguistics, Bantu languages, Nguni languages, S40']"

Embroidering the Present through the Past: Constructing ‘Belarusian-ness’ through Digital- Folk Storytelling,"Navumchyk, Anna","['Crucq, A.K.C']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Several Belarusian artists began including re-appropriated folkloric imagery and art-making techniques in response to anti-dictatorial protests, which erupted in Belarus on May 24th, 2020 following the rigged elections. Rufina Bazlova was one such artist, who documented the protest events in The History of the Belarusian Vyzhyvanka (2020-2021). This digitally-native artwork was mechanically embroidered to mimic traditional Belarusian cross-stitch embroidery on linen shirts- vyshyvankas. Using Bazlova as a case study, this paper examines how, and to what extent, the interweaving of digital and folk-storytelling in contemporary Belarusian art contributes to the representation of a post-2020 Belarusian identity, perpetuated across mass- media since 2020. In exploring this investigation through Peircean semiotics and anthropological methodologies, this thesis shows: how folkloric imagery and material heritage contribute to a distinctly Belarusian identity through their indexical and symbolic meaning, which also gives them anti-colonial agency; and how their contemporary re-contextualisation within the digital creates a historical continuity between former oppositional identities and a uniquely digital, post-2020 identity. In doing so, this research targets a common misconception of a lacking Belarusian culture and identity.","['Belarus', 'folklore', 'embroidery', 'digital-art', 'identity']"
REAPPROACHING TIME: ON FRAMING BALINESE ARCHITECTURE AND CULTURAL HISTORY,"Lynette, Kayla",['Ksenia Fedorova'],2023,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper centers the concept of time and its significance in understanding culture, with a specific focus on Balinese architecture. Here, time is explored through its evolving definition within the Western architecture history where it is persistently conceived as an anthropogenic progress measurement also arguing its homogeneity. The concept of modernity is a common rhetoric in architectural time perception, where it places cultures on comparative ends in determining which has caught up to the modernist trend and which is left to be eternally-traditional. Firstly the paper explores a past colonial exhibition as an exemplifier of a linear time perception in the sense that Western architecture discourse has created a hegemonic interpretive methodology in representing non-Western cultures. The paper aims to decenter the frequently used linear time model and introduce alternative time structures using Balinese theories on time, and time perception within architecture. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive look at the complexity of Balinese temporal values through architecture and tradition.","['temporality, architecture, history, modernity, postcolonial']"

An initial response might be to ban the technology, such that the students have to write every word themselves again. However, one can also take one step back and question what it means that the work a student is expected to do is replaceable by a chatbot. Also, there seems to be a problem with their intrinsic motivation to learn. The fixation on tests and results seems to be one of the main causes for these two issues, as the focus on the end product makes it easy to skip the learning process leading to it, while that process is what motivates students to learn and grow. To revisit the aim of learning and teaching, I will draw upon the insights of the Chinese philosopher Confucius. His ideas on moral education will be used to create a better understanding of the current education system and the role of technologies such as ChatGPT within that. Most important are the emphasis on self-reflection, life-long learning and the role of the dialogue.","['Artificial Intelligence', 'ChatGPT', 'Confucius', 'Education', 'Motivation']"

Two Concepts of Freedom in Schelling's Freedom Essay,"Rezaei Saravi, Mostafa","['Lindberg, Susanna']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this paper, I shall argue that in Philosophical Investigation into the Essence of Human Freedom (Henceforth referred to as the Freedom Essay), Schelling oscillates between two incompatible concepts of freedom: radical and limited. Radical freedom is spontaneous and identical to the agent's own act. It is founded on undetermined intelligibility and stands outside the theological system's domain. Limited freedom is a decided intelligibility that one-sidedly determines human actions. It is located within the domain of the theological system and meets its requirements. I will make the case that these two concepts of freedom are vulnerable to the charge of arbitrariness. First, I shall argue that equating radical freedom with the agent's own act does not provide determinacy for this concept of freedom. Second, I shall contend that the agent's decision on her intelligibility in limited freedom is undetermined, which consequently renders this freedom undetermined. I will suggest the source of Schelling's oscillation in the Freedom Essay is the existence of two incompatible tendencies: a commitment to provide a concept of freedom with unlimited power, and to indwell that freedom in an ordered theological system. I maintain that the simultaneous fulfilment of these two tasks is impossible.","['Schelling', 'Freedom Essay', 'two concepts of freedom', 'radical freedom', 'limited freedom', 'Kant', 'system', 'arbitrariness', 'determination']"

How are contemporary art initiatives attempting to sensitize the public to sounder relational and “ecosystemic” ways of living? What are the proposals that are currently being set forth? The comparison and contrast of two initiatives, the Echigo-tsumari Art Field and the Tokyo-based teamLab project, will allow me to move towards the central hypothesis of this thesis, that is, that self-consciously labelling certain artistic practices as “eco”, can sometimes be a pretext for a variety of economic, social and cultural purposes rather than just an artistic concern. The Japanese conception of nature (shizenkan), which inspires both initiatives will be proposed here as a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it can be exploited to market and sell a static, fictionalized idea of nature, but it also has the potential to become a valuable representational idea from which to depart to develop something new.","['Japanese contemporary art', 'eco-art', 'nature', 'satoyama', 'cultural heritage', 'festival']"

The Phantom Storm: The crisis of 1848 and the stance of the Low Countries towards the danger of a Republican France.,"Lelij, Maarten","['Bos, D.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"On the 24th of February,1848, the Belgian ambassador in London informed the English Foreign Minister Palmerston of the Belgian stance regarding the new developments in France. The ambassador told Palmerston that “a republican France was an aggressive and conquering France.” The memories of the French Revolutionary Wars and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars were still fresh in Europe. Had it not been a French Republic that had threatened the European Balance of Power, subduing the existing states and creating puppet states across the continent? A French Republic that had turned on its rightful king and deposed him before trying to subjugate the lawful order in Europe? The same Republic that had turned into an imperial power under the guidance of Napoleon the likes of which had not been seen since the days of Rome? The parallels to the events of 1789 had to have been frightening to the crowned heads of Europe and their governments. On the 24th, Frederick William IV of Prussia informed Victoria of Britain that he looked at France in fear of a new European war. In the newly formed nation of Belgium, the news of the new French Revolution was met with dread in governmental circles. In the Netherlands, the messages from the French capital of Paris were met with anticipation and uneasiness. When Tsar Nicholas heard of the news he reacted calmly, but immediately stated that Russia would march to war if any infractions were made on existing treaties. He also put a million more rubles at the disposal of the war ministry. Additionally, he wrote a letter to Victoria that a Russo-British union as discussed in 1844 may be needed to ensure stability in Europe. The general consensus at the time among the leaders of European nations was that war was inevitable. France was militarily, by virtue of its population, still one of the most powerful nations on the continent and if it would lead to war, it would mean untold destruction in a display that would appear to be a replica of the events that had happened a little over three decades ago. In the Low Countries, the subject of this thesis, the consequences of the Belgian Revolution of 1830 were still felt strongly. The Belgian Revolution had broken out after the July Revolution in Paris, that had seen the Orleanist take-over of France. It seemed likely that this new French Revolution, a Republican Revolution this time, would also move beyond the borders of France into the Low Countries and bring about another time of violence and war in Belgium and the Netherlands. Except history does not move in predictable patterns. Knowledge of the past does not make one a seer and although a war may have seemed inevitable, it was avoided nonetheless. The diplomatic crisis surrounding this new French Revolution however, is often downplayed in historical works, which have mostly focused on the spread of Revolution across the continent when discussing 1848. Yet, revolution and war were intrinsically linked at the time, especially if that revolution occurred in France. A Revolutionary France would mean a threat to European peace and the balance of power, but it was also a beacon for revolutionaries across the continent who felt supported by a Republican France that might come to their aid, militarily if need be. It may ultimately have been the case that no war in Europe erupted in 1848, but this does not mean that war had not loomed large over the governments of the Low Countries and Europe in general. A manifesto by the French Foreign minister of the Provisional Government Lamartine was sent to all the other courts of Europe one week after the initial Revolution in Paris. It had the intent of unlinking war and revolution (in France), because they were so intrinsically linked in the mind of the 19th century governments. The main objective of the manifesto was legitimising the rule of the Provisional Government and to make sure the reactionary powers would not see the new French Republic as an existential threat. The traumas of the French Revolutionary Wars were specifically addressed. If we consider Lamartine’s manifesto and the Belgian ambassador’s words, this parallel of revolution in France and war was very much on the minds of the contemporary players of the international game of diplomacy.","['Low Countries', 'Belgium', 'the Netherlands', 'France', 'Limburg', 'Luxemburg', '19th Century', 'Revolution', 'Diplomacy', 'War', 'Crisis', 'Borders', 'Transnational', 'Correspondence', 'Lamartine', ""d'Hoffenschmidt"", 'William III', 'Bentinck']"
Female Desire Through Looks and Glances: Exploring Female Desire in Audio-Visual Screen Adaptations of Jane Austen’s Pride & Prejudice,"Rutgers, Xenia","['Rolfe, K.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores the question of how Andrew Davies’ 1995 BBC serial adaptation and Joe Wright’s 2005 movie adaptation of Jane Austen’s homonymous Pride & Prejudice (re)present female desire on screen. This research examines and consults adaptation theory to gain a better understanding of what transpires when adapting a concept such as desire from a novel onto a screen. Implicit instances of desire are explored in the novel, so as to contrast those occurrences with how they are translated on to the screen. Close readings of relevant scenes provide insight into the use of camerawork, acting, dialogue and framing and how they enhance the audience’s attention to the depictions of desire, love, attraction and interest. What this research can conclude is that both productions acknowledge the desire present in the novel, be it implicit, and translate it onto the screen in a literalized manner, highlighting on different ways how that desire could be conveyed. Both adaptations recognize the importance of transmitting information through glances and looks – their focus ranging from shared looks between characters to the female’s independent gaze.","['Female desire', 'Adaptation', 'Adaptation Theory', 'Jane Austen', 'Pride & Prejudice', 'Screen Adaptation', 'Novel Adaptation', 'Desire', 'Female Independency', 'Female Gaze', 'Gaze']"

"Socio-politically active elite women: The extent of their influence in gatherings, patronage and writings explained. 1700-1800","Moreira Calzadilla, Claudia","['Laborie, L.P.F.']",2023,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"During the Cumberland election in 1768 Lady Mary Coke (1723-1811), together with a group of women, visited the Commons at least eight times. Elite women, often related to English politicians, were active in the socio-political world, although there is no historiographic consensus about the intensity of their actions in the second half of the eighteenth century. This thesis challenges the view of some historians; namely that women were cut off from the political world in the period. Unlike most scholars, this research adopts a broader definition of the term ‘politics’ in which the social side is included because women were able to express their opinions more easily within the social realm. This paper aims to find out whether elite women’s political actions became more limited and less effective throughout the century or not. This will be assessed by looking at different women throughout the century, including the insufficiently researched women of the first half of the century. Furthermore, unlike other studies, this thesis will evaluate the obstacles that women encountered by examining society’s reaction to these activities through printed sources, like prints and magazines. It will show how women dealt with these obstacles in three socio-political activities within the public and private spheres: politicized gatherings, political patronage, and publications. This thesis argues that women were not only politically active throughout the century, but also that their activities increased, and that their influence can be easily perceived in the more local and personal levels of society.","['social-political invluence', 'women', '18th century', 'gatherings', 'patronage', 'writings.']"
