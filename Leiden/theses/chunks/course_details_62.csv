Cycles of Violence: How Unhealed Collective Trauma Leads to Armed Conflict,"Iölster, Ina","['Natermann, D.M.S.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In theories of armed conflict in international relations and security studies, human psychology, namely the concept of collective trauma, is very little taken into account. However, considering that states and armed groups consist of individuals, their collective traumas might play a role in the outbreak of armed conflict. This paper articulates theoretical elements from IR, memory studies, and psychoanalysis allowing to better grasp how and why collective traumas generated by large-scale violent events may in turn engender armed conflict if they remain unhealed. This articulation leads to a refined theory and mechanism of ‘cycles of violence’, which is then qualitatively tested in two empirical cases: The United States, with 9/11 and the following invasion of Afghanistan; and Afghanistan, with the US intervention and the following insurgency. In both cases it is possible to establish with a high degree of certainty that the respective large-scale violent events caused a collective trauma which, for different reasons, remained unaddressed and participated in the outbreak of further violence. Each case thus represents a cycle of violence itself, and they represent a larger one together. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the power dynamics sometimes preventing proper healing, and sheds light on the case of Afghanistan, in which Western versions of events often dominate.","['armed conflict', 'memory studies', 'psychoanalysis', 'collective trauma', 'cycles of violence', 'US 9/11', 'Afghanistan']"

Las estrategias de empoderamiento en las letras y audiovisuales del hip-hop cubano femenino: Un análisis de 3 canciones feministas cubanas,"Riupassa, Maria",['Nanne Timmer'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,es,"El título de la presente tesis de maestría es “La estrategia de empoderamiento en las letras y audiovisuales del hip-hop femenino cubano”. La pregunta principal de la investigación es: ¿Qué estrategias utilizan las raperas en sus obras para empoderar a otras mujeres dentro del movimiento hip-hop cubano? Después de responder a esta pregunta, tendremos una mejor comprensión de las formas en que las raperas cubanas invocan la fuerza interior de sus oyentes y el posible impacto real en ellas. Esto será relevante porque a lo largo de la historia el feminismo ha ignorado otras vías a través de las cuales los individuos pueden experimentar opresión y desigualdad. La música hecha por y para mujeres negras muestra otra narrativa que les permite arrojar luz sobre su historia social, cultural, política e individual que no son simples catarsis existenciales. Es importante comprender la forma en que se usa la música hip-hop cuando se busca desarrollar el amor propio y la autoestima. El estudio que realizo pone en juego el debate de cómo y en qué medida esto se pretende. De tal manera, la investigación presenta un análisis de las canciones de tres músicos cubanos dentro del movimiento hip-hop: La Reyna y La Real –“Ciao Papito” (2020)-, La Fina –“Mujer Afrocubana” (2013)- y Oye Habana –“Negra” (2009)-. Teniendo como base la letra y los videoclips, se ha identificado que los temas principales de tales objetos culturales se hallan relacionados con el feminismo decolonial y la conciencia feminista negra. Abrazar la herencia, tener agencia personal para contar su historia, son dos aspectos importantes que inspiran a otras afrocubanas a valorarse más entre sí y a sí mismas. También fue sometido a discusión si este comportamiento era realmente feminista, pues se corre el riesgo de establecer estereotipos dañinos, cuando no confusos o limítrofes con zonas de la realidad que desvían o aniquilan la autenticidad de variados procesos emancipadores.","['Feminismo negro, Feminismo descolonizado, Hip-hop cubano femenino, el empoderamiento y el hip-hop']"
INCUMBENT REELECTION AND ELECTORAL ACCOUNTABILITY: A case study of the 2022 Brazilian Elections,"Nes, Demi van de","['Amann, E.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper analyzes the impact of various policy subject on the Latin American electoral accountability. Knowing to which factors electoral accountability is prone in the reelection of Latin American incumbents is relevant to the incumbents themselves at first. According to the democratic dividend theory, incumbents could increase their likelihood of securing its next term by providing certain policy merits to the population. Moreover, for scientific reasons, it could explain why some incumbents are reelected and others are not. Furthermore, it allows to better evaluate and analyze previous and upcoming elections in Latin America. First, a multi-level regression analysis is conducted concerning the effect of various factors on the incumbent’s reelection. Based on this research, GDP growth and corruption have significant effects on the reelection chances of incumbents. These results are applied to Brazil’s 2022 Presidential elections. The analysis is conducted with semi-structured interviews with experts in the field. This analysis highlights the importance of economic voting as well. Moreover, it mentions influential factors, such as healthcare policy, evangelic voting, and international economic influences. Altogether, this analysis emphasizes the importance of economic voting and economic electoral accountability in Latin American countries. This allows researchers to further analyze the Latin American elections through a better scope.","['Incumbent', 'Reelection', 'Latin America', 'Brazil', 'Electoral Accountability', 'Economic Voting', 'Brazilian Elections', 'Jair Bolsonaro']"

Al met al ben ik al lang blij dat het al af is: Een onderzoek naar het gebruik van al in het Nederlands,"Klinkenberg, Amber","['Barbiers, L.C.J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek gaat over al. Al heeft in het Nederlands veel uiteenlopende functies en kan in contexten gebruikt worden die op het eerste gezicht niet aan elkaar gerelateerd lijken te zijn. Al kan onder andere als focuspartikel gebruikt worden, als zelfstandig naamwoord, als onderdeel van verschillende woorden, als versterker en als voegwoord. In dit onderzoek probeer ik de functies en interpretaties van al dichter bij elkaar te brengen door te onderzoeken waar de betekenissen van al vandaan komen en wat ze met elkaar gemeen hebben. Door de evolutie van al van het Middelnederlands tot het heden te onderzoeken krijgen we een beter beeld van waar de huidige functies van al vandaan komen en kunnen we beter bepalen of bepaalde functies aan elkaar gelinkt zijn. Zo blijkt dat de meeste functies die al in het huidige Nederlands heeft in het Middelnederlands al in gebruik waren, zoals het universele gebruik, al als versterkend element en al als voegwoord. Ook komt al voor in verschillende woorden, zoals de complexe universele kwantoren en voegwoorden als als en alhoewel. Daarnaast bespreek ik een aantal ‘bijzondere’ gevallen van al. Ik probeer vervolgens vast te stellen of de verschillende functies die al in het huidige Nederlands heeft onder één centrale betekenis geschaard kunnen worden. Ik kom daarmee uit op een universele betekenis waar ik de meeste functies van al onder kan brengen. Vervolgens kijk ik of door middel van de syntactische context de functie van al in een bepaalde zin kan worden voorspeld. Hieruit blijkt dat veel functies een unieke plaats in de zin hebben en/of bepaalde constituenten kiezen die niet door andere functies gebruikt worden. Zo kan al als focuspartikel alleen binnen een DP voorkomen als er een NumP aanwezig is, en kan alleen het voegwoord al in SpecCP voorkomen. Zo kan er door middel van de syntactische context vaak voorspeld worden welke functie van al van toepassing is. Waar de syntaxis tekort schiet zijn er vaak andere aanwijzingen die duidelijk maken welke functie van al in een zin gebruikt wordt.","['focuspartikel', 'historische taalkunde']"

M.P.G.M. Mous'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Karel Schoeman (26 October 1939 – 1 May 2017) was one of South Africa’s most prolific writers. His idiosyncratic style contributed to a unique form of authorship. Schoeman’s novels were awarded with many prizes and the output of his historical work is unsurpassed. His status however remains relatively unknown in the world outside South Africa. This can be attributed mainly to the fact that most of his work is written in Afrikaans. Schoeman was raised in three languages. His first language was Dutch, which was spoken at home with his mother. Afrikaans was his second and English his third language. His first unpublished novels were in Dutch and English. From his early twenties on he wrote predominantly in Afrikaans. A decade later he distanced himself from the Afrikaner part of the community. This raises the social-linguistic problem of how it is possible for an author to deeply engage in a language and at the same time not be part of its social group. This matter will be discussed in paragraph two where the course of Schoeman’s life and his attraction and aversion concerning the Afrikaners can be followed and in paragraph four which deals with Schoeman’s creative writing. Schoeman’s work has been the subject of several articles, reviews and theses; many of them are of South African origin. A thesis that investigates the problem posed above has not been written yet.","['Karel Schoeman', 'Afrikaans', 'South African literature', 'South African writers', 'South African historians']"
A Babel of Shadows: The Meaning and Function of Shadows in J.R.R. Tolkien’s 'The Lord of the Rings',"Gahrmann, L. P. J.","['Porck, M.H.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The fictional works of English author and Oxford philologist, J.R.R. Tolkien, have been subjected to many literary and comparative analyses ever since they first came within the purview of academia. Source criticism (i.e. the analysis of how Tolkien drew inspiration from medieval texts, Catholicism, WWI, etc.) and thematic oppositions, such as light vs. dark, have especially attracted scholarly attention. What has not yet been satisfactorily explored within source criticism and light-dark opposition is Tolkien’s use of the ‘shadow’ as a literary motif in 'The Lord of the Rings' and its possible resonances with Old English conceptions of the shadow. This study combines a close reading, philologically-minded analysis of 'The Lord of the Rings' with a comparative approach centred on the occurrence of shadows in Old English poetic contexts. In so doing, the arguments and evidence brought forth in this study make a strong case for shadow as both a viable literary motif throughout the narrative and as a likely area of borrowing from early medieval Old English poetry.","['J.R.R.

"Post-war refugee relief: Dutch NGOs and the IGCR/IRO, 1945 – 1952","Roos, Pepijn","['Schrover, M.L.J.C.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Between 1945 and 1952, Dutch non-governmental organisations (NGOs) closely cooperated with intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) to administer aid to refugees. Making use of a case study approach, this thesis scrutinises the cooperation between four NGOs and the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees (IGCR) and the International Refugee Organisation (IRO). How and why did NGOs and IGOs join forces to effectuate refugee relief? It turned out that interdependence played an important role: NGOs were reliant on the financial support from IGOs, whilst IGOs needed the ‘grassroot’ expert knowledge of NGOs. NGOs also distributed IGO support to the refugees and mediated on behalf of the refugees. In return, IGOs provided NGOs with legal assistance and advice. Moral arguments and preventive considerations (keeping the refugees on the right path and the fear for unwished precedents) played a lesser role in fuelling NGO-IGO cooperation. All in all, this thesis provides a first insight in the unstudied activity of Dutch relief NGOs directly after the war. The case studies are conducted against the backdrop of an extensive and inconclusive debate on NGOs and their role in the establishment of the modern humanitarian refugee regime.",

MORALITIES WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS: AN AKAN COMMUNITARIAN PERSPECTIVE: On Community and Social Responsibility,"Bron, Aranka","['Dr. Eze, Michael Onyebuchi']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"The United Nations' foundational principles, delineated in the Charter of the United Nations, remain the driving political and ideological force in its decision-making, formation, and performance. This research will show that, because the Organization is built on a liberal internationalist morality, it prioritizes liberal ethics to the detriment of a communal morality. Currently, the principles governing the institutions are mostly generalized principles of conduct aimed at fostering economic freedom and to maintain security – a morality mostly based on voluntarism, mutual gains, and negative freedom – but these principles do not speak of an intrinsic motivation towards an (additional) morality based on fellowship, solidarity, equality, and global well-being. A communal moral dimension is absent in the Charter, and this in turns prevents the United Nations from becoming a community instead of an aggregate of member-states. As I will showcase later following the Akan philosophy, such intrinsic motivation is internal to the practices of a community, and the universalisation of the liberal morality currently is insensitive to the international context of the United Nations. Since the Organization has thus yet to become a holistic community, it is unable to take up grand collective responsibility in their striving towards global well-being and development. Akan philosophy specifically and African communitarianism in general will be put forward as candidates to manifest this additional morality, one which will be able to facilitate the formation of a community, to strengthen the bond between member-states and United Nations, and to address social responsibility within a framework of relationality and interconnectedness. African communitarianism could help bridge the gap that currently exists between the theoretical appeal and the actual implementation of the Organization’s collective responsibility. A synthesis between liberal internationalist and African communitarian principles could fashion the United Nations as a community, one in which concepts of freedom and voluntarism would be coupled with values of solidarity and relationality, and where the individual member-states are motivated to adhere to their social responsibilities.","['Akan', 'African Communitarianism', 'African Philosophy', 'Social Responsibility', 'United Nations', 'Liberal Internationalism', 'Community']"

“We want neither a war that kills us nor a peace that subordinates us.”: The role of women in the Havana Peace Negotiations (2012-2016),"Dijk, Veerle van","['Duyvesteyn, I.G.B.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis will examine the link between women’s civil society organizations (CSOs) and women at the negotiation table in the Havana Peace Process between the Colombian government and the FARC guerilla group. Although women are often ignored in peace processes, previous studies have shown a positive relation between the inclusion of women and the outcome of these negotiations. Jana Krause theorizes that female participation in peace negotiations is linked to the durability of peace because female negotiators sustain linkages with women’s CSOs. Through process tracing, this thesis will test whether Krause’s theory can be used to explain the outcome of the Havana Peace Negotiations between the Colombian government and the FARC, taking place from 2012 until 2016. The results will show that women’s organizations were instrumental in getting women in the negotiating teams, and in turn, these women with formal power in the negotiations ensured the participation of women’s CSOs through consultations. This has contributed to the inclusivity of the content of the peace accord but has not necessarily produced any positive effect on the implementation of the agreement, thereby partially supporting Krause’s theory.","['Women Peace and Security', 'Colombia', 'Civil Society.']"

'BRUNA' Muslims and Bedtime Stories: Exploring Dutch Islamic Children's Literature in The Netherlands,"Mons, Sophia","['Berger, M.S.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Since the 1990s, the genre of Dutch Islamic children’s literature has seen an impressive boom in terms of quantity and quality. With increasing numbers of publishers active in the field and books published, the genre is growing with an exponential speed and continuously transforming in character. Building upon the gradually developing field of study that deals with the everyday lives of Muslims in ‘the West’, this study provides an exploratory insight into a specific manifestation of the daily experiences of Muslims in diaspora: Islamic children’s literature. Through 25 qualitative in-depth interviews with those actors most closely involved in the phenomenon, being publishers, authors, and producers, this explorative study aimed to understand the main intentions and motivations for both producing and using these books. Providing a bottom-up account of the phenomenon, this research intended to answer the following research question: What explains the increasing popularity of Dutch Islamic children’s literature since its emergence in the 1990s? With a new generation of Dutch Muslims, born and raised in The Netherlands themselves, facing an increasing need for renewed pedagogical materials that fit contemporary Dutch context, the genre of Islamic children’s literature is the materialised response to a need for educational and socialising materials in a non-Muslim majority context. Characterised by a diversity of both actors involved and books produced, the genre of Islamic children’s literature serves multiple functions, ranging from the strict didactic teaching of virtue to playful modes of representation. Serving both as a complementary tool in the Islamic upbringing of a future generation at home and as a means of strengthening children in their Dutch Muslim identity, the genre is continuously adaptive to the needs of its ‘BRUNA’ Muslim audience.",

Copingmechanismen van beeld- en videoredacteuren: Hoe Nederlandse beeld- en videoredacteuren omgaan met (werken met) belastend beeldmateriaal,"Blonk, Manon","['Burger, J. P.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Uit voorgaande onderzoeken is gebleken dat beeldredacteuren een verhoogde kans hebben om secundair trauma te ontwikkelen, in vergelijking met de algemene populatie. Deze trauma’s kunnen zij ontwikkelen doordat zij op regelmatige basis in aanraking komen met potentieel traumatiserende (oftewel ‘belastende’) beelden. In hoeverre zij daadwerkelijk last hebben van deze beelden is deels afhankelijk van hoe zij ermee omgaan. Om dit in beeld te brengen wordt er in dit onderzoek antwoord gegeven op de volgende vraag: ‘Hoe gaan beeld- en videoredacteuren op redacties van Nederlandse nieuwsmedia om met het werken met potentieel traumatiserend beeldmateriaal?’ Voor dit onderzoek zijn er semigestructureerde interviews afgenomen bij 17 beeld- en videoredacteuren. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat beeldredacteuren zowel adaptieve als maladaptieve copingmechanismen gebruiken om hun werk te kunnen blijven doen. Alle beeldredacteuren omschrijven een professionele afstand die zij tijdens het werk tot de beelden bewaren. Hierdoor lukt het hen om hun werk goed uit te voeren. Eén adaptief copingmechanisme waar veel redacteuren gebruik van maken, is over (de impact van) de beelden praten met collega’s. Het verschilt echter per redactie hoeveel ruimte hiervoor is. Sommige redacteuren zouden het prettig vinden de impact van de beelden meer bespreekbaar te maken, andere redacteuren zien de belastende beelden als onmiskenbaar onderdeel van het werk en geven aan dat je hier als beeld- of videoredacteur zelfstandig mee om moet kunnen gaan. Bij het interpreteren van de resultaten van dit onderzoek is het belangrijk om in acht te nemen dat generalisatie en statistische conclusies trekken niet mogelijk is bij deze onderzoeksmethode. Om deze reden wordt kwantitatief vervolgonderzoek aangeraden. Bij voorkeur met speciale aandacht voor de manier van voorbereiding op het werken met belastende beelden, gesprek over de impact van de belastende beelden met collega’s en het nemen van pauzes tijdens het werk.","['beeldredacteuren', 'coping mechanismen', 'belastende beelden']"

The written portion of the experiment functions as a close replication of the effect of lingering misinterpretation of garden-path sentences found in Christianson et al (2001) and the effect of the frequent misinterpretation of implausible passive sentences found in Ferreira & Stacey (2000). In an online experiment with writ- ten and spoken content, participants read and heard garden path and implausible passive sentences and were asked to answer comprehension questions about them. Effects of good-enough parsing were found for both target sentence types. No significant effect of mode of presentation was detected, but interactions of mode of presentation and control conditions of the sentences turned out to be significant. It can be concluded that the re- plication effort was successful, but the comparison of good-enough parsing effects for written and spoken sentences did not deliver clear-cut results.","['good enough parsing', 'online experiment', 'garden path sentences', 'passive sentences', 'auditory presentation']"

The Affordable Care Act in Low-income U.S. States: A comparative analysis of Louisiana and Mississippi,"Ashmead, Carlijn","['London, Dr. J.D.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The United States has a high level of uninsured citizens. Through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) the federal government has provided funding and a set of rules for Medicaid, to increase the level of uninsured citizens. In the low-income states Louisiana and Mississippi, the uninsured rate has been high for decades. The ACA is not a mandatory act to implement in a state, which results in the ability of states such as Mississippi to reject implementation. In this thesis, factors of influence have been researched what drives state governments to not implement the full ACA. Through the usage of official governmental documents and local newspapers, the outcome of factors of influence can be allocated to political/ideological factors, economic factors and public opinion. Secondly, the comparative effect of the ACA has been measured in order to conclude if it matters to implement the Medicaid expansion in the low-income states. Through the comparing of data on uninsured rates and the costs of Medicaid, the results are that Medicaid is more expensive for the state government of LA, but does decrease the uninsured rate significantly. Whereas in Mississippi Medicaid is less expensive for the state government, the uninsured rate remains higher than the national average. Therefore, a trade-off has to be made between accessibility of healthcare and more economic burden for the low-income states.","['Affordable Care Act', 'ACA', 'U.S. Health Insurance', 'Louisiana', 'Mississippi', 'Low-income States']"

A Defence of Moral Compromise in Democratic Politics,"Jongerius, Frederick Bastiaan",['Dr. Wouter Kalf'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Moral disagreement and compromise seem to go hand in hand in democratic politics. Politicians disagree about moral matters, such as abortion. These moral disagreements cannot be solved by consensus or public agreement. This leaves another domain of democratic politics: forming of compromise. Compromise is everywhere in democratic politics: coalition-building, law-making, policy-adoption etc. Compromise is a necessary part of politics. I therefore introduce compromise as a means of dealing with intractable moral disagreement in politics. Compromises of this sort are moral compromises. I define the notion of compromise (chapter one) and defend my view of politics as necessarily involving moral disagreements (chapter two). I then ask whether is it ethically justifiable to engage in moral compromises in democratic politics. I argue that it is. My argument begins by refuting multiple objections brought against moral compromise. I begin by arguing against David Enoch, who argues that moral compromises are never justified (chapter three). I then argue against Simon May, who argues that principled reasons to compromise do not exist (chapter three). Next, I argue against the idea that moral compromise weakens integrity (chapter four). Based on a distinction between honoring and promoting a principle, I also conclude that, from the point of view of the moral principle in question, it can actually be morally right or required that one compromises on that principle. I end by considering three question/objections that might arise concerning whether moral compromise involves a betrayal of the electorate, which moral compromises are acceptable and why principled reasons are needed (chapter four). If my arguments succeed, then I will have given an ethical justification of moral compromise. This means that politicians should engage in moral compromise in the political sphere.","['Political Philosophy, Democracy, Moral Compromise']"

"‘Baldwin of Egypt’s Lake’: The Egyptian Overland Route and European Colonial Expansion, 1775-1798","O'Donoghue, Tomaz",['E.L.L. Odegard'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis is primarily a study of George Baldwin (1743/4-1824), a British merchant and diplomat, and his efforts in developing an overland route through Egypt in the last decades of the eighteenth century. The significance of the Egyptian overland route in this period has often been overlooked when compared to the later overland mail established by Thomas Waghorn in the 1830s and the Suez Canal. This thesis will provide a reassessment of the overland route’s commercial and geopolitical significance to the British Empire during the period of George Baldwin’s two residencies in Egypt; first as a merchant (1775-1779) and then as the first British Consul-General to Egypt (1786-1798). The growing realisation of the route’s strategic significance by British policymakers, like Henry Dundas, predates the Napoleonic Expedition and will be examined in relation to Baldwin’s consular appointment in 1786. The commercial value of the route will be assessed by looking at the private trade of Baldwin and his associates during both residencies and is something that casts doubt on the traditional view that the Middle East experienced commercial decline in this period. Most significantly, this thesis will focus on the strategic importance of the route to the British position in India. The significance of Egypt increased as the East India Company transitioned into a territorial power in 1770s and 1780s. This meant that Baldwin’s role was a strategic necessity; something shown by a series of case studies on the sieges of Pondicherry in 1778 and 1793 as well as the transfer of Ceylon to the British in 1796.","['Egypt', 'Middle East', 'Colonial', 'Empire', 'Economic', 'Britain', 'East India Company', 'India', 'Commercial', 'Early Modern', 'Napoleonic', 'Military', '18th Century']"
Challenges to the pursuit of American Cold War interests in the Middle East posed by Gamal Abdel Nasser between 1953 and 1970,"Kroon, Famke de","['Ben Aharon, E. + Yenen, A.A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"After a military coup in 1952, the Egyptian Gamal Abdel Nasser developed into the leader of the Arab nationalist movement that was spreading quickly throughout the Middle East. This research will examine how Nasser challenged the pursuit of American Cold War interests in the Middle East. Nasser’s entire period of leadership will be covered: from January 1953 when the coup had just taken place until September 1970 when Nasser died. By means of a very extensive examination of the archival documents of the Foreign Relations of the United States series, this research will show that Nasser, as a powerful leader of a secondary power, was capable of seriously obstructing the pursuit of Middle Eastern interests of a superpower like the United States. Interestingly, this case study of the relations between Nasser and the US interests in the Middle East over the course of 18 years will show that Nasser’s ability to challenge the pursuit of American interests in the Middle East mainly derived from the continued American attempts to get closer to Nasser, even though he proved time and again that he could not be trusted to cooperate with. The Americans apparently valued the influence of powerful secondary powers in the Cold War very highly and therefore put a lot of effort in the attempts to get these powers to align with the American side of the global Cold War rivalry.","['Egypt', 'Nasser', 'Foreign Relations of the United States', 'Cold War', 'Middle East']"

Within this research gap, the objective of this paper is to understand Chinese influence on changing employment patterns in the Lao market service sector, in the context of Lao individuals' experiences. Through the analysis of primary research, more specifically interviews of different clusters of the Lao population, this study observes the increasingly distinct impacts that China has had on the daily life of Lao people. Evidently, this is facilitated through an increase in infrastructure foreign direct investments (FDI), and an expanding Chinese diaspora. Thus, this research demonstrates that Chinese presence affects today's Lao labor at multiple levels, while also impacting future employment patterns within the country. This ultimately poses questions as to long-term consequences on national economic development.","['Lao service sector', 'Chinese FDI', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'Migration and tourism', 'Lao youth employment.']"

This thesis aims to answer the research question How has insecurity and the role of inefficient institutions affected the political legitimacy of Felipe Calderón's 2006-2012 presidential terms? The research paper first explores the parameters of political legitimacy and utilises the normative approach as a theoretical framework of political legitimacy in combination with Hansen's definition of political legitimacy as components to measure Felipe Calderón's regime legitimacy. Thereafter, the text analyses the utilization of electoral legitimacy and revolutionary legitimacy as a tool to maintain and re-assert power and legitimacy during the PRI era, Vincente Fox's administration and its continual use during Calderón's presidential term. Furthermore, the thesis also examines the effects of the three minor variables: criminal violence, media, and public perception on (in)security and (in)efficient institutions on three specific events: the 2006 Mexican presidential election; Felipe Calderón's war on drugs; and the opening event of the monument Coloso and have founded that the insecurity and the role of inefficient institutions have largely decreased the political legitimacy of Felipe Calderóns 2006-2012 presidential term. The paper concludes that Calderón's presidential term was deemed as intially legitimate by the public during electoral process. However, the increase in insecurity and the inefficiency within state institutions greatly decreased the regime's legitimacy by the end of Felipe Calderón's presidential term.","['Political Legitimacy', 'Mexico', 'Felipe Calderón', 'Legitimacy', 'security', 'institutions', 'associative picture']"

Narendra Modi's Janus Face: Economic Saint or Radical Divider?,"Fargel, Maximilian",['Irene Hadiprayitno'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to answer the following research questions: in what ways has economic development enabled the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the ensuing spread of Hindu-nationalism in India? Despite India’s impressive economic growth of the last decades, India society is still lacking widespread human development. Social cohesion is not only threatened by discontent over stagnating overall quality of life but also by the increase of Hindu-nationalist rhetoric, violence, and policies. By examining India’s neoliberalization since 1991, this thesis attempts to draw potential correlations between neoliberalism and surging nationalism. The goal is to highlight how the BJP and their leader Narendra Modi opportunistically employs pledges of inclusive growth to either attract or appease the Indian electorate. The research of this thesis sets off with a literature review of secondary sources about economic development with a focus neoliberalism as a model and its relationship to populism. The case of Chile is employed as an example to highlight the potential implications a neoliberal economy has on human development and social unrest. The literature review is followed by a short chapter on India’s history since independence. A thorough analysis of Narendra Modi’s political beginnings as well as the Gujarat Model give a first idea of his vision for the South Asian nation. Then, this thesis discusses how a declining economy led to another switch in rhetoric and gave the BJP impetus to exclusive Hindu-nationalist policies, resulting in an ever-increasing division of India’s heterogenous society that leaves the Muslim minority subordinated and oppressed.","['economic development', 'neoliberalism', 'India', 'Hindu-nationalism', 'BJP']"

Some of these functions are employed in the industry of fashion. Here, gairaigo are used for example to refer to new concepts or trends that cannot be described using native Japanese terms. These gairaigo lack a so-called equivalent in the Japanese language and are called cultural borrowings. Gairaigo that do have an equivalent in the Japanese language are called core borrowings, and are often used for their modern image. My thesis focuses on this use of gairaigo in the industry of fashion. In particular I do research into the ratio of core and cultural borrowings on covers of Japanese fashion magazines. The aim of this research is to find an answer to the following research question: “What is the relation between the age of the target group of Japanese fashion magazines and the ratio of cultural and core borrowings on the covers of these magazines?” This is done by gathering all candidate-gairaigo from covers of both magazines aimed at women aged 50+ and magazines aimed at women in their late 10s and 20s. All the found gairaigo are thereafter classified as either core or cultural borrowings. Finally a comparison is made between the ratio of core and cultural borrowings on magazine covers aimed at elderly women and the ratio of core and cultural borrowings on magazine covers aimed at younger women.","['Japanese language', 'Western loanwords', 'gairaigo', 'language and linguistics']"
Michel Houellebecq and the dialectic between modernity and tradition: Soumission as a Guenonian novel,"Kattenberg, Pablo","['Dr. Annelies Schulte Nordholt', 'Prof. dr. Frans Willem Korsten']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis assesses the relation between the novelistic work of French author Michel Houellebecq and the theoretical work of French Indologist and esoteric polemicist René Guénon. While this relationship has been noticed before, it hasn’t been addressed in a more extensive study. This work questions how the concept of ‘tradition’, which is a key idea in Guénon’s theoretical work, can be interpreted in Houellebecq’s novels, and especially his 2015 novel Soumission. To adequately address this question, the first chapter sets out to explain and contextualize Guénon’s works Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines (1921) and The Crisis of the Modern World (1927). It explains the most important concepts of Guénon’s work, particularly the semantics of ‘tradition’. The author stresses that ‘tradition’, however a supposedly a-historical notion, is embedded within Guénon’s understanding of History as a gradual disintegration of authentic spirituality. The second chapter investigates how the concept of modernity is represented in several of Houellebecq’s novels. The author uses secondary literature by Van Wesemael, Betty and Sweeney to argue how the representation of modernity throughout Houellebecq’s novels is polyphonic, both progressive and reactionary. Within Houellebecq’s critique of modernity, the third chapter explores how Houellebecq’s novel Soumission fictionally represents Guénon’s idea of tradition. It poses that the representation of traditionalism in Soumission, as an expression of the rejection of modernity that is present throughout Houellebecq’s oeuvre, could be seen as part of a general current of Guénonian influence in Houellebecq’s oeuvre. This influence however, as the thesis concludes, should always be regarded from within the limits of literary representation.","['Houellebecq', 'Guénon', 'Tradition', 'Modernity', 'Traditionalism', 'Submission', 'Reaction', 'Anti-Modernism']"

Today, Kashmir is not seen as a priority by politicians and policy makers. In my opinion, this is a mistake. Since 2016 both states have been subject to border skirmishes and standoffs (BBC news, 2019). Not only does this result in a lot of deaths, it also causes insecurities to the population of both states and surrounding states. This conflict demands a solution before it escalates any further, and is intensified by the nuclear capabilities of India and Pakistan. A solution to the conflict does not yet exist. Therefore, it would be interesting to know what causes these clashes and if (economic) alliances between states can affect these border skirmishes. According to the theory and literature review, India and Pakistan should come to war over the newly build China Pakistan Economic Corridor. I find that the economic cooperation between Pakistan and China does not affect the conflict over Kashmir. However, I do find that the China Pakistan Economic Corridor does affect the relationship between India and Pakistan. I find, that in the future, this could lead to a security dilemma in the South Asian region.",

A Sense of Dark Places: The Gothic Representation of the Scottish Natural Environment in Fiction by Robert Louis Stevenson,"Konings, Maxime",['Dr E.J. van Leeuwen'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the Gothic representation and symbolic function of the Scottish natural environment in two works by Robert Louis Stevenson: the short story “The Merry Men” (1882), and the adventure novel Kidnapped (1886). The Gothic aesthetics in Stevenson’s writings – such as the notion of the sublime, the personification of nature, and the past versus the present – highlight the themes that the author expresses through his description of the Scottish landscape and seascape. By analysing the depiction of the Scottish natural environment in “The Merry Men” and Kidnapped, and by comparing these images with the aesthetics characteristic of the Gothic genre, I will demonstrate that the Scottish natural environment is not only Gothic in description, but also symbolises the themes and motifs of the narratives involved, such as heritage, memory and identity. Moreover, in the two narratives, the idea of Scotland as a nation as well as its specific physical environment becomes dark and mysterious, affecting both the characters’ and the readers’ sense of place. Since one’s sense of place is closely connected to one’s state of mind, this thesis also critically explores the extent to which the Scottish landscape and seascape influence the state of mind of the protagonists.","['Gothic', 'Robert Louis Stevenson', 'The Merry Men', 'Kidnapped', 'Landscape', 'Seascape', 'Natural Environment', 'Scotland', 'Sense of Place']"

Pinking the agenda: The strengthening of the EU LGBTIQ norm against Eurosceptic contestation,"Lous, Sofie Dahm","['Smith, K.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The LGBTIQ rights landscape in the European Union is undergoing change. Government-endorsed discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity has been on the rise in its Easternmost member states. In response to recent events, the European Commission has communicated that the Union must be at the forefront of efforts to better protect LGBTIQ people’s rights. This study critically examines the changing self-perception of the European Commission as it engages with the conflict over LGBTIQ rights. Process tracing of the emergence, (lack of) diffusion and subsequent contestation of the LGBTIQ norm in the region reveals that the ongoing dispute of values between the East and the West is a self-inflicted wound which can be traced back to the Eastern enlargement accession negotiations. The timid approach to the enforcement of European Union membership criteria has caused a normative gap post-accession, resulting in a regional identity crisis. Norm polarisation theory is proposed as a theoretical framework which can describe the deepening rift between the Union’s human rights profile on one hand, and Polish insistence on the right to tradition and sovereignty on the other.","['LGBT rights', 'LGBTIQ', 'European Union', 'EU enlargement', 'norm polarisation', 'euroscepticism']"
The Development of Classifiers in the Tukanoan Family,"Wiegertjes, Jurriaan","['Bruil, M.', 'Gijn, E. van', 'Costa Chacon, T.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"All Tukanoan languages have gender markers and classifiers, and both can be reconstructed to the proto-language to some degree. In this thesis, I provide a reconstruction of the development of the classifier system in the Tukanoan family, where I argue that it developed out of the older gender system morpho-syntactically, but that many of the synchronically found classifiers can morphologically be analysed as grammaticalized nouns. My arguments for this, as elaborated in this thesis, are as follows: i) all Tukanoan languages have similar gender markers which can probably be reconstructed for Proto-Tukanoan (Chacon 2021; in prep.); ii) the gender markers seem to have undergone grammaticalization at an early stage in the family; iii) many classifiers in the family are language-internal developments or can only be reconstructed for a sub-branch; iv) a few classifiers are widely found in the family and can be reconstructed for the proto-language, but these seem to be developments of either Proto-Tukanoan gender markers or originally complex forms. I analyse these complex forms as consisting of a gender marker in combination with some other marker. I furthermore provide an analysis of the development of the Proto-Tukanoan gender system, based on Chacon (2021; in prep), where I suggest that some of its morphological material may indicate borrowings from an Arawakan source. Lastly, by contributing to the reconstruction of the Proto-Tukanoan classifier system, this thesis may contribute to a reconstruction of classifiers in the wider area, as classifiers are a pervasive feature in non-Tukanoan languages as well, where the relatively gender-like morpho-syntactic characteristics of classifiers have been the subject of much discussion (e.g. Payne 1987; Aikhenvald 2000a, 10; Grinevald 2000, 81-82, 87).","['Tukanoan', 'noun categorization', 'classifiers', 'gender', 'grammaticalization']"

Lesbienne ou Gouine: LGBTQ+ Slur Reclamation in French,"Printems, Jeanne",['Dr. E. Alves Vieira'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Slur reclamation is a linguistic process wherein a community reclaims words intended to hurt them. This paper focuses on the sociolinguistic factors behind LGBTQ+ slur reclamation in French. Hence the research question: What are the sociolinguistics factors behind the reclamation process of anti-LGBTQ+ slurs in French? The research was conducted under the hypothesis that French reclamation would only differ from English in people’s objections which would be based on a prestige-appealing ideology. An online questionnaire was used, which participants completed on a voluntary basis. From the results, it appears that LGBTQ+ slur reclamation in French operates in a similar manner as in English. Prestige, however, was less often a factor in French than the hypothesis assumed. Instead, those against reclamation cited the following reasons: derogation too deeply encoded in the slur (always has the potential to hurt anyone, could contribute to internalised oppression), refusal to be defined by your label, pointlessness of the reclamation process. Those in favour of slur reclamation stated the following reasons in the questionnaire: reinforcement of an ingroup feeling, erosion the derogation, humour, unintentionally (part of their lexicon), provocation, secret queer language, ignorance of the insulting nature.","['Linguistics', 'Sociolinguistics', 'Queer studies', 'LGBTQ+', 'Slur reclamation', 'French language']"

Poets in Search of Reality: A Historical Study on How Poets and their Societies Needed the Muses and their Epiphanies in Ancient Greece,"Bil, Jolein","['Zangenberg, J.K.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Greek poets reflected upon the epiphany – the presence - of the Muses in their poems in Ancient Greece. This study aims to determine why poets reflected upon the epiphany of the Muses in their poems. Since Greek poetry was performed in front of a public, it focusses on the social demands to question the epiphany of the Muses in Ancient Greece. Specifically, it investigates how various political and military crises may have created social demands to reflect upon the Muses’ epiphanies. To test the hypothesis that crises created needs for poets to question the reliability and presence of the Muses, the circumstances of poets’ lives and careers are investigated. Biographical and autobiographical literary evidence, in combination with archaeological and iconological evidence, supports the idea that crises led to a demand to reflect upon the Muses’ epiphanies. This suggests that disruptive experiences such as war and diseases impacted the trustworthiness of divine inspiration and divine knowledge.","['Epiphany', 'Ancient Religion', 'Crisis', 'Social demands', 'the Muses', 'Greek poets']"
Translating privacy law,"Batenburg, Didi","['Reus, T.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this study four Dutch privacy statements and their English translations are analyzed in order to get an impression of what privacy law terminology is in use, whether there are issues to be addressed and how these might be solved. The privacy statements investigated are those of Leiden University, Erasmus MC hospital, EliteSingles (a dating website), and Bink Kinderopvang (a child daycare center). The necessary background for this analysis consists of two parts: a chapter in which several theories of equivalence are detailed in order to help structure the analysis and to help identify the choices translators have made in the translations of the privacy statements. There is also a chapter in which the relevant legislation is laid out, the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union, its Dutch translation the Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming and the Uitvoeringswet Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming. The latter is the Dutch law that implements the EU-regulation. In the mentioned analysis, the privacy specific terminology of every statement was arranged in a table in which the English and the Dutch counterparts are compared with each other and, where possible, with the terminology of the mentioned legislation. The analysis showed that if you consistently follow the GDPR/AVG and UAVG, translating privacy law terminology does not pose many problems. It was also found that smaller organizations had translations with more inconsistencies and inaccurate terminology. Finally, a suggested terminology list is given in order to help translators find the right terminology and to promote consistency in translating privacy law related texts.","['privacy', 'legal translation', 'legal terminology']"

SINO-EUROPEAN TRADE RELATIONS: A gravity analysis,"Zandvoort, Koen van","['Scepanovic, V.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study applies the gravity model to explain Sino-European trade flows. It constructs a model with trade conformity to identify the logic underlying Chinese trade flows, trade complementarity to test unused trade potential and predicts trade flows between China and the EU28 to estimate the unexhausted trade potential. The empirical results show that global Chinese trade flows follows a Heckscher-Ohlin model with dominant inter-industry trade. For Sino-European trade, Heckscher Ohlin explains EU exports. However for EU imports of China and total Sino-European trade flows, no model could be identified. The calculated Trade Complementarity Index shows that EU imports have a higher complementary with Chinese exports than EU exports and Chinese imports, indicating that the EU is a better export market for China than vice versa. The complementarity explains trade flows better than the conformity model and predicts unexhausted trade potential between the EU and China. Large unexhausted potential is mostly found in Chinese exports to the EU, indicating that China benefits most from improving trade relations between the EU and China. On the member state level, large heterogeneity in trade potential is found. A small number of member states outperform their predicted trade flows. Most EU member states have unexhausted export potential with China, and China has unexhausted export potential towards the majority of EU member states.","['trade potential', 'gravity analysis', 'European Union', 'China', 'Sino-European trade relations']"

F. van']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the depiction of solitude in the novels Caleb Williams, Frankenstein, and A Tale of Two Cities, and the relationship between these depictions and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century discourses on solitude. In particular, this thesis shows the tension between philosophies of sociability and sympathy, such as Rousseau’s and Hume’s, and the moral dimension of solitude. While previous research has examined solitude by focusing on either Romantic solitude or on loneliness as an imposed condition by social forces, this thesis aims to investigate the moral value of solitude, and its relation to social criticism. Taking a cultural materialist approach, this thesis examines cultural discourses surrounding solitude and offers close readings of the novels to argue that these novels present sociability as a divisive force in society, and solitude as both necessary to foster a connection to humanity, and a necessary condition for justice and morality. The privileging of solitude over sociability shows how these novels respond to the emphasis of Enlightenment philosophy on sympathy and similarity and suggest an alternative foundation for justice and morality in situations where sociability and similarity are insufficient.","['solitude', 'loneliness', '18th century literature', '19th century literature', 'literature']"

Translator Visibility in Dutch Video Game Localisation: An Interview Study,"Leistra, Hester",['Susana Valdez'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the juxtaposition of Lawrence Venuti’s theory on translator visibility with the situation of Dutch video game localisers in practice. Venuti argues that translators should employ foreignizing translation strategies, lest they erase themselves. Video game localisation, however, is said to rely heavily on domesticating strategies to ensure that a game meets the needs of the target culture. This conflicting phenomenon is investigated by means of an interview study with seven professional translators who translate video games into Dutch. The results suggest that Dutch video game localisers do have a strong preference for domesticating their translations, and that a foreignizing strategy is only rarely used. The results further indicate that while translators do feel invisible, they do not see a direct connection between their strategy and their visibility. It therefore appears that Venuti’s theory is not applicable to this type of translation. However, Venuti believes that the translator’s working environment also influences their visibility, and the results of this thesis further suggest that there are other agents within and beyond the game localisation business that may be capable of improving translator visibility.","['translator visibility', 'venuti', 'video game localisation']"

"An analysis of the challenges of the EU natural gas trade relations with Russia, demonstrated by the example of Austria","Lainer, Andreas","['Fynn-Paul, Jeffrey']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In September 2021, the construction of the natural gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 was completed by the Russian state-owned company Gazprom alongside five European partner companies from Western and Central Europe. Within the European Union this project had already been seen as highly controversial prior to its construction. Essentially, it became evident that a neoliberal approach to develop a commercially profitable pipeline – which was supported by a handful of individual EU member states – faced widespread geopolitically influenced neorealist concerns regarding rising Russian influence within the EU’s energy sector. Moreover, the apparent success of Nord Stream 2 brought into question the effectiveness and purpose of the EU energy policy strategy, which promotes a broad diversification of energy sources. Through utilising a case study research design, this master thesis aims to evaluate the challenges that the EU encounters in implementing its strategic objectives in its natural gas trade relations with Russia based on the example of Austria. This is achieved by analysing the role of Austria in selected natural gas infrastructure projects which vary significantly in the extent to which they align with the broader EU strategy. Furthermore, this thesis elaborates on the theoretical debate between neorealism and neoliberalism on interpreting EU-Russian energy relations and demonstrates how this has impacted the discussions surrounding the case at hand. The results of this master thesis show the limitations of theoretical approaches in IR to fully reflect the intricacies of EU-Russian gas trade relations. Moreover, the thesis also demonstrates that the implementation of the EU’s strategic targets faces a degree of ambivalence between the organisational structure of the EU and the interests of individual member states.",

Whereas scholars have thoroughly examined the role of the state in the securitization of outer space, it has thus far predominantly overlooked possible securitizing moves performed by the private space industry, as well as the role of the novel NewSpace industry within that process. Therefore, this investigation aims to examine the private space companies SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and United Launch Alliance (ULA) building upon securitization theory. Specifically, it will provide a discourse analysis on those companies’ webpages, uncovering four discourses possessing either or both securitizing speech acts and performative securitization. This thesis finds that the private space industry took on a facilitating role regarding the securitization of outer space by proliferating and enhancing space launching capabilities and engaging with the U.S. military and national security services. Furthermore, it might have contributed to the securitization of outer space by performing speech acts, but this investigation refrains from drawing that conclusion, as it has not investigated the audience involved and thus cannot estimate whether the speech acts were performed successfully. Nevertheless, these findings combined with the academic literature on PMSCs, suggest that private space companies sometimes can look and act like PMSCs, explaining why private space companies might be incentivized to contribute to outer space securitization.","['Space', 'Securitization', 'Privatization', 'Private Space Industry']"

Win-Win or Win-Lose? China’s Role in the Development of Pakistan’s Domestic Wind Industry,"Hewitt, Jasper",['Matt Ferchen'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis answers the following research question: to what extent do the Chinese government and Chinese companies contribute to the development of Pakistan’s domestic wind energy industry through technology transfer (TT)? In order to assess this question, I use China as a benchmark for successful TT in the wind industry. The main finding is that there is evidence that the Chinese government and Chinese companies contribute to the development of Pakistan’s wind energy industry through TT. The Chinese government does so through its involvement in several Pakistani knowledge institutions. As for Chinese companies, they go to great lengths to employ and train Pakistani engineers, and one Chinese company even works together with a Pakistani engineering company. That being said, this thesis also finds that Chinese companies are outcompeting Pakistani companies. This prevents Pakistani companies from gaining valuable learning experiences and may also dissuade them from investing in wind-related technologies. However, this is not some scheme by the Chinese government to hollow out a fledgling Pakistani industry. Instead, it is a result of ineffective policies by the Pakistani government itself. This thesis contains three important takeaways. First, it shows that, when it comes to providing training opportunities for locals in Pakistan, Chinese companies follow their government’s official objectives. Second, it underlines earlier findings by Schneider et al. (2021, 25) by showing that local actors play a crucial role in determining the outcomes of Chinese foreign economic activities. Chinese actors cannot single-handedly ensure TT in their foreign operations; the interactive nature of TT also demands strenuous efforts by companies and government institutions in the receiving countries. Third, by using China as a benchmark, this thesis also shows us that—when it comes to developing a domestic wind energy industry—a highly coordinated, state-led approach like the one adopted by China is more effective than Pakistan’s market-driven approach.","['CPEC', 'Technology Transfer', 'Renewable Energy Technologies', 'wind turbines', 'Renewable Energy Policy', 'SOE']"

In Other Wor(l)ds: The establishment of and withdrawal from the JCPOA analysed through the discursive construction of US Self and Iranian Other identities in US foreign policy discourse,"Lutz, Eden","['Gawthorpe, A.J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the past decade, the relationship between the United States and Iran has been through significant changes, particularly playing out in the realm of nuclear proliferation. The establishment of the landmark Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) under the Obama administration, thought to be the start of a new chapter of US-Iran relations, was uprooted by the Trump administration almost immediately after the change in leadership. In order to understand how this radical policy shift is possible, this thesis analyses and compares the policy discourses on Iran of the Obama and Trump administration in terms of Self-Other identity construction. Taking a poststructuralist approach to policy discourse analysis, the ontological link between discursive identity and policy decision making is the central subject of study. The thesis concludes that the decisions to establish and withdraw from the JCPOA are constituted by discourses which in fact construct a highly similar radical Self-Other relationship between the US and Iran, within which the US is positioned as having to change the behaviour of the Iranian regime as arbiter of the Middle East and ally of the Iranian people. Crucially, they differ when it comes to the use of orientalist binaries, the capacity for change attributed to the Iranian regime (temporal identity) and the position of the US vis-a-vis the international community (ethical-spatial identity), which is congruent with the diverging policy decisions on the JCPOA.","['JCPOA', 'Iran-US relations', 'policy discourse analysis', 'identity', 'poststructuralism']"

"No Justice, No Peace: Framing Protests Against Police Brutality by American Media 1992-2020","Morabet Belhaj, Rajae el","['Bouras, N.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Public opinion on protests is largely determined by news coverage. News media function as gatekeepers, who decide how news is communicated to the audience. In the case of protests against racism and police brutality, framing tended to be delegitimizing. This study questions the framing of protests against police brutality by news media within the context of newspaper and televised news coverage, researching long-term developments based on two case studies: the Rodney King riots (1992), and the George Floyd protests (2020). Using a critical discourse analysis of coverage from four newspapers and two news channels, this research examines the framing of protests by media outlets to constitute the dominant narrative of the publications. Next, articles and fragments were quantitatively coded using several terms and ‘coded words’ to generate counts of the words within the articles, which reinforce negative frames. Research suggests media coverage of protests does not necessarily follow a delegitimizing pattern anymore, but protesters are still viewed negatively by the media. These findings contributed to the understanding of the role of news media in the framing of protests against racism and police brutality.","['media framing', 'news media', 'Black Lives Matter', 'racial grammar', 'journalism', 'television news']"

This study has been performed succeeding extensive reporting of Colombian media in which Venezuelan migrants were held responsible for what had been named ‘a security crisis’. The results of this study show that the arrival of Venezuelan migrants has had a highly negative impact on the perception of security of Bogotá residents. Nevertheless, this study found that it is very unlikely, based upon official statistics, that the Venezuelan migrant population is to be held accountable for the ‘security crisis’. This study found that the security crisis, which is in essence a management crisis, is being used as an instrument by the highest political powers in order to attain personal success and slander political opponents. Venezuelan migrants are the victim of this internal power battle, exemplified by the presence of xenophobic and stigmatizing acts and tendencies present in both the political and public domain.","['perception of security', 'citizens security', 'Venezuelan migration', 'Bogotá', 'xenophobia', 'stigmatization']"

The study finds that both groups of speakers innovate self-reference strategies and index their gender/sexual identities through gender-neutral pronouns, zero anaphora, kinship terms, nicknames and the frequent use or avoidance of feminine forms. Additionally, the study looks into how other people refer to women and third-gender persons in a discursive context.First, this paper begins with an introduction to the relevant theoretical framework regarding language, gender/sexuality, and identity. Following that is background information concerning the current reconceptualizations of gender/sexual identities in Thailand. Next, the traditional Thai pronominal reference strategies and gendered status particles are introduced, followed by the case study about the pronominal self-reference strategies and other particle choices made by cisgendered women, transgender women, and non-binary persons in Thai talk shows and series. I conclude with a discussion of these innovative linguistic practices in the context of changing gender roles in Thailand, and of how speakers use these features to establish new gender identities in day-to-day interaction.","['politeness', 'markers', 'particles', 'gender', 'sexuality', 'language', 'Thai', 'sociolinguistics', 'sociocultural', 'linguistics', 'descriptive semiotics', 'identity', 'interaction']"
Style and Complexity: A Syntactic Analysis of English Cosmetic Brand Slogans,"Kooi, Amber Esmée van der",['Dr. Elenbaas'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research indicates that the application of syntactic stylistic devices and syntactic complexity in slogans comes with cognitive advantages and, hence, support the strategies of persuasion that slogans entail. The current study set out to assess the extent to which syntactic stylistic devices and complexity are displayed in English cosmetic brand slogans. In addition, it sought to determine which syntactic stylistic devices are used most commonly, and how cosmetic brand slogans vary in terms of their length (number of words), number of modifiers, i.e. adjectives and adverbs, and levels and types of syntactic complexity. Through content analysis, twenty-five English slogans from twenty-three different cosmetic brands were investigated. The results indicate that the most common syntactic stylistic devices displayed in English cosmetic brand slogans are repetitions, omissions, and changes in the logical syntactic order. With respect to syntactic complexity, the results suggested that both simplicity and moderate complexity occurred frequently within cosmetic brand slogans. Whether moderate syntactic complexity was applied purposefully, could not be concluded with certainty.","['Advertising', 'advertising discourse', 'slogans', 'taglines', 'stylistic devices', 'syntactic complexity']"
A new wave of politicized LGBTI phobia in Hungary and Poland,"Arnoldus, Tristan",['Drs. M. Cornelissen'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Scholars have thoroughly researched the political backlash against the LGBTI community in Poland and Hungary after EU accession. As time has passed, a new wave has arisen. With very little research conducted concerning this new wave or its relation to the earlier wave, it is time to update the body of literature surrounding politicized LGBTI phobia. Therefore, this thesis researches how politicized LGBTI phobia has developed in Poland and Hungary since their accession into the EU in 2004. This question has been answered through an examination of academic articles and NGO reports from the earlier wave, and a thematic analysis of interviews with local and transnational actors combined with information of NGO reports about the current wave. Thematic analysis has been used to analyze these interviews and this thesis utilizes antagonism theory as the wider framework. This thesis observes both parallels and differences among the waves within Poland and Hungary individually and the totality of waves between the two countries. There are continuations of factors, but also new factors to be found in the new waves. This thesis concludes that politicized LGBTI phobia has come in waves, with a shift towards anti-migration narratives in between the two waves. Furthermore, the developments consist of unique domestic factors, regional parallels that can be understood as echos, and also global developments such as the overall anti-gender and anti-LGBTI movements. New factors include new intensified forms of previous characteristics which are for example LGBT free zones, rule by decree, NGO restructuring and family mainstreaming. However, it is apparent that the latest wave has not yet ended and is showing no evidence of dissipating.","['LGBTI phobia', 'Politicized', 'Poland', 'Hungary', 'Gender', 'Queer']"

Neoliberalisme in Nederland en België: Een vergelijkende studie van het privatiseringsdebat omtrent Schiphol en Zaventem: Een vergelijkende studie van het privatiseringsdebat omtrent Schiphol en Zaventem,"Rooijers, Sybe",['D. M. Oude Nijhuis'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Met de opkomst van het neoliberalisme in West-Europese naties vanaf het begin van de jaren '80, was veel staatseigendom in deze landen aan privatisering onderhevig, zo ook in de transportsector. Dit onderzoekt kijkt specifiek naar de luchtvaartsector in Nederland en België. Ondanks dat deze twee landen veel overeenkomsten hadden in beleid, koos België er wel voor om haar nationale luchthaven te privatiseren en koos Nederland ervoor om dit niet te doen. Om dit verschil in privatiseringsbeleid in de luchtvaarsector te bestuderen, is in dit onderzoek gebruik gemaakt van vergelijkend onderzoek tussen een tweetal casussen, namelijk het nationale vliegveld van België (Zaventem) en het nationale vliegveld van Nederland (Schiphol). Hierbij is de volgende onderzoeksvraag gesteld; waarom werd de nationale luchthaven van Nederland (Schiphol) niet geprivatiseerd en de Belgische nationale luchthaven (Zaventem) wel geprivatiseerd, ondanks het overeenkomende neoliberale beleid? Vervolgens zijn een drietal perspectieven gebruikt om te kijken wat het verschil in beleid tussen Nederland en België kan verklaren. Deze drie perspectieven zijn; 1. De rol van de electorale politiek, 2. De rol van belangengroepen en 3. De rol van economische omstandigheden. Aan de hand van een analyse van allebei de casussen met dit drietal aan perspectieven, kwam naar voren dat dit verschil in beleid kan worden verklaard uit een multicausaal samenspel van factoren, waarin economische omstandigheden een dominante rol hebben gespeeld.","['Neoliberalisme', 'Keynesiaanisme', 'privatisering', 'nationalisering', 'Schiphol', 'Zaventem', 'KLM', 'Sabena', 'Ruud Lubbers', 'Wilfried Martens', 'Wim Kok', 'Tineke Netelenbos', 'Annemarie Jorritsma', 'Herman de Croo', 'Rooms-rode kabinetten', 'Paarse kabinetten']"
The Slavic Opening of Syllables and the Avar contact hypothesis,"Dees, Laura","['Pronk, Tijmen']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The Slavic proto-language was subject to a tendency commonly referred to as the “Opening of Syllables”, which is somehow connected to a number of sound changes that all had an opening effect, e.g. nasalization and loss of various coda consonants. The nature of the phenomenon is not quite understood and no language-internal explanations have proven to be successful. This thesis explores the possibility that the Opening of Syllables was due to contact, specifically with the (unknown) language of the Avars, spoken in and around Pannonia during the Migration Period. In order to find out, the relative and absolute chronology of syllable-opening sound changes is examined and mapped onto the spread of the Slavs and the Avars, and the sound changes themselves are compared to possible phonological traits of Avar. Based on this it is argued that contact with Avar was possibly responsible for only two sound changes (monophthongization and the certain developments of consonant clusters), but that this was not the result of a contact-induced tendency toward open syllables. In general, the Opening of Syllables as a whole was not induced by contact with Avar or with any other language.","['Proto-Slavic', 'syllable', 'Turkic', 'Avar', 'language contact', 'sound change']"

Turning the Tide: Explaining Social Mobilization in the Cochabamba Water Wars through Framing Theory,"Weijerman, Pieter",['Christian Henderson'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The emergence of social movements can be considered a significant factor in regard to the successful implementation of neoliberal economic policy, such as privatization. The role of grievances has been overlooked in the explanatory framework of how these movements emerge, which applies to the context of framing theory in particular. Therefore, this paper explores to what extent grievances caused by framing processes play a role in the emergence of social movements against neoliberal policies, such as privatization. The paper utilizes the case of the Cochabamba Water Wars, a conflict surrounding water privatization in Bolivia, to investigate to what extent grievances caused by frames contribute to the formation of the social movement, eventually causing the privatization’s reversal. The paper argues that the framing of Cochabamba’s water privatization as a threat to common cultural heritage, as well as a continuation of lacking political opportunities caused meaningful grievances that contributed significantly to the emergence of social mobilization. The paper demonstrates how social and cultural context affects the interpretation of neoliberal economic policies, especially privatization policies, and their acceptance. Therefore, the findings of the paper could be utilized by government officials to construct more efficient resource management policies, especially in the context of domestic water management.","['Cochabamba', 'Water Wars', 'Framing theory']"

Van Gils']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Abstract In 2012, China established the 17+1-forum together with Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC). It combined the forum in 2015 with the Belt and Road Initiative, an enormous Chinese infrastructure investment project. The EU deems the forum problematic because it divides Member States (MSs) in terms of relations with China, preventing the EU from taking a common position on China. The EU fears that this and other consequences will deteriorate its functioning and security. However, despite the EU’s fears, twelve EU MSs still participate in the forum. This raises an important question: Why do governments of BRI-17+1-forum participants that are also EU MSs choose to cooperate with China, despite that the EU fears that this will deteriorate its functioning and security? The literature gives several arguments for this, but this thesis will only test whether one of these arguments, whether these EU MSs have come to see cooperation with China in the forum as “a viable alternative to the EU project” respectively, is a valid answer to this question. Based on case studies of Hungary, Lithuania, and Slovakia and the application of shelter theory, it is concluded that this argument played a role in the decision of these countries to participate in the BRI-17+1-forum. However, the study also shows that Lithuania, and to a lesser extent Slovakia, have started to consider the forum less important because expectations are not met and because of the risks involved in cooperating with China.","['European Union', 'China', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'Central and Eastern European Countries', '17+1 Forum']"
An Alternative Pathway from Authoritarianism: Personalism as an Indicator for State Failure in Autocratic Regimes,"Goetstouwers, Damiaan","['E. van der Maat', 'D. M. S. M. Natermann']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Current academic literature falsely assumes that an authoritarian regime can solely transition into a democracy, other type of autocracy or a similar autocracy. This paper shows that there can be a fourth alternative: state failure. This paper conceptualises state failure in Westphalian terms, namely when there is an absence of internal and external sovereignty and the state apparatus fails to provide essential services. The paper hence focuses on possible explanations of state failure in autocratic regimes. Specifically, the paper focuses on personalism as a predictor for state failure, which must be understood as the degree to which an autocratic leader forms the regime to their personal demands. The argument of this paper, consequently, follows that personalism is detrimental to the state’s institutions, as these institutions are formed to solely function under the regime’s current leader. Additionally, the paper theorised that this effect would be stronger in regimes where regime change was imposed, as these regimes would be especially ill prepared for the sudden change in regime. Through a binomial logistic regression, this paper has found evidence that higher personalism indeed does lead to a higher probability of state failure, but has found no evidence to support the second claim, as the size of the effect of personalism on state failure seems to decrease when only analysing those regimes which experienced imposed regime change.","['failed state', 'personalism', 'autocratic regimes', 'imposed regime change']"

Toch is er nog steeds veel discussie over de scheiding van kerk en staat in Nederland (Addy de Jong, 2016, Anne Gooren 2019).

Kennedy, NWO) En zo richt de blik van de internationale gemeenschap zich ook vaak op landen waar de scheiding van kerk en staat vaak veel minder is dan in hun eigen omgeving. In het boek Religion and Politics in South Asia bespreken verschillende auteurs hoe religie en politiek in Zuid-Azië elkaar beïnvloeden en door elkaar heen zijn gaan lopen. Een ander land, waaraan echter meer aandacht besteed mag worden, is Rusland. De Russisch orthodoxe kerk (ROK) is een oud instituut en heeft al eeuwen een grote rol gespeeld in de Russische samenleving. Sinds de grondwet van 1993 is Rusland officieel een seculiere staat geworden, maar er zijn sterke signalen, dat Rusland niet zo seculier is al het lijkt. Dit onderzoek zal de vraag beantwoorden: Hoe gebruikt de Russische staat het instituut van de Russische orthodoxe kerk voor binnenlandbeleid? Uit een analyse van toespraken en uitspraken in de media blijkt dat de Russische staat en de ROK graag met elkaar samenwerken en verder gaan dan een samenwerking tussen de staat en een sociaal instituut.","['Russia', 'Rusland', 'Russian church', 'Russische Kerk', 'politiek', 'politieke invloed', 'invloed', 'Kirill', 'Russische Staat']"

Through the case study of the Japanese animated series called ""Noblesse"", this paper argues that with glocalization and cultural exchange also comes the neglect or replacement of the culture of origin, often resulting in an unequal cultural exchange. In the case of ""Noblesse"", originally a Korean Webtoon series created in South-Korea by South-Koreans, most of the South-Korean aspects of the story has been replaced by Japanese cultural references in its Japanese animated adaptation. This paper discusses the workings of this inter-Asian cultural exchange and argues how globalization, and in extension glocalization, affect inter-Asian transnational cultural media exchange. In addition, using the case study of ""Noblesse"", the contextual discursive approach, and the notion of glocalization, this paper aims to answer the question why cultural references have been replaced and what role the Asian animation industry and (global) audience of Japanese animation and Korean Webtoon play in the process of inter-Asian cultural exchange and how they affect it.","['Globalization', 'Glocalization', 'Cultural Media Exchange', 'Inter-Asian Cultural Exchange', 'Transnational Popular Culture', 'Hegemony', 'Hybridization', 'Anime', 'Webtoon']"

It will demonstrate that ideas on malaria vary significantly between these three cultures: in both Hamar and Swahili, malaria is included in a more general category of febrile illnesses, which becomes clear from the linguistic terms and constructions which are used to express ‘malaria’. In biomedicine, malaria is regarded as a potentially life-threatening disease which requires immediate treatment in hospital. If it progresses into severe or cerebral malaria, patients may show symptoms such as convulsions. This symptom is not related to malaria in many African cultures, but it is instead often categorized in a domain of spiritual illnesses and as such, requires different treatment, according to their traditional indigenous practices. An attempt will be made to clarify the Hamar, Swahili, and biomedical conceptualization of malaria from a linguistic point of view. This is done by investigating how malaria or febrile illness in general as well as related symptoms are expressed in Hamar and Swahili. For the biomedical perspective, it will not only be examined how malaria is conceptualized, but also the way in which traditional indigenous medical knowledge is considered. Moreover, an important aim of this thesis is to make a proposal of how to bring the different views together in an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation, in order to contribute to the global malaria struggle.","['malaria', 'indigenous medicine', 'biomedicine', 'conceptualization', 'linguistics']"

This contribution demonstrates that when the Tokugawa Shogunate began to redefine the conditions of foreign trade and diplomatic relations with Japan during the early seventeenth century, it was only one of several actors involved in this process. The local Dutch factory, led by the charismatic cultural broker Caron, also had a voice in this process through its powerful allies at court which Caron accumulated over the course of a single decade, allowing them to secure a position for the Dutch East India Company in Japan after 1641. It challenges the predominant theory that the Dutch owed their success in Japan to a pragmatic approach to trade which eschewed proselytization of the Christian faith by raising attention to the importance of systems of patronage and the efficiency of local agency in Japan and the broader early-modern colonial context.","['Diplomatic history', 'Dutch-Japanese Relations', 'François Caron', 'Patronage', 'Cross-cultural encounter', 'Commensurability', 'Dutch East India Company (VOC)', 'Tokugawa Japan']"

The research question posed is ‘To what extent is the effect of the Easter terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka reflected in tourists’ travel behaviour through risk perception?’. The literature gap on the impact of the Easter attacks on Sri Lanka has been the motivation for doing this research. The research is multi-disciplinary as it incorporating both political, economic and historical insights on the topic. It can be identified as qualitative research as it makes use of a case study method to research the topic. In order to answer the question, a literature review on terrorism, tourism and tourists’ risk perception has been conducted as well as five expert interviews with Dutch travel agencies that focus on the impact of the attacks on tourism to Sri Lanka. The literature review has been semi-structured, making use of fixed keywords to find peer-reviewed data through Google Scholar. Snowballing has been used as well as a means to find data. The expert interviews have also been semi-structured and probing is used during the interviews. The transcripts have been coded making use of the constant comparative method in order to analyse the data. The findings of the research are that terrorism strongly affects tourists’ risk perception and makes them perceive a destination as unsafe, which subsequently leads to a strong loss in tourism. This perception of risk deteriorates after a couple of months as people forget about the calamity and tourism starts to revive. This has also been the case for Sri Lanka, which experienced a strong loss of tourism after the attacks, but saw tourism increase again after a couple of months. Risk perception therefore strongly influences tourists’ choice in travel destination.","['Sri Lanka', 'Easter Bombings', 'Tourism', 'Terrorism']"

Onuitputtelijke bronnen: hoe Amerikaanse nieuwsmedia verschillen in het gebruik van actoren in nieuws over coronavaccins,"Weert, Mike van","['Opgenhaffen, M.P.A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In het remediatieproces van een (online) nieuwsitem kan een journalist in de verschillende fases andere hulpmiddelen gebruiken om nieuws op een andere manier te presenteren. Zo kunnen ze gebruik maken van actoren of een andere frame presenteren. Deze twee gaan vaak hand in hand; op basis van het frame wordt een actor gekozen om dit frame te sponsoren of de actor kan het frame naar hun eigen hand krijgen. Desondanks is het voor de journalist van cruciaal belang om de hiërarchische structuren van source credibility in acht te nemen; bronnen verschillen immers in hun betrouwbaarheid. Dit onderzoek heeft gekeken naar verschillende Amerikaanse media en hun gebruik van actoren omtrent nieuws over de coronavaccins van Pfizer en Moderna. Over 216 geremedieerde online artikelen (eerste bericht plus alle vervolgartikelen) werden de elite bronnen (bijvoorbeeld wetenschappers en politici) bij elk medium veruit het meeste ingezet, wat in lijn is met de hiërarchische structuren van source credibility. Desondanks werd de berichtgeving vaak onnodig gepolitiseerd, waardoor het vaccin geframed werd als een race tussen Republikeinen en Democraten, wat de betrouwbaarheid van artikelen niet ten goede komt. Een opvallende bijzaak is de hoge representatie van de gewone burger in geremedieerde artikelen over coronavaccins; ondanks dat dit tegenstrijdig is met de hiërarchie van source credibility brengt dit wel de menselijkheid naar voren en wordt er sympathie gewekt bij de consument. De belangrijkste bevinding is dat sommige media evenwichtiger zijn dan de andere.",

This model was combined with the historical context of the Heliand and the Saxon Wars, as well as the cultural, religious and mythological world of the continental Saxons. With these elements, the Heliand was analyzed in order to find out how this Gospel Harmony might have worked in aiding the conversion process of the Saxon Lay Elite, after their forced conversion by Charlemagne a generation earlier. By looking at the allusions in the Heliand to the Saxons their old religion, society, or cultural values with the help of the interpretive model, I tried to find out the Heliand its working for the said conversion process of the Saxons.","['Heliand', 'Early Christianity', 'Conversion process', 'Continental Saxons', 'Charlemagne', 'Versnel', 'Cognitive Psychology', 'CSR', 'Medieval Christianity', 'German Christianity', 'Multidisciplinary approach']"

Morality's Final Hour: A defense of moral concept-abolitionism in response to error-theory,"Dijkstra, Jurre",['Wouter Kalf'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Filosofie (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this dissertation I will be evaluating whether and how moral-concept abolitionism can be a satisfactory answer to the now-what question for moral-error theory. The version of error-theory most people will be familiar with was forwarded by Mackie (1977). Error-theorists are committed to the idea that first-order moral claims are truth-apt, they are trying to refer to some fact out there in the world, but since an ontological investigation does not provide one with moral facts, all moral claims are wrong by default. This leads into the ‘now-what’ question: what are we to do with our moral language once we accept the error-theory. I will forgo arguing that the known version of the error-theory is plausible or true, since I expect those interested in the now-what question to already have accepted the error-theory. Moral-concept abolitionism is one among the possible answers to the now-what question. It recommends we jettison moral concepts from our language for diverging reasons. I start my investigation with Anscombe’s ‘Modern Moral Philosophy’ (1958) in which I argue she forwards an error-theory and her own answers to the now-what question. Her error-theory follows from a historical analysis, rather than an ontological one like Mackie’s (1977). Second, I will evaluate how Anscombe’s abolitionism compares to the work of abolitionists that are responding to Mackie, as well as show their significant differences, their incommensurability. These differences lead me to demarcate two distinct forms of abolitionism. Anscombe’s version, soft-abolitionism, recommends we jettison moral language, but also provides criteria to meaningfully reacquire moral thoughts and talk. I argue these criteria would not be accepted by modern abolitionists for multiple reasons: moral language, as well as the positive account of virtue Anscombe envisions, is at risk of being elitist, authoritarian, and ineffective, which is detrimental to time-sensitive issues such as climate change. I call the position that recommends jettisoning moral language, full stop, hard-abolitionism. I will compare the nuances of both soft- and hard-abolitionism and conclude that while they offer different merits as an answer to the now-what question, the concerns raised by hard-abolitionists lead me to conclude that, at least when deciding between forms of abolitionism, the modern hard-abolitionist version holds the better cards. I conclude that while both forms of abolitionism could be a satisfactory answer to the now-what question, hard-abolitionism is the more viable abolitionism in the face of our current problems.","['Metaethics', 'Error Theory', 'Moral Abolitionism', 'Moral Nihilism']"

Hyperlocals als maizena? Over de bindende functie van lokale journalistiek in de hyperlokale media van Pijnacker-Nootdorp,"Kleijwegt, Francis","['Jong, J.C. de', 'Koetsenruijter, A.W.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Door de opkomst van het internet hebben veel mediaorganisaties moeite om hun medium rendabel te houden. Hierdoor wordt er onder andere bezuinigd op de lokale media waardoor zij verdwijnen uit het medialandschap. Door het verdwijnen van de lokale media is de kans aanwezig dat de informerende, controlerende en verbindende functie binnen een lokale gemeenschap minder worden uitgevoerd. Daarnaast geeft onderzoek aan dat het verdwijnen van de lokale media ook nog eens de angst versterkt dat de verbondenheid onder kleinere gemeenschappen verder afneemt. Het gat dat ontstaat door het verdwijnen van de lokale media in het medialandschap kan worden opgevuld door een vrij nieuw fenomeen binnen de journalistiek, namelijk hyperlocals. Er is alleen nog weinig onderzoek gedaan naar de functies van hyperlocals en of deze functies overeenkomen met de functies van de lokale journalistiek. Met deze scriptie is geprobeerd om daar meer duidelijk in te scheppen door één van de drie functies van lokale journalistiek te analyseren binnen de hyperlokale media, namelijk ‘binden’. Daarvoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Hoe wordt de functie ‘binden’ van lokale journalistiek gerepresenteerd in de hyperlokale media van Pijnacker-Nootdorp? Allereerst zijn er door middel van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse 139 artikelen geanalyseerd van drie verschillende hyperlocals in Pijnacker-Nootdorp. Uit deze inhoudsanalyse bleek dat alle negen dimensies van sociale cohesie aanwezig waren in de hyperlokale berichtgeving van Pijnacker-Nootdorp en dat deze negen dimensies ook op verschillende manieren tot uiting kwamen. Een groot deel van deze manieren hield daarnaast verband met de thema’s ‘sport’, ‘activiteiten door en voor inwoners’ en ‘individuele inwoners’. Naast de inhoudsanalyse zijn er ook drie semigestructureerde interviews gehouden met de makers van deze drie hyperlocals in Pijnacker-Nootdorp. Hieruit bleek dat de makers ‘binden’ als functie zien van hun hyperlokale media. Daarbij proberen de makers deze functie bewust te verwerken in hun hyperlokale media door met name bericht te geven over activiteiten die inwoners hebben georganiseerd en activiteiten die voor inwoners worden georganiseerd. Deze scriptie geeft dus een voorbeeld van hoe de functie ‘binden’ wordt gerepresenteerd in de berichtgeving van hyperlokale media en hoe deze functie wordt verwerkt in de hyperlokale media volgens de makers zelf.","['hyperlocals', 'hyperlokale media', 'binden', 'sociale cohesie']"

The Influences Of The Korean Wave Towards The Adoption of Soft Masculinity in China,"Dasopang, Elfira","['Jang, S.Y.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Korean Wave is a cultural phenomenon that emerged in Northeast Asia during the late 20th century impacting the entire Asian region. The term was created to show the successful influence of South Korean culture with the support of the South Korean government. For over 20 years, China and South Korea have had cultural communication and exchanges, further increasing both accessibility and popularity of South Korean culture and entertainment products in China. The success of the Korean Wave is associated with the spread of its products and the ability to influence the media environment and development of the cultural proximity. Korean drama (K-drama) and Korean Pop (K-pop) is strongly associated with soft masculinity, which has continued to inspire young Chinese males to exhibit their (inner) soft masculinity. The representation of soft masculinity as part of male gender, gives these young males a sense of belonging. The Chinese youth finds it easy to accept and emulate Korean idols and actors, for they feel empathy and cultural resemblances. However, the Chinese government is known for impeding the Korean Wave out of fear that the soft masculinity as portrayed through the Korean Wave will negatively influence Chinese teenagers and young adolescents.","['Masculinity', 'Hallyu', 'Cultural products', 'Music']"

Echter, het wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar de manier waarop de hyperlokale journalistiek de sociale cohesie probeert te bevorderen, is tot nu toe zeer beperkt. Dit is dan ook de aanleiding voor deze masterscriptie waarin door middel van een casestudy naar het hyperlokale medium Poeldijk Nieuws een antwoord geformuleerd wordt op de volgende onderzoeksvraag: Op welke manier wordt de sociale cohesie gerepresenteerd in de berichtgeving van het hyperlokale journalistieke medium Poeldijk Nieuws en welke waarden en gevaren kennen de journalisten toe aan sociale cohesie? Aan de hand van een codeboek waarin het concept sociale cohesie in negen dimensies uiteengezet is, is binnen een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse onderzocht welke vormen van sociale cohesie een prominente plek innemen in de hyperlokale berichtgeving van Poeldijk Nieuws. Hieruit bleek aan de ene kant dat ruim 90 procent van de onderzochte artikelen aan één of meerdere dimensies van sociale cohesie gekoppeld kon worden. Echter, uit de analyse bleek ook dat een aantal dimensies vaker voorkwam dan anderen. Opvallend hierbij was dat met name de dimensies waarbij sprake is van een gevoelige kwestie in de maatschappij in nog geen zes procent van de artikelen werden aangetoond. Om deze resultaten te verklaren, is binnen het onderzoek vervolgens een tweede onderzoeksmethode ingezet namelijk het kwalitatieve diepte-interview. Door middel van drie losstaande gesprekken met de hoofdredacteur, bestuursvoorzitter en de voorzitter van de Raad van Advies van Poeldijk Nieuws is onderzocht op welke manier zij het medium ontwikkelen en welke waarden en gevaren zij toekennen aan de verbindende functie van het medium. Deze scriptie toont aan in hoeverre verschillende vormen van sociale cohesie een plaats innemen in een Nederlands hyperlokaal medium en op welke manier hyperlokale journalisten hiermee omgaan. Daarmee vormt deze scriptie een eerste stap naar een hopelijk breder onderzoek naar de relatie tussen hyperlokale journalistiek en sociale cohesie.","['Journalistiek', 'Hyperlokale journalistiek', 'Sociale cohesie', 'kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse', 'kwalitatieve diepte-interviews']"

De Nullification Crisis, de Crisis van 1850-1851 en de Secession Crisis vormden drie onlosmakelijk verbonden politieke oproeren die South Carolina in december 1860 tot afscheiding van de Verenigde Staten bewoog. Echter, de herhaaldelijk opspelende roep om secessie in deze staat betekende niet dat er geen gedegen tegengeluid bestond. De Unionists, een officieuze, enigszins ongeorganiseerde groep politici, trachtten gedurende alledrie deze crises de dreigende afscheiding te voorkomen.

The Netherlands and the negotiation of the Economic and Monetary Union: An ‘actor-centered’ analysis of the Dutch EMU negotiations and Council Presidency of 1991,"Frudiger, Joost",['Bart van Riel'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis contributes to the debate over the EMU negotiations and the Council Presidency's role by conducting an 'actor-centered' analysis of archival sources. It focusses on the research question how far the senior officials went to advance the Dutch position on EMU during the Dutch presidency of the Council?. It is concluded that the Dutch position on EMU was formulated by senior officials from the Ministry of Finance and the DNB. Wim Duisenberg, President of DNB and Treasurer General Cees Maas, entered the Dutch presidency in 1991 by actively promoting the Dutch position on EMU, disregarding the wishes of other member states. This strategy was successful for establishing the ECB but was less successful for banking supervision and the transition to stage three. Maas and Duisenberg desired to continue tenaciously defending the Dutch position, but Finance Minister Kok determined that an agreement was necessary. The Netherlands was eventually forced to concede several points, but the Treaty was signed in Maastricht. Although the Netherlands had hoped for a different outcome, an EMU with a single currency supervised by a supranational monetary institution would eventually emerge. This has been the Netherlands' desire since 1986.","['EMU', 'EU Treaty negotiations', 'actor-centered', 'Council presidency']"

"Gendered Language in Japanese: Origins, characteristics, and differences between gendered language use in contemporary Japanese and Japanese animation","D'Alconzo, Francesca",['Ivo Smits'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Japanese animation as well as videogame’s industry put a lot of effort on the voicing of their characters. Often, their speech is what it’s used to give a better representation of the characters own temperament and visual representation. In a flexible game that more than often doesn’t manage to get translated in other languages, the way the characters express themselves tells the Japanese audience a lot of details through the linguistic implications. Some characters are built through the contradiction between their polite appearance and their rough speech; some other would instead have the appearance that the audience would expect based on their linguistic register, et cetera. I have long been interested in the connection between Japanese speech patterns and the way in which they are used for the strong linguistic and social representation in various media. For my bachelor research thesis, I focused on Japanese dialects and their usage and perception between Japanese university students, using two questionnaires. I would like to isolate the main speech patterns and analyze them from a linguistic and sociological point of view before seeing their usage in the media, bringing a few examples from popular culture. In particular, seeing as some of them are taken from still spoken dialects or, for historical settings, mixture of modern Japanese and elements of pre-modern/middle Japanese.","['Gender', 'Japanese', 'Linguistic', 'Gendered Language', 'Rapresentation']"

The effects of FDI on labour conditions in Thailand and Vietnam,"Polosina, Nadia","['Shidiq, Rizal']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on working conditions in Thailand and Vietnam. I hypothesise that FDI has a positive effect on working conditions, and that the effect is more pronounced in Vietnam where institutions appear to be stronger and the labour force is entitled to more rights, including the rights to organise and collective bargaining. As previous research has shown, contrary to the common notion of ‘race to the bottom’, FDI is attracted to countries with adequate labour policies. Further, governments play an important role in creating positive spill overs of FDI through the establishment of labour institutions, unions, and wage policies. The analysis has shown that the Thai government’s policies, despite some amendments to its legal framework, are less labour- friendly than Vietnam’s. In Vietnam, however, labour institutions and unions’ top members still lack neutrality and legislation doesn’t promote active employee participation. To conclude, the impact of FDI on labour conditions appears to be stronger in Vietnam, thanks to more labour-oriented policies and institutions.","['FDI', 'labour conditions', 'Vietnam', 'Thailand']"
Framing Covid-19 in online news articles: a comparison between China and the Netherlands,"Flipse, Naomi",['Dr. Florian Schneider'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the beginning of 2020, Covid-19 has impacted societies around the globe and while trying to find ways to live with the virus, societies faced many crises. The news media play an important role during crisis times, keeping society informed on all matters. This thesis concentrates on differences in media coverage on Covid-19 in the first phase of the crisis, between China and the Netherlands. Using the framework of framing theory, this thesis selected news articles in both Dutch and Mandarin and conducted a framing analysis. Doing this, this thesis contributes to a wider research area of crisis media coverage and research on Covid-19 related topics. The main difference between the countries is that the Dutch media wrote more about the consequences of the crisis while the Chinese media wrote more about the preventive measures that were implemented, who were responsible for these measures, and why they were implemented. Furthermore, I noticed that the Chinese news articles’ tone was somewhat more positive than the Dutch articles’ tone. These differences can be understood by looking at the different media landscapes of both countries and their political differences.","['Framing, Crisis, Covid-19, News Media']"
BRONZE MIRRORS OF THE GORYEO DYNASTY (918-1392 CE) How Their Iconography Reflects Their Role in Society,"van Merrienboer, Julia","['Klokke, M.J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Bronze mirror production was at its peak during the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392 CE) of Korea. This resulted in an unprecedented range of sizes, shapes and motifs. A mirror’s purpose is, by definition, to reproduce the image placed in front of it. Interestingly, Goryeo bronze mirrors have been recovered from graves and Buddhist temple complexes, indicating that they also served ritual functions. Considering 508 mirrors from ten museums, this study investigates the relation of mirror iconography to mirror use, answering the research question: to what extent did the iconographic attributes of Goryeo bronze mirrors reflect their meaning and role in society? This research found that a number of recognisable motifs could point to a mirror’s use in a particular context. As grave gifts, bronze mirrors were valuable objects, associated with high status and wealth. This inherent auspicious meaning was reinforced by the symbolism in the interred mirrors’ iconography, denoting values such as longevity, beauty and love. The bronze mirrors used in Buddhist rituals display religious symbolism in their designs, such as bells, images of deities and scenes from scriptures. A comprehensive analysis of the exact role played by these religious mirrors is beyond the scope of this thesis, but could be researched further through the examination of scriptures and other primary literature. As secular items used for personal grooming, bronze mirrors were luxury items indicative of their owners’ social standing. Increasing the value of mirrors as status symbols even further was the appropriation of Chinese motifs, as this signified an appreciation of Chinese culture in agreeance with the education that was expected of those with high social standing. In this way, identifying a bronze mirror’s iconographic theme can help clarify the context in which it was once used. However, Goryeo bronze mirrors’ functions were not mutually exclusive, and the presence of religious and secular mirrors in funerary contexts suggests that they could play various roles throughout their use-life.","['Goryeo', 'Koryo', 'bronze', 'mirrors', 'Korea', 'material culture', 'archaeology', 'iconography']"

Shahmeran is an old and known symbol in the region, especially in the diverse areas of south-eastern Turkey, northern Iraq and Iran. She is most probably a remainder of ancient mother goddesses, and was changed overtime to be adopted by the Islamic community with her own story with the help of early Indo-Iranian literary culture, thus making her a pre-Islamic phenomenon. Traditionally, Shahmeran is used primarily for oral storytelling, literature, and art, but also serves as an important talisman for protection against the evil eye and adversity, as well as for happiness and prosperity. The use of Shahmeran in a student protest at a famous university to highlight social issues is a significant change compared to her traditional roles in the region’s folk beliefs. In response to these events, I based my research on the use of Shahmeran as a political symbol for minority groups such as the LGBTQ+ community and the Kurds. This research was conducted by analysing existing Turkish literature, various artworks and news articles. Shahmeran is an inherently non-binary creature, with both female and male sexual characteristics, making her an important symbol for the LGBTQ+ community and gender expression in general. For Kurds, Shahmeran is used as a symbol of resistance against the Turkish state. Both minority groups in Turkey use art with her in it to express their political realities.","['mythologie', 'turkije', 'Shahmeran']"

The Russian Federation as the multinational successor state of the Soviet Union (SU) faced major struggles concerning notions of citizenship during the 1990s. After the collapse of the SU and leaving the notion of citizenship as ‘the builder of communism’ behind, the main focus of Russia was on democratization, but this changed after 2000, when patriotism was getting more prominent. A way to get access to Russia's conceptions of civic education is examining high school textbooks. An analysis of their content can provide a deeper understanding of how civic education is approached and practised in nowadays Russia, in shaping its next generation. This analysis applied three general conceptions of citizenship, namely liberal individualism, republicanism and communitarianism and argues that Russia fits the the communitarian approach the most.","['Civic education', 'citizenship', 'citizen', 'Russia', 'textbooks', 'moral development']"

The Perceived Relative Importance of Social and Phonetic Variables That Affect Second Language Acquisition,"Koster, Noa",['D.

The native and non-native speakers who were asked to participate in this research provided authentic audio recordings, which were added to the two online surveys that were used. The survey respondents that participated in this empirical study were asked to share their thoughts, via an online survey, on the individual speakers, with its primarily focus on the phonetic and social variables. By analysing the results of this research and examining the correlation between these results and the literature discussed, it was possible to draw a conclusion on which social and phonetic variables obstruct the learning process of Dutch L2 learners. This thesis concludes that the social variables (the division between a younger and older group of participants) and the phonetic variables (sounds that were identified as unintelligible and/or intolerable) that were recognized in this empirical research are collectively responsible for disrupting the comprehension and production of sounds for second language learners.

While discussions on rebels’ social media presence usually centre around issues of violence and disruption, mounting evidence exists pinpointing the non-violent tactics rebel actors employ online. Interested in how social media use contributes to the ability of established rebel groups to project, cultivate, and negotiate favourable online personas internationally, this research project offers an exploratory case study analysis of the 5-day long #AskHamas Twitter campaign that Islamic resistance movement for Palestinian liberation Ḥarakat al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah - commonly known as Hamas, conducted in March 2015. A mixed method approach combining social network analysis and empathic close-text reading was employed to reconstruct the international reception of the online event. Framing the Twitter campaign conceptually as an instance of public relations (PR) management, findings substantiate that the #AskHamas Twitter event allowed Hamas to establishing direct, and relevant relations with its targeted Western audience. At the same time, evidence pinpoints the ultimate dependency of online campaigns on the willingness of targeted audience to engage seriously. In case of #AskHamas, meaningful exchange with Hamas was obstructed by deliberate trolling, mocking and ridiculing on parts of participating. Evidence collected in this study implicates the urgency to overcome violence-fixation in Western understandings of rebel actors, and the necessity to contextualise identified rebel online communication practices to their socially mediated context of creation and dissemination.","['Rebel Groups', 'Social Media', 'Hamas', 'Twitter', '#AskHamas', 'Social Network Analysis']"

Acceptance for the Sake of Acceptance: Discussing the Role of Same-Sex Marriage within Taiwanese Diplomatic Discourse through Thematic Content Analysis,"Teunis, Hein Jacob Hendrik",['M. Nakamura'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper will discuss what role same-sex marriage legalized in 2019 has within Taiwanese diplomatic discourse (Ministry of Justice 2019). Taiwanese diplomatic discourse is heavily influenced by the fact it has no official United Nations recognition (Schafferer 2020, 46). As the head of state, President Tsai shapes Taiwanese diplomatic discourse. Current academic work has discussed the role of human rights diplomacy and same-sex marriage in Taiwanese diplomacy to a very limited extend. This causes understanding of Taiwanese diplomacy to be lacking. Same-sex marriage has taken a prime position within global diplomacy. Discussing President Tsai’s diplomatic discourse can provide insights in how same-sex marriage is adopted within Taiwanese diplomatic discourse. This paper provides further insight on the mechanics of Taiwanese diplomacy and the role of human rights and same-sex marriage within Taiwanese diplomatic discourse. Through thematic content analysis it became apparent that President Tsai argues for recognition of Taiwan’s sovereignty by mainly western actors based on shared values. The base of these relationships is shared liberal values, such as freedom, democracy, the upholding of human rights, and providing gender and LGBTQ+ equality. She also argues that the legalization of same-sex marriage reason to support Taiwanese democracy. The legalization of same-sex marriage legitimizes President Tsai’s narrative to present Taiwan as a beacon of freedom and democracy in Asia. Based on these shared values, President Tsai argues for protection by the international community of Taiwan from the People’s Republic of China. The legalization of same-sex marriage takes a position within Taiwan diplomatic, as presented by President Tsai, as proof to legitimize Taiwanese advanced democracy, respect for human rights, and Taiwanese sovereignty.","['Same Sex Marriage', 'Taiwan', 'Sovereignty']"

To this end, this thesis replicates the two experiments of Patel et al. (2006) regarding the rhythm and melody of British English and French speech and instrumental music. In addition, a third parameter labelled as “slope” was tested to investigate if melody, when taking into consideration the durational property of the melodic interval, provides the same results as the two previous replicated experiments. We replicated the findings for rhythm and melody reported in Patel et al. (2006). The slope parameter, however, showed a reverse pattern raising some critical questions about the validity of the metrics to portray statistical evidence of national characteristics in speech and music.","['Speech Melody', 'Music Melody', 'Pitch', 'Pitch Interval', 'Pitch Height', 'nPVI', 'slope parameter', 'rhythmic variability', 'melodic interval']"
Kashmir's special status: not so special after all?,"Eerd, Donna van","['Blezer, Henk']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In August 2019, the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to revoke the special status of the state of Kashmir. Because of this special status, the Kashmiris were able to live under their own Constitution and host their own elections. Without a doubt, revoking this special status will have far-reaching consequences on the disputed region of Kashmir. Chances are that the fragile balance that exists in the area will be jeopardised by the decision to revoke Kashmir’s special status. However, the abrogation of the special status is not a completely random decision. It can be argued that this special status has never been effectively implemented. Thus, this thesis will analyse why this is the case, and which factors influenced the erosion of Kashmir’s special status. Furthermore, this thesis will analyse possible consequences of the revocation of this special status. In doing so, the aim of this thesis is to fill the research gap provided by the topicality of this research.","['India', 'Kashmir', 'Article 370', 'Special status', 'Revocation', 'Religion', 'Politics']"

Negotiating different valuations of our surroundings: An interpretation of responses to the Amazon rainforest fires in 2019,"Versnel, Ester","['Henderson, C. J. V. + Black, L. O.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2019, the occurrence of forest fires in the Amazon rainforest gained worldwide attention. Actors at different political levels thereby exhibited conflicting understandings of the issue, appropriate responses to it and responsibility to be taken. As linkages were drawn between the perception of the rainforest fires as a global environmental problem, and ramifications for the pursuance of economic interests, the case of the political discussion around the 2019 Amazon rainforest fires is illustrative of valuations of the environment within a Global Political Economy (GPE) context. In order to further understanding of these valuations, this thesis looks into the use of particular conceptions of nature-society relations and spatial scales, which both come forward in political ecology literature. Through a textual analysis of statements by civil society actors, Amazonian countries and foreign governments, it finds that ecological change is made political, and political legitimacy is created or limited for different involved actors, through references to the value of the Amazon rainforest and the scale of this value. This leads to the conclusion that conceptions of nature-society relations and spatial scales reflect and have implications for the ways in which we define environmental problems, politicize the environment and allocate forms of environmental responsibility to different actors.","['Nature-society relations', 'spatial scales', 'political ecology', 'Amazon rainforest', 'forest fires', 'environmental problems', 'environmental responsibility']"

Este proyecto trata de evidenciar el hecho de que, en la actualidad, las plataformas digitales mantienen una relación estrecha con el mundo exterior. Dentro de este orden de ideas, se demuestra como el mapudungun en Facebook contribuye notablemente al activismo mapuche contemporáneo. De este modo, se investigan factores relacionados con el ámbito político, social y cultural de la sociedad chilena. La realización de este trabajo no solamente significa un avance lingüístico, sino también sociopolítico, ya que se presenta información complementaria para la comprensión de los procesos políticos actuales del país. Además, es necesario mencionar que, a día de hoy, dicha cuestión aún no ha sido abordada en su totalidad. Para llevar a cabo este propósito se ofrece, inicialmente, una contextualización del estudio en la que se aborda la correlación de poderes, las estructuras hegemónicas y el conflicto mapuche, de tal forma que destaca un enfoque histórico de los hechos. Posteriormente, se concede un marco teórico y una revisión de la literatura en la que salen a la luz los conceptos más relevantes en relación al activismo digital y las vivencias mapuches en los medios de comunicación. La metodología trata de especificar y justificar el plan de acción, por lo que cada uno de los pasos tomados son clarificados.

Evaluating the ideology of universal emperorship in the foreign policy of the Former Han dynasty,"van Oosten, Ramses",['Dr. Hilde de Weerdt'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Chinese dynasties are often described in terms of “universal emperorship”, because their territory was vast and they had a large influence on the wider region. This has also been applied to the Han dynasty, which is the first major Chinese dynasty. However, there is much evidence suggesting that the Han empire used a more limited notion of empire, which challenges the theory of universal emperorship. Therefore, this paper explores the question: to what extent does the foreign policy of the Han dynasty reflect the principle of universal emperorship? To answer this question, historical evidence about the foreign policy of the Former Han dynasty is analyzed according to three aspects of universal emperorship: political emperorship, geographical emperorship and cultural emperorship. This case study yields the conclusion that the foreign policy of the Han empire does not reflect the theory of universal emperorship. Instead, the Han dynasty accepted the independence of other states, and sought for equal relations with their leaders. This result suggests that the association between Chinese empires and universal emperorship has to be revised.","['History', 'China', 'Empire', 'Ideology']"

Spatial Distribution of Economic Growth in the City Cluster of Chengdu-Chongqing: How the Chinese government pursues it to promote the cluster in East Asian International Production Networks,"Twiss, Jermaine","['Robles, M.T.A.C.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This Masters’ thesis aims to answer the question of how China employs the pursuit of equitably distributed economic growth within the Chengdu-Chongqing city cluster (or shorter: Cheng-Yu cluster) in promoting the cluster in East Asian international production networks (IPNs). A proper and efficient division of labor across multiple locations – when well managed and guided by the government – factors significantly in the success of the city cluster, which is part of IPNs. This thesis intends to contribute to earlier research on the cluster by looking at the geographic differences in terms of development within the cluster. I conclude that the Chinese government envisions the promotion of the Cheng-Yu cluster in East Asian IPNs through the pursuit of equitably distributed economic growth by way of assigning roles to specifically defined cities, but the allocation of roles is very broad and a more well-defined distribution of roles may benefit the equitability of growth distribution and the effective incorporation in IPNs.","['international production networks', 'global production networks', 'IPNs', 'GPNs', 'city clusters', 'spatial distribution', 'Chengdu', 'Chongqing', 'China']"

Kritiek op de journalistiek: een onderzoek naar hoe Nederlandse journalisten omgaan met kritische opmerkingen en hate speech van buitenaf,"Stade, Laurens","['Pleijter, A.R.J.', 'Burger, J.P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De journalistiek ligt de laatste tijd steeds meer onder vuur. Van buitenaf klinken geluiden dat journalisten nepnieuws verspreiden of zich voor het karretje laten spannen als een propagandamachine. Hierdoor neemt de druk op de journalistiek steeds meer toe, waardoor deze zich ook moet verdedigen tegen de kritiek van buitenaf. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen hoe Nederlandse journalisten omgaan met kritiek en haatdragende taal van buitenaf. Om hierachter te komen staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: Op wat voor manier(en) verweren Nederlandse journalisten van nieuwsmedia zich tegen kritische opmerkingen en hate speech van buitenaf? Om deze vraag te beantwoorden zijn elf journalisten van tien verschillende Nederlandse nieuwsmedia een-op-een geïnterviewd. Alle elf de journalisten zijn gevraagd naar hun visies en ervaringen op zes onderdelen: de journalistieke professie, maatschappelijke taken van de journalist, de relatie tot het publiek, de kritiek en soorten kritiek, het omgaan met de kritiek en ten slotte de effecten van de kritiek. Uit de antwoorden zijn verschillende manieren van omgaan met kritiek naar voren gekomen, waarbij meerdere journalisten aangeven dat zij de kritiek makkelijk van zich laten afglijden. Bovendien zijn meerdere journalisten bereid om te reageren op kritiek, al stopt die welwillendheid vaak wanneer er scheldwoorden aan te pas komen.","['Media', 'hate speech', 'journalisten', 'nieuwsmedia']"

European Momentum: Analysing Representations of European Strategic Autonomy in Dutch Politics,"Snijders, Pascal",['Dr. M.E.L. David'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"With the adoption of the European Union Global Strategy in 2016 the EU renewed its quest for attaining strategic autonomy. However, the EU document did not specify what would constitute European strategic autonomy (ESA), so, as is the case with the EU’s external policies, the national perspectives of Member States are its obvious basis. Historically, the Netherlands has been an obstructionist when it came to European security and defence integration due to its Atlanticist position, begging the question: how is European strategic autonomy represented in Dutch politics? To understand the Dutch perspective and positioning regarding ESA, this thesis drew from the field of Critical Geopolitics, conducting an interpretive-explanatory research employing discourse analysis by analysing statements made by party representatives in the Tweede Kamer during the period of 2016-2021. Three distinct schools of thought underpinning the representations of ESA in the Dutch debate. The Sovereigntists are Eurosceptics who present ESA as an attempt to establish a European army and a threat to national sovereignty. The Europeanists actively champion ESA and envision it as an emancipatory project to make the EU able to act independently of the US because it is an increasingly unreliable ally. The Atlanticists present ESA as an opportunity to take responsibility within NATO and improve burden-sharing with the US. This thesis found that the Dutch debate regarding European security policy has substantially Europeanised. While the Atlanticists are still cautious, they no longer take an active obstructionist position, instead adopting Europeanist talking-points from the 90s. Considering this Europeanist momentum, there is potential for the Netherlands to become an active and serious promotor of ambitious European security commitments.","['European Union', 'European Strategic Autonomy', 'the Netherlands', 'Dutch', 'NATO', 'CSDP', 'Common Security and Defence Policy', 'EUGS', 'European Union Global Strategy', 'Atlanticist', 'Europeanist', 'Eurosceptic', 'Identity', 'Representation', 'Discourse', 'Critical Geopolitics']"
An unlikely pivotal state? Japan’s role during the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations,"Davids, Judith",['Dr. Lindsay Black'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis looks at the role of Japan during the negotiations of a large-scale free trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region, namely the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Previously, academic discourse such as the pivotal state theory by Solís and Katada has focused on role of Japan during mega-FTAs. However, most of this research has been focused on Japan during CPTPP negotiations. This thesis looks at Japan’s role within RCEP, as it is the first mega-FTA with China. How does Japan’s influence compare to China during RCEP negotiations? By way of methodological triangulation, this thesis will measure the influence of Japan. While there are limitations, Japan was able to influence some regulations, especially regarding tariff reduction, intellectual property and e-commerce. That being said, while Japan hoped to include India within RCEP, India withdrew in the last stage of negotiations. This is because that Japan’s position within negotiations was hampered among others by its interventionist agricultural lobby. As Japan’s influence within RCEP was limited, it remains an unlikely pivotal state while China’s influence grows. With its analysis, this thesis will contribute to a broader academic discourse on the pivotal state theory, as well as the developments of mega-FTA negotiations in general.","['Japan', 'RCEP', 'pivotal states', 'FTA negotiations']"
All Along the New Silk Road: The Rise of China and its Implications for Southeast Asian Cohesion,"Valden, Daan","['Robles, M.T.A.C.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"China’s contemporary foreign policy project, dubbed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) or the ‘New Silk Road’, which was initiated in 2013 to foster a ‘community of shared destiny’ through infrastructure development, has remained a prominent contemporary issue for Southeast Asian states that are situated in one of China’s key geographical areas of interest for the BRI’s designated ‘Maritime Silk Road’. While on the one hand presenting itself as a solution to the region’s infrastructural challenges through investments, it simultaneously continues to clash with a number of states within Southeast Asia over territorial disputes within the South China Sea (SCS). In this sense, what China has gained in means of hard power, it can be argued to lack in soft power within the current regional order – a power vacuum that the implementation of developments under the banner of the Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI) component of the BRI could potentially resolve for China. In attempting to find an answer to the question “How has China’s 21st Century Maritime Silk Road affected state cohesion within Southeast Asia?”, a comparison has been made between five claimant states within the SCS region (the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and Vietnam) to see how each of their positions has potentially been altered in light of China’s MSRI, and thereby ultimately their overall cohesion. By applying a congruence analysis, the explanatory power of realist and constructivist theoretical approaches have been tested to determine which variables have been decisive in foreign policy decision-making for the observed cases. While the variables related to realism have been concluded to be more decisive for a decrease in cohesion amongst the claimant states for the time being, developments under the banner of the BRI as well as the SCS disputes are in constant flux. Therefore no definitive conclusion can be drawn yet with respect to the direction of regionalism in Southeast Asia and the most suitable theoretical explanation thereof.","['China', 'MSRI', 'BRI', 'OBOR', 'New Silk Road', 'ASEAN', 'South China Sea', 'Southeast Asia']"

This project intends to formulate an identity that is beyond the East-West dichotomy and into an equalization of voices, to formulate some answer to the discourse of gendered identity in a globalizing world. Previous studies on Wŏn Buddhism, a Korean tradition, incorporate different modern perspectives of Buddhist modernism, new religious movements in Asia, and East Asian modernity. The current project stands at the intersection of these fields with a focus on the Wŏn Buddhist understanding of the ultimate nature of reality through the concept of anchored multiplicity. Wŏn Buddhists, in particular female Wŏn Buddhists, emphasize the equalization of spiritual cultivation and give room for a critical discussion on the reality of (gendered) identity. The tradition has been thriving since the start, not exclusively as a practice for devoted Buddhists. The project will contribute to the philosophical selfhood discussions and argue for an identity anchored in the modern global reality, embracing the multiplicity of voices beyond dualistic notions situated in a contemporary tradition and the lived experience of female Wŏn Buddhists.","['Won Buddhism', 'gendered identity', 'non-selfhood', 'multiplicity', 'anchored', 'Korean Buddhism', 'Korean women', 'East Asian Feminism', 'Multicultural feminism', 'Modern Buddhism', 'Modern Buddhist feminism']"

Door deze unieke situatie kan er opnieuw gekeken worden naar concepten zoals nieuwswaarden en uitingen van wetenschappelijke onzekerheid. Deze scriptie kijkt specifiek naar hoe het nieuws over de coronavaccins gepresenteerd wordt op Instagram, een steeds belangrijker nieuwsplatform voor jongeren. Door middel van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse wordt er gekeken naar de nieuwswaarden die aanwezig zijn in het vaccinnieuws op de Instagram van de Nederlandse nieuwssite NU.nl. Ook wordt er gekeken of er sprake is van zogenaamde hedging, te weten taalkundige uitingen van (wetenschappelijke) onzekerheid, iets waar het in de wetenschapsjournalistiek veelal aan ontbreekt. 96 posts over de vaccins uit een tijdsbestek van een half jaar zijn vervolgens geanalyseerd. Hieruit bleek dat de relevante nieuwswaarden vooral bekende nieuwswaarden van socialemedianieuws en wetenschapsnieuws omvatten, zoals positief nieuws en personificatie. Interessant genoeg was sociale relevantie de hoofdmanier waarop het nieuws relevant gemaakt werd, en niet overige zaken zoals economische of politieke relevantie, wat de invloed van de pandemie op de samenleving extra duidelijk maakt. Verrassend genoeg bleek er wel degelijk ruimte te zijn voor uitingen van wetenschappelijke onzekerheid in de Instagram posts, hoewel er wel willekeur was qua wanneer er twijfel aan statements werd toegevoegd en wanneer niet. Hoezeer dit komt door de unieke situatie rondom de pandemie en dus in hoeverre deze bevinding door te trekken is naar wetenschapsjournalistiek in het algemeen is echter onzeker.","['Instagram', 'news analysis', 'inhoudsanalyse', 'hedging', 'wetenschapsjournalistiek', 'COVID-19']"

The primary argument of the AIL was that the annexation devalued the American founding principles, although other arguments, such as race, were raised as well. Earlier works have examined the relation between race and (anti-) imperialism in the context of American imperialism at the end of the nineteenth century, albeit in a broader context. This thesis aims to determine in what ways race was fundamental to the AIL’s views of the annexation of the Philippines. To determine how fundamental race was to these views, this thesis analyses documents and speeches of six AIL members, belonging to three different movements within the AIL: the rights activists, the Social Darwinists, and the white supremacists. These documents show that the perception of race plays a role in structuring the argument of race, yet it also structures other political, administrative, and labor-related arguments. These results show that the perception of race was fundamental in the shaping of several arguments against annexation.","['anti-imperialism', 'Anti-Imperialist League', 'AIL', 'Philippines', 'race']"

Art as Humus: Composting as a Concept and Artistic Practice to Grow Fertile Soil for a Flourishing World,"Mulder, Rosa Marie","['Fedorova, K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis explores how composting can be a fruitful practice and concept in contemporary art. Current artistic practices resonate with the planetary problems that arise when people tend to feel disconnected from soil. There is an increasing awareness that soil is not merely dirt but is in fact essential for human and other life forms on Earth; still, the understanding of soil as a resource prevails. Composting is one way to counter soil-exhausting systems, such as industrial agriculture, and work towards a soil-nourishing approach since composting is the transformative decomposition of organic waste into nutrient-rich humus. Composting offers a means of caring for and relating to soil instead of disconnecting from it. Material and speculative facets of composting can be observed in art and enable to expand and review the agricultural practice and understanding of composting. The material and speculative qualities of artworks can urge a reconsideration of human relations with earth, soil and our planet, by making them sensible and imaginable. Therefore, the question that guides this thesis is as follows: how can we humans re-imagine our relationships with earth through material and speculative forms of composting in contemporary art? Composting entails a web of interdependent relations between humans and many non-human actors, such as microorganisms and the environment. In her book Staying with the Trouble (2016), the feminist biologist and philosopher Donna Haraway engages with this idea of composting in a metaphorical way to imagine the world as one big compost pile. Hence, it is in this composting world that humans must learn other ways to be part of planet Earth’s web of relations. The material aspects of composting in art are examined primarily on the basis of the exhibition M for Membrane (2020) by the artist TJ Shin at the Wave Hill Public Garden & Cultural Center in New York City. The speculative possibilities of composting are mainly investigated through the artwork Untilled (2012) by the artist Pierre Huyghe at dOCUMENTA (13) in Kassel, Germany. In dialogue with complementary theories, the analyses of contemporary artworks aim to develop ways to replenish Haraway’s concept of composting and substantiate the idea that art can be fertile soil for a flourishing world: art as humus.","['Composting', 'Contemporary art', 'Donna Haraway', 'Human-earth relations', 'New Materialism', 'Natureculture', 'Speculative art', 'Pierre Huyghe', 'TJ Shin']"

This global interest causes the need to translate the series’ English language into other languages. The use of language that is specific to the drag community and gay community, one that is tied to both gender and sexuality, as explored in this thesis, causes the translator to have to deal with community-specific words. A fairly recent phenomenon, the concept of translating this community-specific language and its translation into Dutch has not yet been extensively discussed. This thesis aims to find patterns that are visible in the translation procedures used (based on the concept of translation procedures by Newmark) for the translation of language tied to the drag and gay community, for the Dutch Netflix subtitles of three episodes of RuPaul’s Drag Race. Some of this language is maintained in the audiovisual translation, while other language is modified or removed. This modification or removal might possibly cause a different viewing experience for the Dutch viewer as compared to a viewer who only uses the source text, and causes a loss of meaning of cultural elements related to the drag community.","['drag', 'drag queen', 'drag queens', 'drag language', 'drag vocabulary', 'drag slang', 'gay culture', 'gay language', 'gay vocabulary', 'gay slang', 'queer culture', 'queer language', 'queer vocabulary', 'queer slang', 'reality television', 'audiovisual translation', 'subtitling', 'translation procedures', 'RuPaul’s Drag Race', 'gender', 'gender expression', 'subtitling slang']"

The Influence of Migration History on the Identity of Hindostani in The Netherlands.","Mondeel, Lisa-Marie (Romy)","['Meel, P.J.J.', 'Schrikker, A.F.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this interdisciplinary thesis, I use history and anthropology to research the influence of migration history on the identity construct of Hindostani people in the Netherlands. The work is anthropological because I created data by interviewing 23 participants about their lives and experiences, and historical because I used a framework of scholars who have researched the complex fields of identity, colonialism, migration, and transnational history or have specifically researched Hindostani people and their history. Combining these datasets, I present a case study that goes in depth to find out what the influence of colonial migration is on Hindostani people in a ‘postcolonial’ society such as the Netherlands. The conclusion is a careful but meaningful one, as it offers insights into both the people I interviewed and the society in which they live. This study shows that identity is so complex and personal that migration history has divergent meaning and effect on the lives of individual Hindostanis, so that even pointers such as age and gender cannot indicate the importance of that history to a Hindostani person. The only exception to this was religion, as religious participants ascribed more meaning to their migration history. Their history played a large part in the constructing of their identity and in the raising of their children. Lastly, I argue that both interdisciplinary and microhistory, even though small-scale, are key to historical research, especially of colonial history, by creating data and writing with the people who are the embodiment of that history.","['Hindostani', 'case study', 'the Netherlands', 'Suriname', 'India', 'colonial history', 'migration', 'identity', 'transnationalism', 'anthropology', 'microhistory']"

UNEARTHING THE GENESIS OF PEACEBUILDING IN SOMALIA: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THREE DIFFERENT PEACEBUILDING PROCESSES.,"Abdi, Abdullahi",['Professor Stefano Bellucci and Dr. Karin Smith'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Over the last 30 years, Somalia has experienced a civil war that has torn the country apart. Countless civilians have lost their lives, almost all public institutions have been destroyed, and large segments of the Somali society have fled abroad to seek shelter (Mohamud 2020, 115). The country experienced a Hobbesian era of anarchy that symbolized what Robert Rotberg classified as “a rare and extreme version of a failed state. (…). a mere geographical expression, a black hole [where] there is dark energy, but the forces of entropy have overwhelmed the radiance that hitherto provided some semblance of order and other vital political goods to the inhabitants (no longer the citizens)” (Rotberg 2004, 9). To end Somalia’s acute state of anarchy and its protracted inter-tribal warfare’s, international multilateral organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and Somalia’s neighbouring countries have sought to mediate relations between the contesting factions that were exercising inter-tribal politics within the country. Three major peace and reconciliation conferences sponsored by the international community have been held to resolve the Somali impasse: the first summit took place in Borama (Somaliland) in 1993, the second in Arta (Djibouti) in 2000, and the third in Mbagathi (Kenya) in 2003. The Borama conference in particular is what led to the self-determination of Somaliland, which is not the theme of this thesis. The topic of this research is to look at the differences between these peace processes. By comparing the nature of these three conferences it is possible to identify practices and models of peacebuilding for Somalia, a country that is seeking stability to this day. Despite these costly peace-making conferences as it cost the United Nations (UN) and donor countries to spend enormous sums of money and resources, Somalia remains fragmented and unstable, with the current federal government barely able to control its capital, Mogadishu (Ingiriis 2020, 10). Through a top-down peace-making approach, the so-called international community (IC) has attempted to solve disputes between powerful actors without incorporating local values, history, expertise, and the everyday experiences of the wider Somali population into the peacemaking processes and ultimately these efforts have failed to produce effective dispute resolution (Ansems 2011, 99). Given these failures, this research attempts to investigate the underlying factors that explain the UN’s liberal peacebuilding approach (which applies a predefined conceptual top-down framework that neglects Somalia’s everyday experiences) and why it failed to bring forth any genuine reconciliation (Glawion 2020, 66). Due to the disconnect between the top-down peacebuilding framework and Somalia and democracy, this paper investigates how an alternative framework called the “pragmatic peacebuilding approach” which moves beyond traditional liberal peace, can facilitate a more practical approach to peacebuilding that is sustainable, reconciliatory and context-specific. This thesis will endeavour to test the following research question and hypothesis. The research question is quite straightforward: the UN’s top-down peacebuilding process has been taking place in Somalia for more than 20 years, why then have the UN’s efforts failed to yield plausible peace results in Somalia? The answer to the research question is based on the following hypothesis: in Somalia, top-down peacebuilding has prevailed over grassroots-level peacebuilding and this is why peacebuilding in Somalia did not succeed. The hypothesis is based on both a historical account of what has happened in Somalia, including Somaliland, since the early 1990s and on the review of the literature on the Somali problem as well as on peacebuilding in general. Somaliland achieved peace vis-à-vis a grassroots model of peacebuilding, while in the rest of Somalia the UN used a top-down approach.","['Bottom-up Peacebuilding', 'Liberal Peace Theory', 'Federalism', 'Civil wars', 'Tribalism', 'Somalia', 'Somaliland']"

Debating the Unity of Virtues in the second century: Following ‘antakolouthein’ from Alexander of Aphrodisias to Plotinus,"Vlis, Anouk van der","['Haas, F.A.J. de']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"The ethical writings of Alexander of Aphrodisias and of Plotinus both contain discussions on the thesis of the mutual implication of the virtues, which states that having one virtue implies having them all. Their discussions are furthermore marked by the same term, namely antakolouthein (‘to be reciprocally implied’). Combined with the fact that there are other already established connections between Alexander and Plotinus, these facts raise the interesting question of to what degree Plotinus participates in the debate on the mutual implication of the virtues as is visible in Alexander of Aphrodisias’ Ethical Problems and Mantissa? This thesis provides an answer to this question by comparing both philosophers on the topic of mutual implication of the virtues and by pointing out the differences and similarities. The debate on the mutual implication and the different perspectives will be discussed, as well as the Stoics as opponents in the debate, Aristotle as background to Alexander and the origin of the debate and of the term antakolouthein.","['ancient philosophy', 'virtues', 'unity of virtues', 'antakolouthein', 'Alexander of Aphrodisias', 'Plotinus', 'Stoics', 'Aristotle']"

Zijn zij de stad? Hyperlokale media en sociale cohesie in de gemeente Middelburg,"Maas, Pieter Cornelis van der","['Jong, J.C. de']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Met de opkomst van gratis nieuwsmedia en het internet zijn veel lokale media in het gedrang gekomen. Ondertussen hebben hyperlokale media een nieuwe manier van informeren, verbinden en controleren ontdekt. Deze media nemen de deels weggevallen functies van lokale media waar en richten zich met name op de verbindende functie. Vaak gaat het om initiatieven die klein en gratis beginnen en opereren in een geografisch afgebakend gebied als een wijk of een dorp. In veel gevallen worden ze gerund door individuen en speelt internet een grote rol in het bereiken van hun publiek. In deze scriptie is met name de verbindende functie van de hyperlocals onderzocht. Op welke manier stimuleren ze de sociale cohesie in hun gemeenschap? Het onderzoek is een casestudy van twee hyperlokale media in Middelburg: Wij zijn de stad en Middelburgers. Een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse en twee diepte-interviews met redacteuren van beide media geven antwoord op de onderzoeksvraag: Hoe draagt de berichtgeving van hyperlokale media bij aan de sociale cohesie in Middelburg? Om dit te onderzoeken is gebruik gemaakt van een bestaande theorie, opgesteld door Delhey en Dragolov (2016) en later geconcretiseerd door Leupold et al. (2016). Deze theorie onderscheidt negen dimensies, in feite manieren waarop media sociale cohesie onder hun publiek kunnen bevorderen. Voor het kwantitatieve deel is er een inhoudsanalyse uitgevoerd op het werk van Wij zijn de stad en Middelburgers, beide gevestigd in de Zeeuwse hoofdstad Middelburg. Voor de casestudy zijn 80 artikelen van deze twee hyperlokale media geanalyseerd. Om te zien wat motivatie van de auteurs achter het gebruik van de dimensies is, zijn er ook twee interviews afgenomen met de huidige eindredacteuren van beide media. De resultaten wezen uit dat sociale cohesie inderdaad een belangrijk onderdeel van de berichtgeving van de hyperlokale media is. De redacteuren zijn bewust bezig met het verbinden van het publiek en hebben daar hun eigen visies op. Niet elke dimensie die Leupold et al. (2016) onderscheiden, is even relevant voor de redacteurs. Dat is terug te zien in de inhoudsanalyse. Ook tussen beide media zijn verschillen waarneembaar. Voor Wij zijn de stad is identificatie erg belangrijk, dat wil zeggen het schrijven over onderwerpen die typerend zijn voor de regio en waar het publiek zich dus in kan herkennen. Bij Middelburgers vertrouwen in instellingen een grote rol speelt. Deze dimensie gaat met name over het functioneren van de lokale politiek.","['journalistiek', 'hyperlokale media', 'sociale cohesie', 'Middelburg']"
