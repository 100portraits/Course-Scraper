The Field in Recovery: Functional and Societal Recovery amongst Patients with a Psychotic Disorder,"van den Berg, Rick","['Bernice van Aken', 'Anne Cuperus']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Patients with a psychotic disorder generally seem to have difficulties recovering, especially on functional and societal ground. Due to cognitive impairments and experienced stigma, the psychosis population feel excluded from society as a result of discrimination. This study aimed to get a better insight of functional and societal recovery and their association amongst patients with a psychotic disorder. In addition, it was investigated whether degree of importance regarding social roles had a moderating effect on the association. Functional recovery lacked consensus on terminology and assessments, but this study used executive functioning as a point of reference. Societal recovery was described as counteracting the public stigma on mental illness and improving the position and rights of (ex-)clients within society. Methods: This study included 237 participants (18-65 years) with psychosis as their main diagnosis through Flexible Assertive Community Treatment teams or Early Intervention Psychosis teams in healthcare institutions throughout the Netherlands. Participants signed informed consent prior participating in the study. The study design was cross-sectional, where data at baseline was used for the analyses. The data was gathered through (self-reported) questionnaires that measured executive functioning (functional recovery), and satisfaction scores on fulfilling various social roles (societal recovery). Two multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess whether the level of executive functioning was associated with satisfaction scores. A binary logistic regression was performed to assess executive functioning in employment. Results: No effects were found between self-reported executive functioning and satisfaction scores. The degree of importance regarding social roles was found to have a direct relationship with satisfaction scores. Surprisingly, self-reported executive functioning did not seem to be associated with employment. Conclusion: Functional and societal recovery were not related and degree of importance regarding social roles was directly related to societal recovery. Self-reported executive functioning did not differ amongst those who were employed and unemployed. A better consensus on terminology and measurements needs to be realized for functional and societal recovery to acquire a better assessment of the psychosis population. Further research should include a more diverse range of patients in the psychosis population for better generalizability","['Psychotic Disorder', 'Schizophrenia', 'Recovery', 'Functional Recovery', 'Societal Recovery', 'Executive Functioning']"
Privately or publicly pausing one’s e-group participation when feeling overloaded in an e-group? A matter of keeping or losing others’ sympathy,"Laat, Marjolein de","['Wit, A.P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study investigated the impact of fellow e-group members on the intention to privately pause and on the intention to publicly pause one’s e-group participation if one feels overloaded due to their e-group participation. We hypothesized that subjective social norms, as one of the components within the predictive framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB, Ajzen, 1991), would have less impact on the intention to privately pause than on the intention to publicly pause one’s e-group participation. Our results suggest that more people intend to cope with overload by privately pausing rather than by publicly pausing their e-group participation. At the same time, they assume that fellow e-group members think more negatively about one privately pausing their e-group participation and more positively about one publicly pausing their e-group participation. Unexpectedly, subjective social norms appear to have less impact on the intention to publicly pause than on the intention to privately pause one’s e-group participation. Instead, anticipated negative feelings at an interpersonal level (i.e., the attitudinal component of TPB), such as the feelings nervousness in the e-group and uncertainty about being liked by fellow e-group members, seem to have more impact on the intention to publicly pause one’s e-group participation. Thus, this study suggests that fellow egroup members do matter for both intentions, as more people who are coping with overload intend to keep it private when they care less about fellow e-group members’ negative thoughts about privately pausing one’s e-group participation. At the same time, less people intend to publicly cope with overload when they anticipate to lose others’ sympathy if they would publicly show their way of coping. The implications of these results for studying interpersonal behaviors that affect people’s well-being are discussed.","['Overload', 'e-group participation']"
Gender differences in mathematics anxiety: implicit and explicit measurements,"Heemskerk, Jasmijn","['Sikkema-de Jong, M.T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Developmental Psychopathology in Education and Child Studies (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"The gender gap in STEM majors and careers is very prominent and alarming (Beilock & Maloney, 2015). Students are more likely to avoid STEM careers when they show higher levels of Mathematics Anxiety (MA; Ahmed, 2018). The current study investigates the difference in Mathematics Anxiety between male and female students in their first year of the preacademic educational track (HAVO, atheneum and gymnasium) in secondary school in the Netherlands. The Numerical Dot-Probe Task (NDPT) is a computerized task that is based on attentional bias and less susceptible to bias than self-report questionnaires. (Rubinsten, Eidlin, Wohl, & Akibli, 2015). Related concepts to MA that will be controlled for are; mathematical achievement, general anxiety and working memory. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling, the final sample consisted of seven students. Using the adapted t-test, z-scores of all participants were compared in order to answer the research question (Crawford, Garthwaite, & Wood, 2010). 100% of girls and 20% of boys showed higher levels of MA when looking at their scores on the self-report questionnaires compared to their score on the NDPT. Overall, the girls’ MA score was overestimated and the boys’ MA score was underestimated. However, this effect was not strong enough to result in an overrepresentation of girls and an underrepresentation of boys in the population of children with high levels of MA when looking at the self-report questionnaires. Results suggested that the prominent gender gap in STEM studies might not be due to gender differences in MA. Due to the smaller sample size, it is important that these findings are replicated in future studies using bigger samples. Stereotype threat is a variable that could explain the STEM gender gap and should thus be included in these future studies.","['gender differences', 'numerical dot-probe task', 'mathematics anxiety', 'mathematical achievement', 'general anxiety', 'working memory', 'preacademic educational track', 'secondary school']"

This thesis aims to research the Committee on the Rights of the Child’s influence on compliance of member states with the objectives of the Convention. Compliance with objectives on the minimum age of criminal responsibility in juvenile justice in Denmark shall be analysed through a single-case study. The theoretical expectation is that through interactions with the member state, the Committee has an agenda-setting influence on the domestic policy-making process, which in turn increases compliance. The research finds that when the member state finds itself in a condition of non-compliance with a particular objective, that the Committee’s monitoring and reporting mechanism provides an agenda-setting function and opportunity for Danish parliamentarians to initiate policy that increases compliance.","['Convention', 'human rights', ""children's rights"", 'Denmark', 'treaty', 'agenda-setting', 'UNCRC', 'Convention on the Rights of the Child', 'juvenile justice', 'MACR', 'minimum age of criminal responsibility']"
The Artemis Accords and space weaponization: A commons approach,"Marel, Maarten van der","['Kabasakal, D.', 'Hagen, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Artemis Accords are an international agreement first drafted by NASA and the US government that aim towards establishing a framework for civil space activities by civil space agencies regarding the Moon, Mars, asteroids and comets. The Accords have been signed by multiple states, in particular those that are willing to play a role in the US-led Artemis Program for renewed human spaceflight to the Moon. The Accords have been controversial among experts in the field of space governance. Experts have claimed that the Artemis Accords do not respect space as a commons and that the Accords have important shortcomings that hamper its ability to facilitate sustainable space governance. Others have primarily criticized the Artemis Accords for the tensions it has increased between the US and states like Russia or the People's Republic of China, as some believe the US are actively trying to influence the governance of space in their favour. Some fear that this can lead to attempts to overtly weaponize space. This research aims to look at both of these criticisms, by first assessing to what extent the Artemis Accords comply with or violate the principles associated with sustainable governance of a commons and looking at the Accords and its contents in detail. Then, the effects this has on the weaponization of space will be considered and discussed in order to better understand how the Artemis Accords are influencing the weaponization of space.","['Space', 'Commons', 'Ostrom', 'Artemis', 'Accords', 'Artemis Accords', 'Weaponization', 'Space Weaponization', 'Design Principles', 'Outer Space', 'Space Policy', 'CPR', 'Space Politics', 'Moon', 'Moon Policy', 'Moon Politics', 'Lunar Policy', 'Lunar Politics']"

Does intra-party democracy affect the geographic representativeness of political parties? A look at candidate selection methods in the Netherlands between 2002-2021,"van Doeselaar, Jasper",['S.P. Otjes'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis we test the claim that intra-party democracy, measured as the inclusiveness of candidate selection, leads to less diverse candidate lists. Previously, this area of research has often conceptualised diversity in the form of women’s representation. To test whether previous findings also apply to other forms of descriptive representation, this thesis considers the geographic representativeness of parties. To do this, the Netherlands has been chosen as an ideal case due to its electoral system, which works as a single nationwide district. Twelve parties and seven elections between 2002 and 2021 were analysed with a multilevel linear regression model. The results suggest that inclusive candidate selection methods do not have a relevant effect on the geographic representativeness of parties. One finding is that rural parties are generally more geographically representative than urban parties. However, it remains unclear whether differences between urban or rural parties can be explained by levels of intra-party democracy. For further research, it is suggested to include more data on rural parties.","['intra-party democracy', 'intraparty democracy', 'candidate selection methods', 'inclusiveness', 'selectorates', 'geographic representation', 'geographical representation', 'descriptive representation']"

The Effects of Integrated Palliative Care on Patients with COPD and their Informal Caregivers,"Vekemans, Enisa","['Cuperus, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Chronic pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Even though COPD is a common chronic disease, patients that suffer from this disease do not receive palliative care as often as patients with other diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to broaden knowledge about the effectiveness of palliative care interventions for patients with COPD and their informal caregivers. This study focused on the effect of an integrated palliative care intervention on quality of life and spiritual wellbeing of the patient and the satisfaction with care of their informal caregiver. The eight participating hospital regions in the Netherlands were randomly allocated to the intervention or control condition by an independent statistician. Patients in the control condition (N = 97) received care as usual and patients in the intervention condition (N = 89) received integrated palliative care implemented by trained health professionals. The patients and their informal caregivers filled in questionnaires at multiple moments; baseline, three months after inclusion and six months after inclusion. Based on earlier research we hypothesized that the quality of life and spiritual wellbeing of the patients in the intervention group would improve over time. With respect to the informal caregivers, we hypothesized that their satisfaction with the hospital care and the care of the general practitioner would improve over time for the intervention group. Linear mixed model analysis was used to compare the control and intervention group over time. Results did not show an effect of the intervention on quality of life, spiritual wellbeing, and satisfaction with care over time. However, findings of this paper do contribute to a broadening of the knowledge about the effects of palliative care interventions for patients with COPD. This is important, as palliative care for patients with COPD is not as well studied as palliative care for other patient groups. Further research on palliative care for patients with COPD is recommended.","['COPD', 'palliative care', 'quality of life', 'satisfaction with care', 'spiritual wellbeing']"

Subspace Independent Component Analysis (SICA) A comparison of methods for cluster analysis in high dimensionality.,"Rozema, Lude","['Durieux, J.', 'Wilderjans, T.F.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Clustering algorithms are important for data mining, and K-means is one of the most well-known clustering algorithms currently available. In cases in which data are high-dimensional, however, mere application of K-means to a data set may fail to uncover clusters due to presence of masking variables, the curse of dimensionality, and difficulties in interpretation of the obtained solution. A commonly used work-around is to apply dimension reduction to the data prior to performing cluster analysis, a practice called Tandem Analysis (TA). A vulnerability of TA is that the applied dimension reduction is not guaranteed to preserve cluster structure present in the original data, jeopardising the usefulness of subsequent cluster analysis. Multiple authors have provided algorithms that reduce dimensionality of a data set and perform cluster analysis on the reduced data, either in a sequential fashion or a simultaneous fashion, all aiming to find suitable low-dimensional representations of data while also keeping cluster structures intact. In this thesis, a novel approach to reducing dimensionality and performing cluster analysis on the low dimensional representation of the data - called SICA - is described and thoroughly tested in two systematically manipulated simulation studies and applied to three empirical data applications. Results show that SICA is a computationally efficient algorithm well able to extract components from the original data that preserve cluster structures, but that performance depends on characteristics of the data and the model of data generation. In addition, the correctness and validity of the clusterings obtained through SICA is high, although it does not always outperform currently available methods in this regard and is dependent on the same characteristics of the data and model generation as the other algorithms. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.","['Cluster analysis', 'High dimensionality', 'Independent Component Analysis', 'K-means', ""Multimodality, Alzheimer's Disease"", 'Sensory Processing Sensitivity']"

Coping strategieën van adolescenten met selectief mutisme,"IJlst, Leonie","['Nibbering, N.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Research shows that maladaptive coping is an important factor in the development of psychopathology. Selective mutism has recently been classified as an anxiety disorder in the DSM-V. From this perspective, it is relevant to explore coping in adolescents because little is known about the use of coping strategies of adolescents with SM when they are anxious. Insight in coping will also provide information on the non-speaking behavior of this group. Research on this subject is scarce. In total 79 adolescents from the Netherlands and Belgium participated in this explorative research study. The sample consisted of 34 adolescents with SM and 45 adolescents without psychopathology, in the age 9 to 18. The aim of the present study is to examine which coping strategies are used by adolescents with SM when anxious, and how this differs from adolescents without psychopathology. The Feel-KJ, a self-report questionnaire, was used to research this question. The effect of age was included as a covariate. The results show that adolescents with SM use less adaptive coping strategies and more maladaptive coping strategies, with the exception of aggression, compared to their peers without psychopathology. Age also has an effect on the use of maladaptive coping strategies, but this effect is small. This knowledge contributes to the existing research in which evidence has been found for a link between the use of maladaptive coping strategies and psychopathology. It is important to conduct further (experimental) research to confirm these findings and to examine a possible causal relationship. The present study gives insight in how adolescents with SM cope with fear in comparison to adolescents without psychopathology. Information about adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies can be implemented in interventions and treatments so that adolescents with SM can learn to adaptively cope with fear.","['Selective mutism', 'Maladaptive coping', 'Adaptive coping', 'Coping strategies']"
Identifying dementia in individuals with intellectual disability,"Tobin, Ruth",['Dr. Anne Cuperus'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: This study examined the ability of the Short Form Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (SFIQCODE), to identify dementia in individuals with intellectual disability. Standard screening tools to assess for dementia, are not suitable for use with this population, more sensitive dementia screening tools are needed. This study also examined if participant levels of depression are linked to cognitive decline, and if there is a relationship between cognitive decline and difficulties performing activities of daily living (ADL). Methods: This study forms part of a longitudinal, observational study. Data gathered over two periods named Waves 3 and 4, included 740 participants over 40 years of age along with their carers who acted as respondents. ROC curve analysis was carried out to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the SFIQCODE to identify dementia in individuals with intellectual disability. Correlational analysis examined SFIQCODE scores in relation to levels of depression and binary logistic regression examined the association between SFIQCODE scores and ability to perform ADL. Results: ROC curve analysis of SFIQCODE scores in Wave 3 indicated sensitivity = 0.77 and specificity = 0.86 of the SFIQCODE to correlate with a dementia diagnosis at cut-off score of 3.3 and sensitivity = 0.60 and specificity = 0.96 at a cut-off of 4. In Wave 4, for a cut-off score of 3.3, the ROC curve analysis indicated sensitivity = 0.35 and specificity = 0.85. At a cut-off of 4, sensitivity = 0.25 and specificity = 0.94. In Wave 3 correlational analysis found r(135) = .33, p < .001 between carer reported depression and SFIQCODE scores. In Wave 4 the correlation between carer reported depression scores and SFIQCODE scores was r(50) = .26, p = .062. Logistic regression identified non-significant associations between SFIQCODE scores and ADL. Conclusions: The SFIQCODE has potential for identifying dementia in individuals with intellectual disability. The correlation between carer reported depression and SFIQCODE scores within waves suggests depression and cognitive decline may be linked in individuals with intellectual disability. No relationship was found between SFIQCODE scores and ability to perform ADL. This study identifies the importance of all-encompassing health-care for individuals with intellectual disability.","['dementia', 'intellectual disability']"
"Freedom of Movement, Activity and Quality of Life in Nursing Home Residents with Dementia: A Case Study","Willems, Monique","['Gawehns, D.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: There is growing evidence that freedom of movement inside and outside the nursing home has a positive effect on the Quality of Life (QoL) of people with dementia. The participants in this study were living in nursing homes with either ‘freedom of movement’ or ‘restricted movement’. The level of physical activity, QoL, and how these differed in the two nursing home situations was examined. Furthermore, it was tested whether there was a correlation between physical activity level and QoL for both nursing home situations. Method: A questionnaire with nine subscales was used to measure QoL for people with dementia (QUALIDEM). The Maastricht Electronic Daily Life Observation (MEDLO) tool was used to measure physical activity levels during social activities. Results: For this study 81 nursing home patients with dementia were included (mean age ‘restricted movement’, 84 years; 33 females [69%]; mean age ‘freedom of movement’, 83 years; 20 females [83%]). Both QoL and activity level data was available for six participants from the ‘restricted movement’ situation and thirteen participants from the ‘freedom of movement’ situation. No significant differences between the two situations for QoL and activity level were found. Also, no significant correlation was found between activity level and QoL for the two situations. As a consequence of this non-significant correlation, it was decided that the moderation by situation would not be tested. Conclusion: Participants did not show a difference in activity level or QoL between the two nursing home situations (‘freedom of movement’, ‘restricted movement’). A relation between activity level and QoL could not be confirmed for either nursing home situation. Additional research is needed with a sample size providing sufficient statistical power. Furthermore, mediation needs to be included in the hypothesized model with depression and activities of daily life (ADL) as mediators for QoL.","['activity level', 'QoL', 'dementia', 'freedom of movement', 'nursing home residents']"

Verschil tussen mannen en vrouwen in landmarkgeheugen: De invloed van navigatiestijl,"Winkler, Bente","['Vogelsang, D.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Er is in de huidige literatuur al veel te vinden betreffende eventuele verschillen tussen mannen en vrouwen. In deze studie is hier ook onderzoek naar gedaan en dan specifiek over het verschil in landmarkgeheugen na een navigatietaak tussen mannen en vrouwen. Dit is onderzocht door de deelnemers drie minuten door een virtuele omgeving te laten navigeren waarin objecten stonden, waarna een geheugentaak over de objecten is uitgevoerd. Eerder onderzoek heeft laten zien dat vrouwen bij het navigeren gebruik maken van de landmarkstrategie (ten opzichte van de mannen die gebruik maken van de oriëntatiestrategie). Door het gebruik van de landmarkstrategie was de verwachting dat vrouwen hoger zouden scoren op de landmarkgeheugentaak ten opzichte van de mannen. De resultaten lieten echter een ander patroon zien dan deze hypothese. Mannen scoorden namelijk significant hoger dan de vrouwen op de landmarkgeheugentaak. Deze resultaten zijn niet beïnvloed door een algemeen beter geheugen van de mannelijke deelnemers ten opzichte van de vrouwelijke deelnemers, omdat er geen significant verschil was in de scores tussen de seksen op de controle geheugentaak. Er zijn wel andere factoren die mogelijk van invloed zijn geweest op de resultaten, zoals onder andere het kleine aantal deelnemers in dit onderzoek. Het is dan ook interessant om de analyse te repliceren als meer participanten het onderzoek hebben uitgevoerd, omdat deze resultaten de huidige consensus over dit onderwerp in de literatuur tegenspreken. De resultaten zouden dan eventueel meer nuance in de literatuur kunnen aanbrengen.",
the roles of presence and arousal on landmark memory in a virtual reality experiment,"Sjoerdsma, Jaimy","['Vogelsang, D.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"After the introduction of virtual reality (VR) in the entertainment industry, there has been increased interest in the potential applications of this relatively new technology within scientific, educational, and clinical fields. However, the effects of various psychological factors on human cognition within VR remain largely uncertain. Two examples of these factors are sense of presence and arousal, and their associations with memory performance within the context of VR. The aim of the current study was to further examine the associations between sense of presence, arousal, and landmark memory The current study included a healthy sample of 11 participants (6 male, 5 female) with a mean age of 22.91 years old (SD = 3.18). Main analysis consisted of two simple regression analyses. The first of these simple regression analyses tested whether self-evaluated arousal experienced while exploring a virtual environment predicted landmark memory performance, while the second simple regression analysis tested whether the sense of presence experienced while exploring a virtual environment predicted landmark memory performance, with the expectation that both arousal and presence significantly predicted landmark memory. Contrary to expectations based on current literature, results showed that neither self-evaluated arousal experienced while exploring a virtual environment, nor the sense of presence experienced while exploring a virtual environment significantly predicted landmark memory performance. The findings of the current study fail to partially replicate previous studies. However, it should be noted that the current study included an insufficient sample size, and thus, these pilot results should be interpreted with caution.","['sense of presence, arousal, virtual reality, virtual environments, immersion, desktop-VR, landmark memory,']"

The Role of Rejection Sensitivity in Negative Social Learning,"Neuteboom, Lisette","['Kortink, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In social situations, people can experience social rejection. Based on these sorts of feedback, people update their self-evaluations. This feedback-based social learning processes can be biased. Rejection sensitivity (RS) is a cognitive system where people already expect rejection and overreact to it. RS is associated with socio-emotional disorders, such as depression or anxiety. More knowledge about RS in biased social learning could help us approach these socio-emotional disorders more targeted. In a reinforcement-learning environment, participants (n = 151, mean age = 20.44) were asked to predict acceptance or rejection from their peers, based on personal statements on their own social-media profile. These peers were actually not real, but set on giving acceptance in amounts of 85%, 70%, 30% and 15%. The current study researched RS in negative social learning processes to see if it could be linked with increased negative social learning. The link between RS and recalled peer acceptance, and RS and expectations of peer acceptance before the task was also examined. The results show that there is no significant correlation between both RS and negative social learning, and RS and recalling peer acceptance. A significant negative correlation was found between RS and expected peer acceptance. More research is needed to support these findings. Suggested are studies that examine how fast people adjust their expectations to be accepted on trial-to-trial basis.",
Financiële stress en vermijding: De veelbelovende rol van schaamte veerkracht.,"Bouman, Jip","['Seip, E.C.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek is er gekeken naar hoe vermijdende neigingen geassocieerd met schaamte omgebogen kunnen worden tot meer probleemgerichte neigingen. Er is gefocust op een interventie die betrekking heeft op de communicatie van schuldeisers richting hun cliënten. Het doel hiervan was het vergroten van de bereidheid tot contact. Deze interventie werd uitgevoerd door het manipuleren van componenten van schaamte; machteloosheid, verstikking en isolatie, gebaseerd op de schaamte veerkracht theorie van Brown (2016). Uit de componenten van schaamte werden vier condities opgesteld. Een controle conditie, waar geen manipulatie heeft plaatsgevonden, een conditie waar verstikking is verminderd, een conditie waar macht is verhoogd en een conditie waar verstikking is verminderd en macht is verhoogd. Uit de resultaten bleek, zoals verwacht, dat participanten in de interventie waar macht was gemanipuleerd meer controle over de situatie ervaarden en daardoor sneller bereid waren om tot contact te komen, vergeleken met de controlegroep en groepen waar andere interventies uitgevoerd waren. De eerste hypothese veronderstelde dat het verminderen van gevoelens van verstikking zal leiden tot een verhoging van de bereidheid tot contact vergeleken met de controlegroep, de hypothese niet aangenomen. De tweede hypothese veronderstelde dat het vergroten van ervaren macht zal leiden tot een verhoging van bereidheid tot contact, vergeleken met de controlegroep. Deze hypothese is wel bevestigd, er is een significant verschil gevonden in het verschil van ervaren macht tussen de controlegroep en de groep waar ervaren macht was vergroot. De derde hypothese stelde dat het verminderen van gevoelens van verstikking en het vergroten van ervaren macht zal leiden tot een verhoging van de bereidheid tot contact, vergeleken met de controlegroep. Hoewel er een trend is gevonden, is het effect niet significant en is de hypothese niet aangenomen. De vierde hypothese stelde dat het vergroten van ervaren macht en het verminderen van gevoelens van verstikking zal leiden tot een hogere bereidheid tot het leggen van contact, tegenover een interventie waar alleen het verminderen van gevoelens van verstikking is toegepast of waar ervaren macht is vergroot het effect was niet significant en de hypothese is niet aangenomen. Uit dit onderzoek hebben we kunnen concluderen dat het vergroten van ervaren macht de bereidheid tot contact vergroot in de communicatie van schuldeisers tot schuldenaars.",
Attachment Styles: The Cardiac Response to Social Rejection Feedback,"Heemskerck van Beest, Mila van","['Kortink, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social relationships are vitally important to such an extent that social rejection is processed by the brain as a threat to survival. Studies found a pronounced cardiac slowing as a response to social rejection potentially messaging feelings of hurt. The most pronounced cardiac slowing was found when social rejection feedback came as a surprise. Attachment styles seem to influence the way people respond to social threat. Since people who score high on attachment related anxiety and avoidance are deemed to be more sensitive to social rejection, this study examined the relationship between attachment related anxiety and avoidance and the cardiac response to unexpected social rejection. Sixty-one undergraduate students (mean age = 20.50 years) participated in the SELF-Profile paradigm, which consists of an evaluation task in which participants expressed their expectancies about being liked or disliked by other peers. Subsequently, they received actual feedback messaging acceptance or rejection. The cardiac response was recorded by using interbeat interval measurement (IBI), comparing expected and unexpected acceptance and rejection with each other among attachment related anxiety and avoidance. As predicted, unexpected rejection provoked the most pronounced cardiac slowing compared to the other four conditions. Against expectations a significant negative relationship was found between attachment related anxiety and cardiac slowing to unexpected social rejection, indicating no cardiac slowing or even cardiac speeding. Although the cardiac responses with respect to unexpected rejection confirm existing studies, the negative relationship found rather contradicts existing studies and gives rise to the need for further research.

People who score high on attachment-related avoidance and/or attachment-related anxiety may experience a biased form of social feedback learning. In this study the effects of attachment-related anxiety and attachment-related avoidance on positive and negative social feedback learning were examined. 165 undergraduate students with an age between 18 and 25 participated in the SELF-Profile task, that was used to measure social feedback learning (mean age = 20.50). In this task participants received social evaluative feedback from four peers who each gave a different predetermined percentage of positive feedback (Peer 1: 85%, Peer 2: 70%, Peer 3: 30% and Peer 4: 15%). Attachment was measured with the ECR-R. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to test whether there was a social learning effect during the SELF-Profile task. Subsequently Pearson correlations were used to examine the relations between attachment and social feedback learning. Results showed a significant social learning effect. No significant Pearson correlations were found, which means that we found no relationships between attachment and social feedback learning. Follow-up studies could focus on also including a clinical sample for a broader range of scores on attachment. Subsequently follow up studies could use a trial-to-trial approach for a more precise measure of social feedback learning.",

In dit onderzoek werd aan de hand van de componenten van de Schaamte Veerkracht Theorie onderzocht hoe deze vermijdende houding omgezet kon worden in een houding die gericht is op het oplossen van problemen. Er waren vier condities opgesteld aan de hand van deze componenten, die elk verschillende interventies toepasten op brieven van schuldeisers. Er deden 182 participanten mee van 18 tot 85 jaar oud, die allemaal aangaven ervaring te hebben met schuldproblematiek. Elke participant kreeg één van de vier condities te zien, waarna er een vragenlijst werd afgenomen om de bereidheid tot contact te meten. Er werd verwacht dat zowel een interventie op machteloosheid als een interventie op verstikking een positiever effect zouden hebben op de bereidheid tot het zoeken van contact, vergeleken met de controle conditie. Ook werd er verwacht dat een interactie tussen een interventie op machteloosheid en verstikking een positiever effect zou hebben op de bereidheid tot het zoeken van contact, vergeleken met de controleconditie, de interventie op machteloosheid en de interventie op verstikking. Resultaten toonden aan dat de interventie gericht op het verminderen van machteloosheid als enige van de interventies een significant effect had op de bereidheid tot het zoeken van contact door de participanten. Hierdoor wordt de vermijdende houding die voortkomt uit schuld omgezet tot een oplossingsgerichte houding.",

Is optimism helpful when expecting pain?,"Leupe, Denise",['K. Peerdeman'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Expectancies can significantly influence pain experience. Previous research has found an assimilating effect of these expectancies. However, not all research has found these effects, which might partially be explained by individual differences of participants, such as dispositional optimism. Research suggests that optimists have more attentional bias towards positive stimuli than pessimists, which could lead to optimists being more susceptible to the effects of underestimating pain and less susceptible to the effects of overestimating pain. Understanding the effect of expectancies on experienced pain could be helpful in clinical settings to help manage pain. The current within-subject study investigated the effects of expectancies on pain by presenting 23 healthy participants aged 18-35 with predicting cues followed by moderately painful electrical stimuli using the DS5. The predicting cues were presented visually on a computer screen in front of the participant and were either ""low pain"", ""moderate pain"", or ""high pain"". The Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) was used to measure dispositional optimism, which was used to investigate the interaction effect of optimism on the relationship between expectancies and pain experience. Underprediction resulted in a significantly less intense, and overprediction in a significantly more intense pain experience than when pain is correctly predicted. However, no significant moderating effects of optimism were found. The present study contributes to research supporting an assimilating effect of expectations on pain experience. However, further research should be done to realize the practical use of expectations of pain in a clinical setting.",

Especially for pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) a sense of belonging is important in order to have positive experiences at school. The most important contributor to a sense of belonging at school is the staff-pupil interaction. The purpose of the current research is to investigate the relationship between a sense of belonging at school and staff-pupil interaction for pupils with ASD. The relationship will be investigated for boys and girls at primary school and secondary school. Participants are parents of 200 children with ASD between the age of three and seventeen years old. The parents filled in questionnaires about the well-being of their children in the school context. The current research showed that there is a strong positive relationship between sense of belonging at school and staff-pupil interaction for pupils with ASD. No differences were found in the levels of sense of belonging at school and staff-pupil interaction between boys and girls and between primary and secondary school.,"['ASD', 'sense of belonging', 'staff-pupil interaction', 'boys', 'girls', 'primary school', 'secondary school']"
The influence of observational learning on placebo analgesia and the mediating effect of pain expectation,"Arema, Sascha","['Lennep, J.P.A. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"There is an increasing demand from health professionals to develop recommendations about evidence-based and ethical use of placebo effects in the clinical practice, but the underlying mechanisms behind the placebo effect are not all known yet. One of these mechanisms is observational learning, which is the topic of this study. The current research has two research aims. First, the influence of observational learning on the placebo effect is investigated. Second, the mediating effect of pain expectations in the role of observational learning on the placebo effect is studied. Based on previous findings it was expected that observational learning would induce placebo responses and that pain expectations would mediate this effect. Twenty-three healthy students from 18 to 30 years old participated in this study, which was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Placebo analgesia was measured as the difference in pain scores between the activation and the deactivation of a sham device over the course of 18 trials. Pain scores were given on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), with scores between 0 and 10. Placebo analgesia was compared in two groups: an observational learning group and a control group. Both groups received painful stimuli in combination with fake activation ore fake deactivation of a sham device. Participants in the observational learning group watched a video in which a model showed analgesic effects after every pain stimuli when the sham device was activated (ON) but not when the sham device was deactivated (OFF). The control group also got to see a video, but in this video there was no relation between the pain scores of the model and de activation/deactivation of the sham device. The results show that observational learning did not lead to placebo analgesia (F(4.392,92.228) = .557, p = .710). Furthermore, pain expectations did not mediate the relation between observational learning and the placebo effect (b = 0.01, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.10]). These findings contradict previous research that did find a placebo effect induced by observational learning and a mediating role of expectations. Future research should focus on the circumstances in which observational learning does induce a placebo effect. When observational learning does induce placebo responses, the mediating factor of pain expectation should be re-evaluated.","['Placebo effect', 'placebo analgesia', 'social learning', 'observational learning', 'pain expectation']"

Neurocognitive Mechanisms Supporting Learning from Social Feedback about the Self in Adolescence: Links with Parenting Climate,"Kiyui, Kimberly Janji","['Ruitenberg, M.', 'Will, G. J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The valuation of one’s self-worth, i.e., self-esteem, is derived from social feedback throughout life. During adolescence, the period between ages 10 to 19, many changes occur in one's social environment– peers gain importance, and dependency on parents decreases. However, parents continue to influence self-esteem. Although the early parent-child relationship has been linked to self-esteem formation, it is unclear how perceived parenting climate influences self-esteem updating in adolescence in response to peer feedback, as these mechanisms have only been studied in young adults (individuals aged 18–25). This study used self-reports about perceived parenting, alongside computational modelling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how parenting climate co-varies with neurocognitive mechanisms supporting self-esteem formation in 61 healthy adolescents (Mage = 15.8; SD age = 1.42). The adolescents performed a social evaluation task during fMRI scanning which required them to predict “likes” or “dislikes” from two groups of raters and to rate their self-esteem every 2 to 3 trials. Using a computational model, we extracted a set of variables about the adolescents’ self-esteem in response to the task and performed a canonical correlation analysis to link it to a set of self-reports collected about parenting climate. The canonical correlation analysis yielded a single significant canonical dimension, Wilks’s λ = 0.04, F(117,305) = 1.35, p = 0.022, which we labelled “positive parenting”. “Positive parenting” was associated with high levels of perceived maternal care, low maternal conflict, and low emotional abuse. Adolescents scoring higher on this dimension exhibited more responsive, fluctuating self-esteem (higher self-esteem instability) compared to their lower-scoring peers, 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑑 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 0.31. Our study in adolescents did not find activation in 𝑤1 neural regions that were previously proposed to represent the neural processes underlying self-esteem formation in young adults (VS/sgACC: z = 1.84, p = 0.065; vmPFC: z = 0.50, p = 0.618). Lastly, adolescents scoring lower on this dimension did not present with a neural phenotype of psychiatric vulnerability previously found in young adults (AI responses to SPEs ρ(59) = 0.028, p = 0.831; insula-vmPFC functional connectivity ρ(59) = 0.045, p = 0.731). This study suggests that more responsive, fluctuating self-esteem associated with the “positive parenting” dimension may be adaptive in the developmental stage of adolescence, and that developmental differences may be present in neurocognitive mechanisms supporting self-esteem updating in adolescents versus in young adults.","['self-esteem', 'social feedback', 'parenting climate', 'positive parenting', 'adolescence']"

Physiological Aspects of Conspiracy Theories: Conspiracy Belief is not Related to Interoceptive Sensitivity,"Schmidt, Pia Marie",['Daan Scheepers'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"We assumed that conspiracy belief would be associated with greater interoceptive sensitivity (i.e., people’s perceptions of their internal bodily activity). Specifically, people who believe in conspiracy theories (CTs) may rely more heavily on their “gut feelings” and intuitions than people who do not believe in CTs. As a first test of this possible relationship, we examined whether interoceptive sensitivity is related to greater conspiracy mentality (CM) using a heartbeat detection task (N = 67). Further, we expected the relation between interoceptive sensitivity and CM to be positively mediated by faith in intuition and negatively mediated by analytical thinking. Contrary to our predictions, there was no relationship between interoceptive sensitivity and CM (β = -.15, p = .222). Mediation analyses did not reveal a mediated effect of intuitive or analytical thinking either. Yet, consistent with previous research, CM was related to analytical thinking and faith in intuition, albeit only marginally to the latter. Importantly, all results should be considered with caution, as our study has insufficient power. Further research on the relation between conspiracy beliefs and interoceptive sensitivity using well-suited manipulations is needed. Such research may have wide ranging implications for our understanding of conspiracy as well as ideological beliefs.","['conspiracy theory, conspiracy belief, interoception, physiology, ideology']"
Begrijpen we begrijpend lezen? De Zelfgerapporteerde Kennis van Leerkrachten met betrekking tot belangrijke Aspecten van Onderwijs in Begrijpend Lezen,"Remmerswaal, Eva","['Koornneef, A.W.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Uit onderzoek van het Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is gebleken dat de leesvaardigheid van Nederlandse leerlingen de afgelopen jaren is gedaald. Een scholengemeenschap in Zuid-Holland merkte deze daling ook. Zij vroegen zich af wat de rol van hun leerkrachten was in deze daling. Daarom is onderzocht in hoeverre aspecten rondom begrijpend lezen bekend zijn bij de leerkrachten van groep 5 t/m 8 binnen de scholengemeenschap en op welke manier zij deze toepassen tijdens hun lessen begrijpend lezen. Uit literatuuronderzoek kwamen zes belangrijke aspecten van begrijpend lezen naar voren: technisch lezen, woordenschat, begrijpen, evalueren en reflecteren, informatie opzoeken en leesplezier. Uit de afgenomen vragenlijst bleek dat leerkrachten aangeven significant minder kennis te hebben van evalueren en reflecteren dan van woordenschat en begrijpen. Er bestond geen significante samenhang tussen de aangegeven kennis en bestede tijd van leerkrachten bij begrijpend lezen. Voor de individuele aspecten: woordenschat, begrijpen, informatie opzoeken en leesplezier was dit wel het geval. Leerkrachten die een cursus op het gebied van taalonderwijs hadden gevolgd gaven aan significant meer kennis te hebben van het aspect woordenschat. Leerkrachten gaven daarnaast aan aspecten vaker aan te bieden wanner deze voorkwamen in de methode. Concluderend blijkt dat de zelfgerapporteerde kennis van leerkrachten bij evalueren en reflecteren het laagst is. Het is aan te bevelen aan scholen om meer aandacht te besteden aan dit aspect. De zelfgerapporteerde kennis en bestede tijd ligt bij de aspecten woordenschat en begrijpen hoger dan bij de andere aspecten, dit wil echter nog niet zeggen dat hier ook een causaal verband bestaat. De methode heeft namelijk een grote invloed op het aanbod van leerkrachten tijdens de lessen in begrijpend lezen. Het is dan ook aan te bevelen aan de scholengemeenschap om goed te kijken welke aspecten in de methode al terugkomen en aan welke aspecten nog extra aandacht moet worden besteed.",
Feedback bij rekenen: Een beschrijvend onderzoek naar verschillende vormen en kenmerken van feedback,"van der Ende, Melissa","['Chung, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Op basisschool Wissel daalt het aantal excellente rekenaars. Leerkrachten kunnen door het geven van feedback de motivatie en rekenprestaties van leerlingen verbeteren. Daarom is onderzoek gedaan naar de volgende onderzoeksvraag: ‘Welke vormen van feedback worden momenteel gegeven in een rekenles van groep 3 tot en met 6 op basisschool Wissel en hoe zou de inzet van feedback geoptimaliseerd kunnen worden?’. Deze vraag is onderzocht door middel van gestructureerde observaties bij zeven leerkrachten op de basisschool. In de literatuur wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen taakgerichte, aanpakgerichte, zelfregulatiegerichte en persoonsgerichte feedback. Een combinatie van de eerste drie vormen is het meest effectief. Daarnaast wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen de aard (bevestigend, kritisch, constructief en/of neutraal), doelgerichtheid (doelgericht of niet-doelgericht) en doelgroep (klas, groepje of individu) van feedback. Een combinatie van bevestigende, kritische en constructieve feedback is het meest effectief. Verder is doelgerichte feedback effectiever dan niet-doelgerichte feedback en is feedback gericht op individuen effectiever dan feedback gericht op de klas of een groepje. Op basisschool Wissel wordt het vaakst feedback op zelfregulatie gegeven. Het advies aan leerkrachten is om voornamelijk een combinatie van taakgerichte, aanpakgerichte en zelfregulatiegerichte feedback in te zetten. Verder wordt met name niet-doelgerichte feedback gegeven. Het advies is daarom vaker doelgerichte feedback in te zetten. Feedback gericht op een individu wordt al het vaakst ingezet op de basisschool. In vervolgonderzoek zou een training aan leerkrachten gegeven kunnen worden, waarbij zij leren reflecteren op hun eigen manier van feedback geven tijdens rekenen.","['feedback', 'rekenonderwijs', 'basisonderwijs', 'effectiviteit', 'vormen']"

The dataset contained 255 Dutch participants, between the ages five and eighteen (mean age: 11,37 (SD = 2.91); 190 boys and 65 girls). The teacher of the participant filled out Achenbach’s Teacher Report Form (TRF) to assess the behavioural problems. Both vocal and facial emotion recognition tasks were conducted. Furthermore, both hot inhibition (delayed frustration) and cool inhibition (response inhibition) were measured. To evaluate the group differences MANOVA’s were conducted. The results revealed that there were different clusters of behavioural problems. In the younger group two clusters were found, a cluster with less problems and a cluster with more externalizing problems. Three clusters were found in the older group, a cluster with less behavioural problems, a cluster with high externalizing problems, and a small cluster with both internalizing and some externalizing problems. The results also revealed that the participants in the different clusters did not differ in their ability on emotion recognition and inhibition. Concluding it can be stated that the current study found different clusters of behavioural problems in children and adolescents deemed at risk for developing antisocial behaviour. Contrary to expectations, the group with both internalizing and externalizing problems was small in the current dataset. The current research did not find group differences in emotion recognition and inhibition.","['At risk youth', 'behavior problems', 'clustering analyses']"

This paper argues that this difference between France and the US stems from their unique identities. Using a realist constructivist approach, the paper investigates the foreign policy of both France and the US toward China. The theoretical expectations of the paper are that France’s foreign policy toward China is guided by Grandeur, whereas the US’ foreign policy is guided by “Exceptionalism’. The paper then analyses a total of 30 foreign policy documents bounded between the years 2017 and 2020, using a Most Similar System Design and a Qualitative Content Analysis. The results of the analysis are in line with the theoretical expectations. These results can be of interest to policy makers in both France and the US, as well as to students and scholars interested in great power politics and realist constructivism.",

Te bang om te helpen? De relatie tussen angst en de mate van prosociaal leren,"Smalbrugge, Maureen",['E.R.A. de Bruijn'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het vertonen van adequaat sociaal gedrag is essentieel voor het onderhouden van relaties. Door het vertonen van prosociaal gedrag, een vrijwillige actie waar de andere persoon baat bij heeft, leert het individu wat de effecten van hun gedragingen zijn. Dit proces wordt prosociaal leren genoemd en is een onderdeel van prosociaal gedrag. Eerdere onderzoeken tonen aan dat iemand beter voor zichzelf leert dan voor een onbekende andere en lijkt angst te zorgen voor een lagere mate van prosociaal gedrag. Daarom zijn de volgende hypothesen, middels een leertaak en een vragenlijst die angst meet, getoetst: participanten leren beter voor zichzelf, gevolgd door leren voor een vriend en het minst voor een onbekende, angstigere participanten vertonen prosocialer leergedrag tegenover vrienden dan voor een onbekende en angstigere participanten leren minder prosociaal dan minder angstigere mensen. Resultaten van 136 participanten (84 vrouwen, 52 mannen) laten zien dat individuen het best voor zichzelf leren, gevolgd door leren voor een vriend en het minst leren een onbekende andere, waardoor de eerste hypothese wordt aangenomen. Daarentegen laten resultaten geen positieve samenhang zien tussen angst en de mate van prosociaal leren, waardoor de tweede en derde hypotheses worden verworpen. Mogelijke verklaringen zijn dat individuen meer hun best doen voor een vriend omdat dit gedeeltelijk op sociale verwachting kan berusten. Daarnaast heeft het uitblijven van sociale interactie in de leertaak mogelijk gezorgd voor het verwerpen van deze hypothesen, terwijl dit een belangrijk onderdeel lijkt te zijn in prosociaal leren. Vervolgonderzoek geadviseerd zich te richten op een taak waarin sociale context een grotere rol speelt.",
De rol van zelfvertrouwen in de mate van pro sociaal gedrag,"Fens, Lianne",['E.R.A. de Bruijn'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Er is sprake van pro-sociaal gedrag wanneer anderen baat hebben bij iemands acties, bijvoorbeeld iemand helpen. Niet iedereen is even pro-sociaal. Om te meten in hoeverre iemand pro-sociaal gedrag vertoont kan gekeken worden naar pro-sociaal leren. Het doel van dit onderzoek was om te onderzoeken aan de hand van een leertaak voor beloningen of men verschilt in leren voor zichzelf, vrienden of een onbekende. Ook werd er gekeken naar de mogelijke positieve correlatie tussen zelfvertrouwen en pro-sociaal gedrag. Zelfvertrouwen is het gevoel van zelfwaarde, ook wel de positieve of negatieve evaluaties die iemand over zichzelf maakt. Eerdere onderzoeken wijzen uit dat zelfvertrouwen mogelijk bijdraagt aan de mate van pro-sociaal gedrag. 136 participanten (gem leeftijd: 28,1 jaar, 84 mannen, 52 vrouwen) hebben zich vrijwillig via social media aangemeld. Aan de hand van de resultaten kon worden geconstateerd dat er wel een significant effect te vinden is tussen het leergedrag voor jezelf versus voor een ander. Mensen leren namelijk het beste wanneer ze spelen voor een beloning voor zichzelf, daarna presteren ze voor een vriend en er is het minste sprake van leergedrag in de onbekende conditie. Er is geen significante correlatie tussen zelfvertrouwen en pro-sociaal leergedrag gevonden. Een van de mogelijke verklaringen hiervoor is het ontbreken van sociale interactie, wat veel invloed kan hebben op hoe iemand presteert, met name kan zelfvertrouwen hier van afhangen. Voor verder onderzoek kan zelfvertrouwen met meer items worden getest om zo een betrouwbaarder beeld te krijgen van iemands zelfvertrouwen.",
Financiële stress en vermijding: De veelbelovende rol van schaamte veerkracht,"Groot, Luc de",['E. Seip'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het niet kunnen bereiken van klanten is voor veel schuldeisers een groot probleem. Een belangrijke factor hierin is dat de klanten zich vaak schamen voor hun financiële situatie. Om dit probleem op te lossen is er in dit onderzoek onderzocht of het op een andere manier communiceren naar de klanten hun contactbereidheid verhoogt. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat het geven van het gevoel dat de personen niet de enige zijn in een lastige situatie er niet voor zorgt dat de contactbereidheid verhoogd. Uit het onderzoek is wel gebleken dat er een groep is waarbij de contactbereidheid toch te verhogen is. Het is echter niet duidelijk waarom deze verhoging niet in alle groepen is gelukt. Voor vervolgonderzoek is het dus erg interessant om te onderzoeken hoe het komt dat er bij een van de groepen wel een verhoging van de contactbereidheid is geconstateerd. Not being able to reach customers is a major problem for many creditors. An important factor is that customers are often ashamed of their financial situation. In order to solve this problem, this study investigated whether communicating in a different way with the customers would increase their willingness to be contact. It turned out that giving people the feeling that they are not the only ones in a difficult situation does not increase their willingness to make contact. The research did show that there is a group in which willingness to contact can be increased. However, it is not clear why this increase was not achieved in all groups. For follow-up research, it is therefore very interesting to investigate how it is possible that one group did result in an increase in willingness to get in touch.",

Playing videogames is such a complex motor skill. Among other things, playing videogames can improve cognitive and motor skills. One specific move, the 90 degrees rotation, occurs in the gaming world, but is not often performed in the real world. In this study, the so-called rotor pursuit task with 90 degrees rotation was investigated, comparing gamers and non-gamers. The research question was: do gamers outperform non-gamers on the RPT with 90 degrees of rotation? As a first hypothesis, it was expected that people who have experience playing videogames have better basic skills. In addition, gamers were expected to learn the task better in 24 hours than non-gamers. In the second day study, spaced 24 hours apart, 14 participants performed the RPT with 90 degrees of rotation. On the second day, personal questions about gaming were asked to determine in which group the participant ended up. No significant effects were found. Gamers did not outperform non-gamers on the RPT with 90 degrees rotation. A better basis skill and learning effect for gamers were also not found.",
Leren van Complexe Motorische Vaardigheden: Relatie met sport,"Haas, Bart de",['J. van Ketel'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Complexe motorische vaardigheden zijn de bewegingen die een mens kan maken, de motoriek die beheerst moet worden. Deze vaardigheden worden zowel gebruikt voor het leren van sporten als de Rotor Pursuit taak (RPT) uit dit onderzoek. In dit onderzoek wordt met een t-toets onderzocht of sporters beter in staat zijn om de RPT te leren en uit te voeren dan niet-sporters. De eerste hypothese is dat op de RPT het leereffect van sporters groter is dan het leereffect van niet-sporters. De volgende hypothese is voor beide dagen dat op de RPT sporters een lager gemiddelde hebben dan niet-sporters. Daarnaast wordt met een lineaire regressie onderzocht of een hoger aantal sportjaren voor een betere uitvoering van de RPT zorgt. De hypothese zal zijn dat een hoger aantal sportjaren een betere uitvoering van de RPT zal geven. Voor het experiment is een groep van 30 gezonde participanten verzameld. Een persoonlijke vragenlijst werd afgenomen voor informatie over het aantal sportjaren en het wel of niet doen van een sport. Er waren geen significante effecten of correlaties gevonden. Sporters waren dus niet beter in staat om de RPT te leren en uit te voeren dan niet-sporters. Daarnaast zorgde een hoger aantal sportjaren niet voor een betere uitvoering van de RPT.",

Classificatie van alzheimer door middel van een combinatie van metingen uit structurele en functionele MRI scans,"Kluit, Ilsa",['F. de Vos'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Atrofie van bepaalde gebieden in de hersenen is kenmerkend voor het hebben van Alzheimer. Dit is te zien op structurele MRI scans. Daarnaast is er ook een andere hersenfunctie te zien door middel van functionele MRI scans. Om goed een classificatiemodel te kunnen maken zal er een onderzoek gedaan worden naar hoe nauwkeurig een model op basis van een combinatie van functionele en structurele MRI het onderscheid weergeeft tussen ouderen met Alzheimer en ouderen zonder Alzheimer. Er wordt gekeken of de accuratesse en AUC van dit model groter is dan van een model op basis van alleen de metingen van de structurele MRI of het model van alleen de metingen van de functionele MRI scan. Er wordt verwacht dat het samenvoegen van de metingen van structurele en functionele MRI de hoogste accuratesse en AUC zal opleveren. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd bij 173 cognitief gezonde ouderen en 76 ouderen met alzheimer. De predictoren van de structurele MRI zijn: corticale dikte, grijze stof dichtheid en subcorticale volumes. De functionele MRI informatie bestaat uit 190 connectieve verbindingen tussen 20 verschillende hersengebieden. Er is gebruik gemaakt van LASSO logistische regressie met kruisvalidatie. De resultaten laten zien dat model 3 op basis van functionele en structurele MRI het best het onderscheid weergeeft (AUC: 0.936) vergeleken met model 1 op basis van structurele MRI (AUC: 0.935). Het model op basis van functionele en structurele MRI scan samen voorspelt dus het best of een oudere Alzheimer heeft of niet. Een limitatie is dat de dataset niet zo groot was. Er waren vooral niet heel veel Alzheimerpatiënten. Dit kan ervoor zorgen dat het minder betrouwbaar is en lastiger te generaliseren is.",
De combinatie van structurele MRI en Resting-State fMRI voor de classificatie van de ziekte van Alzheimer,"Bruggen, Merel van",['F. de Vos'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De ziekte van Alzheimer gaat gepaard met atrofie van de grijze stof, de verdunning van de cortex en een afname van het volume van de subcorticale gebieden in de hersenen. Deze atrofie kan worden gemeten met een structurele MRI-scan. Uit onderzoeken blijkt dat er sprake is van een verandering in de functionele connectiviteit (FC) bij patiënten met de ziekte van Alzheimer. De Resting Statefunctionele MRI-scan (RS-fMRI) is een methode die de functionele connectiviteit tussen de netwerken in de hersenen bekijkt. In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht of de functionele connectiviteit gemeten door RS-fMRI de classificatie-accuratesse verbetert van de ziekte van Alzheimer gemeten door structurele MRI. In dit onderzoek wordt gebruik gemaakt van een structurele MRI-model, RS-fMRI-model en een gecombineerd MRI-model (structurele MRI en RS-fMRI gecombineerd). Er wordt gebruikt gemaakt van een LASSO logistische regressie in combinatie met een kruisvalidatie. De AUC-waardes van het structurele MRI-model, RS-fMRI-model en het gecombineerde MRI-model zijn respectievelijk .93, .73 en .94. De combinatie van de structurele MRI en de RS-fMRI geeft een hogere accuratesse dan de scans apart van elkaar. RS-fMRI speelt een rol in het correct classificeren van de ziekte van Alzheimer. Het verschil met de structurele MRI is minimaal en daarom is de vraag hoe praktisch relevant het is om RS-fMRI toe te voegen aan de classificatie voor de ziekte van Alzheimer. Alzheimer's disease is associated with atrophy of the gray matter, the thinning of the cortex and a decrease in the volume of the subcortical areas in the brain. This atrophy can be measured with a structural MRI scan. Studies show that there is a change in functional connectivity in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The Resting State functional MRI scan (RS-fMRI) is a method that examines the functional connectivity between the networks in the brain. In this thesis it is investigated whether the functional connectivity measured by RS-fMRI improves the classification accuracy of Alzheimer's disease measured by structural MRI. In this study, a structural MRI model, RS-fMRI model, and a combined MRI model (structural MRI and RS-fMRI combined) are used. A LASSO logistic regression in combination with a cross-validation is used. The AUC values of the structural MRI model, RS-fMRI model and the combined MRI model are .93, .73 and .94, respectively. The combination of the structural MRI and the RS-fMRI gives a higher accuracy than the scans separately. RS-fMRI plays a role in correctly classifying Alzheimer's disease. The difference with the structural MRI is minimal and therefore the question is how practically relevant it is to add RS-fMRI to the classification for Alzheimer's disease.",

The difference in parental acceptance and expected effectiveness between pharmacological and non-pharmacological placebo applications in pediatric patients,"Pinckaers, Germaine",['H. van Middendorp'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"A placebo application is an intervention designed to evoke remarkable improvements in the symptoms of the patient, which are caused by factors of the therapeutic encounter, without being caused by discrete therapies. A distinction can be made between pharmacological and non-pharmacological placebo applications. Both types of placebo applications have been proven to positively influence (pediatric) patients in which there is a reduction in anxiety and pain during treatment. However, little research focuses on the differences between the various types of placebo applications in children and on the degree of acceptance and expected effectiveness of these applications according to parents. This study investigated whether there is a difference in parental acceptance and expected effectiveness between pharmacological (use of an inactive ointment and an open-label placebo) and non-pharmacological (use of virtual reality glasses and music) placebo applications in pediatric patients. A cross-sectional observational online questionnaire study was used to investigate whether there was a difference between pharmacological and non-pharmacological placebo applications. Nineteen parents of a child who had received medical treatment in the past year participated in the study. The results showed that non-pharmacological applications scored higher on acceptance (p < .001) and the four components of expected effectiveness (p-values ranging from p <. 001 to p = .049 ) than pharmacological applications. Non-pharmacological applications seem to be the most accepted by parents, and parents also had the most expectations in terms of effectiveness with these applications. The findings of this study could imply there should be a focus in the treatment policy of hospitals on non-pharmacological placebo applications, and there should be more attention to informing parents about the advantages of different kinds of placebo applications.",

De analyse is door middel van een repeated measure ANCOVA uitgevoerd. Uit de analyse kwam naar voren dat risicoaversie beter werd voorspeld dan zelfzuchtigheid, dat er een positieve relatie is tussen zelfzuchtigheid en het wonen in een onveilige buurt en een negatieve relatie tussen risicoaversie en het wonen in een onveilige buurt. Er is ook een significante interactie gevonden tussen motivaties en de antwoorden bij de NVS.

Eerder onderzoek toonde het belang van een open houding van de therapeut tegenover de cultuur van de cliënt aan. Dit draagt bij aan het creëren van een sterke band tussen cliënt en therapeut. Doel: De huidige studie onderzocht of de religiesoort van de cliënt een rol speelt in de tevredenheid in de therapeutische relatie. Daarnaast werd onderzocht welke rol religiebegrip kan spelen in de relatie tussen therapeut en cliënt. Methode: In dit onderzoek hebben 166 respondenten (M=27.02, SD = 8.58) een online vragenlijst ingevuld over religiesoort, religiebegrip en de tevredenheid in de therapeutische relatie. De vragenlijst bestond uit een combinatie van de CALPAS-P en nieuwe vragen. Resultaten: Er werd geen verband gevonden tussen de religiesoort en het begrip van de therapeut voor de religie. Er werd geen verband gevonden tussen de religiesoort en de mate van tevredenheid in de therapeutische relatie. Er werd een verband gevonden tussen religiebegrip en de score van de tevredenheid van de therapeutische relatie. Conclusie: Religiebegrip speelt mogelijk een rol in de tevredenheid van de therapeutische relatie. Dit kan kansen bieden voor het verhogen van de prognose van de cliënt, een begripvolle houding voor de religie van de cliënt wordt geboden. Discussie: Vervolgonderzoek is nodig met betrekking tot data over de religie van de therapeut.

Daarnaast is de relatie tussen het inschattingsvermogen van prosociaal gedrag bij adolescenten en ouderlijke agressie onderzocht. De mate van ouderlijke agressie is gemeten met de Parental Aggression Index (PAI). Het totale onderzoek omvat participanten (N = 43) tussen de tien en twintig jaar oud. Voor de analyse is een Repeated Measures ANOVA uitgevoerd. Er is gevonden dat de participanten gemiddeld hoger scoren op risicoaversie dan op zelfzuchtigheid. Echter was dit niet significant. Daarnaast is er een niet significante, positieve correlatie gevonden tussen de score op de PAI en zelfzuchtigheid en risicoaversie. Hierbij was de correlatie tussen de PAI en zelfzuchtigheid het sterkst. Mogelijk zijn de verschillende resultaten die uit dit onderzoek naar voren zijn gekomen te verklaren door een te kleine onderzoeksgroep of door een te kleine spreiding in leeftijd. In vervolgonderzoek zou de spreiding in leeftijden en de hoeveelheid participanten mogelijk vergroot kunnen worden om zo meer statistische power te creëren.",
Puberty and predicting others’ behaviour: Cross-sectional study about the influence of age & puberty for male adolescents’ accuracy of predicting others’ (pro)social behaviour,"Mettes, Demi",['I. Ma'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"this cross-sectional study investigates whether the accuracy of male adolescents in predicting other people's (pro)social behaviour is influenced by puberty and age. The (pro)social behaviour has the underlying motivations greediness and risk-aversion. During adolescence, building- and maintaining social relationships is extremely important for mental and physical health. Being able to correctly predict others’ (pro)social behaviour is necessary for building good relationships. Gaining knowledge about this subject allows professionals to improve the foundation of adolescents in the field of social relations. Method: 18 male participants (ages: 10-20) made predictions about what choices others would make in behavioural economic games. The participants had to predict whether the figure would choose to share or keep coins based on the underlying motivations of risk-aversion and greediness. The puberty status was tested with the Pubertal Development Scale. Results: there were no significant interaction effects found between motivation and age. Furthermore, there are no significant results found of puberty as an addition to age. There is also no significant difference found between predicting greediness and risk-aversion due to puberty status. Conclusion: in this study, no evidence was found that puberty and age are influencers of males’ accuracy in predicting other people's behaviour. Yet some trends are found in the direction of the hypothesis, and the advice would be to repeat this- or a similar study with a representative number of participants.",
The prevalence and combined measurement prediction of autism spectrum disorder in children with tuberous sclerosis complex,"Straver, Chantal","['Cuperus, A.A.', 'Hoopen, L.W. ten', 'Nijs, P.F.A. de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Introduction: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic multisystem disorder characterized by the widespread growth of benign hamartomas in multiple organ systems, leading to very diverse (neuropsychiatric) manifestations, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study aimed to examine the prevalence of clinically assessed ASD in children with TSC visiting a specialized TSC outpatient clinic. The influence of gender, age, intellectual functioning, and mutation type on a clinical ASD diagnosis was investigated. Secondly, the predictive value of using both a screening instrument and an observational assessment in relation to a clinical DSM-IV/-V ASD diagnosis in the group of children with TSC was examined. Methods: The data sample consisted of 110 children (50% male) between 1 and 17 years old (mean age = 9.65, SD = 4.61) diagnosed with a genetically and/or clinically confirmed diagnosis of TSC and a filled out ADOS and/or SRS. They were assessed as part of standard (mental) health care and longitudinal follow-up. The independent variables were gender, age, IQ/DQ, and mutation type, which associations with clinical ASD diagnoses were examined with Chi-Square Tests of Association or independent sample t-tests. The dependent variables were ASD classifications according to the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS/SRS-2) scores, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-second edition (ADOS-2) scores, and DSM-IV/-V diagnoses. Results: A clinical ASD prevalence rate of 52.7% was found, substantially higher than in the general population. Children with a clinical ASD diagnosis had significantly lower intelligence scores (p = .01). No gender, age, or mutation type effects were found. The combined use of screening and observational- based classifications showed the highest positive predictive value for DSM-IV/-V ASD diagnosis. Discussion: The results showed a substantially higher ASD prevalence rate compared to the general population, underlining the importance of ASD assessment in children with TSC. Furthermore, these results highlighted the relevance of using both a screening instrument and an observational assessment to accurately classify children with TSC as having ASD. A better ASD prediction and classification may lead to earlier diagnosis and appropriate, personalized interventions, potentially alleviating some of the burden for both patients and their families or caregivers.","['TSC', 'tuberous sclerosis complex', 'ASD', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'ADOS', 'SRS', 'neurocognitive developmental disorder']"

Several studies have focused on one aspect of noise annoyance, such as attitudes or health. However, a comprehensive picture of factors contributing to noise annoyance is not drafted yet, so this study aims to fill that gap. The study was conducted remotely for ten consecutive days in the daily life of 32 participants. It consisted of two main tasks: (1) wearing an activity tracker and (2) submitting flyover events into the NLR study app. We hypothesised that healthy coping mechanisms would predict lower reported noise annoyance and that predictors of higher reported noise annoyance are more negative attitudes, prevalent unhealthy coping habits, perceived louder and higher-pitched flyovers, and perceived lengthier flyover events. The main questionnaires analysed in this study to test the hypotheses were the ICBEN 11-point scale, BriefCOPE and the attitude component from the NORAH study. Attitudes and coping mechanisms are not verified as predictors in this study. The results do imply that subjective volume, subjective pitch, and subjective duration of a flyover event are good predictors of reported noise annoyance. Further research is needed to explore how subjective volume, pitch, and exposure duration as intervention targets can help reduce aircraft noise disruptions in individuals that live in affected areas.","['Aviation', 'Aircraft', 'noise annoyance', 'attitudes', 'coping mechanisms', 'perception of noise', 'volume', 'pitch', 'exposure duration']"

Clinicians of organizations that provide personalized care to individuals with intellectual disabilities experience complicating factors in the diagnostic process of dementia classification. Identifying domains of (cognitive) functioning underlying the ‘Dementia Scale for individuals with Intellectual Disabilities’ (DSVH) could aid these organizations in the development of personalized care guidelines for individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia. The aim of this pilot study was to identify potential domains of (cognitive) functioning underlying the DSVH. It was hypothesized that domains regarding mood, aggression, appetite, loss of interest, functional decline (reduced self-care skills), cognitive decline, personality, speech, maladaptive behaviours, disorientation, confusion, environmental awareness, and motor skills would be found. A Multiple Correspondence Analysis was employed to visualize the relationship between different active variables in a sample consisting of 50 participants (n = 50). Domains regarding the presence of forgetfulness, an increase in negative mood, decline in motor skills, decline in orientation in time, decline in responses to stimuli, and a decline in characteristic behaviour were found. The results found in this study suggest that those domains of (cognitive) functioning might be underlying the DSVH, that could be uncovered when the analysis is performed on a sufficiently large and diverse sample in future studies.","['Intellectual disabilities', 'dementia', 'dementia classification', 'domains of functioning']"

Effectieve didactische principes in het technisch leesonderwijs,"Steenbergen, Annelore","['Bosch, L.J. van den']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Om voor leerlingen de kans op succesvolle deelname aan de maatschappij te vergroten, is het belangrijk om technisch leesonderwijs zo effectief mogelijk vorm te geven. Dit kan door effectieve didactische principes in te zetten. In dit onderzoek is nagegaan in hoeverre midden- en bovenbouwleerkrachten van drie basisscholen in de regio van Reeuwijk en Gouda de (al dan niet) effectief gebleken didactische principes op het gebied van technisch lezen toepassen. Ook is nagegaan of er tussen de midden- en bovenbouw een verschil is in de inzet van principes. Hierbij is een vragenlijst gebruikt, waarbij aan negentien midden- en bovenbouwleerkrachten per principe werd gevraagd hoe vaak zij deze inzetten. Deze vragenlijst betrof tien principes: zeven bewezen effectieve principes (koorlezen, herhaald lezen, luisterend lezen, individueel begeleid hardop lezen, tutorlezen en Listening Passage Preview), twee principes waarvan geen eenduidigheid over de effectiviteit bestaat (flitsen en wisselrijen) en een bewezen niet effectief principe (niveaulezen). Uit de resultaten blijken de volgende principes gemiddeld (heel) vaak te worden ingezet: koorlezen, luisterend lezen, flitsen en herhaald lezen. Daarnaast worden individueel begeleid hardop lezen, EDI en wisselrijen regelmatig ingezet. Niveaulezen en LPP worden daarentegen soms ingezet, terwijl tutorlezen beperkt wordt ingezet. Verder worden individueel begeleid hardop lezen en flitsen significant vaker door middenbouwleerkrachten ingezet dan door bovenbouwleerkrachten. Een praktische aanbeveling betreft het vermijden van de inzet van niveaulezen en het eerder inzetten van een bewezen effectief principe dan een niet-eenduidig principe. Tot slot betreft een praktische implicatie het inzetten van voor-koor-door lezen, waarbij verschillende effectieve didactische principes worden gecombineerd.","['technisch lezen', 'didactische principes', 'middenbouw', 'bovenbouw']"

An hierarchical regression analysis was performed and results showed that job crafting opportunities significantly predicted subjective (b = 1.02, p < .001) and objective career success (b = .21, p < .001). No significant evidence was found for the association between mindset and career success or for the moderating role of mindset. However, a negative significant interaction effect of cognitive crafting (i.e., one component of job crafting) and mindset on objective career success was found (b = -.03, p < .001).

People with intellectual disabilities are also at higher risk of developing unsafe attachment with their caregivers, which can be one cause of their behavioural problems (Dekker-van der Sande & Janssen, 2009). The current research examined whether setting goals related to building a safe attachment with the care staff is effective for lessening behavioural problems in people with an intellectual disability with attachment problems. Method: The research group concerns clients (n= 25) with an intellectual disability with a care package 6 or 7, with attachment problems. The questionnaire DBC-A (Mohr et al., 2011) was used to examine behavioural problems. Attachment problems and goals were derived from the personal care plans. Results: The results show that almost no specific goals on enhancing safe attachment are accumulated. Interpersonal relationship can be viewed as an indirect measure of attachment. Research shows a significant decrease in disruptive behaviour, when there are goals focussed primarily on interpersonal relationships. There were no significant effects on the other subdomains of behavioural problems when goals related to interpersonal relationships were set. Conclusion and discussion: To conclude, there should be more awareness for the importance of setting goals aimed at creating safe attachment with care staff. Setting goals aimed at interpersonal relationships also leads to a decrease of disruptive behaviour.","['Verstandelijke beperking', 'Probleemgedrag', 'gehechtheidsproblemen', 'hechtingsproblematiek']"

Daarnaast beschrijft het onderzoek hoe leerkrachten deze betrokkenheid kunnen signaleren en hoe leerkrachten betrokkenheid kunnen vergroten. Om dit in kaart te brengen is er een vragenlijst afgenomen bij 95 leerlingen en zes leerkrachten waarin zij op een vijfpuntsschaal aangaven in welke mate zij, of de vijf cognitief sterkste leerlingen uit hun klas betrokken zijn tijdens reken- en taallessen. Middels open vragen werd in kaart gebracht wat leerkrachten zouden kunnen doen om betrokkenheid te vergroten. Zoals verwacht scoorden leerlingen die rekenen leuk vinden hoger op emotionele betrokkenheid dan leerlingen die rekenen niet leuk vinden en leerlingen die taal leuk vinden scoorden hoger op emotionele betrokkenheid dan leerlingen die taal niet leuk vinden. Er werden geen verschillen gevonden in de mate van agentic engagement wanneer deze werd bekeken op basis van de vaardigheidsscores van leerlingen voor rekenen en taal. Leerlingen scoorden in het algemeen hoog op betrokkenheid waarbij zij het hoogst scoorden op gedragsmatige betrokkenheid en het laagst op agentic engagement. Betrokkenheid zou vergroot kunnen worden door leerplezier te vergroten en door instructie aan te laten sluiten op het juiste niveau.","['Betrokkenheid', 'gedragsmatige betrokkenheid', 'emotionele betrokkenheid', 'cognitieve betrokkenheid', 'agentic engagement', 'explictiete directe instructie']"

De meest effectieve manier van feedback geven is door feedback te geven die doelgericht is met een bevestigend-constructief-kritische aard en gericht op het individu. De feedback is afwisselend gericht op zelfregulatie, taak of aanpak. Uit de resultaten komt naar voren dat de meest gegeven feedback bevestigend is (M = 26.18), niet doelgericht (M = 65,77), gericht op zelfregulatie (M = 29,87) en gegeven aan het individu (M = 54,74).

Welke activiteiten bevorderen leesmotivatie bij bovenbouwleerlingen? Een perspectief vanuit de zelf-determinatietheorie,"Jonge, Marit de","['Mol, S.E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De afgelopen jaren daalt de leesmotivatie van Nederlandse basisschoolleerlingen. Terwijl leesmotivatie ten grondslag ligt aan een goede leesvaardigheid: wie lezen leuk vindt, leest meer, wat resulteert in een betere leesvaardigheid. In deze studie is onderzocht in hoeverre autonomer en gecontroleerder gemotiveerde lezers een voorkeur hebben voor bepaalde leesactiviteiten die gebaseerd zijn op de zelf-determinatietheorie. Dit is onderzocht met een online vragenlijst bij 178 leerlingen uit groep 6, 7 en 8 onder vier basisscholen in omgeving Haarlemmermeer. Leerlingen werden op basis van hun antwoorden op de Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ) ingedeeld in een meer autonoom of meer gecontroleerd gemotiveerde groep lezers. Er bleken 149 leerlingen autonomer gemotiveerd te zijn (A>G) en 29 leerlingen gecontroleerder gemotiveerd (G>A). Leerlingen werden gevraagd wat voor leesactiviteiten hun leesmotivatie op school zouden kunnen bevorderen. Beide groepen kozen dezelfde drie leesactiviteiten als “leukste”. Er werd verwacht dat de G>A groep activiteiten die te maken hadden met competentie of relatie het leukst zouden vinden, maar dit bleek onjuist. Allebei de groepen vonden zelf je boek kiezen het belangrijkst. Daarnaast vonden leerlingen kiezen waar en wanneer ze lezen ook van groot belang. Concluderend kan gesteld worden dat, ondanks verschil in soort motivatie, leerlingen keuzevrijheid bij het lezen als belangrijke motivator zien. Er wordt aangeraden om experimenteel vervolgonderzoek te doen naar de leesactiviteiten die als leukst worden gezien om te onderzoeken of de leesmotivatie daardoor daadwerkelijk omhoog gaat. Daarnaast is meer onderzoek naar evidence-based leesactiviteiten nodig aangezien er in de wetenschappelijke literatuur nog niet veel over bekend is. Tot slot is het van maatschappelijk belang dat wordt geïnvesteerd in leesmotivatie, aangezien leesmotivatie bijdraagt aan leesvaardigheid, wat een voorspeller is voor succes in de maatschappij.","['Leesmotivati', 'zelf-determinatietheorie', 'basisschool', 'leesactiviteiten', 'autonoom en gecontroleerd gemotiveerd']"

To act in a socially adaptive manner, we must learn about the consequences our actions have on both ourselves and others. In the current study, empathy was tested as a trait which influences our ability to learn to make decisions which benefit others. It was hypothesised that higher empathy would lead to improved prosocial learning, and that feelings of responsibility for others would meditate such effect. A probabilistic prosocial reinforcement learning task was used, whereby 30 healthy males aged between 19 and 34 played a game to win monetary rewards for themselves, another person, or no-one. ANOVA analysis revealed that participants showed higher learning rates when playing for others rather than themselves, which is not congruent with previous research. The potential reasons for this finding are discussed. Correlation analysis of accuracy rates and computational learning rates with empathy scores revealed no relationships between trait empathy and prosocial learning. Further analysis failed to show feelings of responsibility for others mediating the effect of empathy on prosocial learning. Thus, the current study found no evidence for empathy having a role in prosocial learning, nor for feeling responsible for others as a mediator. The current sample did, however, perform as well or better for others than for themselves, which may be due to cultural differences or testing occurring during the Covid-19 pandemic when empathy, prosocial actions, and social responsibility were increased.","['Prosocial Learning', 'Empathy', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Computational Modelling', 'Social Responsibility', 'Covid-19']"

A high-quality test is characterized by norms that allow meaningful interpretation of the raw scores. With normed scores an individual’s performance can be evaluated properly by taking into account the influence of relevant individual characteristics, such as age, gender, education level or socio-economic status. From several norming techniques, regression-based norming has proven to be most efficient one and especially useful when including more than one demographical predictor variable. Recently, the R package GAMLSS has been proposed as a framework for this technique. It is an exhaustive family of flexible models that may fit a wide variety of empirical data. This research investigated the performance of GAMLSS compared to traditionally used approaches of multiple regression-based norming. Both techniques were applied to data of the Brief-Symptom Inventory, which was collected in a sample representative of the Dutch population (N = 1662). Age and gender were taken into account as normpredictors. The approaches showed very high correspondence, expect for a deviation of GAMLSS-based scores in the lower score ranges. None of the two approaches was able to properly capture the relationship between raw scores and age. GAMLSS-based norms did not outperform the regression-based approach. They can be considered equally suitable but in practice the complexity of the GAMLSS approach makes it less convenient. However, its flexibility could be advantageous when applied to tests that are heavily dependent on continuous norm predictors.","['continuous norming', 'regression-based norming', 'GAMLSS', 'IRT', 'Brief- Symptom Inventory']"

Met het stellen van de rode lijn committeerde de president zichzelf tot actie bij overschrijding ervan. Bij het wel of niet nakomen hiervan zijn zowel externe als interne gevolgen aan verbonden. De literatuur kan geen verklaring geven waarom Obama, ondanks de externe gevolgen, geen gehoor gaf aan zijn eigen rode lijn. Het neoklassiek realisme kan met interveniërende variabelen verklaring geven waarom de binnenlandse omstandigheden het voor Obama niet mogelijk maakte zijn rode lijn na te komen. Door aan te tonen welke binnenlandse actoren invloed hadden op het gevoerde buitenlandbeleid na de schending van de lijn, kan dit onderzoek voorgaande literatuur aanvullen en een handvat bieden voor verdere uitwerking van deze theorie op vergelijkbare cases.

(2007) stellen dat de intrinsieke motivatie voor rekenen, in vergelijking met andere schoolvakken, gedurende de schoolperiode het meest daalt. Het is interessant om te achterhalen welke variabelen samenhangen met de intrinsieke rekenmotivatie om inzicht te krijgen in deze ontwikkeling en deze mogelijk zelfs te kunnen vermijden. In dit onderzoek zijn de volgende drie variabelen die mogelijk samenhangen met de intrinsieke rekenmotivatie centraal gesteld: autonomie, leeftijd en sekse. Om antwoord te kunnen geven op de vraag in hoeverre de variabelen autonomie, leeftijd en sekse samenhangen met intrinsieke rekenmotivatie zijn online vragenlijsten afgenomen bij leerlingen uit de groepen 6, 7 en 8 van twee Leidse basisscholen (N = 41). De leerlingen hebben stellingen beantwoord waarmee de intrinsieke motivatie voor een bepaald vak gemeten kan worden, in dit geval: rekenen. De vragenlijst bestaat uit verschillende subschalen, waaronder autonomie. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat de variabele autonomie significant positief samenhangt met de intrinsieke rekenmotivatie. Verder bleek de variabele leeftijd niet significant samen te hangen met de intrinsieke rekenmotivatie. Tot slot zijn er met betrekking tot de samenhang tussen leeftijd en intrinsieke rekenmotivatie geen significante sekseverschillen waargenomen. Van de drie centraal gestelde variabelen bleek dus enkel het ervaren van autonomie positief bij te dragen aan de intrinsieke rekenmotivatie van de onderzochte populatie.","['Intrinsieke rekenmotivatie', 'zelfdeterminatietheorie', 'stage-environment fit theorie', 'IMI']"

A Friend or a Foe: Analysig the Impact of Media Framing Tendencies on the Colombian Reconciliation Process,"García Romero, Celia","['Rrustemi, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Media has often been neglected as a potential asset for peacebuilding due to certain framing tendencies which are deemed to promote polarization and conflict, namely partiality, sensationalism and simplification. Combining framing and reconciliation theories, this thesis explores whether this is indeed the case for Colombia’s reconciliation process following their 50-year long civil war. This qualitative content analysis demonstrates the capability of mainstream media to act as a friend for peace, choosing to employ the abovementioned techniques in manners that actually promote truth-telling, rule of law, and the development of mutual understanding and respect. A sole major pitfall is identified in the newspapers’ reporting approach, as they often overlook the importance of relating current developments to the root causes of the conflict. The consequent limitation of their truth-telling function produces spill-overs to other reconciliation aspects, thereby partially restricting the otherwise positive impact of media. Overall, this thesis challenges conventional narratives depicting media framing tendencies as inherently negative, and therefore opens up new possibilities for peacebuilders, transitional justice institutions, governments and the population to regard media as an ally to peace.","['reconciliation', 'mainstream media', 'peacebuilding']"

Risk and Protective Factors for Depression: A Network Analysis,"Symeonidou, Alexandra","['Fried, E.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The literature on risk and protective factors for depression focuses on biological, demographic, social-environmental, and psychological factors. Estimating a network model, this thesis project explores how dynamic psychological risk and protective factors for depression interact and determines which factors are more central to a network of these factors (Research Question 1). It also tests if dynamic risk and protective coping factors relate to current depressive symptoms, as prior studies suggest (Research Question 2). Cross-sectional data from 453 students at a Dutch higher education participating in the WARN-D research project were analyzed. Overall, protective factors clustered together, as risk factors did. The strongest positive associations emerged between Seeking Distraction and Ignoring and between Locus of Control and Optimism. The strongest negative relations merged between Seeking Social Support and Ignoring, Resilience and Intolerance of Uncertainty, and Catastrophizing. Self-efficacy, Resilience, and Self-esteem were the most central features of the network. The results did not support the hypothesis that all the included risk and protective factors are related to current depressive symptoms. Only some were, with the strongest positive associations being between current depressive symptoms and Persistent Thinking and Optimism. Despite the limitations of the present work, these findings highlight the importance of further research on risk and protective factors for depression.","['Risk Factors', 'Protective Factors', 'Depression', 'Network Analysis']"
Sustainable employability: The capability set for work as predictor of employment status in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"Beißer, Emma","['van der Hiele, K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Perceiving work as a valuable part of life seemingly stimulates long-term (sustainable) employment in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). As up to 80% of patients lose employment after their diagnosis, this study aimed to examine if this can be traced back to a lack of values in the workplace. This study examined whether the Capability Set for Work Questionnaire (CSWQ), measuring valued aspects of work that workers with MS are both enabled and able to achieve, is predictive of sustainable employability. The study examined whether (1) the size of a capability set and (2) a change in the size of such capability sets over time predict loss of employment over 3 years. The study examined (3) whether the capability set has a moderating effect on the association between a change in the size of capability sets and loss of employment, and (4) whether individual expectations of future employability are predictive of employment status after 3 years. Methods/design. This study is a subproject of the 3-year MS@Work study. A total of 10 workers who lost their employment over 3 years and 10 workers who maintained their employment were matched for gender, age, educational level, and type of job. Participants completed online questionnaires on demographics, health, and work functioning/employment status. The CSWQ examined whether seven work values were considered valuable (A), enabled in the work context (B), and achievable (C). When all three criteria were met, a value was considered part of one’s capability set. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the predictive value of those sets concerning sustainable employability. Results. The study did not yield statistically significant results (p ≤ .05), but trends (p ≤ .10) were discovered indicating that larger capability sets (b = -.498, s.e. = .302, Wald X2 (1) = 2.715, p = .099) and higher expectations of future employability (b = -1.097, s.e. = .651, Wald X2 (1) = 3.156, p = .076) increased the chances of maintaining employment. Discussion. The study yielded encouraging results for further research on the CSWQ as a predictive tool for sustainable employability in workers with MS.","['Multiple Sclerosis, work, capability approach, sustainable employability, health']"
Implementation of Bootstrap calibration in Regression Trees for Meta-Analysis,"Megen, Joyce van",['Dr. E.M.L. Dusseldorp'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Meta-analytic tree models (meta-CART) can be widely used to identify possible (multiple) interaction effects and examine how study characteristics explain the heterogeneity in study effect sizes. The algorithm partitions individual studies in more homogeneous groups (i.e. terminal nodes) and in each node a summary effect size is estimated with a naive standard error. Unfortunately, tree based method can be unstable. Since the terminal nodes are generated by an algorithm rather than being predetermined, the complex search strategy that generates these naive standard errors fails to distinguish between a constant (global) and a local optimum and can be over-optimistic. In order to acquire more attainable confidence intervals of the summary effect sizes, the current study introduces a new bootstrap calibration approach to meta-CART models. With bootstrapping, the standards errors are re-estimated in order to correct this underestimation of the naive confidence intervals. The present study was conducted to test the performance of the new bootstrap method extensively via a simulation study and aims to provide more knowledge whether the new approach showed better coverage of the established tree models. The results of the simulation study are very promising. The new method increases the mean coverage, creates wider confidence intervals and provides more accurate summary effect sizes compared to the current naive method.","['Psychology', 'Methodology', 'Statistics', 'Regression Trees', 'Bootstrap Calibration', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Meta-CART', 'metaCART', 'CART', 'decision tree', 'local optimum', 'tree models', 'heterogeneity']"
The influence of cultural values on the effect of person-organization fit and person-group fit on turnover intention and job satisfaction,"Durieux, Esther",['Dr. C.J.M. Verhoeven'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Person-environment (PE) fit is simply defined as the match between an individual and the environment. PE-fit fit has proven to be an important predictor of work related outcomes. A Perceived Person-Environment Fit Scale is developed, which distinguishes four dimensions of PE-fit. Therefore the present research has investigated two of those dimensions in relation to work related outcomes. The present research has examined the relation between person-organization (PO) fit and person-group (PG) fit with the work related outcomes job satisfaction and turnover intention. Furthermore, it was examined whether the strength of those relations is influenced by the individual cultural values uncertainty avoidance and collectivism. In addition, it was also tested whether job satisfaction positively mediates the negative effect of PO-fit and PG-fit on turnover intention. To examine these effects an online survey study was conducted among the general Dutch working population (N = 163). The analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 28. It was predicted and found that PO-fit has a positive effect on job satisfaction and a negative effect on turnover intention, the negative effect on turnover intention was also mediated by job satisfaction. Furthermore, it was also predicted and found that PG-fit has a positive effect on job satisfaction. However, a relation between PG-fit and turnover intention was not found and neither was the mediating effect of uncertainty avoidance and collectivism found. The findings of this research are interesting for organizations. The relations found between the PE-fit dimensions with job satisfaction and turnover intention can be used strategically. By improving employees’ PO-fit and PG-fit job satisfaction can be enhanced and turnover intention reduced.","['person-environment fit', 'person-organization fit', 'person-group fit', 'job satisfaction', 'turnover intention', 'collectivism', 'individualism', 'uncertainty avoidance']"

Vreeke'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Previous studies identified an increased risk of anxiety disorder for children with high behavioural inhibition. This study therefore examines whether the level of behavioural inhibition of children (measured by BIQ-SF) also impacts their immediate Quality of Life (measured by KidScreen-10). Additionally, a comparison is made between children who had or had not experienced a stressful life event. Both factors are tested by means of a one-way ANOVA, using data on 10633 children from Amsterdam around the age of ten. Lastly, a factorial ANOVA is used to investigate whether children with high behavioural inhibition experience a stronger negative impact due to a stressful life event compared to children with low or moderate behavioural inhibition. The results show that a high behavioural inhibition indeed has a medium to large negative effect on Quality of Life (QoL). The hypothesis that a stressful life event has a negative effect on the average QoL also proved to be correct, a medium effect is identified. The hypothesis of an interaction effect was rejected. However, the group means demonstrate that children with high behavioural inhibition who also experienced a stressful life event scored remarkably low on QoL. Their score is lower than children experiencing psychopathology in other studies, which provides evidence to view behavioural inhibition as a significant vulnerability factor in a diathesis-stress model. In conclusion, children with high behavioural inhibition are more likely to experience psychological issues after exposure to a stressor. This knowledge can be valuable for developing preventive psychosocial interventions.",
Aandachtsbias en angst: D e relatie tussen trek angst en aandachtsbias voor milde dreiging en hoge dreiging,"Nuberg, Thirsa",['Dr. P.L.J. Putman'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Abstract A few studies describe that attentional bias and its relation to trait anxiety are moderated by the stimulus threat level. However, the distinction between mild threat (MT) and high threat (HT) level has little empirical study. Therefore the goal of the current study is to investigate the relation between trait anxiety and attentional bias moderated by stimuli of MT and HT level. Fifty-six participants completed a self-report trait anxiety questionnaire and a dual probe task with stimuli of MT and HT level. Results indicated no attentional bias toward stimuli of MT and HT level relative to stimuli of neutral level. Besides that results indicated participants with a higher score on trait anxiety demonstrate increased attentional bias towards stimuli of MT and HT level. These data confirm the relation between trait anxiety and attentional bias toward threat. However, this study do not confirm that attentional bias and its relation to trait anxiety are moderated by the stimulus threat level. Samenvatting Een aantal onderzoeken omschrijven een relatie tussen trek angst en een aandachstbias voor bedreigende stimuli. Echter heeft er nog maar weinig onderzoek plaatsgevonden naar de relatie tussen trek angst en aandachtsbias bij variërende dreigniveaus. Het doel van het huidig onderzoek is om de relatie tussen trek angst en aandachtsbias voor bedreigende stimuli te onderzoeken bij mild dreigende (MD) en hoog dreigende (HD) stimuli. Zesenvijftig gezonde participanten hebben de zelfrapportage vragenlijst State Trait Anxiety Inventory – Trait (STAI-t) ingevuld. Daarnaast voltooiden de participanten de dual probe taak met MD en HD stimuli. Resultaten tonen geen aandachtsbias richting MD en HD stimuli aan ten opzicht van neutrale afbeeldingen. Daarnaast tonen de resultaten aan dat bij een toename van trek angst een toegenomen aandachtsbias richting MD en HD stimuli zichtbaar is. Deze resultaten bevestigen dat er een relatie is tussen trek angst en een aandachtsbias voor bedreigende stimuli. Echter laat de studie geen onderscheid in reactie op MD en HD stimuli zien wat betreft aandachtsbias.",

De invloed van het kijken naar geanimeerde prentenboeken op de voorkeur die kleuters hebben voor papieren prentenboeken,"Lieshout, Kim van","['Swart, E.K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De afgelopen jaren is de samenleving sterk gedigitaliseerd, ook prentenboeken konden niet ontkomen aan deze verandering. Verschillende onderzoekers hebben onderzocht wat de effecten zijn van deze digitale prentenboeken op de taal- en leesvaardigheid van kinderen. Andere onderzoekers hebben onderzocht of kinderen een voorkeur hebben voor de digitale of papieren prentenboeken. Ondanks dat uit de verschillende onderzoeken bleek dat digitale prentenboeken een positieve invloed kunnen hebben op de ontwikkeling van kinderen én dat kinderen beide type boeken leuk vinden, zijn uitgevers huiverig om prentenboeken te digitaliseren. Dit komt mogelijk, doordat ze verwachten dat het digitaliseren van prentenboeken ertoe zal leiden dat de markt voor papieren prentenboeken zal afnemen. In dit onderzoek wordt daarom onderzocht of het kijken naar een geanimeerd prentenboek invloed heeft op de voorkeur die kleuters voor papieren prentenboeken hebben. Hierbij is ook gekeken naar de redenen die kleuters geven voor hun voorkeur. Deze vraag is onderzocht door middel van een quasi-experiment. In drie experimentele condities werd een geanimeerd prentenboek, ofwel een digitaal prentenboek dat geen interactieve elementen bevat, getoond. In twee experimentele condities is het boek driemaal bekeken, in één experimentele conditie is de animatie slechts eenmaal laten zien en in de controleconditie werd geen animatie bekeken. Vervolgens is in zowel de experimentele condities als in de controleconditie een keuzemoment gehouden waarbij de voorkeur van kleuters voor een papieren prentenboek en reden hiervoor zijn uitgevraagd. In totaal hebben 89 kleuters, verdeeld over zeven klassen van twee scholen, deelgenomen aan het onderzoek. De kinderen waren tussen de drie en zes jaar oud (M = 4.74, SD = 0.69) en er waren ongeveer evenveel jongens (n = 43) als meisjes (n = 46). Door middel van tweezijdige proportietoetsen zijn de verschillen in voorkeur tussen kleuters in de verschillende condities geanalyseerd en met een Chi-Kwadraat toets is gekeken of er verschil is tussen het aantal keer bekijken van de geanimeerde prentenboeken. Verder zijn de motieven voor de boekkeuzes gecategoriseerd. Uit de resultaten voor de boekkeuze bleek dat 45% van de kleuters koos voor het geanimeerde prentenboek dat ze gezien hadden in de klas. Ook werd in twee van de drie condities waarin kleuters een geanimeerd prentenboek hadden bekeken, significant vaker gekozen voor het papieren prentenboek van de animatie dan in de controleconditie. Verder bleek dat wanneer kleuters het geanimeerde prentenboek hadden gezien, er geen effect was van het aantal keer dat kleuters een geanimeerd prentenboek hadden gezien op de voorkeur voor het papieren prentenboek. Kleuters gaven een variatie aan motieven voor hun boekkeuze. 41% Van de kleuters gaf niet-specifieke antwoorden zoals ‘Vind ik leuk’ of ‘Weet ik niet’. Kleuters leken met name te kiezen voor papieren prentenboeken door de karakters op de kaft (26,1%), door andere uiterlijke kenmerken van de kaft (12,5%) of door bekendheid met het geanimeerde prentenboek (10,2%). Tot slot zijn de motieven uitgesplitst naar het wel of niet kiezen voor de papieren versie van het geanimeerde prentenboek. Hieruit volgde dat 24,3% van de kleuters die het geanimeerde boek koos, aangaf dat ze dit deden door de animatie die gezien is in de klas. Op basis van de resultaten van het huidige onderzoek volgt het advies om te blijven proberen om uitgevers te overtuigen meer prentenboeken te laten animeren, aangezien het onderzoek geen aanleiding geeft om aan te nemen dat dit ten koste gaat van de verkoop van papieren prentenboeken. Daarnaast is ook het advies om de invloed van geanimeerde prentenboeken op de voorkeur voor papieren prentenboeken van kinderen op grotere schaal te onderzoeken, gezien de beperkingen van dit onderzoek.","['prentenboek', 'leesontwikkeling', 'digitalisering', 'animatie']"

To prevent people with a history of childhood maltreatment from developing depressive symptoms, information about which factors mediate this relationship is needed. Previous research suggests that distress tolerance is one factor that could explain the relationship between childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms. For the current study, we explored the correlations between the different types of childhood maltreatment and distress tolerance. Also, we investigated if distress tolerance plays a mediating role in the relation between childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms. We used a trauma-exposed community sample (N = 304) and only included participants without a current diagnosis. We used several questionnaires to assess the levels of childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms and distress tolerance. Our results were that only emotional abuse was negatively significantly correlated with distress tolerance. The total scores of childhood maltreatment were negatively significantly related to distress tolerance, and positively significantly related to depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we found that distress tolerance had a negative significant association with depressive symptoms. At last, we found that distress tolerance mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and distress tolerance. Our results indicate that childhood maltreatment makes individuals more vulnerable for developing depressive symptoms because of their lower levels of distress tolerance. By focussing on improving distress tolerance, people build more resilience and are less likely to develop depressive symptoms.","['Childhood maltreatment, Distress tolerance, Depressive symptoms, Trauma-exposed community sample.']"
The effects of binaural beats during rest on memory consolidation,"Flierman, Vincent","['Varma, S. + Vogeldang, D.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research has found that Autobiographical Thinking (ABT) affects memory consolidation and can be linked to Alpha- and Slow/Delta range brain oscillations. Binaural beats might therefore be an effective way of improving memory consolidation. The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of binaural beats stimulation on ABT and memory consolidation. 37 participants performed a face encoding task where they judged faces as either friendly or unfriendly. Subsequently, participants experienced 8 minutes of Alpha (9Hz) binaural beat stimulation, Slow/Delta (0.5Hz) binaural beat stimulation, or Control (pink-noise) stimulation. Twice during these 8 minutes, we asked participants to indicate what percentage of time they spend engaged in ABT, and how intense these thoughts were. Memory for each set of faces was subsequently tested in an old/new recognition memory test. Our data did not suggest any significant relation between binaural beats, ABT and memory performance. Alpha range binaural beats were however related with more intense ABT. Notwithstanding the limitations of the current study, it can be concluded that binaural beats might not be a feasible intervention to enhance consolidation of episodic memory. Further research could clarify whether other types of memory do benefit from binaural beats stimulation.","['Binaural beats', 'memory consolidation', 'episodic memory']"

Comparing autism spectrum disorder symptomatology in fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex,"Melaard, Anoek","['Hiele, K. van der', 'Lubbers, K.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders and has a major genetic heterogeneity. Comparing monogenetic causes of ASD can contribute to understanding its genetic aetiology. This study compares patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS) to patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in terms of ASD severity and symptomatology to create an image of their ASD symptom profiles. This could lead to more focused diagnoses and specialized treatment for these patient groups. Methods: This study included children and adolescents (ages 1–18, mean age = 9.01 years) with FXS (n = 57, 80.7% males) or TSC (n = 105, 49.5% males). The second editions of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale and the Social Responsiveness Scale were used to assess ASD symptomatology. First, the prevalence of official ASD diagnoses among FXS and TSC patients was compared. Next, patients with an official diagnosis were compared in terms of (1) overall autism severity, (2) severity of problems within the restricted and repetitive behaviour (RRB) and social affect domains, and (3) more specific ASD symptoms such as ‘reciprocal communication’. Intelligence quotient (IQ; mean IQ = 58.08) was included as a predictor in the logistic regression and as a covariate in both between-group analyses of covariance and all multivariate analyses of covariance. Results: FXS patients are more likely to receive an official ASD diagnosis (χ2 = 4.081, p = .043). Higher IQ is related to less autism symptomatology (χ2 = 8.592, p = .003). Overall, ASD severity of patients with an official ASD diagnosis does not differ between the patient groups. The FXS patients with ASD exhibited more severe RRB (F = 8.21, p = .005). No significant difference was found for social affect or any specific symptoms. Conclusion: ASD prevalence is higher in children with FXS than in children with TSC, with FXS patients exhibiting more severe RRB. This study illustrates the relevance of comparing symptomatology in monogenetic causes of ASD, indicating that syndrome-symptom relationships can be found. This could lead to earlier intervention and focused treatment for these patients and contributes to research on the genetic aetiology of ASD.","['autism spectrum disorder', 'fragile x syndrome', 'tuberous sclerosis complex']"
What to expect when you’re expecting: The influence of the expectations surrounding childbirth on the birth experience in women with and without psychiatric problems,"Capelleveen, Suze van","['Middendorp, H. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: Between 10-15% of women have a pathological fear of childbirth. An expectation of fear might contribute to an actual fearful childbirth experience, which is known as a nocebo effect. Likewise, positive thoughts about childbirth may lead to positive experiences, known as a placebo effect. Negative expectations surrounding childbirth mainly occurs in women who are known with anxiety and depression. As a result of these negative expectations, women could have a prolonged labor and obstetric complications which can evoke traumatic symptoms. The purpose of this study was to research whether there is a predictive association between positive or negative expectations surrounding childbirth and the experience of childbirth and whether this differs in women with or without psychiatric problems. This is relevant because most research on women’s expectations of childbirth are focused on fear of childbirth and its potential impact in medical aspects, whereas in this study the focus is on a broader expectation base, including positive expectations and also the subjective experience of childbirth. Methods: In this prospective study we included in total 150 women from both the Psychiatric Obstetric Pediatric (POP) outpatient clinics, a clinic for pregnant women with psychiatric vulnerability, and the general obstetric clinic, between January 2020 and January 2022. All participants filled in the Wijma Delivery Expectancy (version A at T1) and Experience (version B at T2) questionnaire after providing an informed consent. Also, all participants filled in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and the PTSS checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), to evaluate current psychiatric complaints. Results: The expectation surrounding childbirth was a significant predictor for the childbirth experience after controlling for parity and pain relief, p <.001, whereas positive expectations are related to a positive childbirth experience (placebo effect) and negative expectations are related to a negative childbirth experience (nocebo effect). This was not different for women with or without psychiatric problems, p =.841. Conclusions: Women’s negative and positive expectations of childbirth are related to the childbirth experience, showing indications for both a nocebo and placebo effect. These results can be important for future experimental research to see whether changing the expectation of childbirth in a positive way, could improve the experience of childbirth.","['Fear of childbirth', 'placebo effect', 'nocebo effect', 'psychiatric problems']"
Bayesian Hypothesis Testing: Sequentially Analyzing Real-World Data,"Ardern-Mulhern, Thomas","['Heyman, T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Prior research has compared Bayes factors and p values within Hypothesis testing using t tests (Wetzels et al., 2011). The current research expanded on this comparison to include both t tests and various forms of Analyses of Variance. Further, we conducted maximal n sequential analyses, following the design as proposed by Schönbrodt and Wagenmakers (2018). We conducted two forms of sequential analysis: The fixed order sequential analysis, in which the order the data was presented in the dataset dictated the order by which it was added, and the replicated random order sequential analysis in which the order was randomized, and the procedure repeated 100 times. For both the comparison and Sequential analyses we used Bayesian alternatives to Classical Significance tests with real-world data that were reproduced with author’s assistance by Hardwicke et al. (2018). We found that Bayes factors and p values covary in both t tests and Analyses of Variance. However, we observed Bayes factors that underemphasized the perceived effect by p values, as well as Bayes factors that overemphasized when compared to p values even after performing a sensitivity analysis. We also found that most Sequential analyses produced Bayes factors exceeding a threshold prior to the maximal n, with most analyses exceeding more. We also contextualized our fixed order sequential analysis using the percentage of Bayes factors across the 100 replications of each sequential analysis that exceeded thresholds. We evaluate these findings and propose measures researcher may take based on our findings to utilize optional stopping in a way that is efficient, reasonable and accurate.","['Bayesian Hypothesis Testing', 'Sequential Analysis', 'Optional Stopping', 'Bayes factor', 'Significance Testing', 'Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing', 'p values', 'Analysis of Variance', 't tests']"

Suicide Risk and Borderline Personality Disorder Features: Which diagnostic criteria of BPD are associated with suicide attempts?,"Ott, Linnea Maria Helene","['Krause-Utz, A.D.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Background: As suicide rates are alarmingly high worldwide, finding predictors for suicide is imperative. People with borderline personality disorder (BPD) have a heightened risk of attempting and dying by suicide. BPD is diagnosed using nine distinct criteria, which have all been previously linked to suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and suicide attempts (SA) in people with BPD. However, the results of previous studies vary greatly, and no single diagnostic criterium seemed to have a uniquely strong correlation with SA. The aim of this study was to shed more light on the associations of these criteria and SA by including a large group of people with BPD or other psychiatric illnesses, and healthy participants. Method: Diagnostic criteria and previous SA were assessed in a semi-structured interview by trained clinicians. Data was analyzed with multiple regression analyses in the three groups separately. Results: In BPD participants, the criteria of abandonment avoidance and affective instability were significantly linked to SA, while suicidal and self-harm behaviors only showed a marginally significant predictive effect. In the clinical group, all diagnostic criteria had non-significant effects on the number of SA. The analysis for the healthy group was inconclusive due to restricted range of SA. Conclusion: These findings suggest that abandonment avoidance and affective instability may be the most pronounced risk factors for people with BPD; they are more strongly linked to SA than even suicidal behavior and the remaining diagnostic criteria. In people with other psychiatric illnesses, other risk factors may be more important for SA. This may have implications for suicide prevention in clinical practice, though further research is needed.","['Borderline Personality Disorder', 'BPD', 'suicide attempt', 'suicide risk']"
Het wegen van een weloverwogen advies: Onderzoek naar de factoren die bijdragen aan het advies van wel of geen contact tussen ouders en kinderen boven de twaalf jaar in gezags- en omgangszaken,"Scheenstra, Annabel","['Haan, W. de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek, dat in opdracht van de Raad van de Kinderbescherming regio Amsterdam is uitgevoerd, stond de volgende vraag centraal: Welke factoren spelen er mee om wel of geen contact te adviseren tussen kinderen van boven de twaalf jaar en hun ouders in gezag- en omgangszaken? Deze vraag is onderzocht door middel van twee online focusgroepen met in totaal vijf participanten, die vervolgens getranscribeerd en gecodeerd zijn. De factoren die het meest genoemd zijn, waren: conflicten tussen ouders, contact tussen kind en ouder(s), de mening van het kind, maatwerk, contactfrequentie, onveilige/veilige situatie en loyaliteit van het kind naar ouder(s). Deze factoren moeten wegens de genoemde frequentie in ieder geval meegenomen worden in het adviseringsproces. Daarnaast zijn er nog vele andere factoren naar voren gekomen die in mindere mate genoemd zijn, maar wel in enige mate van belang zijn in het adviseringsproces. Hier wordt in dit adviesrapport op ingegaan. Daarnaast is het advies altijd maatwerk: per kind, per gezin, per situatie moet gekeken worden naar wat van belang is. Dit is ook het advies wat we de Raad meegeven. Beperkingen van het onderzoek zijn de generaliseerbaarheid en dat frequentie en belang van genoemde factoren niet aan elkaar gelijk staan. Dit betekent dat een vaak genoemde factor daarmee niet per se belangrijker hoeft te zijn dan minder genoemde factoren. Verder adviseren we dit onderwerp met vervolgonderzoek verder te onderzoeken. Met een grotere populatie zou vervolgonderzoek een vollediger en robuuster beeld van de meewegende factoren kunnen geven.","['kinderbescherming, contact tussen ouder en kind, adviezen, factoren, gezags- en omgangszaken']"
"Face-to-face, heart-to-heart: Paralinguistic expression in high versus low socially anxious individuals during in-person conversations","Madgwick, Hanrike","['Chen, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study investigated the effect of social anxiety on the expressions of four paralinguistic features; Fundamental frequency (F0), Voice Intensity, Number of pauses, and Pace, as well as the possible moderation of level of self-disclosure in this relationship. Previous research has shown significant effects of social anxiety on all four paralinguistic features and has established a link between social anxiety and level of self-disclosure. However, these have yet to be studied in conjunction - especially in the real-life situation of a face-to-face conversation. Therefore a final sample of 53 students with high or low social anxiety participated in a recorded face-to-face conversation with a confederate. Eighteen questions were asked in an alternating pattern, ranging in different levels of intimacy (High/Low). There were five hypotheses: That HSA individuals would display increased fundamental frequency as compared to LSA individuals, that HSA individuals would have an increased number of pauses as compared to the LSA group, that the HSA group would have a lower intensity as compared to the LSA group, that the HSA group would have a faster speech rate, and that level of intimacy would have a moderating effect on the relationship between level of anxiety and the paralinguistic features. Results revealed no significant effect of level of social anxiety on expression of paralinguistic features. Additionally, we found no evidence for a moderation effect of intimacy on the relationship between social anxiety and paralinguistic features. This study contributed to the growing literature on social anxiety and paralinguistic features, with novel insights into the role of intimacy and aiding in a better understanding that could lead to more suitable and objective measures of social anxiety in the future and help the growing population of those affected by it throughout their lifetime.","['Social Anxiety, Paralinguistics, Self-disclosure, Intimacy, Face-to-face conversations, Fundamental frequency, Intensity, Number of pauses, Pace']"

Schadenfreude, stereotypes as part of someone's worldview, mortality salience, and fundamental psychological needs, such as the need for esteem, need for control, need for a meaningful existence, and need to belong, were all investigated in relation to sharing such videos online. The 132 participants took part in an online study with a 2 worldview (confirming vs disconfirming) by 2 misfortune (lethal vs. non-lethal) between-subjects design. The study featured 3 different videos which were followed by a questionnaire and several demographic questions. The first three hypotheses focused on the effect of worldview on schadenfreude and the willingness to share. The three hypotheses that followed focused on the effect of mortality salience on the fundamental needs and the willingness to share. The final hypothesis incorporated the elements of the first six hypotheses. A series of MANOVAs and ANOVAs for the different videos showed only non-significant or marginally significant effects. Therefore, an exploratory analysis investigated the influence of gender and empathy on schadenfreude. The theoretical and practical implications, as well as limitations and future research, are discussed.","[""Schadenfreude, motivational factors, online sharing, video's online, social media, misforturn""]"
Parental Bonding and Depressive Symptoms in Students: The Mediating Role of Loneliness,"Leimonis, Epameinondas","['Antypa, N.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Parental bonding is a key contributing factor in psychosocial development, since experiencing optimal versus non-optimal bonding has been linked to various mental health outcomes. In the recent years, mood disorders such as depression, as well as loneliness have been on the rise among university students. However, studies examining the link between parental bonding and depressive symptoms among this population have been limited, while the potential role of loneliness on the aforementioned relationship has not been investigated to date. Aim: This study explores the association between parental bonding and depressive symptoms, along with the potential mediating effect of loneliness, among university students. Method: A total of 207 Leiden University students (87.4% female) aged 18-33 years (Μ = 20.17, SD = 2.61) completed a self-reported questionnaire regarding parental bonding, depressive symptoms and loneliness. Results: Non-optimal maternal and paternal bonding significantly predicted higher depressive symptoms, after controlling for a number of sociodemographic variables, b = 6.16, 95% CI [3.52, 8.81], p < .001; b = 6.14, 95% CI [3.52, 8.77], p < .001 respectively. Moreover, there were significant indirect effects of non-optimal maternal and paternal bonding on depressive symptoms through loneliness, after controlling for participants’ living situation, b = 1.40, 95% CI [.53, 2.57]; b = 1.75, 95% CI [.79, 2.89]. Conclusion: Loneliness plays a mediating role in the relationship between parental bonding and depressive symptoms among young adult students. Present study findings could contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms linking parental bonding with depression and related mood disorders.","['Parental bonding, mental health, depressive symptoms, loneliness, students.']"
Does Age and Audience Make the Heart Beat Faster? A Study Into Embarrassment and Pride,"Aerssens, Maggie","['Riddel, C.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite the substantial impact of embarrassment and pride on social relations and situations, little is known about the physiological response accompanying these emotions. Both emotions have an interpersonal character and have a peculiar developmental pattern across childhood. This makes it interesting to investigate the impact of the social context in which they occur and whether there are differences across ages. Therefore, this study aims to identify whether there is a difference in heart rate reactivity across ages during the elicitation of embarrassment and pride. Additionally, we examined whether heart rate reactivity is affected by an audience in the immediate environment. It was expected to find a gradual increase in HR acceleration across ages for embarrassment and pride. Additionally, an audience condition would lead to significantly more HR acceleration than a solitary condition for both emotions. We investigated 176 individuals in three different age groups: 3.5-5-year-olds, 8-10-year-olds, and adults. All participants performed a singing and a puzzle task to elicit embarrassment and pride and were divided into an audience and solitary condition during measurement. Results showed a gradual increase in heart rate acceleration across the three age groups during the elicitation of embarrassment. During the elicitation of pride, we found no differences in heart rate reactivity between the three age groups. In addition, we found no differences in heart rate reactivity between the audience and the solitary condition for embarrassment and pride. The results suggest different physiological development patterns for pride and embarrassment. In addition, it shows that a small audience does not influence the heart rate at different ages. Future research could focus on different types of audiences, emotion elicitors, and the influence of different cultures on a wider range of physiological reactivity.","['self-consciousness emotions, pride, embarrassment, heart rate, development, audience']"
Broers en zussen: geliefde rivalen: Een onderzoek naar de samenhang tussen kindfactoren en agressie bij broers en zussen in de adolescentiefase,"Wassen, Merel","['Berkel, S.R. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Aim: The relationship between siblings is unique for its duration and intensity in one’s life. When this relationship is hostile, it is plausible that siblings experience negative consequences. For example, siblings may have more externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems like antisocial behaviour or a low self-esteem. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to examine whether the child characteristics birth order, gender composition, and age gap are associated with aggression between siblings in adolescence. Method: Data were collected among 34 sibling pairs. In general, 6 brother-brother pairs, 23 brother-sister/sister-brother pairs, and 5 sister-sister pairs were included. The age of the participants ranged from 10 to 18 years old. The average age of the oldest brother/sister of the sibling pair was 14.65 years old (SD = 1.90) and the average age of the youngest brother/sister of the sibling pair was 11.71 years old (SD = 1.69). Sibling aggression was measured with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales – sibling version (CTS2-SP). In the current study, merely subscales for physical assault and verbal aggression were used and were combined to compose aggression. Results: The results showed that there was no difference found between older and younger siblings and their mutual aggression. Moreover, no difference was found between gender composition and sibling aggression. Finally, no coherence was found between age gap and aggression nor between gender of both siblings and aggression. Conclusion: In contrast to previous studies, child characteristics were not related to sibling aggression in adolescence. Future research should include a more objective method of measuring sibling aggression in addition to questionnaires. Furthermore, the use of a high-risk sample is recommended for future studies. More research is necessary to get a more complete view of which child characteristics are related to sibling aggression in adolescence.","['Sibling aggression', 'birth order', 'gender composition', 'age gap', 'CTS2-SP']"
"The Role of Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability, and S-Ketamine Metabolite Levels in S-Ketamine’s Antidepressant Effects","Linden, Esther",['Amanda Moreira João'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"With only approximately two thirds of patients that suffer from major depressive disorder responding to traditional antidepressant treatment, the need for novel antidepressants, such as ketamine, is evident. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist has been shown to have rapid, but short-term antidepressant effects. To investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying these effects, this study examined the effects of heart rate, heart rate variability, and of the plasma concentration of S-ketamine’s metabolites S-norketamine and S-hydroxynorketamine on the drug’s antidepressant properties. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial with a cross-over design, 17 healthy women aged 18-28 attended two test sessions, in which they received a placebo and an intravenous subanesthetic dose of S-ketamine (0.4 mg/kg). Depression scores were determined with a single-item visual analogue scale, cardiovascular measures were examined through vectorcardiogram in an fMRI scanner, and the metabolite plasma levels were determined through regular blood samples. The S-ketamine administration did not lead to a significant decrease in depression scores. There also were no associations between the cardiovascular measures and depression scores, and the S-ketamine, S-norketamine, and S-hydroxynorketamine levels were not associated with changes in depression scores. Previous results, which suggested that S-ketamine causes a rapid increase in heart rate and a decrease in heart rate variability were replicated. These results signify that S-ketamine might have different effects in healthy individuals, compared to depressed ones, possibly due to general differences in heart rate. Additionally, differences in metabolization, potentially modified by the antibiotic rifampicin, could alter S-ketamine’s antidepressant effects and should be examined in future research.","['S-ketamine, depression, metabolites, heart rate, heart rate variability']"
Brooding Rumination and Reflective Pondering in Relation to Stress and Sleep Quality,"Wang, Victoria Lingxiao",['Sebla Umay Aksungur'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Greater perceived stress is associated with maladaptive repetitive thinking, which can be divided into worry and rumination. Previous literature found associations between rumination, stress, and sleep quality; however, for the subcomponents of rumination, namely brooding rumination and reflective pondering, only a relationship between brooding rumination and stress has been found in which brooding rumination increases after the occurrence of a stressor. In order to gain more insights into both the relationship of brooding rumination and sleep quality in moderation of academic stress in students, and to exploratively investigate the relationships between brooding rumination and reflective pondering with sleep quality, an online questionnaire using the Ruminative Response Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Perception of Academic Stress was used with Leiden university students. The hierarchical multiple linear regression with interaction did not find a moderation effect for academic stress on the relationship between brooding rumination and sleep quality with F(3, 43) = 0.98 p = .413, and both simple linear regressions revealed insignificant results for an association between brooding rumination and reflective pondering with sleep quality with F(1, 44) = 1.35 p = .252 and F(1, 44) = 0.06, p = .803, respectively. Whereas the latter finding may suggest an association of the subcomponents of rumination with sleep quality through the possible mediator depression, the former finding could be depicted in a simple slope analysis that suggested a moderation effect of academic stress after all. The clinical relevance of this study therefore lies on the moderation effect of academic stress and the relationships between rumination, sleep quality, and depression.","['rumination', 'brooding rumination', 'reflective pondering', 'sleep quality', 'academic stress']"

The Legal Vacuum in United Nations Peacekeeping Missions: The Contribution of the ‘Effective Control’ Test to State Accountability in Peacekeeping,"Bijker, Fieke","['Kinacioglu, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"United Nations peacekeeping missions are increasingly criticised for their failures to protect civilians and even for human rights abuses by peacekeepers. The victims of this misconduct have been trying to get reparation in court by holding the UN legally accountable. However, with the UN being protected by its immunity, they have started turning to the State as an alternative legal avenue. The academic debate has followed this turn of events by asking if and how a troop-contributing country (TCC) should be held accountable in court. Scholars are arguing in favour of applying the ‘effective control’ test to reach attribution to the State. This thesis will, therefore, aim to answer the question: In what ways can the ‘effective control’ test contribute to State accountability in peacekeeping? It will do so by applying a qualitative, legal doctrinal approach to a case study: the fall of Srebrenica (1995). The Srebrenica cases (2008-2019), which ensued from this instance of peacekeeping failure, provide insights into the contribution of the ‘effective control’ test to peacekeeping accountability. This thesis will conclude that the ‘effective control’ test according to the preventive interpretation, based on Article 7 ARIO, allows for a wide attribution to the State and thus State accountability in peacekeeping.","['peacekeeping accountability', 'State accountability', 'the ‘effective control’ test', 'the fall of Srebrenica']"

Contestation of cyberspace norm: Following the conflict A Constructivist Analysis of the International Norm of Non-intervention in Cyberspace Following the conflict A Constructivist Analysis of the International Norm of Non-intervention in Cyberspace,"den Boer, Thijs",['Hilde van Meegdenburg'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The creation of cyberspace has drastically problematized how states interact with each other. This thesis aims to understand the dynamics of international norms of sovereignty and non-intervention in cyberspace, and how they relate to already existing norms established in the physical world. To study this, Antje Wiener’s theory of contestation is used as a conceptual tool for explaining how norms have developed in cyberspace in the last two decades. Contestation is a social practice in which states show their disapproval of norms, aiming to alter them in their favor. Through these instances of contestation, norm development can be identified. The theory is applied to United Nations dialogues on cyberspace norms, as well as two pivotal cyberattack cases. The results of the analysis show that cyberspace norms follow a rather recognizable development pattern, going through all the stages contestation theory puts forth. Furthermore, the content of the empirical evidence shows that cyberspace norms are highly based on comparable norms in the physical world. This results in a paradox, where eventually cyberspace norms are adopted from earlier existing norms, but still need a conventional norm development of over two decades before these norms are slowly being implemented, meaning that international agreements, such as the UN Charter did not speed up this process.",
De Feuerstein methode: een methode met potentie: Een onderzoek naar de waargenomen effectiviteit van de methode en adviezen over het bevorderen van transfer,"Jong, Loïs de","['Veerbeek, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het Feuerstein Centrum Nederland houdt zich bezig met de behandeling en begeleiding van mensen met leerproblemen en/of ontwikkelingsstoornissen. De methode is gericht op het ontwikkelen van leer- en denkstrategieën vanuit de theorie van Reuven Feuerstein. Bij aanvang van de behandeling met deze methode wordt er een dynamische toets afgenomen, waarbij er een analyse wordt gemaakt van de verschillende cognitieve functies van de cliënt. Tijdens de behandeling wordt er getracht de onderontwikkelde cognitieve functies te ontwikkelen door middel van interactie met een tussenpersoon. Deze rol wordt bij de behandeling vervuld door een zogeheten mediator, die als bemiddelaar tussen de wereld en het kind staat en helpt om betekenis te geven aan alle indrukken en prikkels vanuit de omgeving van de cliënt. Deze mediator doet verschillende soorten oefeningen met de cliënt en focust hierbij voornamelijk op het denkproces in plaats van op de uitkomsten van de oefening. De mediatoren werken vanuit de gedachte dat elk kind effectief kan 'leren leren' door middel van de juiste begeleiding. Het centrum wil met de Feuerstein methode zo veel mogelijk kinderen en jongvolwassenen helpen met achterstanden en leerproblematiek. Om dit te realiseren zou het gunstig zijn als scholen en ouders op de hoogte zijn van de methode en de effectiviteit hiervan, zodat de methode meer bekendheid krijgt. In huidig onderzoek is getracht om de door leerkrachten waargenomen effectiviteit van de methode te onderzoeken. Daarnaast is er onderzocht hoe de methode beter overgedragen kan worden naar de leersituatie in de klas (transfer). Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: “In hoeverre zien leerkrachten effecten op het leergedrag van de kinderen die met de Feuerstein methode behandeld worden in de klas en hoe kunnen volgens de leerkrachten de mediatoren transfer - van wat geleerd is tijdens de behandeling - naar de klas bevorderen?” Om tot beantwoording van de onderzoeksvraag te komen is er een kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd. Deze bestond uit een literatuuronderzoek en semigestructureerde interviews. In totaal zijn er vier participanten geïnterviewd; twee leerkrachten en twee mediatoren. Uit het literatuuronderzoek is gebleken dat voor een goede transfer er zo veel mogelijk overeenkomsten gecreëerd moeten worden tussen de leersituatie en de situatie waarin het geleerde toegepast moet worden. Daarnaast is het hebben van een growth mindset bij zowel leerkrachten als leerlingen bevorderlijk voor de leerprestaties van leerlingen. 3 Uit de interviews is gebleken dat alle participanten een goed contact tussen het Feuerstein centrum en de leerkracht belangrijk achten, maar sommigen hierin tekorten hebben ervaren. Aan de hand van de literatuur en de interviews zijn de volgende adviezen opgesteld voor het Feuerstein centrum: (1) verbeteren van het contact tussen het centrum en de leerkracht (2) de leerkracht informeren over de behandeling met de Feuerstein methode en (3) concrete tips aanreiken aan de leerkrachten. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat goede communicatie tussen het centrum en de leeromgeving belangrijk is. Wanneer zowel de mediatoren als de leerkrachten voldoende op de hoogte zijn van de doelen van de cliënt, kunnen zij efficiënter aan dit gezamenlijke doel werken. Door het informeren van de leerkracht en het aanbieden van praktische tips kan het centrum de leerkracht ondersteunen om de contexten beter op elkaar te laten aansluiten, wat de transfer bevorderd. Een limitatie aan dit onderzoek is dat er slechts vier participanten hebben deelgenomen aan het onderzoek. Een advies voor vervolgonderzoek zou zijn om dit onderzoek op een grotere schaal uit te voeren. Met een grotere steekproef kan er meer duidelijkheid ontstaan over de visie van leerkrachten en mediatoren omtrent de methode.","['Feuerstein methode', 'Mindset']"
Aggression in Borderline Personality Disorder – A Mediation Model,"Kaffenberger, Jan","['Krause-Utz, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is frequently understood as a condition associated with aggressive behavior, while the contributing factors are less understood. Based on the existing literature, it was suggested that impulsivity and acute dissociation might be important factors promoting aggressive behavior in BPD. The main objective of the study was to experimentally test a mediation model, in which higher BPD symptomatology would be associated with increased behavioral aggression, mediated by impulsivity and dissociation. Methods: In an all-female sample (N = 87), 29 individuals diagnosed with BPD were compared against 28 clinical controls (CC, diagnosis of ADHD without comorbid BPD) and 30 healthy controls (HC). Participants were tested baseline and in an experimentally induced stress condition. Aggression was assessed with the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), impulsivity with the GoStop impulsivity paradigm and the Immediate Memory Task (IMT), and dissociation was measured with the Dissociative Stress Scale (DSS-4). Results: Individuals with BPD did not display higher rates of provoked aggression than the CC and HC groups. Furthermore, aggression was not mediated by either impulsivity (GoStop task), dissociation, or both in a serial mediation. An additional exploratory analysis yielded a significant mediation effect via impulsivity when measured with the IMT. Conclusion: A current diagnosis with BPD was not associated with elevated levels of aggression compared to healthy and clinical controls. The fact that one indicator of impulsivity yielded a significant mediation effect informs future research and entails implications for the treatment of BPD.","['borderline, personality disorder, BPD, aggression, dissociation, impulsivity']"

Ook is onderzocht wat er verandert in deze behandeling als er daarnaast sprake is van persoonlijkheidsproblematiek. Hiervoor is een literatuuronderzoek uitgevoerd en zijn acht therapeuten geïnterviewd. Uit het literatuuronderzoek bleek dat de universele aanpassingen aan therapieën voor cliënten met ASS overeen lijken te komen met de specifieke aanpassingen die worden voorgesteld als er naast ASS ook sprake is van gehechtheidstrauma en persoonlijkheidsproblematiek. Wel kunnen er bij deze comorbiditeit specifieke traumagerichte therapieën ingezet worden zoals EMDR of TG-CGT. Uit de interviews kwam naar voren dat therapeuten het vooral belangrijk vinden om aan te sluiten bij de interesses, wensen, intrinsieke motivatie en belevingswereld van de cliënt. Ook de betrokkenheid van ouders of een ander hechtingsfiguur tijdens de behandeling, begrip van de therapeut en het stellen van concrete vragen scoorden hoog als werkzaam element. Er bestond het minst consensus over het inzetten van EMDR en het gebruik van visuele hulpmiddelen tijdens de behandeling. Het advies in dit rapport is om werkzame elementen, waaronder het aansluiten bij de cliënt, begrip tonen en concrete vragen stellen, te includeren in de behandeling.","['gehechtheidstrauma', 'autismespectrumstoornis', 'persoonlijkheidsproblematiek']"

Children growing up in poverty have more uncertain surroundings, where less inhibition and better switching enables them to better take advantage of opportunities. Hypothesis 1 predicted that childhood scarcity would be positively related to cognitive switching, but only when participants were tested while in a scarcity mind-set. Hypothesis 2 predicted that childhood scarcity would be negatively related to inhibition, but again only while participants had a scarcity mind-set. Previous studies that applied the sensitized-specialized hypothesis to the relationship between childhood scarcity and adult executive functioning found inconsistent results. A reproduction study with different methods was therefore performed to see whether these methods would find clear effects of childhood scarcity. Participants were induced into a scarcity mind-set by letting them recall a moment of perceived financial scarcity. Switching was measured with the Number-Letter task, while inhibition was measured with an anti-saccade task. No support was found for Hypothesis 1, while partial support was found for Hypothesis 2. It is advised to perform more research in an ecologically valid environment.","['cognitive switching (shifting), inhibition, childhood scarcity, childhood unpredictability, Life History Theory, sensitized-specialized hypothesis']"
Thematic Analysis on Autobiographical Narratives of Dissociation in BPD,"Lee, Gyeorye Kyeorei (Reia)",['Dr. dr. Annegret Krause-Utz'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Dissociation is a complicated trans-diagnostic symptom involving disruptions in normally integrated psychological functions, such as consciousness, self- and other- perception, and somatic functions observed in various mental health disorders, including Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Dissociative symptoms are commonly reported among individuals with psychological trauma and frequently occur in interpersonal situations with high stress. The episodic/narrative contents of dissociation are known to exhibit a sequence of fear responses (defence cascade) in relation with one’s capacity to counteract, implying that individuals pass through narrated phases of the cascade during their dissociation. Objective: We aimed to identify narrative characteristics and thematic patterns of the BPD population’s lived experiences during dissociations. Method: A previous study's data (autobiographical narratives of dissociation episodes scripted by twenty female participants aged 18-45 with BPD diagnosis) were used. ‘Thematic Analysis’ was applied without presumptive hypotheses. The coded data were reviewed multiple times by the authors, and a software for qualitative research (NVivo) was used at the end to replicate the process. Results: We identified four overarching themes (Emotion Dysregulation, Interpersonal Dysregulation, Dissociation Triggers and Dissociation Symptoms) after analysing 20 scripts coded into 63 references. Each reference contained a block of text representing meaning-units. The frequency per theme and sub-theme represented the number of times each (sub)theme appeared in the scripts, excluding overlaps. Negative emotion and/or interpersonal dysregulation frequently appeared in response to triggers generating dissociation symptoms interlinked with emotional and interpersonal disturbances. Conclusions: Findings suggest dissociative experiences in BPD may be closely linked to emotional and interpersonal dysregulation. Schemata related to rejection sensitivity and mistrust may cause negative emotions triggering dissociation symptoms. The perceived threat may increase psychological arousal leading to detachment from the self (depersonalisation) and/or surroundings (derealisation). Shedding more light on this in future research may help target dissociation.","['dissociation, borderline personality disorder (BPD), thematic analysis, schema, trauma, fear response, qualitative research, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)']"

"A doctrinal approach to the application of notions of IHL to cyber operations during armed conflict: ""How do key notions of IHL apply to cyber operations during armed conflict?""","Nuwenhof, Britt","['Hussain, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The utilization of cyber operations in armed conflict is a fact of life and on top of the agenda worldwide. When Russia began a large-scale military invasion in Ukraine in February 2022, many anticipated the kinetic action to be accompanied by comprehensive cyber operations. So far, cyber operations in Ukraine appear to be somewhat subdued. These cyber operations are covered by international humanitarian law (IHL) to the extent that they have a connection to armed conflict. The cyber operations that have been undertaken so far have been on the borderline of some of the most debated issues in the law regarding cyber operations. Although there is consensus that IHL applies to cyber operations during armed conflict, there is still discussion on how notions of IHL apply to cyber operations during armed conflict. Issues about the notion of “attack” and the notion of “object” are widely debated among scholars, but there is still no common understanding of the concepts. Several scholars have provided different approaches on how to apply both notions. However, the shortcoming of these different approaches is that they discuss the notions in theory, but don’t apply them in practice. This thesis wants to fill the gap of the how-question in practice by applying the key notions of “attack” and “object” of IHL to a cyber operation during an armed conflict that has already happened: the Russian-Georgian cyber conflict. This reveals that a combination of the approaches for both notions will provide the best outcome.","['IHL', 'cyber operations', 'armed conflict']"

Ik voorspelde dat sportintensiteit een positieve relatie heeft met self-efficacy en self-efficacy een positieve relatie met leerpotentieel op de werkvloer. Er werd verondersteld dat de positieve relatie tussen sportintensiteit en het leerpotentieel op de werkvloer wordt gemedieerd door self-efficacy. Om deze hypothesen te testen werd een vragenlijst, elke week voor drie weken lang, ingevuld door typische volwassenen die minimaal 32 uur in de week werken. De hiërarchische regressie analyses laten zien dat één van de drie voorspellingen bevestigd is. De gemiddelde sportintensiteit van week 1 brengt geen verandering teweeg in de mate van self-efficacy van week 1 naar week 2. Self-efficacy, gemeten in week 2, heeft wel significante invloed op het leerpotentieel op de werkvloer. Self-efficacy en leerpotentieel op de werkvloer blijken constante variabelen over de tijd te zijn. Wanneer er niet wordt gecontroleerd voor een eerdere week bestaat er wel een significante positieve relatie tussen de drie variabelen. En self-efficacy medieert dan wel de positieve relatie tussen sportintensiteit en leerpotentieel. Er wordt beschreven hoe deze resultaten bijdragen aan de wetenschappelijke literatuur en werknemers en werkgevers handvat kunnen bieden de werkervaring positief te veranderen. Tot slot worden er aanbevelingen genoemd voor vervolgonderzoek.",

Bloodshed Technology? The Impact of Social Media Access on the Onset of Intrastate Conflict,"Baier, Clemens",['Dr. Juan Masullo Jimenez'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"While there is a growing body of research on the effects of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on the onset of intrastate conflict, the effects of social media access have not been analyzed thoroughly based on a large N, cross-country study. In this study, the impact of social media access on the onset of intrastate conflict is assessed, using country-year data (2000-2020) for 173 countries. It was hypothesized that social media access leads to an increase in the onset of intrastate conflict, ceteris paribus. Additionally, it was also hypothesized that the effect of social media access on the onset of intrastate conflict is stronger in more ethnically homogenous countries. These hypotheses were tested using a binomial logistic regression model. The main results of the analysis indicate there is only a significant correlation between Internet access and the onset of non-ethnic intrastate conflict. These results suggest that intrastate conflict is too broad of a category and should be disaggregated into smaller subgroups to develop more accurate empirical analyses. This research advances not only the study of intrastate conflict onset but also the academic discussion on the effects of social media access.","['Social Media', 'Conflict', 'Ethnic Conflict', 'Non-Ethnic Conflict', 'Intrastate Conflict Onset']"

How the EU aggregates foreign policy: Is the EEAS expanding to meet the needs of the expanding EEAS?,"Sintorn, Manfred","['Heaphy, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The European Union (EU) has a substantially more united foreign policy than any other international organisation. Said expansive joint foreign policy has developed in an inhospitable setting where its members hold widely different interests and perspectives on joint foreign policy. Given states’ tendency to jealously guard sovereignty over their foreign policy, how the EU’s foreign policy structures and instruments have been aggregated remains unclear. This paper addresses this via the question “Through what mechanism did the EU aggregate its foreign policy between 2014 and 2021?” and applies a modified ‘Failing Forward’ framework where foreign policy is aggregated via a process of problem-solving by problem-making resulting in an iterative institutionalisation causal mechanism. To analyse whether this mechanism is present, this study adopts a theory-testing process-tracing research method on the development of EU foreign policy structures and instruments from 2014 to 2021. It argues that the aggregation of the EU’s foreign policy relies on iterative intergovernmental and neofunctional processes establishing an integrative causal feedback loop. Examining how the EU aggregates foreign policy is valuable to both EU policymakers and actors within other international organisations seeking greater unison in their foreign policy and contributes to research on international integration in intergovernmental settings.","['EEAS', 'EU Foreign policy', 'Integration', 'CFSP', 'Failing Forward']"

Wind of change? An institutionalist approach to China's evolving policy on peacekeeping operations,"Mathis, Hanna",['Janina Heaphy'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"China’s rise in political power over the last decades has been reflected by its growing international influence, e.g., in international organisations like the World Bank or the United Nations. Especially its role in the UN Security Council is of importance as China holds one of the permanent seats. One important agenda item of the SC is peacekeeping operations. China’s peacekeeping policy has attracted significant scholarly attention. However, there is a theoretical gap as previous research has not yet focused on the influence of institutions on China, in particular its peacekeeping approach. This study aims to fill this gap by looking at how China’s increase in political power affects its peacekeeping policy. In order to answer this question, this paper connects prior research findings with an analysis of UNSC meeting records on peacekeeping operations from 2000-2003 to explore China’s evolving peacekeeping policy. The analysis provides mixed results: While there is clear evidence for a path dependence and the critical juncture, there is ambiguity regarding a change in China’s peacekeeping policy after 2001.","['China', 'United Nations', 'Peacekeeping Operations', 'Shanghai Cooperation Organization']"

The Effect of the European Commission in EU Security and Defence Integration,"Albares Infante, Adriana","['Haigh, S.', 'Verschoor, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Decisions over the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) in the EU have been historically confined to the European Council and thus the European member states (EU MS). Nonetheless, the European Commission (EC) finds itself increasingly involved in security and defense policy integration. This gradual yet certain shifting of power from the intergovernmental to supranational level within the EU's CSDP remains a gap in the literature. So far, the literature has acknowledged the relevant role of the European Commission in the integration of ""low politics"" policy areas like trade. However, it has neglected the role of the European Commission in ""high politics"" policy areas like security and defense. This paper investigates the research question: to what extent is the European Commission a relevant actor in EU security and defense integration? The paper argues for an increasingly relevant position of the European Commission, particularly within the EU's security policy integration. Specifically, this paper adopts a historical neo-institutionalist theory, process tracing methodology, and an interpretivist approach. It bases its analysis of the CSDP's developments on a longitudinal case study design from 2009 to today. It concludes that the EC is a relevant actor in the EU's security policy integration but not yet one for the EU's defense policy integration.","['European integration, European Commission, European Council, security, defense, historical institutionalism, critical junctures, path dependence, windows of opportunity, EU institutional power dynamics']"
"The Alliance Security Dilemma, NATO and Strategic Consensus","Andrews, Jack",['Stephen Haigh'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Despite the multidimensional threat posed to European security by China, NATO allies have not yet crafted a coordinated strategy for the Alliance to address this threat. NATO’s current Strategic Concept was published in 2010 and does not mention China once. This alarming observation warrants research that may shed light on the Alliance’s inability to formulate a coherent policy to face the Chinese threat. The extant literature that has examined the post-formation strategies states enact has predominantly drawn on Snyder’s (1984) alliance security dilemma framework and has chiefly considered bilateral alliances in the East Asian context, with minimal scholarly attention paid to NATO. This research thus aims to fill the lacuna by clarifying the link between allies’ strategies and the determinant factors underpinning them in a multilateral, European context. This paper constitutes a comparative case study of the United Kingdom and France’s respective alliance security dilemmas and strategies. To conduct this analysis, it draws on Press-Barnathan’s (2006) refined framework and adopts the interpretivist method based on scientific realism. This research finds that, in the absence of the dilemma, the UK enacts cooperative strategies with the United States while France, under a more intense dilemma, enacts autonomous strategies. These discordant strategies underpin two NATO stances oriented around confrontation and engagement, which are ultimately incongruent with reaching strategic consensus.","['Alliance security dilemma, entrapment fear, abandonment fear, consensus, post-alliance formation strategy, cooperation, division-of-labour, pact-of-restraint']"

Prenatal psychopathology affects early and later child development. The present study analyzed limited maternal emotion regulation and bipolarity during pregnancy and infant anxiety, sadness and aggression at six months. Method. The data derives from the longitudinal study “Een Goed Begin”, in which expectant mothers and their child from the Netherlands were followed during their pregnancy and after birth. For the current study, data from screening instruments were used to perform predictive analyses. Results. Limited maternal emotion regulation during pregnancy was not predictive of anxiety, sadness and aggression in infants at six months. Bipolarity of the expectant mothers was only predictive of aggression of the infants at six months. Collectively, the predictors were not predictive of fear, sadness and aggression. Unexpectantly, positive relationships were found between maternal bipolarity during pregnancy and infant anxiety and aggression at six months when the mother reported low emotion regulation problems. Conclusion. Based on the results it cannot be said with absolute certainty that mood problems in pregnant mothers are predictive of negative emotions in infants at six months. That said, it seems that a high degree of bipolarity symptoms during pregnancy is predictive of anxiety and aggression of the infant at six months.",['Emotieregulatie bipolariteit zwangerschap angst verdriet agressie zuigelingen een goed begin']

In het huidige onderzoek is de invloed van de presentatievorm op het verhaalbegrip onderzocht bij kinderen tussen de 8 en 12 jaar. Tevens werd gekeken of het verhaalbegrip anders was voor kinderen jonger en ouder dan 10 jaar en of de presentatievorm van invloed was op de zelfgerapporteerde aandacht van het kind. In een within-subjects experimentele studie hebben 83 kinderen drie verhalen in drie verschillende presentatievormen (tekst, audio, video) aangeboden gekregen. Het verhaalbegrip werd gemeten aan de hand van begripsvragen na afloop van het verhaal en de kinderen beoordeelden hun aandacht tijdens het verhaal. Het bleek dat kinderen het verhaal in de video presentatievorm beter begrepen dan in de tekst presentatievorm. Tussen de video presentatievorm en audio presentatievorm, en de audio presentatievorm en tekst presentatievorm zat geen verschil. Bovendien bleek leeftijd geen invloed te hebben op de verschillen in het verhaalbegrip tussen de presentatievormen. Tot slot was de zelfgerapporteerde aandacht bij de video presentatievorm hoger dan bij de tekst en audio presentatievormen. Tussen de audio en tekst presentatievormen was geen verschil.

Recognition vs. redistribution - a false dichotomy?,"Schaap, Martine","['Zwart, F. de']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Recognition has been established as a right in political theory, with the argument that it is connected to justice since misrecognition can inflict injury to one’s identity. Meanwhile in political theory there is debate about whether recognition drives out redistribution or that redistribution will eventually follow from recognition, however empirical evidence is scarce. One cross-national analysis by Banting et al. (2006) analysed the effect of multicultural recognition policies on redistribution, but concluded that there was no correlation between recognition and redistribution. Nancy Fraser (2000) made a distinction between two different kinds of recognition politics: status and identity politics. She claims that the latter drives out redistribution, while status politics does not. This thesis looks at whether the difference between identity politics and status politics can explain why recognition and redistribution are not correlated in the study by Banting et al., and if identity recognition policies indeed drive out redistribution. The performed cross-national statistical analysis does not support the hypothesis that multicultural identity policies drive out redistribution. However the data does hint in this direction.","['recognition', 'redistribution', 'identity politics', 'status politics', 'multiculturalism']"

De betrouwbaarheid van kleur-emotieassociaties: In hoeverre zijn kleur-emotieassociaties van basisschoolleerlingen vanaf 7 jaar bij het herkennen van emoties van anderen betrouwbaar?,"Boncz, Laura","['Nefs, H.T.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd in opdracht van Jeanette van Tricht, oprichtster van de methode Buts en Bofn. Buts en Bofn is ontwikkeld met als doel lastige onderwerpen bespreekbaar te maken. De methode bestaat uit gekleurde houten blokjes waarmee persoontjes kunnen worden opgebouwd. Het gebruik van deze verschillende kleuren kan iemand helpen om zijn of haar emoties uit te drukken. Een onderdeel van de methode is een legendakaart. Dit is een werkblad dat de therapeut voor de therapiesessie kan invullen met de cliënt. Op die manier kunnen er afspraken worden gemaakt over welke emotie aan welke kleur wordt toegekend door de cliënt en kan de therapeut de cliënt beter begrijpen. De legendakaart die Buts en Bofn gebruikt, is gebaseerd op het idee dat mensen kleur-emotieassociaties maken. Om te onderzoeken hoe de legendakaart het beste geïmplementeerd kan worden, is er onderzocht in hoeverre kleur-emotieassociaties van basisschoolleerlingen vanaf 7 jaar bij het herkennen van emoties van anderen betrouwbaar zijn. Om hier antwoord op te kunnen geven, hebben 58 participanten op twee meetmomenten een vragenlijst ingevuld waarbij zij kleuren aan de emoties van gezichten moesten koppelen. Uit dit onderzoek bleek dat er sprake is van een beperkte test-hertest betrouwbaarheid van kleur-emotieassociaties. Dit betekent dat kinderen niet per definitie dezelfde kleur toekennen aan een emotie op twee verschillende momenten. Op basis van dit onderzoek kan geadviseerd worden om de legendakaart voor elke therapeutische sessie opnieuw in te vullen met het kind en altijd te blijven vragen welke emotie een kind met een kleur aanduidt.","['Kleur', 'Emoties', 'Kleur-emotieassociaties', 'Betrouwbaarheid.']"

Beyond the Federal-Unitary Distinction: Examining the Autonomy of Constituent Units Across Federations,"Sikkema, Tim",['Adina Akbik'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This master thesis examines the autonomy of constituent units across different federations. No comprehensive study has thus far accounted for these differences. This master thesis will therefore help fill that gap by examining in particular the asymmetric structures and origins of federations. Asymmetric tendencies appear to be mainly symbolic, as there are no significant differences compared to symmetric federations. Still, this is of major importance to keep some ethnic minorities inside the federal state . The recognition of special groups’ positions, without granting them substantially more autonomy proves a means of balancing the interests of different groups and keeping them together. The origins of federations do not result in a significant effect, which means that the initial distribution of powers is not fixed, but subject to continuous change. Three control variables are added, the dual/cooperative character of which turns out to account best for the autonomy of constituent units. Constituent units enjoy more autonomy in federations where powers are either assigned to the national or sub-national level as opposed to federations in which both tiers of government are involved in the same policy areas. All contemporary 24 federations have been included in the analysis, which means the findings apply directly to the entire population.",
Political Discourse in Times of Crisis: The Impact of the 2015-2016 Refugee Crisis on the Parliamentary Discourse in the Netherlands and Greece,"Spiridakis, Anna","['Akbik, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to understand the impact of the 2015-2016 refugee crisis on the parliamentary discourse in the Netherlands and Greece. It does so by drawing on Triandafyllidou’s (2018) work on media and political discourse, which proposed an important distinction between three discursive frames developed in response to the refugee crisis: 1) a moralizing frame; 2) a security frame; and 3) a rationalizing frame. The goal is to trace these frames in Dutch and Greek parliamentary debates, as parliaments have not received much attention in the academic debate. The analysis covers transcripts of plenary sessions in parliamentary debates between August 2015 and April 2016. Following the work of Triandafyllidou (2018), the key hypothesis is that the longer a refugee crisis lasts, the more parliamentary debates become dominated by a rationalizing frame, regardless of how affected countries are by refugee inflows. The findings identify that no particular frame dominated the parliamentary debates, indicating that political parties remained stable on the left-right dimension. Thus, against the expectations from the literature on the 2015-2016 refugee crisis, the thesis demonstrates that the refugee crisis did not impact the political discourse in EU member states.","['refugee crisis', 'parliamentary discourse', 'the Netherlands', 'Greece']"
The power of the opposition to oppose: a Critical discourse analysis of the four largest Dutch opposition parties’ communications in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic,"Weg, Sophie van de","['Akbik, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the communications of the four largest Dutch opposition parties SP, PvdA, GroenLinks and PVV throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to emergency legislation and an increase in public support for the executive government, opposition parties were sidelined during the pandemic. The aim of this thesis is to examine how these four opposition parties, together forming the biggest opposing force to the cabinet, responded to their marginalised position. This is done through analysing their communication towards the public, as communicative means are an essential tool for political parties to connect with the public. The case study on the four largest opposition parties is conducted through a Critical discourse analysis. Based upon Norman Fairclough’s dialectical-relational approach, text, discourse, and social context of the opposition parties’ communications is analysed. The finding of this research is that during the crisis, the opposition parties communicatively defended their democratic function. This started when they learned that their initial response has not been effective, as they were sidelined and the cabinet’s Covid-19 response failed. They brought their own democratic functioning to the forefront in an attempt to convince the public that they can provide valid alternatives to the cabinet’s failing Covid-19 response.","['Opposition parties', 'Covid-19', 'crisis', 'communicative behaviour']"

Additionally, we aim to investigate whether stress mediates the relationship between having a mentally ill family member and adolescent substance use. A health monitor (N = 14,878) was conducted by Public Health Services North and East Gelderland (GGD NEG) from October 2019 until December 2019 among 2nd and 4th year high school students. The target group, adolescents with a mentally ill family member (n = 1,683), was compared to the control group, adolescents without a mentally ill family member (n = 12,842). The target group had a mean (± SD) age of 14.5 (1.3) years, 59% was female, 42.6% was highly educated and 33.5% was religious. The control group had a mean (± SD) age of 14.2 (1.2), 51% was female, 46.7% was highly educated and 32% was religious. Stress, alcohol use, drug use and substance use were measured by means of a self-report questionnaire. An ANCOVA, controlling for age, gender and educational level and a mediation analysis were performed. The results showed that the target group scored higher on stress, alcohol use, drug use and substance use than the control group. In addition, stress mediated the relation between adolescents having a family member with mental illness and substance use. However, effect sizes were small. We recommend further research on this topic considering stress and substance use could have adverse effect on overall health and well-being.","['Substance use, drug use, adolescents, parental psychopathology, family member, mental illness, stress, coping']"
"Towards a Student Suicide Safety Net: The Relation between Suicidal Ideation, Depressive Symptoms and Social Support in Students","Scheltinga, Tanner","['Veenman, M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In recent years suicidal behavior has become more prevalent among students, especially in cases of depression. The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide has suggested that feelings of thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness can precede suicidal ideation. Both concepts are rooted deeply in the social world and research suggests that social support may alleviate these feelings offering a promising avenue of research for suicide prevention. The current study aims to explore the relationship between social support and suicidal ideation in the context of depressive symptoms among students by using a network analysis. A network of 11 nodes was computed using a Gaussian Graphical model. Nodes represented depressive symptoms (suicide ideation, low energy, sleep problems, weight/appetite changes, psychomotor changes, concentration problems, guilt, sadness and loneliness), perceived social support and objective social support. Participants (N = 453) were recruited as part of the WARN-D program and suicide ideation, level of social support and depressive symptoms were assessed using various questionnaires. Contrary to our expectation, no relationship was found between suicide ideation and social support or loneliness. Loneliness emerged as the most central node in the network. Guilt was found to have the most connections with other variables in the network. Further research is needed to clarify the role social support can play in preventing suicide ideation and in depression in general.","['suicide ideation', 'social support', 'depressive symptoms', 'network analysis', 'students']"
How do parents’ positive and negative affect relate to positive and negative social behaviour in early childhood?,"Venetikidi, Marianna",['Evin Aktar'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Child social behaviour is indicative of psychosocial functioning. Familial factors, including positive and negative parental characteristics are proposed to be related to child adaptive and maladaptive social behaviour. The differential susceptibility (DS) theory suggests that the relationship between parental characteristics and child behaviour can only be understood after taking child characteristics into consideration. In this study, we explored the relationship between parental positive and negative affect/social anxiety and child positive shyness and avoidance while taking into account the potential moderating role of child temperament. The sample consisted of children aged 4 to 6 years (N = 68, Age M =5.16; 34 girls) and their primary caregivers. Parents reported their positive and negative affect and their child’s temperament. Child positive shyness and avoidance were observed during a social performance task. Parenting dimensions did not significantly relate to child social behaviour. No significant associations were found between parental positive affect and child observed positive shyness, or between parental negative affect/ social anxiety and child observed avoidance. Child temperament was not found to enhance the relationship between parenting dimensions and child observed behaviour. These non-significant results could be explained by the reflexive nature of inhibitory behaviour, or by methodological aspects of the study.","['early childhood, differential susceptibility, parents, positive and negative affect, social behaviour, behavioural inhibition']"
Russia’s Ontological (In)Security: Is it the Post-Cold War European Security Architecture?,"Tezel, Kaan Başar","['Rrustemi, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"On December 17, 2021, the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation published two draft treaties that demand various security guarantees from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United States. This meant that Russia wanted to reform the post-Cold War European security architecture. Upon the rejection of these proposals, Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Despite extensive scholarly research on Russia’s stance regarding European security, the debate revolves around realist and neo-realist perspectives which are not sufficient in comprehending the fundamental reasons behind why Russia wants to do so. For that reason, this thesis introduces a new theoretical approach called the ontological security theory. By adopting a post-structuralist methodology and discourse analysis, it argues that Moscow feels ontologically insecure due to the divergence between Moscow’s identity and its role in the post-Cold War European security architecture. Therefore, Russia sets its foreign policy for the “recognition” of its Self by the West, which is necessary for ontological security. The findings of this thesis also reveal the significance of identity in international relations and politics, as it brings alternative explanations to arguments put forward by grand IR theories regarding a phenomenon.","['Russia', 'Ukraine', 'European security', 'ontological (in)security', 'identity']"
"The Justification of Illegal Pushbacks at the EU's External Borders: Beyond the ""General (In)securitized Context"" Understanding of the (In)securitization of Migrants in EU Politics","Leander Djerf, Casper","['Ploof, R. A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Thousands of migrants trying to enter the EU are subjected to illegal pushbacks at the hands of the border protection functions of individual EU states. (In)securitization theory suggests that these illegal pushbacks warrant the need for political justification. Yet the primary current academic literature regarding the (in)securitization of migrants in the EU does not even recognize that the pushbacks are taking place. This research project first offers an altered conception of (in)securitization that can better account for the illegal practices taking place. This conception of (in)securitization emphasizes a process-centric approach to the concept’s application that focuses on both the actual (in)securitization attempts by actors and their motives, and the actual practices taken by border control agents. This is in contrast to the primary usage of (in)securitization that instead is restricted to establishing an abstractly conceived general (in)securitized context. Secondly, the reconceptualization is applied to the three cases where the most significant number of pushbacks are taking place; Romania, Hungary and Croatia. The project's findings suggest that (in)securitization theory must take a step back and align more closely with its original conception, that emphasized specific political motivations, to better capture the actual extraordinary practices that need political justification.","['EU', 'politics', '(in)securitization', 'legitimacy', 'migration', 'pushbacks', 'populism']"
"Political Legitimacy, Reformist Consent Theories, and Panarchy","Agustoni, Matthieu","['Ploof, R.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Theories of political legitimacy are concerned, in short, with states’ moral right to create and enforce laws and regulations, and to see these respected by their citizens. Of all available theories of legitimacy, so-called consent theories are often taken to be a straightforward and convincing way of grounding such a right. Despite this advantage, many also argue that virtually no existing state secures the valid consent of its citizens, undermining the theories’ success in the real world. In face of such challenges, several thinkers have proposed various societal reforms to bring about widespread, valid consent, thereby safeguarding states’ legitimacy. The work at hand offers an overview of three of the most convincing so-called reformist consent theories and argues that all face serious challenges. It then argues that panarchy, a largely overlooked meta-political framework that defends a plurality of non-territorial states and that places citizen’s direct express consent at its core, successfully answers these challenges, gaining the theoretical upper hand over other reformist theories. It then concludes by assessing some of the strongest objections against panarchy, underlining the strengths and weaknesses of the theory, and spelling out venues for further research.","['Panarchy', 'Political Legitimacy', 'Consent Theory', 'Reformist Consent']"
Fighting Financial Hardship: Is Self-Compassion Half the Battle?,"Lohse, Ann-Kathrin","['van Dijk, W.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study examined whether the induction of a self-compassionate state improves financial coping strategies by reducing financial shame and stigma. After recalling a personal financial weakness, participants (N = 189) either wrote a self-compassionate message to themselves or not. Although it was hypothesised that self-compassion decreases avoidance-oriented financial coping and increases problem-focused financial coping by reducing financial shame and stigma, no such effect was found. However, explorative analyses showed that financial stress was associated with more financial shame and stigma, which were positively related to avoidance-oriented and negatively related to emotion-focused financial coping. Financial shame and stigma did not mediate the relationship between financial stress and problem-focused coping. Overall, the current study suggests that a one-time state self-compassion induction is not sufficient in changing individuals’ levels of perceived financial shame and financial coping strategies. Future research adapting longer self-compassion interventions may produce more desirable outcomes.","['self-compassion, financial shame, financial stigma, financial coping']"
Who are today’s Bosnians? Constructing Individual and Collective Identities and Ethnic Grievances in Second-Generation Bosnian Families and Communities,"Anderson, Kimberly",['Dr. Leila Demarest'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Ethnic identity, a concept that describes a form of identification and situates individuals within groups based on shared values, beliefs, or descent, has received a lot of attention in social sciences. Constructivist theories presume that ethnicity is fluid and dynamic, which means that it is constructed via social structures and therefore changes over time. Thus far, research offers different theories on the formation of identity and what factors may influence an increase in its salience. Intergroup conflict and civil war can be one factor that links ethnic grievances to the construction of identity. But what happens after conflict? How do identities change and how do ethnic grievances persist over time? This paper seeks to answer these questions by incorporating a theoretical framework on the formation of identity, collective memory, and intergenerational transmission of conflict. Taking the case of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a post-conflict region, I demonstrate a difference in identification and intergroup attitudes between second-generation Bosnian Croats in Bosnia and the diaspora. Using a qualitative research design, 20 interviews with second-generation Bosnian Croats were held and contrary to my expectations, the results suggest that ethnic categories may be more salient among the diaspora identification. Surprisingly, local respondents identify more strongly via nationality, despite their socialization in an ethnically divided society. Furthermore, increased intergroup contact has proven to be effective in overcoming ethnic grievances which highlights the importance of reconciliation for long-lasting peace.",

Whether having left voluntarily or not, migrants face various challenges in their new host states. Many rely on their co-nationals and diaspora communities to remain connected to their homeland and to navigate their new host countries. One way to remain connected to the home country are joking relationships. Prevalent in West African states, joking relationships or cousinage assume make-believe family ties, which in turn allow people to jokingly insult their “cousins”. Commonly known as traditional conflict resolution techniques, these relationships play important roles in people’s everyday life. This thesis investigates the impact that cousinage has on the community of the Senegalese diaspora in Germany, as well as the question whether diaspora activity and involvement can facilitate integration. In the course of this thesis, an in-depth case study of the Senegalese diaspora in Germany was conducted, for which 28 members of the diaspora were interviewed. The research found that joking relationships are a way for the diaspora to create community feeling based on ethnic and national identities. Furthermore, the thesis shows that diaspora involvement facilitates the integration process of migrants by offering active support.","['Ethnicity', 'Diaspora', 'Senegal', 'Cousinage', 'Joking Relationships']"

As many international actors support Sahelian states in mitigating the crisis, this study seeks to shed light on state violence in the Sahel from different perspectives. I use theories and concepts of recent studies on militia-state cooperation and societal explanations of violence and modify them to develop my theoretical framework of “cooperation, rivalry, and revenge”. Based on that framework, I argue that three factors determine state violence in Burkina Faso and Niger: firstly, cooperation of the state with militias encourages the latter to carry out local conflicts violently, secondly, state actors target more civilians the higher the rivalry measured in parity of represented and marginalised ethnic groups, and thirdly revenge motives account for the location of state violence. I test these arguments using a mixed-methods design that combines extensive qualitative information from expert reports with data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Proejct (ACLED) for Burkina Faso and Niger from 2015 to 2021.","['Militia, Violence, Sahel']"
Genderneutraal opvoeden in de kinderopvang: de ontwikkeling van een observatie- instrument: observatie-instrument,"Woltjer, Esmee","['Groeneveld, M.G.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Tegenwoordig wordt er in media en publieke opinie steeds meer waarde gehecht aan het concept genderneutraal opvoeden. Uit eerder onderzoek blijkt dat niet genderneutraal opvoeden kinderen al op jonge leeftijd in een ‘gender hokje’ plaatst. Op de lange termijn heeft dit gevolgen voor verschillen in beroepskeuzes en inkomsten van mannen en vrouwen. Om dit te voorkomen moet er al vroeg worden gekeken naar genderneutraal opvoeden. Gendersocialisatie begint namelijk al op de kinderopvang. In dit onderzoek is daarom een eerste aanzet van een observatie-instrument voor genderneutraal opvoeden op de kinderopvang ontwikkeld. De onderzoekstudenten hebben dit instrument ontwikkeld gebaseerd op wetenschappelijke literatuur over gender(overtuigingen), uit zowel de gezins-, kinderopvang- als schoolcontext. Het formulier bestaat uit negen categorieën die zijn ondergebracht in zes subschalen, namelijk: activiteiten, gender, interactie, mate van instructie, corrigeren en de ruimte van de kinderdagverblijven. Er zijn in totaal elf observaties gedaan om het observatie-instrument aan te scherpen en de betrouwbaarheid ervan te testen. Uit de analyses over de interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid bleek dat het observatie-instrument in zijn geheel betrouwbaar was, maar dat nog niet alle subschalen voldoende betrouwbaar geacht konden worden. De beschrijvingen van de observatoren met betrekking tot de ruimte kwamen grotendeels overeen. Er is nog verder onderzoek nodig om ervoor te zorgen dat ook alle subschalen een goede interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid hebben en het observatie-instrument in de praktijk gebruikt kan worden. Hoewel dit onderzoek een duidelijk startpunt vormt voor een observatie-instrument om genderneutraal opvoedgedrag mee in kaart te kunnen brengen, is vervolgonderzoek aan te raden om het instrument verder te ontwikkelen en bruikbaar te maken voor de praktijk.",
Adviesrapport en Individueel Slothoofdstuk: Bachelorproject naar Genderneutraal opvoeden op de kinderopvang,"Jongenotter, Carolien",['M. G. Groeneveld'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Genderneutraal opvoeden komt steeds meer voor in onze maatschappij. In dit onderzoek is bekeken wat er in de literatuur bekend is over genderneutraal opvoeden. Daarnaast is onderzocht wat de visie van de pedagogisch medewerkers van kinderopvangorganisatie Kibeo over genderneutraal opvoeden is. Uit het literatuuronderzoek bleek dat de kinderopvang invloed heeft op de ontwikkeling van kinderen. De eerste levensjaren van een kind vormen een belangrijke basis voor de ontwikkeling, zo ook voor de ontwikkeling van genderidentiteit. Het is gebleken dat pedagogisch medewerkers van invloed zijn op de (gender)ontwikkeling van een kind. Het zou dus mogelijk kunnen zijn dat de invloed van de kinderopvang eveneens van invloed is op de ontwikkeling van genderidentiteit. Naast dit literatuuronderzoek is een kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd. Dit is gedaan door interviews uit te voeren naar de visie van pedagogisch medewerkers. Deze respondenten hebben zich aangemeld via een oproep die is gedaan door een beleidsmedewerker van Kibeo namens de onderzoekers. De respondenten waren vrouwelijke pedagogisch medewerkers die op de groepen werkten met kinderen van nul tot vier jaar oud. Er zijn tien semigestructureerde diepte-interviews afgenomen, die gehouden zijn aan de hand van een vooraf geschreven topic guide. Dit werd gebruikt als rode draad in de interviews, maar hier werd van afgeweken als het interview daarom vroeg. Na het transcriberen van de interviews zijn deze in het computerprogramma Atlas.ti gecodeerd. De belangrijkste codes die aan tekstfragmenten zijn gekoppeld, zijn codes voor de visies van de pedagogisch medewerkers, de gender contrastereotyperende opmerkingen die werden gedaan en de sturing van de respondenten. Na het coderen zijn de interviews aan de hand van deze codes geanalyseerd. Uit de analyse bleek dat het grootste deel van de pedagogisch medewerkers een positieve houding heeft ten opzichte van genderneutraal opvoeden. Door het merendeel van de medewerkers werd het geaccepteerd als er door kinderen met elk soort speelgoed gespeeld werd, ongeacht hun gender. Een belangrijke overeenkomst hierin was de autonomie van het kind. Er waren ook twee negatieve meningen ten opzichte van genderneutraal opvoeden, waarin werd aangegeven dat er een grens zat aan genderneutraal opvoeden en waarin werd afgevraagd of het wel mogelijk zou zijn. Ook door deze medewerkers werd echter het spelen met verschillende soorten speelgoed ongeacht gender geaccepteerd. Naast tekstfragmenten over de visie van de pedagogisch medewerkers over genderneutraal opvoeden zijn er tekstfragmenten bekeken over de sturing van de pedagogisch medewerkers en de omgang met de ouders van de kinderen. Hieruit is gebleken dat de meeste respondenten kinderen aansporen om met allerlei soorten speelgoed te spelen en dat dit vaak in het belang is van de ontwikkeling van de kinderen. Zo laten de respondenten zien dat ze inderdaad voor het belang en de autonomie van het kind kiezen. Aan de omgang met de ouders kan worden gezien dat een deel van de pedagogisch medewerkers de wensen van de ouders voorop stelt en een deel de autonomie van het kind. Door dit onderzoek is er een begin van een algemene visie van de pedagogisch medewerkers van Kibeo in kaart gebracht, maar dit is nog niet bruikbaar voor een beleid voor genderneutraal opvoeden binnen de kinderopvangorganisatie Kibeo. Het advies is om voor dit eventuele beleid in gesprek te gaan met de pedagogisch medewerkers en om nog meer onderzoek te doen naar genderneutraal opvoeden.","['Genderneutraal, gender, sekse, opvoeden, kinderopvang, kinderdagverblijf, kind, 0-4 jaar, ouders']"

De hoofdvragen zijn als volgt opgesteld: Wat zijn de wetenschappelijke inzichten over het bevorderen van emotionele veiligheid van kinderen van 4 tot en met 12 jaar op de BSO? Wat voor opvattingen hebben pedagogisch medewerkers en pedagogische coaches hierover? Er is een vragenlijst uitgezet om de opvattingen over de concepten sensitiviteit, autonomie bieden en structuur en grenzen stellen te meten om een beeld te geven van hoe emotionele veiligheid geboden wordt in de organisatie. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat zowel pedagogisch medewerkers als pedagogisch coaches het hoogst scoren op het concept sensitiviteit. Daarnaast komt uit de resultaten dat pedagogisch medewerkers significant lager scoren op het concept autonomie bieden dan pedagogisch coaches. Voor de concepten sensitiviteit en structuur en grenzen stellen zijn geen significant verschillen gevonden tussen pedagogisch coaches en pedagogisch medewerkers. Er is geen significant verschil gevonden tussen medewerkers die op horizontale of verticale groepen werken. Alle resultaten samengenomen kan er geconcludeerd worden dat voor alle deelconcepten verbeteringen behaald kunnen worden. Aan de opdrachtgever is geadviseerd om de interventie VIPP-CC in te zetten om de sensitiviteit bij de medewerkers te verhogen. Voor het verbeteren van autonomie bieden en structuur en grenzen stellen zijn geen interventies gevonden die gebruiksklaar zijn. Er is aan de opdrachtgever geadviseerd om gesprekken tussen pedagogisch coaches en pedagogisch medewerkers over het bieden van autonomie te faciliteren, omdat de coaches hier hoger op scoren. Daarnaast is geadviseerd om samen met de pedagogisch medewerkers een routine op te stellen, zodat zij kunnen aangeven wat haalbaar is binnen de groepen en vervolgens niet van deze routine hoeven af te wijken. Dit zou het concept structuur en grenzen stellen verbeteren.",

Het vormen van concepten: Is er een amodale hub voor het attribuut vorm,"Hengeveld, Nikki",['Dr. Sebo Uithol'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Concepts are very important for human communication, for gaining knowledge, and for many aspects of cognition. But how knowledge is represented in the brain is a question that leads to many discussions. In this bachelor thesis, the theory of Patterson et al. (2007) will be discussed and researched. The argument of this theory is that concepts are formed through a combination of sensory representations in the brain, and a so called 'amodal hub'. This hub forms a central point via which multiple attributes can be processed through the same neuroanatomical pathways. Patterson et al. place this hub in the Anterior Temporal Lobe (ATL). The brain area where shape is processed is closest to the ATL, which is why, according to them, shape is the constant attribute in every pairing. By means of a computer experiment in which participants have to classify unknown objects, the so called Fribbles, in families, we try to find evidence for a role of the amodal hub for the attribute form in the creation of concepts. The results can be interpreted as in agreement with the theory of Patterson et al. This conclusion can't be rushed though. More research has to be done to gain a wider and clearer image.",

De invloed van klassikaal voorlezen met e-Prent&ABC+ op beginnende geletterdheid en taakgericht gedrag van kleuters.,"Cornelissen, Noortje","['Marianne, M. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"e-Prent&ABC is a reading method designed to enhance children’s vocabulary, story comprehension, print knowledge and phonological awareness. During this reading method digital picture books are read interactively to children. It is based on the didactic model ‘de Viertakt’ and uses print referencing. In previous research e-Prent&ABC has proved to be an effective reading method, however not for all children (Dijken, 2019). Teachers suspected that children with problematic learning behavior benefited less from the reading method than children who did not exhibit this behavior. This is presumably due to a low degree of taskoriented behavior. For this reason, a new version of e-Prent&ABC is designed with added behavioral components aimed at increasing the task-oriented behavior of the children with problematic learning behavior (e-Prent&ABC+). The aim of the current study is to research whether the reading method e-Prent&ABC+, compared to e-Prent&ABC, leads to a larger vocabulary growth in children with problematic learning behavior compared to children who do not exhibit this behavior. Because the ability to display task-oriented behavior is partly dependent on the inhibitory control of children, inhibitory control was also included in the analysis. Participants were 60 children (mean age = 65.52 months). In three intervention weeks, picture books are read according to three conditions (Levende Boeken (control condition), e-Prent&ABC or e-Prent&ABC+). The results showed that the reading method ePrent&ABC caused the greatest growth in vocabulary, this confirms previous research which states that e-Prent&ABC is an effective reading method to enlarge the vocabulary of children. During this reading method task-oriented behavior determined the growth in vocabulary, whereas during reading with Levende Boeken and e-Prent&ABC+ this was determined by the inhibitory control of children. This indicates that the interactive reading used during ePrent&ABC is an efficient way of involving children in the lesson, potentially overcoming a low degree of inhibition, and teaching them new words.",
Ambitie voor interprofessionele samenwerking binnen - en op weg naar - een integraal kindcentrum,"Imhoff, Frits van","['Endedijk, H.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Door veranderingen in de maatschappij neemt de vraag naar kinderopvang toe en wordt er meer geëist van leerlingen in het Nederlandse onderwijssysteem. Dit is mede waarom het integrale kindcentrum (IKC) steeds prevalenter is in Nederland. In deze studie is onderzocht wat schoolteams, die in transitie zijn naar een IKC, ambiëren ten opzichte van een IKC. De focus van dit onderzoek ligt op de interprofessionele samenwerking (IPS) binnen drie kernconcepten van een IKC: pedagogische visie, doorlopende leerlijn en praktische organisatie. Voor dit onderzoek hebben medewerkers van drie basisscholen die in transitie zijn naar IKC een vragenlijst ingevuld (N=43). De vragenlijst bestond uit drie vignetten waarbij in totaal 11 items, passend bij de drie kernconcepten, uitgevraagd zijn over de huidige- en geambieerde onderwijssituatie. Uit deze studie blijkt dat schoolteams, ten opzichte van de huidige situatie, een fors hogere mate van IPS ambiëren. Daarnaast lijken de schoolteams een lagere ambitie te hebben in vergelijking met hun directie. Deze verschillen zijn echter niet bij alle scholen en kernconcepten even groot. In de discussie zullen mogelijke verklaringen hiervoor besproken worden. Deze studie onderstreept het belang van overeenstemming binnen een schoolteam en biedt aanbevelingen om dit te bewerkstelligen. Het is hierbij belangrijk om te benoemen dat een hoge mate van IPS niet direct leidt tot een hogere kwaliteit van opvang of onderwijs, maar dat er altijd gekeken moet worden naar de praktische haalbaarheid binnen de onderwijsorganisatie.","['basisschool', 'interprofessionele samenwerking', 'IPS', 'integraal kindcentrum', 'IKC', 'ambitie', 'transitie', 'opvang', 'visie', 'pedagogische visie', 'didactische visie']"

There was a history of emotional or physical abuse and/or neglect in most of the families. Mothers and children participated in two joint tasks (don’t touch and clean-up) in which their behaviour was observed and coded. Parenting behaviours studied were mild physical interferences and supportive presence. Analyses were controlled for child sex and age. Hierarchical regression models showed that during the don’t touch task mild physical interferences by mothers were a moderate to strong predictor of externalizing behaviour of their children, regardless of the age or sex of the child. In the clean-up task, mild physical interferences interacted with the sex of the child, with boys showing more externalizing behaviour when their mothers physically interfered than girls. However, the regression models with supportive presence were not significant. Age of the child correlated with externalizing behaviour and physical interferences in both contexts, with older children showing less externalizing behaviour and receiving less physical interferences. Future research should study mild physical interference, not only harsh physical discipline, to determine whether this is a predictor of child behaviours in general or only in high-risk families. Other implications for future research and practice are discussed.","['ouder-kinder interactie', 'gezinsklinieken', 'hoog-risico', 'disciplineren', 'fysiek ingrijpen', 'supportive presence', 'ongehoorzaamheid', 'externaliserend gedrag']"

Perceived childhood unpredictability and decision-making under uncertainty,"Kok, Iris","['Topel, S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Empirical and theoretical work suggests that unpredictability during childhood shapes how decisions under uncertainty are made, as childhood unpredictability can make people more sensitive to uncertainty about the future. Research on this subject so far has focused on decisions leading to reward gain, but no literature is available when such decisions concern avoiding harm or loss. This study looked into the relationship between perceived childhood unpredictability (PCU) and how people make decisions under uncertainty when the goal is to avoid loss. It was hypothesized that individuals who reported higher PCU would rely on more certain cues in the environment than uncertain cues that needed to be estimated based on experience. Secondly, it was hypothesized that individuals with higher PCU would feel more uncertain while making decisions during the task than people with lower PCU. These hypotheses were tested in a healthy sample (N = 214) consisting of 104 males and 110 females between the age of 18-35. All participants filled in several questionnaires, under which a questionnaire measuring PCU, and performed an online decision-making task. This task consisted of a social and a non-social (gambling) game. The results did not provide support for the hypotheses, but exploratory analyses found a relationship between PCU and the way that decisions were made in the social versus the non-social game. Specifically, those with higher PCU tend to rely more on learned contingencies than on the magnitude of the points at stake in the social game than in the non-social game. This relationship could be investigated more in future studies.","['Childhood unpredictability', 'uncertainty', 'decision-making']"

De Rol van Gehechtheid tussen Ouder en Kind in de Emotieregulatie van het Kind,"Snoeij, Gerdien","['Van Geel, M.', 'Buisman, R.S.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Attachment between parents and children is the foundation of the development of children. Limited research has been done about the role of attachment with fathers in the development of children. However, fathers fulfill an important parenting role in the society, which makes it important to involve fathers in research. Therefore, the present study investigates the predictive role of attachment with fathers and mothers on the development of emotion regulation in children. The research question is: 'To what extent does a more fearful and avoidant attachment with fathers and mothers predict the emotion regulation of the child?' To answer this question, the emotion regulation strategies 'Acceptance' and 'Catastrophizing' are examined. A correlational study was conducted using a subset of the data from the Three Generation Parenting Study by Buisman and colleagues (2020). Children (N = 192) from 16 to 65 years old were involved (Boys: N = 80, Girls: N = 112), whose parents were still alive and with which they were still in contact. To measure the attachment forms and the use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies, the participants had to complete questionnaires (ECR-RS & CERQ) in the lab of the University of Leiden. The study found that fearful and avoidant attachment with parents explained a unique part of the variance of using both cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Looking at the separate contributions of the attachment relationships, only a more fearful and avoidant attachment with fathers had a significant predictive role in using the cognitive emotion regulation strategy 'Catastrophizing'. The results suggest that, to prevent psychosocial problems, it is important to give emotion regulation therapy to children who are insecure attached to their parent(s). Furthermore, it is essential to use Acceptance-Based Therapies, because ‘Acceptance’ is a more robust regulation strategy when children are insecure attached to their parents.","['emotion regulation , attachment, acceptance, catastrophizing']"
Investigating the Relationship Between Working Memory Capacity and Norm Compliance During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Berentelg, Lisa","['Vogelsang, D.A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Norm compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic describes the adherence to health- protecting measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene practice. High norm compliance has been shown to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. Norm compliance involves decision-making processes which are linked to working memory (WM), the ability to manipulate and maintain information. A recent study by Xie et al. (2020) found that high WM capacity predicted social distancing compliance as measured two weeks after the US COVID-19 emergency declaration. It remains unknown, however, if and to what extent the relationship between WM capacity and norm compliance changes over time. The goal of this study was to partially replicate Xie et al. 's (2020) research and investigate whether WM capacity can predict norm compliance two weeks (T1) as well as six weeks (T2) after the mandated COVID-19 lockdown in Germany. A sample of 67 participants (60 for T2) completed two self-report questionnaires for T1 and T2 respectively (within-subject design). WM capacity was measured with the digit span backwards (DSB) and a compliance scale assessing social distancing and hand washing behaviour was developed. The results indicate that WM neither significantly predicted social distancing compliance at two weeks nor at six weeks, thereby not replicating the study by Xie et al. (2020). These inconclusive findings can be explained by the complexity of measuring norm compliance, the differences to Xie et al. 's (2020) research and the limited representativity and size of the sample. As norm compliance is crucial for a functioning society, future research should continue investigating (cognitive) predictors of compliant behaviour, thereby identifying strategies for compliance-enhancing interventions.","['norm compliance', 'COVID-19', 'working memory (capacity)', 'social distancing']"

"The Influence of Migrants’ Social Networks on their Social Integration Process: The Case of First Generation Middle age Western migrants in Rotterdam, the Netherlands","Zwagemaker, Lonne","['Saptari, R.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Rotterdam has one of the largest amount of migrants living in its city in relation to other cities in the Netherlands (IDEM Rotterdam 2019: 1). Most European countries, including the Netherlands, look at integration as a two-way process between migrants and the host society while also assuming assimilation to social cohesion (Anthias et al. 2013: 3). A big part of social integration is establishing social relationships through bonding and bridging (Wessendorf & Phillimore 2019: 126). But migration studies often take social networks for granted while researching migrants’ lives. Therefore, there is a need to research the influence of migrants’ social networks on social integration from a sociological point of view (Ryan 2011: 720). Studies on integration often focus on younger migrants. While first-generation older migrants are one of the most disadvantaged groups because of their migration background, age, and otherness (Warnes et al. 2004: 307). Therefore, this research investigates the influence of first-generation middle-age to older migrants’ social networks on their social integration process in Rotterdam. The research draws on three months of ethnographic fieldwork in the social lives of eight migrants living in different neighbourhoods throughout Rotterdam. The aim is to find out what the experiences of these migrants are regarding their migration trajectory, family and non-family social networks, and sense of belonging in a transnational context, considering their social integration process. In this thesis, I argue what the influences of the social networks are and that all experiences are situational by giving examples of multiple experiences per subject. In the conclusion, I connected the different aspects of the social networks’ influences to argue that all these aspects influence each other and therefore the experiences the migrants have.","['Migrants, Social networks, social integration process, sense of belonging, family networks, non-family networks, social integration']"

Ook komt uit onderzoek naar voren dat depressiviteit in taalgebruik terug te vinden is. In dit onderzoek gaan we na of tijdens de eerste lockdown in Engeland het taalgebruik geassocieerd met depressiviteit ook veranderd is. In dit onderzoek zijn brieven die zijn geschreven voor de eerste lockdown (in de periode één januari tot en met 30 april 2019 en één januari tot en met 22 maart 2020) vergeleken met brieven die zijn geschreven tijdens de lockdown (in de periode 23 maart tot en met 30 april 2020; N = 1946). Deze brieven zijn verworven uit de nieuwsbron ‘The Guardian’. Taalgebruik geassocieerd met depressiviteit wordt in de huidige studie opgedeeld in zeven verschillende betekenisvolle woordcategorieën opgesteld door het ‘Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count’. Deze woordcategorieën betreffen ‘eerste persoon enkelvoud’, ‘absoluut taalgebruik’, ‘positieve emoties’, ‘negatieve emoties’, ‘angst’, ‘boosheid’ en ‘verdriet’. De resultaten laten zien dat het taalgebruik geassocieerd met depressiviteit op verschillende woordcategorieën veranderd is. De briefschrijvers gebruiken ten tijde van de lockdown relatief meer woorden geschreven in de eerste persoon enkelvoud, woorden gerelateerd aan angst en marginaal meer woorden gerelateerd aan verdriet. Tevens gebruiken de briefschrijvers tijdens de lockdown relatief minder woorden met een positieve lading en woorden gerelateerd aan boosheid. Er is bij de briefschrijvers geen verandering gevonden in de mate van woordgebruik gerelateerd aan negatieve emoties en absoluut taalgebruik. De data laten dus zien dat er tijdens de lockdown een verandering is opgetreden in taalgebruik. We bediscussiëren dat achter taalgebruik psychologische processen kunnen meespelen en wijzen voorzichtig in de richting dat taalgebruik dit bloot kan leggen. We gaan in op de aard van de levensgebeurtenissen in relatie tot taalgebruik, waarbij we noemen dat vervolgonderzoek hier meer zicht in kan bieden.","['taalgebruik', 'lockdown', 'coronavirus', 'depressiviteit', 'woordcategorieën', 'LIWC', 'mentale gezondheid']"
Dark Iris Rings – Understanding Human Social Cognition Through Paedomorphosis in Dog Eyes,"Walkenhorst, Simon",['Mariska Kret'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In order to gain novel insights into human social cognition, this study researched dogs’ facial communication and sociability towards humans with the help of a newly explored concept termed the dark iris ring. The dark iris ring is a discolouration in the iris around the pupil of a canine eye, which is believed to be a paedomorphic trait developed during selective breeding processes by improving social communication with humans. The study took it upon itself to answer the questions of whether the dark iris ring classifies as such a paedomorphism, whether modern breeds have a higher expression of iris discolouration than ancient breeds and whether they are, hence, evaluated as “more cute”. Three hypotheses were formulated, stating that (1) dark iris rings are paedomorphisms that (2) are more present in modern dog breeds when controlling for contrast values and that (3) modern dog breeds are, therefore, evaluated as “more cute”. In order to test these hypotheses, eye measurements of N = 36 canine images, including both ancient and modern breeds, were taken and cuteness ratings were gathered in an online survey administered to N = 106 participants. Eye measurements and cuteness ratings were compared respectively. The confirmatory analyses show the results to be non-significant, not supporting either notion of the three hypotheses. Even though our findings provide too little evidence that dark iris rings developed as paedomorphisms due to an elicitation of caregiving responses and the appraisal of cuteness by humans, we urge future research to continue the examination of dark iris rings.","['Dog Eyes, Paedomorphism, Selective Breeding, Kindchenschema, Cuteness, Social Cognition, Facial Communication, Sociability, Genealogy, Cognitive Psychology']"
Generating Feedback Reports for Ecological Momentary Assessment Data,"Rimpler, Aljoscha","['Fried, Eiko']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a data collection method that utilizes phone apps to gather data in daily life. EMA has many advantages, such as ecological validity. However, data collection protocols are often intense, with multiple measurements per day, which can interrupt participants’ everyday activities and place a burden on them. This can reduce compliance. One way to tackle this is to provide participants with personalized data reports as an intrinsic reward. However, current frameworks to generate such reports are focused on single individuals in treatment, and not suitable for large-scale studies. Here we introduce a software to fill this gap, FRED (Feedback Reports on EMA Data), and showcase FRED by generating reports for 428 participants who took part in the WARN-D study. Participants were followed for 85 consecutive days, and received four daily and one weekly survey, resulting in up to 352 observations. We provided feedback to participants in the form of downloadable HTML-files, which were generated using the R programing environment. Reports included descriptive statistics, timeseries visualizations, and network analyses on selected variables. Furthermore, we assessed participants’ perceptions of the created reports (n=54), who judged reports mostly as understandable, insightful, and that reports resonated well with them. Given that FRED is flexible and can be adjusted to the needs of a particular research project, it provides a good basis to generate large numbers of personalized data reports.","['Ecological Momentary Assessment', 'Experience Sampling Method', 'Personalized Feedback']"

One of the major reasons for this is the presence of shame and its related component - stigma. We conducted an experiment to test the effect of reducing shame and stigma on willingness to contact an organization and on coping styles. For this purpose, we created an intervention website with elements that reduce shame and stigma. The results showed that while participants in the intervention group were not more willing to contact the organization than the participants in the control group, the former engaged in active coping style more than the latter. Additionally, since perception of the organization is an important factor for people who might seek help from it, we measured the perceptions of competence, warmth, and morality of the organization in each condition. We found that the participants in the intervention condition viewed the organization presented on the website as more warm and moral than those in the control condition.","['financial struggle', 'shame', 'help', 'advice']"

Due to unknown reasons, current treatments for the disorder are only effective in 30-40% of patients. Therefore, the aim of this research was to identify relevant predictors of treatment outcome. The treatment consisted of an 8-week intervention including 2 weekly rTMS sessions followed by exposure therapy. The research question was whether Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity during successful inhibition in a Stop Signal Task could significantly predict baseline symptom severity and treatment outcome in OCD patients. It was investigated whether lower pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), inferior frontal gyrus, and/or inferior parietal cortex BOLD activity would predict higher symptom severity scores at baseline and a larger decrease in Y-BOCS scores. The total sample consisted of 51 participants, spread over two experimental (pre-SMA and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)) and one control (vertex) condition. Symptom severity scores were recorded before and after treatment using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Results revealed that none of the regions of interest significantly predicted treatment outcome. Lower pre-SMA BOLD activity did however significantly predict higher symptom severity before treatment. In addition, an exploratory analysis of BOLD activity in the right DLPFC during successful inhibition was not a significant predictor of treatment outcome, while it was a significant predictor when based on executive control-related BOLD activity. It may be concluded from the results that pre-SMA BOLD activity significantly predicts baseline Y-BOCS scores, and that right DLPFC BOLD activity is not a relevant predictor when based on successful response inhibition.","['OCD, inhibition, pre-supplementary motor area, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal cortex']"

Results confirmed that the original NAM is a suitable model for explaining food waste separation intentions. In addition to previous studies, results supported our hypothesis that citizens’ outcome efficacy is positively associated with personal norms. Findings concerning extensions of the NAM were not in line with expectations.

Safety in Childhood - Safety for Life? Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Attachment Security on Chronic-Physiological Stress Later in Life,"Bognár, Dóra","['Brosschot, J.F.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Early life stress is a common problem in today's society, and it has been shown to lead to a variety of psychological and somatic conditions in adulthood. This is believed to be partly due to chronically enhanced physiological stress levels, irrespective of stressors experienced in adult life. According to a new stress theory, the Generalized Unsafety Theory of Stress (GUTS), chronic stress is the result of a chronically disinhibited stress response as a result of a general sense of unsafety rather than the cumulative effects of everyday stressors. Early life stress might lead to developing such a sense of generalized unsafety by disrupting safety learning in close relationships, better known as insecure attachment. Insecure attachment potentially induces long-term dysregulation of the HPA axis that can lead to chronically high levels of cortisol, majorly contributing to somatic health complaints in adulthood. Purpose: This meta-analysis is the first one to systematically examine the connection between an insecure attachment and chronic high cortisol levels in later life, with the aim to provide a better understanding of the ways early life experiences can have detrimental effects on our long-term health and wellbeing. The broader aim of this paper is to find supportive evidence for the theoretical framework of the GUTS. Methods: The Web of Science database was searched for eligible studies using an exhaustive keyword profile. Articles were included only if they used a physically and psychologically healthy adult or child population, measured resting or baseline levels of cortisol and attachment style later in life and reported statistical analyses of the relationship between attachment styles and cortisol levels. The program Comprehensive Meta-Analysis was used to determine an overall correlation coefficient representing this association. Results: A small but significant association was found between adult insecure attachment and baseline cortisol levels later in life (r = 0.199, p < 0.001). Differential analyses of types of insecure attachment revealed that attachment anxiety had a significant contribution to the association, while attachment avoidance did not. Conclusion: Insecure attachment is related to a higher resting level of cortisol. In this way, it seems to play a moderate but potentially important role in chronic stress later in life. This role is more attributable to higher levels of attachment-related anxiety than attachment-related avoidance. The findings partially support the theoretical framework of GUTS, however, also raise points for debate.",
A Preconscious Attentional Bias Modification Training for Itch: No Found Effects on Attentional Bias and Itch Sensitivity in Healthy Individuals,"Vermeulen, Yulin","['Becker, J.M.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Existing literature indicates that attention, specifically attentional bias, may play an important role in the experience of itch. Attentional bias (AB) is the inclination to prioritize the processing of certain types of stimuli over others. Several studies have indicated an AB towards itch related information, however the evidence remains equivocal. As it has been found that an attentional focus on the location of itch aggravates symptoms, patients with chronic itch may benefit from learning to disengage their attention away from itch. Therefore, it has recently been studied whether AB and itch sensitivity can be altered by means of Attentional Bias Modification (ABM) training. The only ABM-training for itch that has been studied so far was found to be ineffective at changing AB and itch sensitivity. This training was delivered consciously, yet there are indications that preconscious processes can affect itch, which may signify that a preconscious ABM-training might be more effective. This study therefore examined the effect of a preconscious ABM-training on AB towards itch and itch sensitivity in healthy participants. It was hypothesized that AB towards itch and itch sensitivity would decrease in those who received the preconscious ABM-training. This study comprises a 2 (pre- and post-training) x 2 (ABM-training and control-training) within-between-subjects design. Final study data consisted of 73 participants. AB was measured with a pictorial dot-probe task for itch (20 ms), and itch sensitivity was measured with 0 - 10 ratings after cowhage itch induction. A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA was used to test both hypotheses with a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level of .025. Contrary to expectations, the preconscious ABM-training did not alter AB towards itch (p = 0.518) nor itch sensitivity (p = 0.036). Equivocal findings in the effectiveness of ABM-trainings signify a further need for study. Future studies may benefit from optimizing ABM- training methodology. When preconscious ABM-training for itch would eventually be proven successful, future studies should focus on patients with chronic itch. These patients are generally motivated to reduce their attention and sensitivity to itch and have a higher susceptibility to visual itch cues than healthy participants, which may both positively influence results.","['Preconscious Attentional Bias Modification Training', 'Itch', 'Itch sensitivity', 'Attentional Bias towards Itch']"

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on both dimensions of mental health in older adults that received treatment for anxiety symptomatology. Specifically, we hypothesized that: a) changes from baseline to posttreatment in positive mental health and psychopathology are moderately negatively correlated, b) the majority of participants will improve on one dimension but not on both, and c) participants who received ACT will tend to improve on positive mental health while participants who received CBT will improve on psychopathology. A total of 314 adults aged 55 to 75 with mild to moderate anxiety symptoms participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either the ACT or CBT condition and completed two assessments: one at baseline and one at posttreatment (3 months after baseline). Positive mental health was measured using the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). Psychopathology was measured using the General Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). There was a significant negative weak correlation between changes in positive mental health and changes in psychopathology, r(212) = -,282, p < .001.

To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to examine LVFB in a real-world social setting. Furthermore, the effects of social anxiety on LVFB were explored. The results of this study confirm that individuals express LVFB in a real-world social situation. This study found no significant result for the effect of social anxiety (SA) on LVFB. This study also posed an exploratory question of the persistence of LVFB over time (conversation duration). No significant result was found for the influence of time and persistence of LVFB over the duration of the social setting. In conclusion, LVFB applies to a real-world social setting. However, as this study was the first to make use of a real-world social situation more research is needed. Future research could involve clinical samples to clarify the influence of social anxiety on LVFB in real-world social situations.","['Left visual field bias, LVFB, Social anxiety, real-world social situation']"
Do I want to be similar and/or different? How purchase options can have the potential to fulfill the two basic social needs.,"Torij, Sarinda",['Arjaan Wit'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study investigates the relationship between two basic social needs, i.e., the individual need for assimilation and the individual need for distinctiveness, and consumers’ perceptions of the potential of various purchase options to fulfill their need for assimilation and their need for distinctiveness. The role of Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) is investigated as a moderator in this relationship. The results show that, although all seven purchase options selected for the present study meet the potential to fulfill participants’ two basic social needs, the perceived potential to fulfill the need for distinctiveness is slightly higher. This may be related to the fact that in the present sample, the individual need for distinctiveness appears also to be felt somewhat stronger than the individual need for assimilation. It was hypothesized and partially found that participants’ stronger individual need for assimilation goes together with a higher perceived potential of various purchase options to fulfill their need for assimilation. In a similar vein, participants' stronger individual need for distinctiveness goes together with a higher perceived potential of various purchase options to fulfill their need for distinctiveness. Furthermore, participants with a stronger individual need for assimilation experience more FoMO, while participants with a stronger individual need for distinctiveness experience less FoMO. FoMo moderates the relationship between the strength of the two basic social needs and the perceived potential of various purchase options to fulfill the two basic social needs. From a marketing perspective, it may be suggested that companies can safely focus on both basic social needs, for example in their marketing campaigns, to try to reach as many potential customers as possible.","['Optimal Distinctiveness theory', 'purchase behavior', 'Fear of Missing Out']"
Equality Does Not Equal Safety: The Role of Team Psychological Safety in Self-organising Teams,"Romney, Shanice Orinthia","['Groeneweg, J']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Dutch healthcare organisations are currently turning to self-organising teams to provide cheaper highquality care. However, many organisations have experienced adverse effects after the implementation of self-organisation such as an influx in costs, employee absenteeism and turnover. Contemporary organisational research has identified faulty and hasty implementation as the culprit of unsuccessful self-organisation. Despite extensive research, there is one factor, team psychological safety, that has not been investigated within self-organising teams. Team psychological safety is ‘the shared trust that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish members for speaking up or expressing themselves freely’. Team psychological safety should be considered an important factor in the implementation and the success of self-organising teams. The reason for this is that without team psychological safety, team members are unlikely to engage in collaborative behaviours, such as knowledge sharing, which is required in these highly interdependent teams. Therefore, in this study, the role of team psychological safety within self-organising teams will be evaluated. To this end, two methods of data collection were utilised and the results of these were then compared to each other. This study consists of three parts: the quantitative, the qualitative and the comparative. In the quantitative part, questionnaires were distributed among three healthcare teams within the same organisation (N=56). It was hypothesised that team psychological safety was a predictor of the level of self-organisation within the team and that this relationship was mediated by the number of employee silence exhibited by the teams. Lastly, it was expected that empowered coaching (the manager’s ability to coach and stimulate self-reliance within the team) and high-quality interpersonal relationships were the antecedents of team psychological safety within self-organising teams. In the qualitative part, semistructured interviews were conducted with N=50 healthcare professionals within the same three teams. A thematic analysis was conducted on the interviews and the results were then divided into barriers and facilitators of self-organisation. The barriers and facilitators found were then analysed in their relation to psychological safety. The quantitative results showed that team psychological safety is a predictor of the self-organising behaviour exhibited by the teams. However, it was not found that this relationship was mediated by the employee silence reported by the teams. Furthermore, only high-quality interpersonal relationships were found as an antecedent for team psychological safety. The qualitative results showed that the most prominent barriers and facilitators were related to psychological safety, indicating a possible relationship between psychological safety and selforganisation. Further, the qualitative results showed that the main problems were related to knowledge sharing and inadequate interpersonal relationships. Despite that, the most prominent facilitators were collegiality and job satisfaction. In the comparative part, a discrepancy was found in the evaluation of team performance and psychological safety. The quantitative results portrayed a more positive view of the teams compared to the qualitative results. In spite of the contradictory results, it can be concluded that team psychological safety could be considered an important factor in the successful implementation of self-organisation as team psychological safety seems to be positively linked to selforganising behaviour. Further, it can be concluded that high-quality interpersonal relationships are the driving force behind team psychological safety within self-organising teams. Lastly, healthcare organisations with self-organising teams are also advised to not only rely on team performance reports as an indicator of success but to also evaluate the degree to which the team is self-organising. For it has also been found that the way these teams achieve their goals can be problematic.","['team psychological safety, high-quality interpersonal relationships, self-organising teams, employee silence']"
Self-perceived social support as a protective factor in the relation between negative life events and mood disorder in Dutch adolescents,"Kooijman, Suzanne","['Tajioui, I.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objectives: Risk factors like negative life events are often linked to mood disorders in adolescents. The objective is determining what the relation is between negative life events (NLE) and mood disorder, and to establish whether self-perceived social support functions as a protective factor in the relation. By determining risk and protective factors, effective interventions can be created to safeguard adolescents’ mental health. Methods: Data was acquired from the MARIO study from five separate sites in the Netherlands and the final eligible sample comprised 106 adolescent participants with an age range from 13 to 25 years. NLE, mood disorder and self-perceived social support were measured with self-reported questionnaires and were analysed with a regression moderation analysis. We corrected for age, sex and site. Correction for parental mood disorder was impossible at the time of this study. Results: A positive and significant association was found between NLE and mood disorder. However, no moderation effect of self-perceived social support was found in the sample. Limitations: A limitation was the uneven distribution of participants with and without mood disorder, with only 11 participants reporting mood disorders. Conclusions: This study does not, contrary to earlier studies, demonstrate that social support functions as a protective factor in the relationship between NLE and mood disorder. Implications include the improvement of autonomy to create individual resilience against the development of mood disorders, as social support from the environment may not offer enough protection. Further research is required in which mood disorder of the parents are taken into account.","['self-perceived social support, adolescents, mood disorder, negative life events, moderation']"
The Role of Age in the Relationship Between Leisure Activities and Subjective Well-Being,"Catena Ortega, Nicole","['de Vries, J.D.', 'Wolters, F.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This cross-sectional study aimed to understand the role of age in the relationship of time spent on leisure activities (LA) and subjective well-being (SWB) with the data collected by the surveys of the LISS Panel in the late months of 2018 (N=5013). The mean age of the participants was 53 (SD = 18) with an even spread of male participants (46%) and female participants (54%). In this study a distinction was made between four types of leisure: digital, creative, sport and cultural. With the use of regression analyses and ANOVAs, this research analysed the relationship between time spent on LA and SWB (1), the relationship between age and time spent on LA (2) and the possible moderation effect of age on the relationship of time spent on LA and SWB (3). The analyses of the first research question showed a mostly positive relationship between time spent on different LA and SWB. Only digital leisure has a significant negative relationship, though the effect size was very small for all significant relationships found. Secondly (2), age related negatively to time spent on digital and cultural leisure, positively to creative leisure and did not relate significantly to sports-related leisure. Lastly (3), only the moderation analysis of age on the relationship between time spent on creative leisure and SWB came out significant (Beta = .05, t = 3.36, p = .001), even though the effect sizes were negligible. Overall, this results do not fully support the hypotheses. Either other factors and relationships play a larger role in predicting SWB or the limitations of this study make it not possible to produce clear results. The study gives the suggestion for future research to examine the relationship between age and the underlying mechanisms that make up the effect of leisure activity on SWB. If this study would be replicated, advice is given to use a longitudinal design and take into account the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on leisure.","['Leisure', 'age', 'subjective well-being', 'moderation']"
"Interoception and Prejudice: The Relations Among Prejudice, Interoceptive Sensitivity and Disgust Sensitivity","Dinç, Lara","['Scheepers, Daan']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Prejudice is an emotion-specific phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of predictors. In this paper, we looked at interoceptive sensitivity (IS) as a potential determinant of prejudice through emotional sensitivity, especially disgust. We had five hypotheses including the last one being exploratory. (1) Higher IS would lead to higher prejudice. (2) Greater IS would lead to higher disgust sensitivity (DS). (3) Greater DS would lead to higher prejudice. (4) Greater IS would lead to increased prejudice through increased DS. (5) Higher IS would lead to increased prejudice through different emotional sensitives (fear, anger, disgust). IS was measured using a heartbeat detection task and other variables were measured using questionnaires. Regression analysis was used to analyze the results. As part of the exploratory analysis, principal component analysis was used to identify potential prejudice subscales. Findings showed all the hypotheses to be insignificant. The key finding of exploratory analysis is that IS was not significantly related to any of the emotion specific prejudice measures. Main limitations were the sample size and its characteristics. In the future, complex emotions could be examined within this analysis and disgust could be manipulated to see if prejudice towards disgust eliciting groups change.","['interoception', 'disgust sensitivity', 'prejudice', 'anger', 'fear', 'heartbeat detection task', 'thermometer scale']"
Association between teleworking and psychological and work-related outcomes in employees: A cross-sectional study,"Isilak, Asmar","['van der Doef, M.', 'Schaafsma, F.G.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Purpose. The current study aimed to research the relation between teleworking and distress levels, depressive symptoms, workload, work functioning and need for recovery. Age and gender were further tested as moderators on these relations, and workload was tested as a mediator between telework and distress level, depressive symptoms, work functioning and need for recovery. Methods. A sample of 87 employees working at a Dutch telecom organization were included. The group of employees who exclusively worked at the office (teleworkers; N = 37) was compared to the group of employees who worked remotely some of their time (teleworkers; N = 50) on all outcomes using independent t-tests. The indicators were measured cross-sectionally. Results. There was no significant difference between teleworkers and nonteleworkers in distress level (p = .161, d = 0.33), depressive symptoms (p = .575, d = 0.12), workload (p = .886, d = 0.01), work functioning (p = .266, d = 0.24) and need for recovery (p = .964, d = 0.01). Moreover, age and gender did not have a moderating effect on any of these relations. Results showed lastly that workload was not a significant mediator between telework and all four outcomes. Conclusion. The current study suggests that there is no difference between teleworkers in distress levels, depressive symptoms, workload, work functioning and need for recovery. Also, characteristics of the employees such as gender and age do not seem to relate to relations of telework with these outcomes. Results furthermore suggest that workload does not explain the effects of telework on the included outcomes.","['telework', 'employees', 'work from home', 'employee outcomes', 'employee wellbeing', 'job-demands resources model', 'depressive symptoms', 'distress', 'workload', 'work functioning', 'need for recovery']"
The Relationship Between Social Support and Academic Performance in University Students With Autism,"Mattar, Chiara","['Does, W. van der']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background The number of students with an autism diagnosis is increasing at university. Previous research has shown that those students experience lower levels of social support. Previous research has also shown a positive link between social support and academic performance. However, there is limited research on this topic. Aim To explore the relationship between social support and academic performance in university students, and to check whether this relationship is mediated by stress, perceived self-competence, depression, or anxiety, and moderated by an autism diagnosis. Design and method Online survey. 222 university students (aged 18-56), 59 with an autism diagnosis (aged 18-39), and 163 without an autism diagnosis (aged 18-56), completed multiple questionnaires assessing participants’ academic performance, perception of their competence to do their class work, stress related to studying at university, anxiety, depression, and social support. Participants were recruited at Dutch universities. Results There was no relationship between social support and stress, perceived self-competence, depression or anxiety. There was no relationship between stress, perceived self-competence, depression or anxiety and academic performance. Autism diagnosis moderated the relationship between social support and depression, and the relationship between social support and anxiety. Limitations The results are reliant on self-reports. A snowball procedure was used for recruitment, which may have caused the sample to be unrepresentative. Conclusion Considering the differences in findings to previous research and the limited amount thereof, it remains unclear whether a relationship between social support and academic performance in students with autism is present, and whether the relationship is mediated by stress, perceived self-competence, depression or anxiety. Future research should examine gender differences, as well as a combination of different constructs.","['Autism', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'social support', 'academic performance', 'university', 'stress', 'self-competence', 'depression', 'anxiety']"
The Role of Loneliness and Meaning in Life in the Mental Health of University Students with Autism,"Sondermann, Jan-Hendrik","['van der Does, A.J.W.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: University students with autism are more likely to experience mental health issues during their studies than their neurotypical peers. The exact role of loneliness and meaning in life in the mental health of students with autism is unknown. Aim: To investigate the impact that loneliness and meaning in life have on different mental health outcomes for university students with and without a diagnosis of autism. The examined mental health outcomes were depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Methods: Online survey. The sample consisted of 59 students with autism and 163 neurotypical university students in the Netherlands. Results: Students with autism reported lower levels of meaning in life and higher levels of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation than their neurotypical peers. Both loneliness and low meaning in life could significantly predict all the mental outcomes. Loneliness was also predictor of low meaning in life. For participants with autism, there was no evidence of meaning in life mediating the relationship of loneliness with depression and anxiety. However, meaning in life fully mediated the effect that loneliness has on suicidal ideation. Regarding the neurotypical sample, there was evidence of a partial mediation of meaning in life for all three mental health outcomes. Conclusion: Students with autism are at greater risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Both loneliness and low meaning in life may contribute to this. If replicated, universities may be advised to offer social support, as well as interventions targeting meaning in life to their students with autism.","['autism spectrum disorder', 'loneliness', 'meaning in life', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'suicidal ideation']"
The effect of anticipated guilt on food consumption and the moderating role of distracted eating,"Groeneveld, Nikkely","['Meer, F. van']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Food overconsumption seems to negatively impact people’s well-being. This study hypothesized that anticipated guilt decreases food consumption, which may diminish for higher levels of distracted eating. The study had a between-subjects design. Food consumption was measured between lunch and dinner by self-report, anticipated guilt by a questionnaire, and distracted eating by manipulating the level of distraction during lunch. A simple and moderated regression analysis were conducted (N = 90). Results suggested that anticipated guilt decreased eating frequency (p = .042) but not the number of portions (p = .104) and the eating frequency compared to the regular eating frequency (p = .299). The relationship between anticipated guilt and food consumption did not seem to depend on distracted eating (p = .523). Anticipated guilt may be helpful to reduce eating frequency without considering the level of distraction during meal consumption. The study provides suggestions for future research and implications for marketers.","['anticipated guilt', 'distracted eating', 'food consumption', 'eating frequency']"

With this, we also examine the mediating role of anticipated respect and the moderating role of perceived need for donations. This research has a 4 cell (perceived organizational morality, perceived organizational competence, perceived organizational sociability versus control) between-subjects factorial design and used a total of 159 members of the general public (50,3% female, 1,3% non-binary; Mage = 34,4 years) from English speaking countries (the US, the UK, Ireland and Canada) as research participants. A first series of ANOVAs showed our manipulations to be effective in instilling perceptions of organizational morality, competence and sociability. A second series of ANOVAs indicated that only the morality of the nonprofit organization raised the perception of organizational prestige in our participants. A multiple regression analysis showed that perceived organizational prestige, while controlling for age and gender, related directly and positively to anticipated respect received when donating to a nonprofit organization. Mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect of perceived organizational prestige on willingness to donate via anticipated respect as a mediator. A second and third mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect of perceived organizational morality on willingness to donate, via organizational prestige as well as via anticipated respect as mediators. Moderation analysis showed no support for the notion that perceived need for financial donations strengthens the effect of organizational prestige on donation willingness.

By using various audio-visual and ethnographic methods I explore how Buurland became the community it is now and how this communal living is lived and experienced by different ‘Buurlanders’. The focus of this research is on processes of re-design and place-making and the factors that allowed this re-design to occur. The temporality of the place, and the attitude and close ties of the initiating group prove to be important in this process. Furthermore, drawing upon discourses on architecture and communal living, I argue that the specific design of the housing blocks fosters social interactions between neighbors. In addition, Buurland’s case-study shows how lack of policy in a residential area leads to creative communal practices organized by neighbors. The yearly ‘Zwemfest’ is a key communal practice, which forms a binding ritual among the members of the community. In 2023 the housing blocks of Buurland will be demolished and make place for social housing appartements and mid-market rental housing. The aim of housing corporation Mitros is to ‘create’ a new community with a similar communal character. The question remains if Mitros will succeed in doing so.

Reading ability and rhythm skills in school-aged twins,"Alphenaar, Linda",['Sylvia van Beugen'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A growing number of studies report links between nonlinguistic rhythmic processing skills and linguistic abilities. However, in current literature, there is a lack of information on the relationship between rhythmic skills and reading ability in non-clinical samples. In this experimental accelerated cohort-sequential longitudinal twin intervention study, reading ability is examined as a predictor for beat perception (the ability to perceive temporal regularity) and rhythm discrimination (the ability to remember and discriminate metrical structures) in early development. A sample of twins (N = 112; Mage = 13.28 years; 45.5% men) completed multiple aptitude tests measuring their rhythm skills and their reading ability. Through statistical analyses, a moderate Pearson correlation was found between beat perception and rhythm discrimination. Furthermore, mixed linear models showed that reading ability predicted rhythm discrimination, whereas it did not predict beat perception, suggesting differential maturational pathways of both rhythm discrimination and beat perception. This study contributes to a more thorough understanding of the development of rhythm perception in children, and provides normative data of a non-clinical research population. Moreover, we now know that musical rhythm interventions promoting reading development should focus on rhythm STM, as opposed to beat perception training.","['Reading, rhythm, twin study, beat perception, rhythm discrimination']"
UMAP Compared to Other Dimensionality Reduction Methods for Data Visualization in R,"Uysal, Uveys",['Huisman S.M.'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimensionality reduction method that has been shown to have advantages over other methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) for data visualization. Although valuable, previous comparisons between these methods have not been done with data from Likert scales. Likert scales are common in psychological research and often cause data to contain ties. This study therefore compared UMAP to PCA, MDS, and t-SNE for three datasets varying in feature types. We included a dataset that was used in previous research (MNIST), a dataset containing Likert scales (CCAM), and a simulated personality dataset to confirm findings. The latter two datasets were edited into two versions that did contain ties and did not. Comparisons were done mainly on local and global structure preservation between visual embeddings of the respective methods. Additionally, we inspected what advantages the different dimensionality reduction methods provided. For datasets without ties, UMAP and t-SNE performed similarly in local structure preservation. However, UMAP showed arguably better global structure preservation than t-SNE. Valuable global structure could also be achieved with t-SNE but this was at the cost of a higher runtime. UMAP and t-SNE both arguably showed a better clustered structure in embeddings compared to PCA and MDS. On the other hand, PCA embeddings provided insights into feature relationships that UMAP did not provide. For datasets with ties, UMAP and t-SNE both suffered in terms of local and global structure. Embeddings were substantially different compared to the embeddings from data without ties. In some cases, UMAP showed a clustered structure arguably worse than PCA. We conclude that UMAP is recommended over t-SNE for data visualization if a clustered structure can be assumed in data since it provides similar local structure but better global structure. This is however only true for data without ties. Therefore we recommend dealing with ties before using UMAP and t-SNE. Finally, PCA is still recommended when the interpretability of feature relationships is concerned.","['Dimensionality Reduction', 'Data visualization', 'UMAP', 't-SNE']"

"The effect of microdosing psychedelics on cognitive control: Two randomized, longitudinal, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials","Broek, Kirsten van den",['Luisa Prochazkova'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Rationale: Anecdotal evidence suggests that microdosing (i.e., taking small doses of) psychedelics can enhance focus and increase productivity and creativity. However, the current literature on the benefits of microdosing on cognition is generally based on self-report and lacks adequate controls, leading to experimental bias and placebo effects. Methods: This study adds to the limited literature on microdosing by examining the effects of microdosing in two-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, longitudinal trials. Specifically, we examined the effects of microdosing psilocybin truffles on various aspects of cognition and working memory. In the first experiment, 69 participants completed all sessions, and in the second experiment, a sample of 67 participants was studied. Participants were divided into two groups, a placebo and an active microdosing group, and completed the following tasks: AX-CPT, Multi-Armed Bandit, Attentional Blink, Remember-Know, Reference-Back, N-back, Inclusion of Other in the Self scale (IOS), and Trust Game. Based on previous theoretical research, we expected that the active microdosing group would perform better on tasks linked with cognitive flexibility while showing lower performance on tasks requiring top-down inhibition and persistent focus. Results: Contrary to our hypothesis, the results showed that microdosing had no significant effect on any of the tasks tapping into cognitive control or working memory. We did find some initial significant results for the IOS, but, after multiple comparison correction, these results were found to be nonsignificant. Importantly, participants in our study were not breaking blind, as has been the case in previous microdosing studies. Moreover, no negative effects on the tasks were found after microdosing, suggesting good tolerability of psychedelic microdosing. Conclusion: Our results showed no benefit of microdosing psychedelics on cognition. Therefore, the reported benefits are more likely driven by placebo effects. However, microdosing did not impair cognition and can therefore be considered relatively safe in healthy subjects.","['Microdosing', 'Psychedelics', 'Cognitive Control', 'Double-Blind', 'Placebo-Controlled', 'Longitudinal']"
Rethinking the European Union's common security and defence policy in the post-Brexit era,"Walraven, Gijs","['Heaphy, J']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In Lisbon 2007, the European Union (EU) established a new policy called the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). With Brexit, the EU lost an important member state in political, military and financial terms, potentially harming the CSDP. EU foreign policy and the impact of member states leaving IOs have attracted much scholarly attention. Previous research has been published before the actual exit date or during the negotiations and therefore has not yet focused on the impact of Brexit on the CSDP. This paper aims to answer the question “How does Brexit influence the European Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy?” via a theory-testing process-tracing method. The single case study uses the theory of historical institutionalism. While the analysis provides evidence for path dependency and a critical juncture in CSDP development, there is ambiguity regarding the actual long-term impact of Brexit on the CSDP. Just months ago, the world was shaken by an unprecedented war in Ukraine, forcing the EU to accelerate its policy adjustment within this field. Which means that it is difficult to give an absolute answer to the RQ itself. However, it makes the outcome of the researched policy adjustment process quite clear.

Put Your Money Where Your Mind Is: Positive Emotions and Temporal Discounting,"Lamie, Ashley","['Van Dijk, W.W.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Financial stress is a widespread issue that has a profound impact on the ability to make sound financial decisions. People experiencing financial stress are generally more prone to temporal discounting: valuing immediate (monetary) outcomes more than future ones. This tendency can prolong the problematic financial situation. In this study, we developed and tested an intervention to help individuals in financial stress increase their focus on their future financial goals. Based on the broaden-and-build theory, which suggests that positive emotions facilitate attentional broadening, we induced either joy or hope in the participants. Our online survey was filled out by 324 UK-participants with varying degrees of financial stress. First, the participants filled in a questionnaire that measured their experienced financial stress. To induce positive emotions, the participants then wrote about personal experiences that either make them feel joy or hope. Finally, they made a series of hypothetical financial decisions. Participants in the gains condition chose between receiving a small amount now, or a larger amount in the future. Participants in the losses condition decided between paying a sum now, or a larger amount later. We hypothesized that, compared to the control condition, temporal discounting would be lower in both the joy and hope condition (1); and that, compared to the control condition, the positive relationship between financial stress and temporal discounting would be weaker in both the joy and hope condition (2). Although our emotion manipulation was successful, linear regression analyses indicated that both hypotheses were not supported. First of all, financial stress and temporal discounting were not positively related in our sample. Additionally, inducing joy and hope did not lessen temporal discounting. We can conclude from this that further research is needed on how temporal discounting can be reduced.","['Positive emotions', 'Temporal discounting', 'Financial stress', 'Scarcity']"
Mi'kmaq Traditional Knowledge and the Ecosystem Dilemma,"Vonberg, Hannah","['Belic, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The moral rights of nature, and especially the rights of ecosystems, have been difficult to establish within the conceptual boundaries of traditional moral theories.

In this thesis, I argue that these ontological and ethical problems can be resolved by employing Indigenous traditional knowledge (TK), represented by Mi'kmaq concepts such as netukulimk. By expanding our ways of thinking about the world and our place within it, we can break the ecosystem dilemma. Utilizing the Mi'kmaq's holistic approach to the environment supports the case for the moral concern of ecosystems. Yet, no single point of view should dominate the discussion – the 'map of moral concern' aims to collect different concepts that are to be used in coadjuvancy to resolve moral dilemmas. Cooperation can be achieved by combining values (traditional Western thinking) and employing two-eyed seeing (Mi'kmaq TK). My thesis tries to showcase the value of immersing oneself fully in a different way of thinking to resolve well-documented problems – essentially this is an argument for radical openmindedness to ultimately strengthen the concept of moral rights of nature.","['Environmental ethics', 'ecosystems', 'moral considerability', 'Indigenous knowledge']"

Taxing the Beneficiary: applying the Beneficiary Pays Principle to individuals through carbon taxes,"Rotz, Charlie von","['Belic, J.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Beneficiary Pays Principle (BPP) describes a method for distributing the costs of climate change, in this case among those who benefit, directly or indirectly, from emissions. Such distributive principles are essential in determining where the moral responsibility for climate harm lies, and how this harm is best addressed. This thesis proposes a concise answer to what exactly BPP ought to mean, explaining how it could be applied to different agents, including individuals. Working from this definition, this research creates a theoretical basis for developing workable policies, using a carbon tax as a basis. To this end, I discuss the impact of consumer behavior on climate change and the problems which stem from disregarding the consumption and emissions of individuals. I also examine the different approaches to using BPP, focusing on the question “could BPP be applied to individual actions?” I discuss the possibility of implementing a carbon tax as the ideal way to put this interpretation into practice and conclude that BPP forms a necessary basis for globally addressing climate harm.","['Beneficiary Pays Principle', 'BPP', 'Carbon Tax']"

Detoxified Radicalisation - New Right Influences on Far-Right Parties: A German Case Study,"Krieger, Adrian Hans Albrecht","['Akbik, A.', 'Louwerse, T.P.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Party systems in contemporary democracies have underwent profound changes in the last decades. The emergence of far-right parties is only one of the many factors determining our modern political systems. However, we can also see a further radicalisation of these parties combined with a simultaneous attempt to uphold a ‘civil’ image. This thesis aims to explain this development by looking at the role of the ideological movement of the New Right and its influence on far-right parties. For this, a case study in Germany shall be conducted. The presence of New Right ideology in far-right parties will be identified via frame analysis and the connections between the two explored through process tracing. Through this analysis the presence of New Right frames in far-right party ideologies was found and the importance of personal connections between the New Right and the aforementioned parties stated. The analysis contributes to the understanding of developments in our party system and aims to explain part of the reason why far-right parties radicalise themselves.","['New Right', 'Far Right', 'Radicalization']"
Gender Dynamics in Legal Systems and Normative Frameworks pertaining to Peacekeeping Operations: Analysis of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in MONUC & MONUSCO,"Tarakcioglu, Melis","['Dr. Gisela Hirschmann', 'Prof. Dr. Muge Kinacioglu']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"United Nations Peacekeeping began in 1948 when the Security Council authorized the deployment of UN military observers to the Middle East. Since then, more than 70 peacekeeping operations have been deployed by the UN. UN peacekeepers were even rewarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988. Furthermore, in the 1990s the UN introduced reforms and established various large and complex peacekeeping operations in various African countries, including Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, the last decade have been extremely controversial for peacekeeping operations due to crimes committed by UN personnel against the civilian population. There were serious reports of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) perpetrated by UN peacekeepers. Even though SEA fundamentally undermines the ethics of peacekeeping, it remains as one of the less-acknowledged issues. Despite various efforts, SEA is still recognized as an endemic issue, especially in the DRC. Peacekeeping operation, MONUC & MONUSCO has the most allegations against SEA, which consists of rape, prostitution, pedophilia, torture, child pornography and peacekeeper-fathered children. Therefore, this thesis aims to identify why and how SEA occurs in MONUC & MONUSCO. The main focus will be on the analysis of the gender dynamics embedded in the legal systems and normative frameworks pertaining to the peacekeeping operation. The predominant systems belong to the host state, sending state and the organizing international actor. Thus, there will be an analysis of DRC, South Africa and the UN. This study demonstrates that patriarchal norms governing judicial systems and UN’s frameworks plays an important role in the occurrence of SEA. The UN system is rooted in inclination towards patriarchy and it is designed to benefit men at the expense of women. Additionally, patriarchy thrives in DRC and South Africa, in a way that it manifests itself in the culture and laws.",

Geo-engineering and Nature’s Rights: An Ecocentric Critique,"Gabriele, Beatrice",['Dr. Jelena Belic'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"As consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly obvious, more and more risky practices are being considered to moderate its repercussions, such as geo-engineering. Climate engineering, however, carries many ethical questions to be considered before it can be deemed an acceptable measure. In this thesis, ethical considerations in regards to the rights of nature will be examined in order to assess its permissibility. The rights of nature seek to question the widely held instrumental view of nature, aiming at conceptualizing the natural world as an interconnected reality, rather than an available and exploitable resource. This is especially important when evaluating geo-engineering since it involves artificially altering natural processes, which may jeopardize nature's integrity. An ecocentric approach will thus shed light on the anthropocentric essence of geo-engineering and its harmful effects towards nature. In all, I will argue how these elements can be turned into a more considerate approach to the practice, should a shift in our conception of nature occur. This in turn will favor a modification of the aim of geo-engineering, whose scope will be expanded to include nature’s rights.","['climate change', 'climate justice', 'geo-engineering', 'ecocentrism', ""nature's rights""]"

I first evaluate the Ability to Pay Principle, the Polluter Pays Principle, and the Beneficiary Pays Principle on their normative grounds. I conclude that the BPP can be defended against objections concerning the consideration of wealth in proportion to historical emissions and imposing costs on the wrong people, whereas the PPP and the APP can not. Therefore the BPP is a fairer principle. However, due to the past-benefits objection, I render the BPP nonetheless inappropriate to guide international climate policy. Instead, I propose an altered version of the BPP (Alternative Beneficiary Pays Principle), which is able to take both historical, present, and future emissions into consideration, filling the gap the other principles leave open. Finally, whereas the current literature stops after dealing with the normative grounds of the principles, I further evaluate the feasibility of the ABPP in guiding international climate negotiations. I conclude that the long- and short-term feasibility of the ABPP is enhanced due to taking states as appropriate agents to assign the costs of climate change.","['distributive justice, Polluter Pays Principle, Ability to Pay Principle, Beneficiary Pays Principle, climate change, international climate policy, feasibility']"
De gevoeligheid van leraren voor het verleidende effect van breininformatie op de geloofwaardigheid van artikelen over onderwijsonderzoek: De gevoeligheid van leraren voor het verleidende effect van breininformatie op de geloofwaardigheid van artikelen over onderwijsonderzoek,"Hijlkema, Renée","['Helder, A.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the seductive allure of neuroscience explanations (SANE effect), the finding that people overvalue psychological arguments when framed in terms of neuroscience findings, among teachers in the Netherlands. This study is based on the work of Im, Varma & Varma (2017) and also examined the possible role of three moderating variables, i.e. educational background, neuroscientific knowledge and attitude towards educational neuroscience. Participants (N = 310) read eight articles about educational topics in one of the four conditions corresponding to four levels of neuroscientific framing: psychological finding alone, with an extraneous neuroscience finding (verbal), with an extraneous neuroscience finding (verbal) and graph, and with an extraneous neuroscientific finding (verbal) and brain image. Participants were randomly assigned to one level of neuroscientific framing and rated the credibility of each article’s argument on a 7-point Likert scale. The results show that there was a general SANE effect when educational articles were accompanied by both extraneous verbal neuroscience findings and brain images. Extraneous verbal neuroscientific framings, either alone or accompanied by graphs, did not influence the credibility of the application of psychological findings to educational topics. The results did not support the expectations that teachers’ educational background or neuroscientific knowledge play a role in the SANE effect. However, the results suggest that the teacher’s attitude towards educational neuroscience does influence the SANE effect: teachers who were very positive towards the use of neuroscience in education were sensitive for the SANE effect and teachers who were moderate to not positive about this were not. On the basis of the results of this research and previous SANE studies, future studies to further investigate the mechanism of the SANE effect among teachers, the role of the effect and neuromyths in education, and how to build a bridge between neuroscience and education are suggested.","['seductive allure of neuroscience explanations', 'educational neuroscience', 'neuroscientific framing', 'neuroimaging', 'reasoning', 'neuromyths']"
Cross-Species Emotional Priming Effect on the Attention for Emotional Expressions,"Matsulevits, Anna",['Mariska Kret'],2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Perceiving and correctly interpreting emotional expressions is one of the most important abilities for social animals’ communication. It determines the majority of social interactions, group dynamics, and cooperation, being highly relevant for an individual’s survival. With the evolutionary implications of understanding emotions, and the phylogenetical closeness between humans and non-human primates, the core mechanisms of this ability have been hypothesized to be shared across closely related species. In the current study, we aimed to find homologies in human processing of different species’ facial expressions using eye-tracking. Introducing a prime-target paradigm, we tested the influences on human’s attention elicited by priming with differently valenced emotional stimuli depicting human and chimpanzee faces. We demonstrated a shift of attention towards the conspecific emotional target picture that was congruent with the valence depicted on the primer picture. We did not find this effect to occur with heterospecific primers, although based on post-hoc valence and arousal ratings, the emotional expressions in chimpanzees were interpreted correctly. Explanations of this finding, as well as implications about the involvement of related emotion processing mechanisms between humans and chimpanzees are discussed. Additional systematic investigations of emotional expressions across species are needed to unravel whether the emotion representation mechanisms can extend to process other species’ faces. Through cross-species investigations, we continue to address the gap of a shared evolutionary ancestry between humans and other animals to ultimately answer the question of “Where emotions come from?”.","['emotions, priming, attention, chimpanzees, eye-tracking']"
The impact of verbal IQ and Performance IQ on (social) functioning in psychiatric patients,"Nederlof, Mark","['Sijben, A.E.S.']",2022,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background In the psychological treatment of children, IQ tests are often used to assess if there is a risk of a patient developing mental problems, as the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) is known to be a powerful predictor. However, various articles state that the FSIQ loses its predictive power if discrepancy between its underlying factors, namely the Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Performance IQ (PIQ), is present. Therefore, the vast majority of clinicians uses a factor-based approach, with which clinicians aim to recognize potential weaknesses in a child’s cognitive profile that would otherwise be overshadowed by their strengths. VIQ-PIQ discrepancy is associated with increased problem behaviours, because of the disbalance in intellectual functioning and the inability to meet others’ expectations This study aims to further examine the extent of this relationship in children with psychiatric disorders. Methods This cross-sectional study used a standardized assessment procedure of 189 children (aged 6-16) who were referred to a mental healthcare facility. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for children (WISC-III-NL) was used to measure their FSIQ including their VIQ and PIQ. To measure their problem behaviours, the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was used. Patients with common diagnoses, namely Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD, n=27), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD, n=63), Anxiety Disorder (n=21) and Affective Disorder (n=24) were analysed. Firstly, their mean VIQ and PIQ were compared. Then correlations between the VIQ-PIQ discrepancy and some problem behaviours were examined and finally linear regressions were made between this discrepancy and problem behaviours, such as social problems, anxious/depressed and attention problems. Results We found no differences in mean VIQ compared to PIQ, for any diagnosis. In ADHD patients, counter to our hypothesis, VIQ-PIQ discrepancy was negatively correlated with both social problems (r(61)=-.27, p=.03) and attention problems (r(61)=-.27, p=.03). No significant regression equations were found. Discussion Our findings suggest that for ADHD patients, a factor based approach may be valuable. Not just the individual factors, but their values relative to each other affect a child’s risk of social and attention problems. In ADHD patients, those with a discrepancy towards PIQ reported more complaints. However, several variables, such as age and sex, seem to moderate the effects of VIQ-PIQ discrepancy. Further research could examine the dynamic between these variables to improve the accuracy and effectivity of treatment based on a child’s cognitive profile.","['Viq', 'piq', 'discrepancy', 'disharmonie', 'cbcl', 'wisc']"
