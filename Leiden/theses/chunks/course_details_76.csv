Integrating embodied narratives in narrative therapies for PTSD,"Nagel, Giselle","['Sleutels, J.J.M.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"Patients suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) develop self-narratives that are ‘too rigid’ or ‘too coherent’. Narrative therapies are developed to make the self-narrative more flexible by re-telling it (Jongedijk, 2014). However, these therapies are not as effective as some other treatments for PTSD (American Psychiatric Association, 2017). This could be explained by using the hyperreflexivity model (Fuchs, 2011) which illustrates how patients suffering from anxiety, mood- and sleep disorders overly reflect on their life. Therefore, retelling the self-narrative during narrative therapy may rather stimulate the rigidity of the self-narrative than make the self-narrative more flexible. Traumatic events and PTSD symptoms, such as flashbacks, are often experienced in a sensorial and ‘wordless’ way. Therefore, the traumatic experience and symptoms could be treated better by using narratives that include conditions of embodiment (Menary, 2008). Literature on embodied and body narratives (Gallagher & Hutto, 2017) are discussed and applied to the standard concept of narrative therapies. It will be concluded that working with a novel concept of a self-narrative that includes conditions of embodiment leads to better results in the narrative treatments of PTSD.","['Posttraumatic Stress Disorder', 'Body narratives', 'Psychopathology', 'Narrative Therapy']"

This thesis explores the significances and implications of this: how does presenting modern art history as a story, and specifically one that is ‘made’ in the present tense, challenge dominant forms of history that claim to be singular and objective, and how does an exhibition such as this implicate the art historian whose methodologies of writing and representation similarly tend to obscure their own historical position? ‘The Making of Modern Art’ uses copies of paintings, of exhibition form, and of modes of history-writing. These copies, I suggest, function as translations. By engaging with these copies as translations, I explore how originality, authorship and subject-object relationships might be conceived of differently in contemporaneous art historical practices. The contemporary is a historical position, and contemporaneous artistic practices that address or re-imagine modern art history might, or indeed should, have implications on how we continue to write and reinforce particular forms of history.","['modern art', 'historiography', 'translation', 'contemporary art', 'authorship', 'Hayden White', 'Donald Preziosi', 'Van Abbemuseum', 'art history']"
"Soms wel, soms niet - Onderzoek naar modaal soms op Twitter","Riepma, Mart","['Beliën, Maaike']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek is een kwalitatief onderzoek naar modaal gebruik van soms. Met behulp van een samengesteld subcorpus uit tweets wordt de functie achterhaald van soms in vraagzinnen. De literatuur stelt dat modaal soms enkel in vraagzinnen voor kan komen en inwisselbaar is met misschien. Om de functie van modaal soms te bepalen is naar de verschillen en overeenkomsten tussen temporeel en modaal soms gekeken. Uit de studie is duidelijk geworden dat soms zowel modaal als temporeel de kern ‘er is’ bevat. Modaal soms is niet altijd inwisselbaar met misschien, bij veel gevallen van soms bevat de zin niet dezelfde boodschap als misschien gebruikt wordt. Dit is aangetoond door modaal soms te categoriseren in de categorieën bevestigingsvraag, nuance, suggestief en provoceren. In de categorieën suggestief en provoceren past misschien vaak niet op de plek van soms, de spreker weet zelf het antwoord al en wil een beeld oproepen of een reactie uitlokken. Soms kan dus zinnen beleefder maken, maar kan ook voorkomen in zinnen die nietbeleefd bedoeld zijn. Tijdens de analyse van het corpusmateriaal is gebleken dat soms zich leent voor een specifieke constructie, de of niet soms-constructie. Deze constructie heeft een dwingend karakter, is sterker dan de bevestigingsvraag met toch, maar is minder sterk dan of niet dan. De constructie helpt de functie van soms vast te stellen door te kijken naar de rol van soms binnen de constructie.","['Soms', 'Partikel', 'Modaal']"

Social Media and The Rise of Youth Political Participation in Democratic Indonesia,"Kristi, Brigitta Maria Dianti","['Shidiq, A.R.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The increasing number of young and first-time voters on the current election shows the significant role of young people in determining the future of the country. The level of political involvement within a country has a significant impact on every aspect of its citizen's lives, especially when discussing the youth in a particular society. This phenomenon occurs elsewhere in the world, especially with the enormous progress of communication and information technology. As such, youth are becoming increasingly involved in political developments in their respective regions, including within Indonesia. This paper seeks to investigate the reasons behind the increase in the youth's political participation in democratic Indonesia. By looking at two characteristics of social media, the findings indicate that social media has a powerful impact on the increasing involvement of the Indonesian youth in politics explicitly. It is necessary to understand the impact of social media growth in this case, as it could be developed into a more positive and effective method to make use and gain benefits from the technology.",

Natural resources and the position of women on the labour market,"Rasenberg, Kjell","['Gonzalez Vicente, Ruben']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I argue that there is no connection between the amount of export of the natural resources oil and gas and the female participation on the labour market worldwide. This argument resolves an important debate in the literature. In Ross’ (2008) research, he claims that there is a correlation between the oil export and the female participation on the labour market in the Middle East. I counter his argument by analysing all countries with a major oil or gas export worldwide and the major exporters of oil in the Middle East separately. Another opponent of Ross’ (2008) theory is Rørbæk (2016), who argues that culture and religion in the Middle East is to blame for the lack of female participation on the labour market in the region. By analysing the difference in oil and gas export and compare this to the change in female participation between the years 2011 and 2015, I was able to draw a conclusion. The regression analysis of the data of all major gas or oil exporting countries shows us that there is no significant correlation between the two variables, meaning that no connection between the oil or gas export and the female participation on the labour market can be proven. Also in the analysis of the Middle East, no connection between the export of oil and the female participation can be found. Only in the analysis of Islamic countries, a significant correlation between oil and female participation could be found, but this was very minimal. This research therefore implies that Ross’ (2008) conclusions are not applicable to the whole world or the Middle East in the years between 2011 and 2015.",['Resource curse women labour market']
Identity in the Face of Exclusion: How Turkish Germans and Russian Germans Negotiate Belonging to the National Community,"Zahn, Lovis","['Lukac, Morana']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis is an attempt to examine the meaning, relevance, and impact of German citizenship on the lives of Germans of Turkish and Russian-German ancestry in Germany. More generally, it set out to discuss the politics of belonging and membership in a political community, such as the (German) nation-state. The findings as well as the literature that was discussed showcase some of the difficulties, which prevent certain Germans from having full access to their citizenship rights in the German national community. This difficulty arises mainly because Germany has not yet stripped itself completely from an ethnic or cultural understanding of German citizenship and thus identity. As a result citizens are deemed ‘the other within’ based on criteria, such as ethnicity and culture in the public imagination and must negotiate belonging to the national community accordingly. This ‘otherization’ leads to deny certain German citizens of full membership in the national community. Especially so, in relation to their substantive citizenship.","['Turkish Germans', 'German identity', 'German citizenship', 'Russian Germans', 'Identity conceptualization', 'Citizenship discourses']"

Reassessing the Aral Sea’s Disappearance: Why Blaming the Soviet System Misses the Bigger Picture,"Stevens, Imogen","['Roberts, Flora']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Aral Sea is often seen as a problem unique to the Soviet Union. However, many scholars fail to address the similarities between the Soviet system and others, especially that of the USA. This thesis examines the similarities between the Aral Sea disaster and other environmental disasters that occurred in the USA during the Cold War. It demonstrates that the USSR was not alone in their treatment of nature, as underlying views of nature as an instrument to be exploited were also present elsewhere. The Cold War competition exacerbated the tendency of the systems to over-exploit nature, as each pushed their limits in an attempt to emerge superior. Colonial attitudes and power disparities that existed between centers and “uninhabited areas” in both the USA and USSR, led to compounded marginalization for those affected in sparsely populated areas. The slow violence present in all cases demonstrates the lack of attention given to the victims by the governments responsible for the disasters. Placing the blame for the Aral Sea disaster entirely on the Soviet system not only obscures the global context of the disaster, but is potentially dangerous, as with the fall of the USSR, the chance of such a disaster occurring again did not disappear with it.","['Aral Sea', 'Cold War', 'USA', 'USSR', 'Slow Violence']"
How Are NATO’s Humanitarian Interventions Justified? Case Studies of Kosovo and Libya,"Jafarli, Farid","['Lukač, Morana']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will answer the question how are NATO’s humanitarian interventions justified through studying the interventions of Kosovo in 1999 and Libya in 2011. While these interventions took place almost a decade apart and aimed to prevent atrocities committed by autocratic regimes, they caused a significant number of civilian casualties and as a result, were subject to controversy among scholars, as well as civil societies around the world. The work of Richard Falk has highlighted that these controversies were centered around the debate regarding the moral, legal and political justifications of the interventions. Hence, they are used as the basis of the conceptual framework in this thesis. Accordingly, in order to answer the question of how humanitarian interventions are justified, a qualitative research method has been used to identify, compare and contrast NATO's justification for humanitarian interventions through moral, political and legal perspectives. The responsibility to protect (R2P) doctrine and the concept of responsible sovereignty have been found to be specifically prominent justifications. These serve to overcome the mandates of international humanitarian law and the United Nations Charter, which establish the legal limits of humanitarian intervention in sovereign states.","['Humanitarian Intervention', 'R2P', 'Responsible Sovereignty', 'NATO']"
SUB-NATIONAL FACTORS OF REGIME STABILITY IN CONTEMPORARY SAUDI ARABIA,"Visser, Pim","['Forough, Mohammadbagher', 'Regilme, Salvador']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Regime stability in Saudi Arabia is based on the assumption that the distribution of oil wealth among the citizens will lead to political quiescence in return. However, the decline in oil prices since 2014 has exposed the flaws in this assumption of national co-optation. Drawing on insights of Social Contract, Rentier State and Welfare State theory, this thesis will delve deeper into the sub-national factors that influence regime stability in Saudi Arabia. As such, a thorough analysis of the youth bulge and foreign workers in Saudi Arabia concludes that it is not sufficient to investigate the distribution of wealth on a national level to understand the mechanisms of regime stability. Sub-national analysis provides additional insights into the factors that are exacerbated due to the low oil price and establishes a narrative that argues for different mechanisms of regime stabilization. Contemporary developments, such as the implementation of the Vision 2030 policy by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, underline the relevance of expanding sub-national analysis.","['Saudi Arabia', 'Youth Bulge', 'Foreign Workers', 'Regime Stability', 'Sub-national']"

Explaining the production of European Austerity: A Critical Political Economy Approach,"Van der Leer, Erik","['Duzgun, Eren']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Abstract. Since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the formation of the EMU, the Eurozone has progressively transformed into a political economic regime characterised by stringent fiscal discipline and the legalised enforcement of austerity on its member states. Within the literature on the political economy of austerity various competing explanations have been given for this transformation. This thesis will explore the limits of these accounts through a case study of the political economy of the Netherlands over the past decade. Based on the findings of this case, it will argue that current accounts on the rise of austerity fail to properly account for its emergence because they do not properly account for the political elements of its implementation and execution. Consequently, this thesis will explain the rise of austerity by combining a critical political economy approach with a state-centric perspective. In order to so, it will demonstrate the historically politicised nature of austerity through a historiography of one of its most ardent supporters, the Netherlands. Finally, it will explain this Dutch position by arguing that the production of austerity has historically been a political strategy employed by certain state actors within the context of a Weberian market struggle over the structure of the European Monetary Union.","['Austerity', 'Critical Political Economy', 'Market Struggle', 'Euro']"

Populist Resurgence: The Drivers of Right-Wing Populist Voting in the 21st Century Europe,"Georgieva, Ekaterina","['Steen, Bart Simon van der']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“During 21st century, right-wing populist parties in Europe have gained an unprecedented momentum and are slowly changing its political realms. World events of 2016 such as the UK’s vote to exit the European Union and United States’ presidential election of Donald Trump further underlined the general turn to the populist right. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to identify and explain the key triggers of voting preferences for such anti-establishment parties in a previously democratic context. The research presents the top five traditional scholarly explanations for increasing support for the populist far-right (immigration, Euroscepticism, new media, globalization, modernization and economic crisis), and further tests them through a comparative analysis of two distinct European states largely affected by the populist resurgence – Hungary and France. The analysis in this paper is based on polling data from the Eurobarometer survey, alongside secondary literature, and attempts not only at testing the above-mentioned scholarly explanations, but pinpointing the similarities and differences of voting preferences for the populist far-right between Eastern and Western European voters, which currently remain under researched.”","['populism', 'far-right', 'Hungary', 'France', 'immigration', 'Euroscepticism', 'new media', 'modernization', 'globalization', 'economic crisis', 'Eurobarometer']"

Foreign Language Teaching: What are Dutch teachers’ and non-teachers’ attitudes towards non-native accents of English?,"Cavdar, Sule","['Smakman, Dick']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The present study explored the attitudes of secondary school teachers and non-teachers towards different degrees of Dutch-accented English and whether there was a difference in attitudes between these groups. In addition to this, it investigated whether there were certain pronunciation features that would lead to a lower grade. This was tested through an online survey consisting of two parts, namely a listening task and an open-ended question. The listening task asked the participants to grade a total of twelve recordings on a scale from 1 to 10 and to motivate their answer as to why they gave a certain grade. The recordings consisted of two native speakers and ten speakers with different degrees of Dutch accentedness. The degree of accentedness was determined by three people who had listened to the recordings beforehand and these recordings were then categorized into three different groups based on the degree of accentedness. These three groups consisted of (1) native speakers/light Dutch-accented English, (2) medium-Dutch accented English, and (3) heavy Dutch-accented English. The survey ended with an open-ended question which asked the participants wat they thought was the most important aspect to be taught when teaching a foreign language. The results showed that teachers graded most of the recordings (77.8%) higher than the non-teachers, though there was only a small difference. Furthermore, the results showed that both the teachers’ and non-teachers’ grades were lower for the medium- and heavy-accented Dutch Englishes than they were for the native speakers/lightly-accented Dutch Englishes. When asked why a certain grade was given, however, pronunciation only came up 25.8% of the time in the teachers’ answers and only 16.4% of the time in the non-teachers’ answers. A similar pattern was found in the open-ended question, where pronunciation as an important aspect of language learning came up 21.4% of the time in the teachers’ answers and 26.8% in the non-teachers’ answers.","['Attitudes', 'non-native Englishes', 'Dutch']"
The Issue of Syrian Refugees,"Qin, Mengfei","['Broad, Matthew']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Nowadays, European countries are facing the most severe refugee issue since World War II. After the break out of the Syrian civil war, a large number of refugees fled to Europe, seeking protection and stability. As an ongoing international phenomenon, the issue of Syrian refugees has become an urgent problem in need of solving. The European Union has a responsibility to take action and deal with the issue, and one way is through helping newly arrived asylum seekers to settle down. Although the European Parliament and European Commission started in 2015 to launch the resettlement plan (along with various other initiatives to deal with the issue of refugees,) it seems to be difficult for Member States to implement a standard procedure, and no effective unitary measures have been taken so far. Ever since 1997 when the Dublin Regulation came into force, the European Union has been aiming to develop a set of common policies for asylum seekers, and to harmonize the process and procedures. However, previous studies and real situation revealed that neither the Dublin Regulation nor CEAS (Common European Asylum System) could be properly implemented by Member States as planned. In spite of the fact that the European Union has proposed several revisions and amendments since 1997, the main problems remain unsolved, and Member States still struggle to reach an agreement on fair and equal common asylum procedures. This thesis will discuss the topic through a comparison of Germany and Hungary from different aspects on the national level. I hope to identify and explain the reasons why Member States responded differently to the issue of Syrian refugees under the same asylum system and common EU law.","['Syrian Refugee Crisis', 'Dublin Regulation', 'CEAS', 'Asylum Seeker', 'Migration Crisis', 'Comparative Politics']"

Redefining Autonomy in a Situation of Formal Legal Pluralism: The La Cocha Murder Trials in Ecuador,"Korn, Eva Linea","['Bruil, Martine']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The recent adaption of formal legal pluralism in the Ecuadorian constitution marks a historical change for the indigenous nations of Ecuador, which have been restrained from political participation for centuries (Lupien 2011, 775-792). Notwithstanding, it remains unanswered to what extent autonomy, constitutionally granted to indigenous peoples, is effectively actualised. This thesis investigates: To what extent has the constitutional recognition of legal pluralism resulted in an enhanced autonomy of indigenous peoples from the Ecuadorian nation-state? It carries out a comparative case study analysis of two murder cases from the community of La Cocha in the years of 2002 and 2010. The analysis substantialises that formal legal pluralism vastly strengthens the autonomy of indigenous peoples. Nonetheless, ambiguities in the existing legal regulations allow room for manoeuvre for the extent to which customary law can be applied. Until those legal gaps are closed, the Constitutional Court will make judgments that – despite its attempts of impartiality and inclusiveness of customary worldviews – can be influenced by Westernised perceptions of justice (Thomas 2012, 74-76). Further, until an establishment of conflict rules, indigenous authorities will use practices of customary law as counterhegemonic instruments to preserve or perhaps broaden the scope of autonomy for indigenous peoples that is granted within the state apparatus.",
China in Africa: Agricultural Development Assistance and Food Security,"Spöri, Anja Maria","['London, J.D.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis engages with the contested social phenomenon of China in Africa. The phenomenon is a subject of intense debate especially since November 2006 when the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit was held in Beijing. Controversy continues to persist especially about the motives inciting China to deepen its cooperative relations as well as with regard to the effects of Chinese investment and aid, allegedly benefitting the socio-economic development of China and Africa alike. China's activities in Africa's agricultural sector in particular are a subject of interest, as the mainland actor's activities bring to the fore perceptions on both Chinese expertise and know-how in agriculture and development on one hand and Chinese state businesses' self-interested and controversial practices on the other. How should we understand China's enhanced presence in Africa's agriculture? A review of the literature on the topic reveals both useful hints and gaps. By investigating the impact of China's agricultural development package on food security this thesis engages with this debate. In doing so, this thesis not only highlights the complex relationship between agricultural development and food security, a matter of urgent practical concern but also contributes to the growing literature published on Southern development partners, in particular, China. The findings of this thesis indicate that China's agricultural development package holds significant potential to develop Africa's agriculture as well as to enhance food security. In theory and on first sight, China's enhanced presence in Africa's agriculture thus seems to be a positive development. Nevertheless, this research also evidences vested interests and significant implementation problems that might reverse this positive first assessment in the long-run. Consequently, this thesis outlines areas for further research, in particular field studies that are essential to comprehensively understand this subject matter.","['China', 'Africa', 'Agriculture', 'Development Assistance', 'Food Security']"

As this generalization extends to the cultural identities and war trauma of Asian Americans, this thesis asks ""How the war trauma of Japanese Americans on one hand and Korean Americans on the other was formulated and addressed differently in the U.S.?"" This research question intends to challenge academia's assumption of homogeneity among ethnic groups by discovering differences within the same ethnic group to exemplify the inaccuracies inherent in homogenization. This thesis explores the war trauma of Korean Americans and Japanese Americans through three steps: finding the origin of each group’s trauma by looking at each groups' historical backgrounds, researching the concept of ‘political silence’ to understand how each group’s trauma was prevented from healing differently, and investigating how each group’s trauma and silence were overcome by examining each group's generation of ‘prosthetic memory’ by analyzing pertinent exhibitions. Results indicated that despite their external similarities, each group’s trauma is differentiated by various characteristics. In exploring each group's uniquenesses, this thesis will suggest and help develop a more constructive research.",

Environmental Disaster in Japanese Literature: Narrativizations of Time and Space in O̅e Kenzaburō’s Somersault,"Baque, Giulia","['Boletsi, Maria']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, in the field of contemporary literature, greater attention has been put on literary productions dealing with environmental pollution or destruction, prompting the surge of environmental criticism – ecocriticism – to a well developed and independent discipline within the environmental humanities. Nevertheless, the field, as Karen Thornber correctly noted, has been mainly focused on issues raised by western literary works. Environmental fictions – or ecofictions – produced in East Asia, despite their preoccupations with pollution and environmental disaster, are usually excluded from the analyses of ecocritics. In Japan in particular, after the Fukushima disaster of March 3, 2011, varied literary works – from short stories to novels and poems – have addressed topics of nuclear pollution and environmental disaster. Therefore, it becomes paramount to focus on this gap in ecocriticism and start to develop more comprehensive studies of ecofictions expanding beyond literary production in English or western languages. This thesis, presenting as a case study the novel Somersault (1999) – by the Japanese author O̅e Kenzaburō, tries to address this gap by focusing on the narrativization of nuclear disaster in relation to the representations of time and space. After the introduction of an analytical tool comprehensive of various theoretical concepts, this study endeavors to demonstrate the importance of accounting for those elements revealing deeper environmental concerns that are often overlooked by critics in literary productions. My study of narrrativizations of time and space, as they take shape in this Japanese case study, shall prove productive also for the analysis of other ecofictions produced in different languages and arising from varied cultural traditions. Furthermore, an analytical tool linking together temporality and space could enable comparative studies between East Asian and Western ecofictions. This study could thus contribute to the field of ecocriticism by allowing for a diversification in the understanding of perceptions of time and space in literary works from different literary and cultural traditions dealing with the threat, or in the aftermath, of an environmental disaster.","['Ecofiction', 'Oe Kenzaburo', 'Japanese literature', 'Ecocriticism', 'Time', 'Space', 'Displacement']"

Ethics and Biometrics: A study of humanitarian innovation in relation to the humanitarian principles,"Van Eerd, Boudewijn","['Regilme, Salvador']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines how the humanitarian sector is integrating various data technologies into its work. Innovation offers enormous opportunities for the sector, yet also brings with it new risks. Technological innovation is, and will in the foreseeable future continue to be, inextricably linked to partnering with the private sector. This fits in a larger pattern where private sector involvement is becoming increasingly important in humanitarian aid. In this process, private sector norms are increasingly adopted for governing precarity. The research examines the mode of deployment of technologies through a case study of the WFP in Yemen. The Houthi faction’s refusal to accept biometric identity systems there led to a temporary partial suspension of food aid. This deployment is considered through the framework of the humanitarian principles, and finds that the WFP is jeopardizing both the lives of the most vulnerable people and the sector’s sustained access to conflict and disasters. These findings are interpreted through a theoretical framework, focusing on the marketization of multilateralism in the time of surveillance capitalism. The research establishes a technodeterminist reliance on data, represented as neutral reflections of complex realities. The belief in the abilities and necessity of these technologies to maximize impact and efficiency comes as the cost of agency, privacy, and sovereignty. This thesis ultimately argues for recentering humanitarian action and innovation on the humanitarian principles, in order to maintain the legitimate authority of the sector and to safeguard the wellbeing of its beneficiaries.","['Humanitarian', 'biometrics', 'biometric identity systems', 'predictive analytics', 'innovation', 'humanitarianism', 'development', 'big data']"

Women in Contemporary Chinese Television Dramas: An analysis of the representation of urban Chinese women emancipation in the television drama Ode to Joy,"Lucile, Mougeat","['Nie, Yuxi']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The role of the woman in urban Chinese society has evolved since the socialist era, when Mao was striking for a genderless society. Today, gender roles are defined in a societal framework and Chinese women are facing discrimination and pressures at all levels. Media in China is known to be the main source that promotes Chinese societal values, in accordance with the party’s ideology. Previous research finds that the representation of Chinese women in media with a feminist approach is an underdeveloped topic, thus not focusing on the emancipation of these women. This thesis focuses on how urban Chinese women are portrayed in Chinese media, and more particularly in Television Dramas. Conducting an analysis of the Chinese produced television series Ode to Joy (欢乐颂) through the lens of four Feminist Film Theories; the male gaze, the female voice, the female as a sign, and the female spectator, the thesis shows how this chosen case study represents the emancipation of urban Chinese women in regards to romantic relationships, professional career and gendered expectations. Moreover, it relates this representation to the existing discourse in China's urban areas.","['Chinese society', 'Feminism', 'Feminist Film Theory', 'Women emancipation', 'Media', 'Chinese Media', 'Television Drama']"

Researchers believe that the Neolithic has its origins in the Fertile Crescent, which is based on the oldest recorded dates of domesticated plants and animals found there. From this point, the ‘Neolithic package’ has spread across the globe. As of 2019, there are a large number of academic debates revolving around the route of dispersal of the ‘Neolithic package’ from its earliest starting point. One of these debates revolves around the way in which agriculture has reached Northwest Africa, or more specifically, Morocco. Since agriculture is one of the primary components of the ‘Neolithic package’, the author will put a large emphasis on this topic in this research. The spread and emergence of agriculture will be researched through archaeobotanical research, with an emphasis on macrobotany. Macrobotany is a subfield within botany and revolves around investigating plant macrofossils to learn more about topics such as: past environments, past traderoutes, past diets and so on. Plant macrofossils are generally not transported very far from time of sediment deposition, thus enabling accurate descriptions of past environments and vegetation types. This thesis will use archaeobotanical data generated from a Neolithic site in Oued-Beth, which is a site in the vicinity of Rabat and Meknes. The main objective of this thesis is to use this archaeobotanical data within the existing framework created by past archaeobotanical research in Morocco, in order to better understand the process of Neolithisation in Morocco.","['Paleobotany', 'macrofossils', 'Oued-Beth', 'Neolithisation', 'Morocco', 'agriculture']"
Governments are coming for Artificial Intelligence,"Eetgerink, Katinka","['Oster, J.S.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis set out to answer the question “What can France and the United Kingdom teach us about the role of the state in developing an Artificial Intelligence strategy that aims to ensure Artificial Intelligence that benefits society as a whole?” Based on the literature review, this thesis assumed that there seems to be a causal relationship between the technology understanding in governments and the role of governments in developing a national Artificial Intelligence system and strategy. Based on a comparative case study between France and the United Kingdom, this thesis anticipated to adopt the hypothesis. The main result from the case study analysis is that both government’s approach in developing AI seems to have an intensifying effect on technology understanding of a government. Drawing from the analysis, the British government pursues an industry-led approach focused on industrial progress and economic value whereas the French government pursues a predominantly research-led approach that focuses on AI autonomy and transformative capabilities of AI. The main conclusion is that the case study analysis indicated that because of the distant governmental role, the technology understanding of the government appeared inadequate to correspond how a future society with AI will benefit all of society and will not exclude certain social groups. When a government had a more central role in AI, it seems more aware of the necessary conditions in technology design (and further development for applications) that would ensure a future with AI technology that includes the entire society.","['Artificial Intelligence', 'European Union', 'France', 'United Kingdom', 'Strategy']"

As a minor deity of the Egyptian pantheon, Taweret never had a cult centre in any known settlement and was relegated to small altars within households. Due to her minor status, there have been no in-depth studies to examine her influence within a settlement before. While many Egyptologists have extensively researched the settlement of Deir el-Medina, focus on the role of the goddess Taweret has been relegated to small paragraph descriptions and not of central concern. This paper shall examine the archaeological remains of Deir el-Medina which pertain to Taweret in order to determine the influence of the goddess within this unique community, and the possibility that there may have been a chapel within the community dedicated to her and a priesthood to support her. These archaeological remains shall be classified into: stelae, statues, ostraca, offering basins and grills, amulets, tomb decoration and evidence for a temple in order to give a holistic perspective of her prominence.","['Taweret', 'Egypt', 'Iconography', 'Deir el-Medina']"

What sort of government is the current Hungarian regime?,"Tokes, Dorottya","['Broad, Matthew']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Hungary used to be the success story of East-Central Europe in terms of democratic transition, however the nature of the recent reforms now points towards a different path. Viktor Orbán has managed to consolidate his power by undermining democratic institutions for his own advantage. Since 2010, the Hungarian political system has gone through an extensive transformation initiated and carried out by the governing party; Fidesz. The right-central political party is led by the charismatic leader Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has built a highly-centralized party where his authority is unquestioned. Fidesz is in governing position since 2010, when they managed to win the elections by supermajority and retain that position respectively in 2014 and 2018 as well. The initial overwhelming victory, which enabled the transformation of the political system, can be traced back to the distrust and disappointment of the people with the socialist party and with the torn economy. Orbán consciously exploited the political vacuum and saw his chance to take power once more. He portrayed himself as the only salvation for the nation after the socialists’ ‘liberal’ mismanagement. Once he came to power, he started the ‘System of National Cooperation’ which was the frame for the (illiberal) transformation of the society. Exploiting his supermajority, he started structural reforms which laid the grounds for passing the ‘The Fundamental Law’. The new constitutional order systematically erodes checks and balances, undermines the independent institutions, gerrymanders electoral laws, attacks civil society and the media. Arguably, the Fundamental Law serves to purpose of entrenching the power of Fidesz. Considering these developments over the past decade, one could raise the question how to conceptualize the current Hungarian political system? Does it still qualify as a liberal democracy, or should it be categorized as an autocracy, or perhaps a regime “in-between”? This essay seeks to explore the possible answers to this question.","['regime typology', 'hybrid regime', 'de-consolidation of democracy', 'Orbanization', 'Hungarian political system']"

This rejection is based on assumed differences between the Dominican Republic and Haiti in terms of race, religion, and culture. This thesis examines whether such an anti-Haitian ideology is taught to the next generation as well by analysing three contemporary Dominican children's books: Yina Guerrero’s ¿Palo Malo, Quién? [Bad Hair, Who?], José Rafael Lantigua’s Duarte Para Jóvenes [Duarte for the Youth], and César Sánchez Beras’ Al Este de Haiti [East of Haiti]. Working on theories on the dichotomy between ""the Self"" and ""the Other,"" this thesis examines how the children's books construct a Dominican identity in relation to Haitian identity.

In the highly politicised context of globalisation this leads to intense theoretical debates. In Africa the mounting tension between proponents of internationalisation and Africanisation, and in South Africa specifically, the rising demand for transformation and a decolonised curricula, impedes the fusion of local and-global knowledge paradigms. Using a Dutch funded food and nutrition security collaboration project between selected Dutch and South African higher education agricultural institutes as research field, this study set out to determine to what extent South African academics support the inclusion of indigenous and local knowledge in their curricula, and to what degree this is realised in practice.

John Milton's Radical Political Positions in 'Paradise Lost': A Comparison to 'The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates' and 'Eikonoklastes',"Oosterbaan, Elvira","['Dijkhuizen, J.F. van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the representations of John Milton’s political views in 'Paradise Lost' (1667/1674). Much scholarly attention has been devoted to the theological aspect of this epic poem. However, 'Paradise Lost' also engages with the political circumstances of mid-seventeenth-century England, and can thus also be read as a political allegory. In order to analyse this, Milton’s political views in 'Paradise Lost' can be examined by comparing the poem to two of his earlier prose works, namely 'The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates' (1649) and 'Eikonoklastes' (1649). Milton wrote these two works in the same year as the regicide and they offer his views on monarchy and government. Because 'Paradise Lost' is written much later, after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, it is interesting to analyse to what extent his original points of view are still represented in the epic poem. Even though Milton, as a Republican and Puritan, is now part of a severely suppressed group, he utilises the epic poem to convey his political truth. Therefore, by examining the ways in which certain characters are represented, I aim to show that in 'Paradise Lost' Milton continued to voice radical political positions.","['John Milton', 'Paradise Lost', 'The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates', 'Eikonoklastes']"

Hormin served as the Overseer of the Royal Appartments of Memphis under the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II. Based on criteria such as style, the Hormin material is defined and the origins of the incorrect connections to Hormin are investigated. Next to this, all the information is gathered in the Hormin material in order to attempt to reconstruct the life and career of Hormin. Moreover, the nineteenth century discovery and exploitation of the tomb, resulting in the material being spread over at least five museums (Bologna, Paris, Cairo, Leiden, Berlin), is examined. This information assists in deciding what can be said of Hormin's lost tomb and what not (architecture of the tomb; further material that can still be found in the tomb etc.). This thesis highlights the issues involved when studying New Kingdom Saqqara, especially material without a tomb context.","['Saqqara', 'New Kingdom', 'Material culture', 'Lost tombs']"
"Universalizing the Soviet Jewry Movement: The National Interreligious Task Force On Soviet Jewry, Christian Activists, Human Rights and Interreligious Relations in the 1970s and Early 1980s","Hoeven, Mandy van der","['Schmidli, W.M.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the National Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry as an organization advocating for Soviet Jewish emigration and as an interreligious cooperative. It asks how the Task Force, under the supervision of the American Jewish Committee, contributed to the Soviet Jewry movement and how the organization’s efforts differed from those of the leading Soviet Jewry organizations. As an interpretive framework, the tension between particularism and universalism is used. The thesis argues that the Task Force universalized the base and the agenda of the Soviet Jewry movement. By mobilizing Christians on a local, national and international level, the Task Force broadened the base, often using human rights and human rights instruments such as the Helsinki Final Act as a means to universalize the struggle. Furthermore, the Task Force universalized the agenda by including Soviet Christians in their advocacy, thus taking a universalistic approach to linkage. As an interreligious cooperative, the Task Force advanced interreligious dialogue in the United States and helped promote the particularistic American Jewish agenda. Consequently, the American Jewish Committee allowed the Task Force flexibility regarding linkage, although they preferred a particularistic approach themselves.","['soviet jewry movement', 'national interreligious task force on soviet jewry', 'soviet jews', 'human rights', 'american jewish committee', 'interreligious relations']"
"Building Bridges between Indo-European, Semitic and Pre-Greek: A Study on the Origins of Loanwords in Ancient Greek","Poel, Joanne van der","['Kroonen, Guus']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Ancient Greek lexicon contains words that cannot be explained by an Indo-European origin. Many of such words can be explained as loanwords of a Pre-Greek substrate or as Semitic loanwords. However, some Greek words seem to originate from a Semitic language, but the morphology and phonology point towards a Pre-Greek origin. To solve this apparent discrepancy, the possibility that Semitic loanwords entered the Greek lexicon via Pre-Greek is examined in this thesis. A sample of fourteen obscure Greek words confirms this hypothesis. The words share semantical and phonological features with equivalent words in Semitic languages, but share phonological and morphological features with Pre-Greek as well. Especially the occurrence of Pre-Greek suffixes that are not present in the Semitic equivalents are strong arguments in favor of this hypothesis. Besides examples of Semitic influence on Pre-Greek, this thesis provides two possible examples of Pre-Greek loanwords in Semitic languages. These findings develop our knowledge of language contact in the Mediterranean region during the Bronze and Iron Age.","['Indo-European Linguistics', 'Loanwords', 'Pre-Greek', 'Semitic', 'Language contact', 'Morphology', 'Phonology', 'Ancient Greek', 'Lexicon']"
« J’ai parlé ou je parlais ? » Une étude sur le rôle du transfert et de l’enseignement dans l’acquisition du passé composé et de l’imparfait par les apprenants néerlandophones du français,"Stoep, Inge van der","['Doetjes, Jenny']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,fr,"The French Language has several past tenses, including the passé composé and the imparfait. These tenses are at first sight similar to two past tenses in Dutch, the voltooid tegenwoordige tijd and the onvoltooid verleden tijd. For Dutch learners of the French language, it may seem that you use the French passé composé, when you have to use the voltooid tegenwoordige tijd in Dutch, because both the passé composé as the voltooid tegenwoordige tijd are composed of an auxiliary and a past participle. However, there is a difference with regard to the use of these tenses in Dutch and in French. The mother tongue, in this case Dutch, can interfere with the acquisition of the French tenses by Dutch learners. It is possible that there is a negative transfer of Dutch to French. The Dutch education could help learners to acquire the correct use. This thesis examines the transfer of Dutch to French concerning the past tenses and it examines the role that plays education in the process of transfer. In the thesis, we will discuss the past tenses that are used in French and in Dutch and we will examine the role of the mother tongue (Dutch), specially the process of transfer. Furthermore we will discuss the role of de education in this transfer. In which way the education can improve the acquirement of these tenses? With the help of a forced choise task, we will try to specify the role of the transfer of Dutch to French concerning the past tenses and we will try to examine the role of education in this acquisition.","['French', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Passé composé', 'Imparfait', 'Acquisition', 'Langue seconde', 'Transfert', 'Langue maternelle', 'Enseignement']"

Although not the first to tackle the Old English Beowulf, as Sharon Turner had in fact translated a selection of the poem to Modern English as early as 1805, Thorkelín was the first to provide a complete translation of Beowulf in any language. As such, he was the first to introduce its cast of characters to the critics and other translators. Since then, Beowulf has received sustained critical attention. The fact that Beowulf has been available for critical review for such a long period of time makes it impossible for a single person to read, discuss, or even just be aware of all the critical works published on Beowulf. Consequently, the current study cannot cover all that has been written on Grendel’s mother and her representation; it does, however, attempt to paint a picture of the evolving scholarly reception of Grendel’s mother by discussing some of its major developments.","['Beowulf', ""Grendel's Mother"", 'Old English', 'Beowulf scholarship']"

"Beyond the Unspeakable: Embodied Approaches to Female Trauma in Margaret Atwood's ""Alias Grace""","Bon, Kirsten","['Kardux, Joke']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"this thesis argues that alternative approaches outside of the dominant deconstructive model of trauma theory are in order to more comprehensively represent the (embodied) experience of trauma amongst women in Western society. In chapter 1 I will start out by tracing the concept of trauma back to its origins. I will pay particular attention to the narratives emanating from the medical discourse surrounding hysteria and trauma, highlighting the paradoxical and problematic conceptualization of the female subject in psychoanalysis. Furthermore, I will show, taking Alias Grace as a case study, how psychoanalysis and the dominant model of trauma theory can be a fruitful epistemological tool when applied to trauma narratives, but also what its limitations are in the face of the female trauma. Chapter 2, then, will further examine the underlying cause of these limitations and the origin of the harmful narratives perpetuated within the trauma theory discourse by exploring the relationship between the phallogocentric nature of Western society and women’s place within it. It will demonstrate why the female experience of trauma warrants additional reflection and that, in some ways, it lies beyond the reaches of the dominant model. And finally, Chapter 3 will propose three alternative approaches that aim at providing a more inclusive account of the female trauma. All three approaches will be characterized by an emphasis on the embodied experience of trauma and treat the female body as a potential site of expression.","['Trauma', 'Feminism', 'Ideology', 'Patriarchy', 'Trauma Theory', 'Affect', 'Pain', 'Postmemory', 'Hysteria', 'Freud']"

An Analysis of Conspiracy Theories in Media Discourses Surrounding Chemical Weapons Attacks in the Syrian Conflict,"Daoud, Tobias","['Immerzeel, Mat']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the influence that news media can have in conflicts, especially through the production and circulation of conspiracy theories. It demonstrates how conspiracy theories surrounding chemical attacks in Syria affected the media discourse of RT, the BBC and the New York Times and researches to what extent this was aimed at influencing public opinion and international policy making in favour of their respective government’s policies in the Syrian conflict. Firstly, previous case studies are reflected upon, most importantly Chomsky & Herman’s ‘Propaganda Model’. Secondly, the proxy war in Syria and its most important participants ’foreign policies are outlined. Next, this knowledge is applied in the paper’s analysis of the reporting of RT, the BBC and the New York Times in the Syrian conflict. It looks specifically at their reporting on conspiracy theories surrounding the 2013 & 2018 Ghouta and Douma chemical weapons attacks, and how it relates to their respective government’s policy in the conflict. These observations lead to the conclusions that conspiracy theories have significantly influenced the discourses of all the analysed news media in their reporting on these events, and that their reporting generally reflects their government’s foreign policy towards the conflict. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a pattern of strategies used by each of the news media outlets, which are potentially deployed in an attempt to direct their audiences towards embracing their respective government’s stances and policies towards the Syrian conflict. These conclusions reveal that there is likely an information war running parallel to the proxy conflict.","['Conspiracy Theories', 'Media Discourse', 'Syria', 'Chemical Weapons', 'Foreign Policy', 'Proxy Warfare', 'Fake News', 'Propaganda Model', 'Information Warfare']"

Hezbollah’s support of the revolutionary nature and ideology of the opposition movements became an issue when the anti-government demonstrations began in Syria and the organization suddenly contradicted its previous posture by backing the regime.The Janus-faced behavior of the organization had an immediate negative impact on the image that Hezbollah had been building through a pragmatic and selective legitimation process. In this scenario, how does Hezbollah react to the challenges to the legitimacy of its organization?. In light of the aforementioned, this thesis will aim to analyze and identify the way in which Hezbollah justify the intervention in Syria to their support groups at the local, national and international level. This research focuses on Hezbollah’s creation of 4 meaning in the ideological discourse in order to justify their actions and preserve their legitimacy at three different levels of target audiences (communal, national, international) by developing diverse context models (van Dijk, 2006, 21) according to each audience’s particular interests.","['Hezbollah', 'Syrian Civil War', 'legitimacy', 'identity']"

An Analysis of the Securitisation of Migration in the Netherlands: To what extent has the PVV used the securitisation of migration - in response to the European migration crisis as a political tool within their policies?,"Boeree, Nadia","['Broad, M.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the past few years, European countries have faced one of the most defining challenges since the beginning of the 21st century, the European migration crisis. The European migration crisis started in 2015 after a large number of migrants fled from danger and instability and asked for asylum in Europe. The debate about the incoming migrants has caused a lot of disagreement amongst European member states on how to deal with this challenge. Some member states of the European Union but also European citizens, see migrants as a threat towards their ‘own’ nations, even though numbers are declining. The securitisation theory can explain this perception towards migrants. Since, the theory takes into account that political leaders/parties can construct an issue, like migration, into a security threat. This thesis addresses the theory of securitising migration and how political parties have used the theory on a national level, in the Netherlands, and in particular one party. Therefore, this thesis will analyse the research question “To what extent has the PVV used the securitisationof migration - in response to the European migration crisis - as a political tool within their policies?” In order to understand the relationship between the securitisation of migration and the Dutch right-wing party the PVV. This thesis first aims to provide a discussion on how the PVV constructed the issue of migration into a security threat and later will analyse how this impacted or is related to different policy areas. It will do this by using a qualitative method of a discourse analysis on three different policy areas: the welfare state, European integration and the Dutch health care system. In doing so this thesis hopes to identify to what extent the PVV has used the securitisation of migration as a political tool for their own electoral gain.","['PVV', 'Securitisation of Migration', 'Discourse Analysis']"

The thesis departs from the premise that there is a fundamental problem regarding the construction and understanding of Latin American culture and identity. This is fundamentally linked with the continents colonial past and the racial and social constructs that have raised from it. The first festival analyzed is the Milano Latin Festival in which the Peruvian diaspora becomes the central focus of analysis. The second festival is the Festival del Cinema Latino Americano di Trieste in which the cultural film festival industry is questioned as a whole and the role Latin America plays on it. By treating the literature on identity, postcolonialism and representation, the final conclusions attest that festivals approach cultural representation in a defective way. Their main faults rely on a lack of acknowledgement and understanding of the diversity that constitutes each and every Latin American country and the dynamics that exists in these concerning race and class. And in the second case, in that the drive and/or purpose of festivals tend to mold how is that cultures are portrait. There is the necessity of exploring further into the underlying realities of Latin American cultures and treat the problematic and paradoxes these have if one desires to pay justice and respect to the same ones.","['Cultural Festivals', 'Representation', 'Identity', 'Migration', 'Postcolonial', 'Latin America']"
Van politionele actie naar Indonesische dekolonisatieoorlog: De vermelding van het dekolonisatieconflict in Indonesië in schoolboeken geschiedenis tussen 1950-2010,"Hogenboom, Daan","['Oostindie, G.J.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze bachelorscriptie wordt onderzoek gedaan naar de vermelding en behandeling van de Indonesische dekolonisatieoorlog in schoolboeken geschiedenis voor het voortgezet onderwijs. Een selectie van 24 schoolboeken uit de periode 1950-2010 wordt nader bekeken om te bepalen welke ontwikkeling er valt waar te nemen op het gebied van terminologie, algehele inhoud en kwantitatieve omvang van de teksten. Drie deelperiodes bestaande uit de jaren 1950-1969, 1969-1987 en 1988-2010 worden ieder als deelvraag behandeld. Wat blijkt is dat de periode '50-'69 als periode van zwijgen kan worden bestempeld. De term 'oorlog' wordt vermeden, 'politionele actie' heeft de voorkeur. Dit verandert in de jaren ’70. Eufemismen en pro-Nederlandse terminologie worden steeds vaker vervangen door neutralere bewoordingen. Vanaf de jaren ’90 heeft de term ‘oorlog’ definitief de voorkeur en komen door Nederlandse troepen gepleegde oorlogsmisdaden ter sprake. Enkele opvallende verschillen komen eveneens naar voren. Allereerst op gebied van illustraties, die de leerling moeten helpen om de stof te begrijpen. In de eerste periode ontbreken deze volledig, terwijl in de laatste periode illustraties de bladzijdes domineren. Ten tweede is er een verschil tussen schoolniveaus, waarbij VWO-boeken veel uitvoeriger op de gebeurtenissen ingaan dan VMBO-lesmethodes. Ten slotte is er een significant verschil tussen boeken gespecifieerd voor de onderbouw en bovenbouw.

In spite of the long research interest in CAF, many questions are still raised, including a significant question as to what extent L2 CAF measures are correct indicators of L2 proficiency. A speaking-oriented study by De Jong et al. (2015) indicates that measures of L1 and L2 fluency are strongly correlated and therefore concluded that there was a large overlap for many aspect of fluency. This study aimed to examine L2 complexity, accuracy and fluency measures and compared them to L1 behavior. Furthermore, the current study also considered whether such correlations are stronger for high-proficient L2 Speakers. Spontaneous speech of 10 native speakers of Armenian and 19 native speakers of Arabic with L2 Dutch is recorded and analyzed with regard to complexity, accuracy, and fluency. Analysis revealed that measures of Complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) in L1 do not significantly correlate with the equivalent measures in L2. The findings would support the threshold hypothesis (LTH), indicating that some threshold of proficiency needs to be attained in L2 before L1 skills can be transferred in the L2.","['second language acquisition', 'complexity', 'fluency', 'accuracy', 'speaking style', 'language proficiency']"
A Change of Hearts: From Paris to Dayton,"Gelton, Bas","['Broad, Matthew']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the factors that motivated the foreign policy of the French presidents François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac during the Bosnian War. The findings explain the reasoning and the consequences of their strategy. The results contribute to the understanding of the diplomatic relations in the 1990s, explain the style of Mitterrand and Chirac, and complement the existing literature on French foreign policy and the Balkan Wars. This paper utilizes a variety of sources linked to Mitterrand, Chirac, the international institutional actors, and the Yugoslav Wars. These sources include newspaper articles, transcripts of telephone conversations, (auto)biographies, press conferences, institutional documents, and academic literature. As the leading supplier to the peacekeeping operations in the region, France held a dominant position in the international community. The conflict ended with the signing of a peace agreement in 1995 after four years of conflict. The resolution emerged from military pressure by the West. Reasons for the delayed response by France and her allies remained unclear. However, the findings in this paper elucidate that Chirac’s strategies had an important impact on the construction of a western solution. Contrarily, Mitterrand’s rhetoric and policies added to an unresponsive diplomatic environment where the use of military pressure was non-negotiable. Chirac’s strategy to pressure his international equals for the use of force and his preference for the involvement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization stimulated an adequate response. Therefore, Chirac’s policy aided the response by the West that ended the Bosnian War whereas Mitterrand’s actions had the reversed effect. This implies that French foreign policy impacted the duration of the conflict. The period of war might have been shorter if military pressure was exerted in an earlier stage. Furthermore, the difference in strategy between the presidents contradicts the characterizations of the presidents. Mitterrand is famous for is a cooperative approach which was lacking during the conflict in the Balkans. Chirac is regarded as a president that preferred French military independence but co-produced an effective response with his western partners.","['French foreign policy', 'Mitterrand', 'Chirac', 'Bosnian War', 'International Diplomacy']"

Des œuvres d'art acquises de manière douteuse à l'époque coloniale doivent être restituées au pays d'origine par les musées occidentaux. À l'aube d'une nouvelle ère, où des changements dans la politique de restitution du patrimoine culturel africain sont en cours, il est également important de réfléchir sur le passé et d'en tirer des enseignements. Cela s’applique également et surtout au cas particulier de la France, puisque ce n'est pas la première fois que la république doit renoncer à des œuvres d'art acquis de manière illégitime. En effet, en 1815, un débat similaire a eu lieu. Après la perte de la bataille de Waterloo par Napoléon (1769-1821), plusieurs pays européens, dont la Prusse, l'Italie et les Pays-Bas, ont récupéré leurs trésors d'art spoliés par la France lors des guerres révolutionnaires et napoléoniennes. Actuellement, il n’existe pas assez d'attention pour ce précédent, car les musées français adoptent eux-mêmes une attitude dominante et restent sceptiques quant à la restitution de l'art colonial spolié, ainsi l’histoire semble se répéter. Cela soulève la question de savoir si la France a examiné son passé critiquement et a tiré des leçons de l'expérience acquise précédemment lors de la restitution d’art spolié. Afin de contribuer au débat actuel sur la restitution des œuvres spoliées aux pays africains, la restitution du cabinet de tableaux de Stathouder Guillaume V (1748-1806), spolié par la France en 1795 et exposé dans le Musée du Louvre jusqu’à 1815, a été retenue comme objet de recherche dans cette étude, qui tente de répondre à la question suivante : Dans quelle mesure, au cours du débat du 21e sur la restitution de l'art colonial spolié, les musées occidentaux s'en tiennent-ils aux idées de la France révolutionnaire ?","['restitution', 'art', 'spolié', 'révolution', 'colonial']"

The study examines the appearances of the male objectification depending on the audiences of the television commercials. Firstly, it shows the current debate going on in the Gender Studies about model objectification and how the study fits in this debate. Secondly, it cooperates frameworks such as Goffman’s Gender Advertisements to create a visual analysis. This visual analysis is being used to examine the appearances of the male objectification in television commercials. Additionally, the study debates whether the existing frameworks in the Gender Studies are applicable to measure the objectification in male models because these frameworks tend to focus on female objectification. It argues that the appearances of male objectification change depending on the audiences and that the frameworks being used in this study need to be revised in order to be up to date.","['male objectification', 'South Korean television commercials', 'sexual objectification', 'model objectification']"

People are each other's remedy- Chinese contractors navigating an 'unfamiliar' environment in Senegal,"Yang, Yifan","['Kaag, Mayke']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The thesis argues to give special attention to Chinese contractors with a provincial background (State-owned enterprise established at the provincial level) and their activities in African countries. Chinese actors who have an earlier entrance to the African market experience a ‘disembedding’ process as other forms of Chinese capital flow in. In face of intensified intra-China competition, provincial SOEs struggle to secure a position in the local market. This thesis explores how Chinese camps navigate changing and unfamiliar environment by cultivating connections with Senegalese actors and local communities. The analysis is based on ethnographic fieldwork in Touba, Matam, Thiès, Thienaba and Dakar. The tracking strategy is a combination of go-along, participant observation and small-talks. The conceptual tool of this thesis, based on the concepts of ‘scale’ (Xiang 2013), ‘navigation’(Vigh, 2006, 2009) and ‘connection’ (Kaag 2012), attempts to understand how flows at one scale can influence or disrupt another scale; and on the local level, how actors experience these disruptions and move through the social forces created in the momentum as socially immediate and socially imagined; and how, through connection and connecting, they find a temporary anchor. This thesis looks at how Chinese contractors navigate the ambiguity of trust and potentiality of obligation to make work and social life possible. It also looks at how Chinese navigate the Chinese guanxi practice and Senegalese system reciprocity to cultivate stable interpersonal relations with significant local actors, such as the Mbacke marabouts in Touba.

Yemen: Resolving an Intractable Conflict,"Varela Put, Elisabeth","['Henderson, Christian']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The eruption of the 2015 war in Yemen was a turning point in the protracted, deep-rooted conflict. Support from various regional and international players for the domestic adversaries further contributed to the complexity of an already stagnant conflict. This thesis first examines the main drivers behind the war through the lens of intractability theory and subsequently establishes the primary factors resisting peace negotiations. This thesis demonstrates that in the Yemen conflict, protraction, identity denigration and polarized solutions are the primary obstacles on the domestic level, whereas geopolitics and profitability are regional factors contributing to the intractability of the conflict. Despite the fact that the conflict is presently in an intractable position, the recent and unprecedented initiation of peace consultations in Sweden has become a silver lining in the entrenched conflict. In relation to these developments, the second part of this thesis analyses whether the Yemen conflict is presently ripe for negotiations. Following this analysis, a variety of suggestions for inducing the transition from intractability towards tractability are presented. This thesis contributes to existing studies on intractable conflicts by applying intractability theory to the case of Yemen and by proposing various methods to ripen the conflict for negotiations.","['Yemen', 'intractability', 'conflict resolution', 'ripeness', 'peace negotiations.']"
Cooperation on energy security in ASEAN – exploring the role of regional norms in fostering cooperation in Southeast Asia,"Ruth, Buddie van","['Black, Lindsay']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Energy security in this day and age is an increasingly complex concept for policymakers to deal with. In order to sustain future economic growth while keeping in account issues of territorial disputes and environmental pollution, many scholars have anticipated a great role for ASEAN, the regional organisation in Southeast Asia, in fostering regional cooperation on energy security. The dominant perspective within the literature analyses ASEAN in practical terms of material outcomes and claims that ASEAN should follow a similar path as the European Union, focussing on functional cooperation. However, the current research concurs with a marginalised and underdeveloped perspective in the literature and claims that norms and the establishment of a regional identity are crucial in understanding cooperation on energy security in Southeast Asia. The contribution of the research is twofold. First, its analyses of ASEAN’s regional energy security policies, the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore power interconnection project and nuclear energy developments finds that ASEAN’s normative approach is crucial in understanding development of and the rationale behind cooperation on energy projects in the region. Secondly, it finds that contrary to the assumption of many scholars in the existing literature on energy security in ASEAN, ASEAN’s norms are not static but undergo change through a process of norm localisation, in which external norms and practices are adopted and localised within pre-existing institutional norms and practices. The thesis concludes that norms play a crucial role in ASEAN’s approach to fostering regional cooperation on energy security, dictating both form and function of cooperation. A normative approach is therefore key in gaining a better understanding of the development of energy security cooperation amongst Southeast Asian states.","['ASEAN', 'Southeast Asia', 'Norms', 'Energy security', 'Regional cooperation']"

Although the role of a novelist is different from the role of a politician, they both have responsibilities towards society, especially if they are famous and powerful men like Houellebecq and Macron. The public, citizens in a democracy, also have their responsibility to be active and critical, but may not always be aware of ""the art of manipulation"". In this age, in which storytelling and ""fake news"" seem to have more impact (or credibility) than arguments and facts, we might state that the power of skillful writers is more important than ever. In what way are Houellebecq and Macron responsible for (the impact of) their writings, what is the power of their words, and what does this power mean in France today? In this thesis we compare Submission and Revolution, using theories from literature but also from sociology and historiography, notably the concepts of ""performativity"" and “storytelling”, applicable in several fields. Attentive to their differences, we'll compare a literary and a political book, analysing the use of fiction combined with politics and vice versa.","['Houellebecq', 'Soumission', 'Submission', 'Macron', 'Révolution', 'fiction', 'politics', 'politique', 'performativity', 'storytelling', 'narrative', 'récit', 'rhétorique', 'rhetoric', 'démocratie', 'République Française', 'French Republic']"

The NGOization of Peruvian Women's Movements: Limitations and Opportunities of a Hybrid Structure,"Frisch, Lou","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"While development literature generally understands NGOs as main catalysts for bottom-up and cost-effective development projects, feminist critiques of women’s NGOs generally argue that they undermine the quest of social movements for a new social order as well as the very foundations of feminism. Critical feminist scholars believe that feminism has been mainstreamed into development agendas and therefore ‘NGOized’ (Jenkins 2011, Roy 2011, Pearce 2010). The term ‘NGOization’ which is commonly understood as the depoliticization, professionalization and institutionalization of movements for social change (Kamat 2004, Hemment 2007) has been widely discussed in recent critical development literature. A point largely dismissed by critical feminist scholars analyzing the severe implications for feminist movements is the need for relativization and contextualization. This thesis contributes to filling a gap in the academic literature by discussing the relevance of a feminist critique of the process of institutionalization and professionalization of feminism and women’s grassroots movements, while at the same time exploring the extent to which the concept of ‘NGOization’ only provides a partial understanding of the realities lived by feminist activists and women at the grass-roots and at the NGO level alike. In other words, this dissertation stresses the need to move beyond a one-sided understanding of the ‘NGOization’ concept that overemphasizes the negative impacts and effects of these developments. In order to do so, this thesis argues that feminist NGOs are best understood when their hybrid nature is taken into account. Hybridity means that they expand their sphere of influence both at the grassroots levels and in the institutional sphere. As such, NGOs need to be understood as “spaces for the exercise of power, both liberatory and oppressive” (Costa 2014, 172). Therefore, the following research question is explored: What are the opportunities and limitations of transforming women’s movements into women’s NGOs in Peru?","['NGOization', 'Peru', 'NGO']"

These dynamics are studied through the irregular trade happening at the border and the women who engage in it, the porteadoras. To answer this question, I draw on the Foucauldian concepts of (international) biopolitics and docile bodies. These concepts facilitate an exploration of the border dynamics produced by its international biopolitics and the power-relations marked by gender and economic factors are influencing and shaping the lives of the Moroccan porteadoras. I argue that the biopolitics of the border work on those who from the inside have put into place a legislation system to economically benefit the enclaves and the bordering provinces. In these dynamics of power and economy, the bodies of the porteadoras become to an extent “docile” due to the mechanism of the biopolitical border alongside their condition as women and their lack of economic resources.","['Women', 'Porteadoras', 'Morocco', 'Spain', 'Borders', 'Biopolitics', 'Docile Bodies']"

"An Assessment of Climate Footprints through the Activities of Three Women in Yaounde, Cameroon","Mumbfu, Joan Nformi","['Bruijn, M.E.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis entitled ‘An Assessment of Climate Footprints through the Activities of Three Women in Yaounde, Cameroon’ sets out to show the (dis)connectedness of climate tools established in and for the West from local realities in Yaounde, Cameroon. It also aims to prove that the socio-cultural and economic situations of women in local communities are different from those in the West thereby, putting them at crossroads of climate footprint assessment and implementation. Theoretical underpinnings applied in this study indicate the different perspectives on the complex climate change issue, the transformations of climate discourse within given paradigms and the peculiar climate messaging and communication of the World Sustainability Fund (WSF). The three-pronged-methodology: critical discourse analysis, interview and audio/film, observation and photo used to gather data for this thesis aim at assessing the neoliberal individualistic modelling of WSF’s climate footprints and how this works elsewhere. This approach facilitates the communication of both the implicit and explicit experiences of the research/participants as they occur in their real live situations. Results of this study reveal that although climate impact assessment tools such as footprints could be designed with good intensions, they could equally be regarded as dangerous neoliberal power tools that ignore local sociocultural/economic realities elsewhere. The language functions of picture/text and talk around WSF’s climate footprint production rather represent broader sociocultural/political structures as exemplified in the colonial trait of its Sustainable Solutions. This study, conducted at WSF, The Hague and on three women in Yaounde, Cameroon is only a tip of the iceberg. It therefore serves as an opening for more research regarding women as actors in climate issues and the decolonisation of the climate change phenomenon.

A Machista Society: Understanding Impunity and Injustice through the Feminicides of Ciudad Juárez,"Estrada Londoño, Julia","['Bruil, Martine']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"From 1993 onwards, Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, became the epicentre of the abduction and murder of women. This phenomenon is referred to as feminicide, the misogynistic killing of women for gender reasons, for being women. Due to the lack of State responsibility, the killings were not investigated, perpetrators were not prosecuted or convicted, victims were blamed, and the access to justice was thus restricted. Therefore, feminicides are associated with a high level of impunity. In order to address the high feminicide rate and the issue of impunity accordingly, the Mexican State implemented gender-based violence legislation that includes the act of feminicide as its most extreme form. Moreover, feminicides have been classified as an official crime in the Federal Criminal Code and in the Criminal Code of the State of Chihuahua. Hence, this thesis aims to examine the feminicides of Ciudad Juárez and the impact of the changes in legislation in relation to the issue of impunity, in order to establish what this reveals about how impunity can be addressed effectively.","['Feminicides', 'Ciudad Juárez', 'Impunity', 'Gender-based violence legislation', 'Mexico', 'State responsibility', 'Gender violence']"

This thesis will focus on the change that took place from this 'master narrative' towards a more critical one, on the part that Denmark had played in the Holocaust, with its own restrictive refugee policy of the 1930s and 40s, and the cooperation of Danish businesses with the Nazis, to name two such critical aspects. Since the cultural memory of these events had an impact on the perception of society today, it is important to know exactly what happened, and to analyse the background based on which the Danish historical narrative was constructed then, as well as the background for the more critical historical narrative today. Thus, this research has as its main focus the circumstances of occupation-time Denmark, and how the narrative of the characterization of occupied Denmark, as well as how Denmark relates to the Holocaust has changed over time.","['Denmark', 'World War Two', 'Danish Jews', 'Holocaust', 'Cultural memory']"

Tourism as a Public Diplomacy Tool: A Case Study on the Influence of the ADS Policy in Chinese-Taiwanese Political Affairs,"Dols, Delilah","[""d'Hooghe, Ingrid""]",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent years China’s influence in the global order has increased remarkably, thereby stirring up opinions whether China will once again become the world’s leading power by taking over the US’s position. Accompanied with their rapid economic growth, Chinese outbound tourism increased substantially. Due to this growing middle class, accompanied with higher disposable income, China has become the largest tourism marked in the world in terms of travels. Due to growing international tourism of Chinese citizens to overseas holiday destinations the phenomenon of cultural interaction between China and other countries is reinforced. As tourism via the Taiwan Strait is said to be dependent on the changing political relations of the two governments, this thesis will conduct research on the influence of tourism in relation to political affairs between China and Taiwan. Consequently, this research will look into the utilization of tourism as a political tool as part of public diplomacy, specifically analyzing the way in which China uses tourism as a public diplomacy tool and how they apply this as a political tool on Taiwan, demonstrating the framework of tourism to wield both soft and hard power. This research will focus the Approved Destination Status policy by the Chinese regarding the regulation of group tours visits to other entities, which has been operating between China and Taiwan since 2008.","['Public Diplomacy', 'Soft Power', 'Hard Power', 'Tourism Policy', 'Cross-Strait Relations']"

The problem of integration is an old, the domain of cyber is new, controversial and interesting. The issue of cooperation within cyberspace is becoming paramount. This however has influence for the EU-member-state relationship as the classical understanding of sovereignty is eroded by cybersecurity. As cooperation is key to success within cyberspace there must be policy coherence in order to achieve this. The EU has several institutions to achieve this. This thesis will examine in detail the development of one of its cybersecurity institutions; the European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA. By connecting the theory of institutionalism and using three mechanisms this agency is used as a casestudy to show how and why ENISA has developed from a small and insignificant agency to a big and influential agency within the span of just fourteen years.","['cybersecurity', 'EU', 'cooperation', 'institutionalisation', 'neo institutionalism', 'ENISA', 'Europol', 'European cybercrime centre', 'Europeanisation']"

In the first chapter, identity politics within the 1985 novel will be explored, to find out how these fit in with the contemporary identity politics debate. The second chapter will contain an analysis of the 2017 series, which will be compared to the 1985 novel, to further explore how the book's identity concepts have been adapted for the modern small screen. Furthermore, the second chapter will critically discuss which adaptation choices have been made and how these affect The Handmaid’s Tale (2017- ) as an updated version of the book. The second chapter will also display the use of The Handmaid’s Tale within contemporary identity politics, to show how The Handmaid’s Tale - both the novel's source material and the series' adaptation - have become part of the current popular culture. As this thesis will show, The Handmaid’s Tale (1985) contains the identity politics elements that are necessary to adapt it to a twenty-first century version. The Handmaid’s Tale is a still relevant speculative version of reality that (1) explores a possible outcome of the essentialism - constructivism debate, (2) where totalitarianism is used as a political framework, inspired by historical politics - and where (3) the exploration of gender identity, minority identities and identity in general is a main objective. Through these elements, The Handmaid’s Tale has been able to participate in critical debates concerning the construction of identities, especially gender identities, in the broader context of feminism and identity politics as a whole, and to establish itself as a symbol of the modern identity politics debate featured on the small screen.","['Identity', 'Politics', 'Handmaid', 'Tale', 'Atwood', 'English', 'Dystopia', 'Speculative']"

This was achieved by re-organizing and dividing the country into nine separate federal states that are based solely on ethnicity. This shift was considered to be quite radical as Ethiopia remains the first country to have ever implemented federalism based on ethnicity. As such, this study intends to investigate whether the instatement of ethnic federalism can be considered successful in Ethiopia using the methodology of secondary data analysis, in light of the deteriorating political and humanitarian situation within the country. This study’s findings indicate that although the system of ethnic federalism has many positive elements in theory, it’s implementation within Ethiopia has failed due to the government’s deepening and reinforcing of ethnic differences, inequalities and human rights violations therein.

Om de praktische uitvoering te onderzoeken zijn persoonsdossiers van het Nationaal Archief ingekeken, persoonsdossiers van vreemdelingen die volgens de wetgeving waren geïnterneerd of uitgewezen, en dus als ‘gevaarlijk’ waren bestempeld. Middels de gap-hypothesis, die aanneemt dat er een kloof ontstaat tussen de beleidsdoelen en de uitvoering bij migratiebeleid, is gekeken naar de redenen voor het ontstaan van een beleidskloof. De Nederlandse overheid had de migratie van ‘gevaarlijke’ vreemdelingen allesbehalve onder controle, maar het politionele beleid had ook voordelen. Wanneer gevaarlijke vreemdelingen opgespoord waren, bood de wetgeving amper bescherming. Ook de invloed van internationale verdragen voor bescherming van vluchtelingen liet veel te wensen over. Het onvermogen van de Nederlandse autoriteiten om de migratie onder controle te houden, zorgde voor de grootste kloof tussen theorie en beleid. Met uitzondering van dit onvermogen was er sprake van een opmerkelijk kleine kloof tussen theorie en beleid. De wil om het restrictieve beleid uit te voeren was zo groot, dat internationale en bilaterale verdragen niet nageleefd werden, en de legaliteit van het beleid in sommige gevallen in gevaar kwam.","['Migratiebeleid', 'politieke vluchtelingen', 'gap-hypothesis', 'jaren 1930']"
Hypnosis & Consciousness - An Examination of the Relationship Between Hypnosis and the Concept of Consciousness,"Krause, Timon","['Sleutels, Jan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"The focus of this essay lies on analysing the relationship of hypnosis and consciousness. It is my claim that modernly held theories of hypnosis do not manage to fully account for all facets of this seeming psychological anomaly because they may be based on a faulty notion of consciousness. I will attempt to show what this notion of consciousness is and how the phenomenon of hypnosis challenges this notion. I will then propose the use of a radically different notion of consciousness by Julian Jaynes and show what a more successful theory of hypnosis based on this notion of consciousness might look like. I will briefly lay out the origins of hypnosis and why this phenomenon seems to carry with it a less than favourable image. I will isolate recurring classes of hypnotic phenomena and discuss what makes these phenomena so seemingly inexplicable (chapter 2). I will then move on to a discussion of our commonly held notion of consciousness and how it relates to hypnosis (chapter 3). The next step will be a discussion of different attempts at explaining hypnosis (chapter 4). Here I will point out the advantages as well as challenges of each of the theories presented, concluding that they all face difficulties based on their underlying notion of consciousness. Following this will be a discussion of Jaynes’s concept of consciousness, shedding light on the differences between his notion and the formerly discussed commonly held understanding of consciousness, as well as presenting potential criticisms of Jaynes’ idea (chapter 5). I will then present Jaynes’ theory of hypnosis, hoping to further flesh out, clarify and develop the different parts of his theory. This theory will then be shown to integrate the advantages of modern models of hypnosis while doing away with their formerly discussed challenges (chapter 6). Lastly, a brief conclusion with suggestions for further research is presented (chapter 7), followed by this essay’s bibliography (chapter 8).","['Hypnosis', 'Consciousness', 'Julian Jaynes', 'Bicamerality', 'Bicameral Mind', 'Trance']"

The aspects of the language variety that are investigated include the accent and its fragmentation and dialectology across various groups. The paper will analyse several vowels and how these are articulated in SAE as well as their evolution in the main regional settings of the country. The main English dialects of the Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal and Gauteng have been assessed to determine how SAE is employed in various contexts. The paper also goes into detail about the origins of the language variety and determines the structure of its vocabulary, which has undergone the most significant changes over time. This section delves into uniquely South African lexical items and words. It also looks at the topic areas where one can clearly see substratum influences or borrowing from the landscape, culinary influences, politically engineered language as well as ethnic and cultural remnants which have made their way into SAE’s idiosyncratic vocabulary. The research would not be complete without touching on the evolving linguistic attitudes towards English during an important transitional phase for the citizens of this country in which language plays a pivotal role.

Entrepreneurship in Russia: the root-cause of stalemate in development,"Stankovic, Nikola","['Skalamera, Morena']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the development of entrepreneurship and SME sector in the post-Soviet Russia. More specifically, it investigates the root-cause of stagnant development of entrepreneurship. Convinced that the answer lies in the legacy of the 1990s crisis period, the thesis poses the following question: To what extent is the legacy of formal and informal constraints to businesses in the 1990s impacting the development of entrepreneurship and SME sector in contemporary Russia? As such, the goal of the thesis is to set a clear diagnosis that will provide a framework with strong foundations for future researchers, thereby aiding them in tackling the problem from the root. For that reason, a new hybrid framework is developed, which looks at structural (top-down) and ideational (bottom-up) factors. Based on the findings, Russia currently does not have a political, economic and socio-cultural structure in which entrepreneurship is in high demand. Statist-patrimonial capitalism, thriving corruption, unfavorable credit conditions, bureaucratic and administrative barriers still pose major problems for small and medium businesses. The overarching culture of informality as an accelerator for achieving goals, low entrepreneurial intentions and deteriorated entrepreneurs’ trust in the state are other survivors of the 1990s transition. Many practices have thus, survived the turbulent transition or have evolved from it. However, the essence has remained the same, which keeps the 1990s legacy alive and the vicious circle turning, thereby leaving entrepreneurship and SME stuck in development. Unless the problem of stalemate in development is tackled from the core on the political, economic and the socio-cultural fronts, it is not likely that major advancements will be made in building a strong entrepreneurial Russia with a large and dynamic SME sector.","['Entrepreneurship', 'SMEs', 'Russia', 'Informality', 'Development', 'Constraints']"

Colonial Representations of Brazil and their current display at Western museums: The Mauritshuis case and the Dutch gaze,"Monteiro, Carolina","['Zijlmans, Kitty']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"From 1630 to 1654 the Dutch West India Company have succeeded in establishing a colony in the Northeast part of Brazil, then under the dominance of Portugal. Its most preeminent governor, Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, administered the protectorate through slave and sugar trade, inviting artists, botanists and scientists to document the natives and new inhabitants’ daily life and customs. Johan Maurits’ collection of Brazilian representations and artefacts was mostly donated throughout his life in order to secure him alliances after his return from Brazil and most of the works made during the period are now in European museums, such as the Mauritshuis, in the Netherlands. As art is rarely dissociated from its appreciation, it is vital in the contemporary postcolonial world that we discuss, not only the production of these artworks, but also their display, their reception and more importantly, their role in present day societies. The role of Johan Maurits as a ‘benefactor of the arts’ has been broadly praised by scholarly research, and his effort in documenting the daily life in the ‘New World’ has been commonly seen as the work of a ‘humanist prince’ in the tropics. Nonetheless, I argue that precisely because of this mythification of Dutch Brazil, historiography has failed so far – with a few exceptions – in critically analysing the representations produced during the Dutch occupation. By considering these works as true masterpieces only possible because of the effort of a magnificent patron, the relationship between the artist, his commissioner and the object is overlooked. The social and hierarchical interpretations of what is depicted give room to formalist approaches, and the impact of this fruitful production in the imaginary of a European audience is again ignored. This thesis intends to analyse these representations and their impact on the understanding and the construction of an identity of Brazilian society as viewed by Europeans. Taking Frans Post's View of Itamaracá Island (1637) as a case study, it envisions to connect the postcolonial debate of representation with the museum practice in the contemporary and discuss the role of institutions as bearers of colonial legacies.","['colonial Brazil', 'colonial artworks', 'Dutch Brazil', 'representation', 'exotic gaze', 'Frans Post', 'Albert Eckhout']"
Dutch Responses to US Foreign Policy in the 21st Century,"Aken, Pepijn van","['Thakur, Vineet']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis concerns the Dutch responses to US foreign policy in the 21st century. The research involves an analysis of the responses to the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War, which serve as case studies. The thesis examines which theory – bandwagoning or soft balancing – explains the Dutch position in the context of the War on Terror. The realist theories of soft balancing and bandwagoning are two opposing approaches. In brief, soft balancing concerns strategies that are aimed at balancing the exceptional power of the United States, without provoking a disproportionate response from America. In contrast, bandwagoning involves strategies of staying close to the dominant power, in order to profit from the alliance in political, economic, or military-strategic terms. In this context, the Netherlands is an interesting case. As most of Western Europe, the Netherlands bandwagoned with the United States for its security and reconstruction after WWII. However, it is argued that Western European countries soft balanced against the US in the context of the War on Terror. The literature often focuses on France and Germany, but overlooks smaller countries, such as the Netherlands. The Dutch do not have the interest to soft balance against the United States, as it is reliant on its trans-Atlantic ally for its security and economy. However, the Netherlands does not have the interest to provoke its European allies either, as European integration and cooperation has benefitted the Dutch economy. Because of the uncompromising stance of France and Germany in the War on Terror, the Dutch foreign policy of ‘adapting as best as possible’ was complicated. As such, how did the Netherlands achieve its foreign policy goals without damaging its relations with any of its allies? This thesis outlines the government responses of the Netherlands to the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War. From the analysis comes forward that the Dutch foreign policy was consistently about bandwagoning with the United States. By continuous bandwagoning, the Netherlands tried to obtain a better strategic position. Moreover, it tried to show the United States the importance of NATO, and to prevent the US from losing its interest in the trans-Atlantic alliance. The War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War sparked different responses throughout Europe. France and Germany agreed with most of America’s allies that the invasion of Afghanistan and the removal of the Taliban regime was a legitimate response to the terrorist attacks in September 11th. However, they adopted a different standpoint in the context of the Iraq War. The Netherlands remained supportive of the US endeavours in the Middle East. Against this background, the Netherlands tried to deliver European support to the United States. When it failed to do so, it offered limited support to the US, in order to not provoke its European allies.","['United States', 'Foreign Policy', 'Netherlands', 'Soft Balancing', 'Bandwagoning', 'Responses']"
In the footsteps of the past. Contemporary Russian prison camp memoirs in the context of the tradition of Gulag memoir writing,"Mortel, Lisanne Marijn van de","['Boele, Otto']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the reappearance of the Russian prison camp memoir. It investigates how these contemporary prison camp memoirs are connected to prison camp writing from the past. I used the contemporary prison camp memoirs of Maria Alyokhina (2017) and Ildar Dadin (2018). Both were political prisoners, convicted in politically motivated trials, and served sentenced in the modern day system of Russian penal colonies. Their memoirs are a product of the growing repression that takes place under president Vladimir Putin. Russia has a long tradition of prison camp writing. The contemporary prison camp memoirs recall this past, and are therefore looked at in the context of this tradition, especially that of Gulag memoir writing. The thesis first looks at the most important aspects of the narratives of the contemporary memoirs, which they share with Gulag memoirs (retrospect, testimonial function and a bi-functionality). Secondly it investigates the structure of the narratives, and how these share the four morphological features of Gulag memoirs as formulated by Leona Toker, who analyzed the corpus of Gulag memoirs. Thirdly, it explores how the authors of the contemporary prison camp memoirs inscribe their memoirs in the tradition of Russian prison camp writing, and how they deploy the past in their narratives about the present.","['Contemporary prison camp memoirs', 'Gulag memoirs', 'Maria Alyokhina', 'Ildar Dadin', 'Penal colonies']"

Demystifying Pan-Somali Nationalism Through a Historical Analysis of Nation-building: The Case for Ethno-consociationalism.,"Abdi Igal, Abdullahi","['Bellucci, S. (Stefano)']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Introduction There are many political and socio-economic developments that have shaped Somalia’s past and continues to the present. One such example is the rise of ‘pan-Somali nationalism’, otherwise known ‘Soomaalinimo’, which can be described as a political and ideological belief system that rests upon ethno-Somali nationalism. Those who adhere to pan-Somali nationalism specifically yearn for the establishment of a unified ‘Greater-Somalia’, whereby the five regions which historically had been inhabited by ethnic Somalis are reunified under a single Somali nation. The five territories encompassed the Italian Somaliland, the British Somali land, French Somaliland of Djibouti, The Ogaadeen region in Ethiopia and northern frontier district which British colonial administers incorporated into Kenya (Taylor 2014, 91). The discourse of pan-Somali nationalism implies that Somalis are hostages of a neo-colonial project and that the current boundaries of the Somali state are artificial. As such, these borders were critiqued because they were arbitrarily drawn up by colonialists and baselessly divide Somalia into five distinct states (MacArthur 2019,118). In its early stages in the second half of the 20th century, pan-Somali nationalism played a critical role in unifying different tribes and ethnic denominations that had historically been hostile to one another due to clashes over natural resources and grazing land. In fact, for the first time in history, Somalis became more nationalistic and began to share a common ‘Somali’ identity, consequently strengthening the existing Somali nationalist movements in the 1950s and 1960s (Schraeder 2006,87). Anti-colonial sentiment drove them to seek the establishment of a pan-Somali nation-state, whereby the homogeneous Somali society with its common culture, creed and ethnicity could be unified under one state (Schraeder 2006,85). The rise of pan-Somali nationalism can be specifically attributed to the emergence of a new political class of elites between 1940 and 1950. This group of elites advocated for complete independence from Italian and British colonial rules and urged the formation of a unified pan-Somali state (Lewis 2002,116). Nevertheless, within a relatively short period of time, these nationalist elites became more concerned with preserving their own tribal identities and interests than achieving national unity within the state. As such, discussions concerning discourses around Pan-Somali nationalism and Greater-Somalia become a political instrument that enabled the newly-emerged political class to maintain power (Lewis 2002,118). The dysfunctionality of PanSomali nationalism became increasingly evident in the aftermath of the 1977 Ethio-Somali war as clashes between nationalist leaders caused them to retreat in defence of their clan interests. Such events, in combination with additional historical developments, eventually culminated in the collapse of Somalia’s central government in 1992 (Alasow 2010,25). This paper investigates how ‘Pan-Somalism’ ushered in a unique euphoria that created a decisive force of shared national identity within the fragmented Somali society that had previously never experienced any sort of centralised functioning bureaucracy This paper attempts to explore how pan-Somali nationalism and its path towards modernisation clashed with Somalis’ traditional agnatic clan system. As such, this paper will demonstrate the clash between modernisation and traditional fundamentalism amongst Somalis led to the collapse of the central government. henceforth, this thesis seeks to answer the following question: How did ‘Pan-Somali nationalism’ and tribalism undermined the formation and lead to the collapse of the Somali state in the period between 1950 and 1992? The structure of the thesis is as follows: Chapter 1 highlights the historical underpinnings of pan-Somali nationalism and its effectiveness in creating a shared identity, geographical specificity and solidarity within Somali society. Chapter 2 presents the methodologies and theoretical approaches used to answer the research question. Chapter 3 examines how clannism infiltrated the Italian administration and how it derailed Somali politics, leading the country to encounter divisive tribal-based politics. Chapter 4 emphasizes the challenges of a post-independent Somalia where clannism became Some form of political source. Chapter 5 addresses the consequences of pan-Somali nationalism, putting forth a new paradigm called ethnoconsociationalism as a potential lasting solution to the Somali impasse.","['Pan-Somali nationalism', 'colonial artificial boundaries', 'Greater-Somalia', 'Hybrid identity', 'Tribalism', 'state formation', 'civil wars', 'Ethno-Consociationalism']"

Hiervoor zal er eerst worden gekeken naar de ontwikkelingen in de wet, waarom de wet is geworden zoals die nu is. Dit wordt gedaan door middel van een historische analyse in hoofdstuk 2. Vervolgens zal in hoofdstuk 2 worden uitgelegd hoe de MTSA in elkaar zit en welke groepen geesteszieke delinquenten niet in aanmerking komen voor dit systeem. Als laatste zal er in hoofdstuk 2 ook worden gekeken naar wat het strafwetboek van Japan zegt over de veroordeling van geesteszieke delinquenten en wat er daadwerkelijk gebeurt. Zo zijn er zaken waarbij delinquenten met een geestelijke achterstand en delinquenten die ten tijde van hun executie geestesziek waren, toch geëxecuteerd. Terwijl de wet voorschrijft dat dit niet mogelijk hoort te zijn. Vervolgens zal er in hoofdstuk 3 gekeken worden naar de verandering in de strafrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid, het punitief populisme en de doodstraf. Deze sociale factoren kunnen de ineffectieve praktische toepassing van de wet rondom geesteszieke delinquenten verklaren. Er zal gebruik worden gemaakt van een theoretisch kader van Fenwick om het punitief populisme in Japan te verklaren. Hoewel het punitief populisme in voorgaande onderzoeken omtrent geesteszieke delinquenten vaak kort wordt benoemd, zal er een uitgebreide analyse worden gedaan van het punitief populisme in Japanse context en hoe dit fenomeen invloed uitoefent op andere sociale factoren, zoals de strafrechtelijke aansprakelijkheid.","['geestesziekte', 'punitief populisme', 'Japan', 'strafrecht', 'doodstraf', 'geesteszieke delinquenten']"

In tradition of their Soviet history, the Central Asian regimes declared themselves strictly secular. However, these countries, too, are affected by increasing Islamic radicalism. This thesis therefore researches the link between regime consolidation in Central Asia and a (perceived) Islamic threat. It tries to answer the question whether and how the Central Asian states are instrumentalising a fear of Islamic radicalism to increase their hold on power. I have included five case studies to assess the research question, which are Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. As it turns out, Central Asian governments use a (perceived) Islamic threat in order to eliminate opposition and control their population. Increased security mainly served as a justification for increased surveillance and persecution.","['Central Asia', 'Islamic threat', 'Regime consolidation', 'Radicalisation']"

One of the most common products consumed onboard the trains during long journeys is the ekiben. Another service providing food onboard trains is the dining car (shokudōsha). While the ekiben continued to thrive, the shokudōsha were discontinued completely in 2002. This thesis explains why this difference in prosperity exists through an examination of the history of the shokudōsha and the ekiben. Thereafter, it explains how societal changes influenced the cultural significance of both services. The thesis concluded that there was a difference in cultural significance between the shokudōsha and the ekiben.

Cold War Civil Rights: A Visual Analysis of Soviet Propaganda Posters,"Amoani, Shanicee","['Frear, Matthew J.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study aims to interpret Soviet propaganda posters published in the 1960s and 1970s using a selection of multidisciplinary analytical tools. More specifically this selection of eight Soviet posters are inspired by America's race relations, the Civil Rights era and the Cold War, with a particular focus on the USSR’s symbolic depictions of the state of African American civil rights during this time. To this end, the research questions is as follows: What can be interpreted from the state of African American civil rights as depicted in the Soviet Union’s propaganda posters from the 1960s and 1970s? The research question is answered through interpretation that is guided through the selection of academic research that looks at content analysis as well as the use of logical inference, such as the close analysis of visual ideology and linguistic meaning. This paper hopes to demonstrate one way in which the Soviet Union wished to contradict America’s democratic, free and liberal façade. Furthermore, it will exhibit how the Soviet Union worked to present their ideological enemy as a capitalist hypocrite in order to win the hearts and minds of its domestic audience, during a war that focused on a battle of political propaganda. On this basis, it can be interpreted that the intentions of the Soviet Union were to undermine the United States of America shown through the selection of these eight posters, although I do recognise that this in no way a definitive representation of all Soviet propaganda posters that depicted African Americans. Future research and the analysis of a wider pool of propaganda material published within a greater time frame, that targets an international audience would reveal other lines of ideological criticism, symbolic messages and would therefore draw broader conclusions.","['African-American', 'Cold War', 'Propaganda Posters', 'Interpretation', 'Civil Rights', 'Soviet Union', 'Race Relations']"

The second dimension focuses on the accessibility of cram schools, and brings the debate of inequality and social immobility to this study.

Friend or foe: portrayals of China in the Taiwan 2018 election,"Jong, Erik de","['Black, Lindsay']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the 2018 local elections in Taiwan; although the elections were aimed at electing officials at a local level, the relation between Taiwan and China has been heavily discussed. This thesis analyses the way in which the Liberty Times and the United Daily News, as mouthpieces of respectively the DPP and the KMT, have created a discourse on cross-strait relations. In doing so, an analysis is made of Fake News, a topic discussed mostly by the DPP, and the 1992 consensus, a topic mostly discussed by the KMT. This thesis argues that the discourse as created by the DPP-side is less stable compared to the KMT-side, as a result of the traditional viewpoints that both parties adhere to. The image of the DPP as protector of Taiwanese freedom and democracy forces the DPP to a position where they have to paint China as an aggressor, using the issue of Chinese Fake News as one of its tools. In doing so, the DPP itself uses assumptions and exaggerations, thereby becoming a producer of fake news as well. Although the KMT also makes use of assumptions and exaggerations, the fact that the KMT portrays itself as a party aimed at economic progress makes it possible to take a more neutral stance.","['Taiwan', 'Elections', 'Discourse Analysis']"

The Conflagrations of Ottoman Istanbul in the Late 18th and Early 19th Centuries According to Ottoman and European Sources,"Burak, Fici","['HPA, Theunissen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Of all the disasters that hit Ottoman cities, earthquakes and fires belonged to the most harmful. Throughout centuries, the capital city of the Ottoman Empire suffered numerous catastrophic city fires, or conflagrations, not in the least because of its wooden architecture and narrow streets that made the city vulnerable to fires. Accidents and sometimes arson were the main causes for the conflagrations which, because of the wooden houses, the building density, and lack of proper prevention methods regularly resulted in major catastrophes which had profound impact on both the personal, social and economic life of the inhabitants of the capital city. According to European diplomats, fires were sometimes so powerful that they not only reshaped entire districts but also had major impact on the larger political and social constellation of a particular period in time. Arson sometimes in combination with plunder was a mechanism that was regularly used by groups, such as the Janissaries, in order to ventilate protest and put pressure on the authorities. The fires of Istanbul were thus sometimes more than mere accidents. This thesis analyses the conflagrations (city fires) of Istanbul, their causes and effects on the capital city throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, a turbulent period during which the state and Janissaries conflicted.","['18th century', 'conflagrations', 'Istanbul']"

Heritagisation of Borobudur,"Wanadya, Jovanka","['Paskaleva, Elena']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Candi Borobudur is one of the most prominent ‘heritage sites’ in Indonesia. Since its ‘rediscovery’ by Dutch colonists, researchers have been using Western approaches to gain insight in the function, surroundings and overall significance of the candi. In doing so, many scholars have overlooked the Buddhist theological aspects that demonstrate the existence of a cultural landscape in the form of a representative mandala. Within this cultural landscape, local villagers had long maintained a self-sufficient way of life that was both environmentally friendly and economically diverse. Nevertheless, the Dutch East Indies government prescribed that Candi Borobudur be a ‘monument’ and appropriated it as part of Dutch imperial legacy. This narrow understanding is the basis of the ‘heritagisation’ of Candi Borobudur, manifested in its spatial reduction and the omission of its intangible features. After the Republic of Indonesia’s independence, the New Order regime continued to ‘heritagise’ the candi by conducting an exhaustive restoration in the 1970s. An example of ‘crypto-colonialism’ and ‘authorised heritage’, the restoration culminated in Candi Borobudur’s inscription in UNESCO’s World Heritage Site List in 1991. According to the official Indonesian narrative, the candi is a ‘monument’ that epitomises Indonesian cultural and historical wealth. Inspired by the republic’s Pancasila ideology, such a narrative is to instill a sense of ownership of the candi among Indonesians. Ironically, the process of ‘heritagisation’ of Candi Borobudur has entailed the co-optation of obsolete legislation and forced evictions of local communities. Given that the candi is a Buddhist site in a Muslim-majority country, its religious meaning has also become increasingly foreign. Overall, the ‘heritagisation’ of Candi Borobudur demonstrates both a combination of and a contention between ‘colonial’ and nationalist practices.","['borobudur', 'buddhist heritage in indonesia', 'dutch colonial heritage', 'critical heritage studies', 'indonesia', 'dutch east indies', 'pancasila', 'heritagisation', 'unesco', 'cultural landscape']"
Een vertrouwde fout... Verankering van Herodotus in de tragedie,"Korte, Inez de","['Berkel, Tazuko van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Griekse en Latijnse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In een tijd dat teksten van enige literaire kwaliteit nog veelal mondeling in poëzievorm werden voorgedragen, stelde Herodotus als één van de eersten een prozatekst samen over de geschiedenis van mensen. Het verschil tussen deze 'Historiën' en contemporaine poëzie is echter niet zwart-wit: veel elementen uit Herodotus' werk zijn terug te voeren op de contemporaine Griekse tragedie. Waar in de wetenschappelijke literatuur veelal slechts wordt geconstateerd dat deze overeenkomsten er zijn of lijkt te worden aangenomen dat Herodotus eenvoudigweg is beïnvloed door zijn omgeving, meen ik dat deze parallellen kunnen worden begrepen als een vorm van verankering. In mijn scriptie ga ik hiervoor na hoe Herodotus door middel van tragische motieven en een tragische vertelstructuur in de Lydische logos een tragisch referentiekader opzet. Vervolgens onderzoek ik in hoeverre dit tragische referentiekader terugkomt in Herodotus' verhaal over Polycrates en over Periander, om tot slot stil te staan bij de relevantie van een tragisch referentiekader voor Herodotus' werk. Mijn conclusie is dat Herodotus tragische motieven en een tragische vertelstructuur gebruikt als 'ankers'. Door deze op verschillende plaatsen in zijn 'Historiën' te verwerken, probeert hij binnen het intellectuele, competitieve milieu van zijn tijd zijn nieuwe vorm van historiografie op een redelijke of zinnige manier te koppelen aan de belevingswereld van zijn publiek.","['verankering', 'Herodotus', 'Herodotus en tragedie', 'interdiscursiviteit', 'Historiën', 'tragische vertelstructuur', 'tragisch motief']"

This unique approach paints a picture of a well-read man with connections in influential literary circles and interest in literary and philosophical topics. This analysis required the creation of an extensive database, transcribing and fixing mistakes from the auction catalogue from 1701. This database supported the quantitative and qualitative observations on Leti’s reading habits and interests. Quantitatively, the database agreed with the usual accounts of Leti's life as a typical seventeenth-century academic and educated historian, accounts that have been discussed in the few bibliographies focusing on Leti. Qualitatively, this thesis highlighted a thoroughness and range of interest matching the profile of a seventeenth-century scholar. While analysing Leti’s life and personality, this thesis also introduces some changes in the seventeenth century, including an analysis of philosophical and literary movements that became more prominent in this period.","['library', 'Gregorio Leti', 'seventeenth century']"

By reconstructing the experiences of North-African men in the Armée d’Afrique during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, this thesis highlights the inconsistencies inherent to this policy. Additionally, it argues that the colonial military’s formal aspects, such as pay, pensions, promotions and treatment in the military justice system, challenge the current discourse that the ideology was merely imperial rhetoric without substance. In line with the ´new´ military history’s focus on the relationship between war and society, this thesis draws on a myriad of sources to explore a wide range of aspects of colonial deployment during the Second Empire, including: recruitment, uniforms, mobilisation, decorations, religion, food, language, health and hospitalization, housing, combat performance, casualties, public image and treatment as prisoners of war (POWs). It thereby elucidates how the fall of the Second Empire at the end of the Franco-Prussian War, in many ways proved a break with the Third French Republic in terms of the status and treatment of French colonial soldiers.","['Arab Kingdom', 'Second Empire', 'Napoleon III', 'Algeria', ""Armée d'Afrique""]"

The enhanced music rhythmic perception of second language learners of English,"Roncaglia-Denissen, M. Paula","['Grijzenhout, Janet']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Rhythm is an organizational device in language and in music. In both domains, rhythm helps to structure the sound stream (speech or music), by grouping auditory events, that is, sounds and pauses, into meaningful units together in a hierarchical manner. In language, speech rhythm is of importance because it helps speech segmentation and intelligibility and it belongs to the linguistic inventory of a language. Mastering the rhythmic properties of a language is just as important as mastering any relevant linguistic information. When learning a second language (L2), together with its vocabulary and grammar, second language learners must also master a set of rhythmic properties that are either in partial or in complete overlap with their first language or that are completely different. This is the case because languages of the world diverge in terms of their use of rhyhtmic properties and metric preferences. Previous research has described the world' s languages as being stress-timed, syllable-timed or mora-timed languages. Stress-timed languages, from which English is the exemplary item, have the metric foot as their unit of speech perception and production. The metric foot is a combination of one stressed syllable dominating zero or more unstressed ones. In syllable-timed languages, is the syllable, regardless of stress that functions as unit of speech production and perception. In mora-timed languages, it is the mora, a sub-unit of the syllable. Being sensitive to different sets of rhythmic properties may present an advantage to L2 learners, as these could help them more promptly identify and select the target language. Previous research has shown that individuals who master languages with different rhythmic properties are more sensitive to music rhythmic variation than individuals who master languages with similar rhythmic preferences or with very low-proficiency in an L2. The current thesis addresses two of these claims, namely, that learning languages with similar rhythmic properties does not present such an advantage to rhythmic perception as mastering languages with distinct use of rhythm; and that learning a second language, regardless of its rhythmic similarities to or differences from one's first language, enhances individuals' rhythmic perception. This thesis does so by conducting two meta-analyses, using data from two different studies by Roncaglia-Denissen and colleagues (2016; 2013). The results support both claims, namely that learning a second language with similar rhythmic properties as one's first language does not present such a great advantage as mastering languages with different rhythmic properties and that proficiency in a second language is positively associated with individuals' music rhythmic perception. The implication of these findings is that speech rhythm seems to be part of a domain-general skill, which is used in and transferred to different cognitive domains, whenever acoustic similarities between domains are encountered.","['Speech rhythm', 'L2', 'English as a second language', 'music']"

Beyond Retirement Age: Digging Into the Untapped Potential of the Elderly,"Wit, Steef de","['Shibata, Saori']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Being a super-ageing society brings a plethora of problems: social, political and economic. This thesis will limit itself to the economic problems and their political implications due to its limited scope. The most common mentioned problems associated with an ageing society are the pressure on 1) the healthcare system, 2) the pension system, and 3) the labour market. Yet, the current situation is that most elderly workers above 65 are not welcome in the workforce, despite all the relief they can offer. The conclusion of this thesis is that the resistance is due to ageism and archaic employment systems. In order to create a more accommodating employment situation for the elderly, a salary system revision is necessary. The existing literature, however, lacks concrete plans in regards to revising such system. Based on a case study at a company that was in the midst of introducing a salary system revision, this thesis tries to explain the measures that are needed to realise this revision successfully. The most important elements of realising this system are basing salary on performance and only giving promotions if there are vacancies. This will create a system where salaries are equal to production, as opposed to tenure.","['Retirement Age', 'Japanese Political Economy', 'Elderly Workforce']"
Polish Politeness in English Apologies.,"Zegar, Magdalena","['Boogaart, R.J.U.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This investigation explores pragmatic competence of Polish L2 English speakers in offensive situations. The learning of politeness in a second language requires a process of ‘re-framing’, meaning enriching already existing patterns of behaviour in a given context in the native language to schemas appropriate in the target language (Brown, 2010). Acquiring pragmatic competence in a second language is a difficult process especially if the culture of the target language is different from the native one. Polish L2 speakers of English are likely to transfer the pragmatic knowledge of their L1 to L2 they acquire and thus might use different politeness strategies in apologies from native users of English, especially since Polish and Anglo-Saxon culture have been classified as positive politeness and negative politeness culture respectively (Lubecka, 2000). With the use of Ogiermann’s (2009) method based on Brown and Levinson’s (1987) Politeness Theory, the study reveals that Polish L2 English speakers, in general, seem to use similar apology strategies as English native speakers hence employ negative politeness strategies. Nonetheless, to some extent, they show the tendency to employ positive politeness apology strategies which pose threat to the speaker’s negative face and enhance the speaker’s and hearer’s positive face needs. The findings suggest that some cultural aspects are particularly difficult to overcome and therefore teaching pragmatics to second language learners should be improved.","['re-framing', 'apology strategies', 'pragmatic competence of Polish L2 English speakers', 'positive and negative politeness cultures']"
The Recognition of E-sports in Japan,"Raven, Richard","['Veere, H. (Henny) van der']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The field of research on e-sports is relatively new, and research about e-sports in Japan is limited. Broadly speaking, e-sports refers to video games that are played competitively in tournaments and leagues. This study will first further elaborate on the term e-sports and explain e-sports by breaking it down into the player, organizational and spectatorship aspects. A review of the literature on Japanese e-sports, and looking at the state of e-sports in Japan reveals several aspects that will form the basis of this study. Firstly, e-sports is a global phenomenon but has had its own developmental trajectory in each country (Kato Hiroyasu, 2018b, p. 136). Japan is considered to be behind developmentally in terms of e-sports compared to countries like South Korea (Kanbe Masayuki, 2012). Further, the literature on Japanese e-sports is scarce. Scholars have argued that the literature on game related studies is Western-centric, and argue that studies are needed that use knowledge of Japanese studies to examine game culture in Japan (Picard & Pelletier-Gagnon, 2015, p. 1-2). Thirdly, Japanese scholars such as Kato Hiroyasu argue for the interpretation of e-sports as a sport rather than seeing games as play (in the sense of leisure of pastime). The scholar Taylor has also broken down the process of professionalization that players experience on their way to becoming pro gamers in e-sports. These two scholars involve themselves in the question of professionalization (transformation from someone who plays games to a pro gamer who makes their living off competing), and the question of recognition (of e.g. society seeing e-sports as a sport). Recognition is a process that can come in various forms and facilitates the process of professionalization. Recognition in the form of e-sports being (legally) recognized as a sport can offer pro gamers the benefit of being recognized as an athlete. Recognition in the form of pro gamers receiving valorization from society can improve their social status, and enable them to receive more social support (from e.g. friends or family) when they decide to professionalize. Finally, this study identifies several sources that contribute to the process of the recognition of e-sports in Japan: pro gamers, the Japan e-Sports Union (JeSU), and a discourse about e-sports as a potential Olympic event. This study sees an opportunity to contribute to the Area Studies and Game Studies literature by taking the recognition of e-sports in Japan as its focus. This opportunity lies in the fact that each country, and thus Japan as well, has had its own developmental trajectory of e-sports, and that the literature on e-sports is scarce and studies using a perspective rooted in Japanese studies are needed. In order to examine the recognition of e-sports in Japan this study will focus on pro gamers, and analyze how they contribute to the process of recognition. Thus, the main question in this study is: how do pro gamers contribute to the process of the recognition of e-sports in Japan? In order to answer the question of how these pro gamers contribute to the process of recognition this study will analyze how pro gamers in Japan represent themselves in the media and strive for recognition from society in order to be taken seriously as people who dedicate themselves to playing video games competitively. The analysis will reveal the strategies that pro players use to represent themselves in the media and personally emancipate themselves. The analysis will also reveal an interplay between elements of the (Japanese) cultural context players find themselves in and the strategies players use to push recognition of e-sports in Japanese society. This will show the nuance that using a Japanese studies perspective to study e-sports reveals, and try to address the problem of the Western centric literature on e-sports and games studies while contributing to the Area Studies literature.","['e-sports', 'video games', 'japan', 'pro gamers', 'game center', 'street fighter', 'fighting games', 'arcades']"

Mijn keuze voor dit onderwerp komt voort uit mijn persoonlijke belangstelling voor de rechten en de plichten van vrouwen in de Turkse samenleving. De publieke moraal en de sociale controle waarmee de vrouw anno 2019 nog steeds mee te maken heeft, was tevens één van de redenen om aan deze studie te beginnen. Gedurende mijn zoektocht naar informatie over de ontwikkelingen van vrouwenrechten in Turkije heb ik het boek van Şefika Kurnaz Cumhuriyet öncesinde Türk kadını (Turkse vrouw voor de republiek) bestudeerd. Ik heb haar boek veelvuldig gebruikt in mijn onderzoek. In de inleiding schrijft Şefika Kurnaz het volgende; “Halbuki, kadın haklarının günümüzde ulaştığı merhalenin laikiyle anlaşılabilmesi için Cumhuriyet öncesi devirlerdeki gelişmelerin gün ışığına çıkarılmasına ihtiyaç vardır.” (Echter, om de bereikte ontwikkelingen op het gebied van vrouwenrechten goed te kunnen begrijpen is er behoefte om de ontwikkelingen voor de republikeinse periode ook in het daglicht te brengen.) Om het heden te begrijpen zijn de ontwikkelingen van het verleden bepalend. Dit maakte dat ik mij vooral gericht heb op de periode vóór de uitroeping van de Turkse Republiek in 1923. De positie van de vrouw binnen de Turkse samenleving, vooral in het westen, heeft zich de laatste jaren weliswaar verder ontwikkeld. Echter naar mijn mening is de positie van de vrouw nog niet evenwichtig en gelijkwaardig genoeg. Dit onderzoek beoogt om de drie belangrijkste elementen die ingezet zijn voor de emancipatie van de Osmaanse vrouwen bijeen te brengen en een bijdrage te leveren aan de bestaande werken. Deze elementen zijn onderwijs, vrouwenverenigingen en vrouwenbladen. In mijn onderzoek zal ik ook aandacht besteden aan de hervormingen die vrouwen meer rechten hebben gegeven. De ontwikkelingen op het gebied van binnenlandse onderwijs, de vrouwenverenigingen die ieder vanuit eigen gedachtengoed ondersteunend zijn geweest voor vrouwen en de vrouwenbladen die vóór de oprichting van de Turkse Republiek zijn verschenen zullen behandeld worden.","['Vrouw', 'Osmaanse Rijk', 'Turkse Republiek', 'vrouwenrechten', 'vrouwenverenıgıngen', 'vrouwenbladen', 'feminisme', 'gender studies', 'filantropie', 'Patriarchaat']"

Ik heb geprobeerd een eenduidig antwoord hierop te geven door middel van drie invalshoeken. Ik heb gekeken naar de reacties van kranten in de week na het interview van Joop Hueting, de reacties van de Nederlandse kranten op de buitenlandse dekolonisatie-problematiek en de rol van de historici in de productie van de excessennota. Het wordt duidelijk dat Nederland in 1969 aan het moderniseren was. Haar reactie op de Hueting-affaire lijkt dit echter op een aantal manieren niet te bevestigen. De kranten reageren (op hun eigen manier) gematigd op een donker dekolonisatieverleden. Op hetzelfde moment is de Nederlandse blik op de buitenlandse dekolonisatiepolitiek echter wel kritisch. Opmerkelijk is verder de positie van de wetenschappers. Vele historici willen in 1969 niet meewerken aan de excessennota.

As both of these texts engage with concepts of selfhood amid themes of social engagement and social isolation, they make ideal candidates for an investigation of this kind. The intentions of this thesis are, firstly, to show how the texts reveal that perceptions of self can be moulded by these contrasting states of sociality and solitude, and, secondly, to highlight the novels’ depictions of the consequences of each state. Because the perceptions of self these states generate manifest themselves in real-world behaviour and essentially influence self-creation, it is worth considering these consequences as represented by a literary movement which so carefully scrutinised the dichotomies of perception and reality, and self and other. By employing a psychological approach to character analyses of selected figures in the texts, this research will cast light on these characters’ personal relationships with sociality and solitude, consequently revealing how their lives, and their understandings of themselves, are positively and negatively influenced by each.","['Solitude', 'Sociality', 'Self-Concept', 'Mrs Dalloway', 'Good Morning Midnight', 'Virginia Woolf', 'Jean Rhys', 'Modernism', 'Memory']"
We Are Animals: The Allegorical Potential of Animals in Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs,"Bosch, Max","['Leeuwen, E.J. (Evert Jan) van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Because Isle of Dogs is simultaneously an animated picture involving talking animals and a work of socio-political critique, the movie and its central themes can be perceived differently by both children and adults (Rosenburg). For children, Isle of Dogs tells the tale of a boy’s desperate quest to find his lost dog. For adults, however, themes of imprisonment such as dogs in camps allude to American soldiers in Japanese POW camps, Japanese American citizens in American internment camps, and the large amount of Jewish people in German concentration camps. For many adults watching the film, animals, and the dogs specifically, become allegorical vehicles for historical tenors. Moreover, contemporary political philosophies such as Trumpism are also respectively scrutinized, criticized, and satirized in the film, adding another layer of political allegory to this richly allusive film. In turn, the references to the various events that took place during the Second World War draw out contrasts and parallels with current American politics, emphasizing that history can repeat itself, according to Anderson.",

Primogenituur en erftradities in Ernestiner Saksen,"Gender, Michaël Franciscus Maria van de","['Duindam, Jeroen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In de 19de eeuw werd primogenituur als een van de belangrijkste kenmerken in het proces van vooruitgang van staatsvorming in Europa gezien. In het Duitse Keizerrijk werd dit denkbeeld aangevoerd door Hermann Johann Friedrich von Schulze. In de tweede helft van de 20ste eeuw werd de toepassing van het belang van het eerstgeboorterecht voor Duitsland door verschillende historici betwist. Paula Sutter Fichtner laat dat primogenituur in verscheidene prominente Duitse deelstaten pas vrij laat werd ingevoerd, ver nadat het proces van staatsvorming op gang was gekomen. Erfdeling was de norm volgens haar, waarbij religie bepalend was voor een vroegere of latere totstandkoming van primogenituur. Judith J. Hurwich bouwt verder op Fichtners bevindingen, maar stelt dat niet religie maar de economische situatie van een vorstenhuis bepalend was voor de totstandkoming van primogenituur. Hierbij gaat Hurwich echter niet in op één van Fichtners meest sprekende voorbeelden, de casus van Saksen. Deze scriptie zal onderzoek doen naar de totstandkoming van primogenituur in de Saksische erflanden en de rol die gelijke erfdeling daarin gespeeld heeft. Dit zal gebeuren aan de hand van zowel beschrijvende literatuur als eigentijdse documenten. Voor dit laatste zal Schulze’s Die Hausgesetze der Regierenden Deutschen Fürstenhäuser gebruikt worden. Vanwege de ingeperkte omvang van deze scriptie zal enkel de protestantse Ernestiner dynastie besproken worden. Dit onderzoek laat vervolgens zien dat zowel moderne literatuur als de gebruikte bronnen economische malaise als primaire reden zagen voor de totstandkoming van primogenituur binnen Ernestiner Saksen. Bij een goede economische situatie werden de Saksische erftradities grotendeels gehandhaafd. Het belang van het religieuze element kan echter niet compleet achterwege gelaten worden, zonder een vergelijking met de Albertiner dynastie van Saksen te maken. Hier is echter meer onderzoek voor nodig.","['primogenituur', 'Saksen', 'Wettin', 'Ernestiner', 'Albertiner', 'Sachsen', 'Erftradities', 'Equality among brothers', 'Schulze', 'Eerstgeboorterecht', 'Duitsland', 'Heilige Roomse Rijk', 'Centraal Europa', 'Dynastieën', '1400-1800']"

Picking up the Pieces Confronting Heritage Trauma in the Post-Conflict national museums of Syria and Iraq,"Tommi, Arbiv","['Hoijtink, Mirjam']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis follows the trajectories of two museums, the National Museum of Damascus and the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, across the past two decades, to investigate the extent to which notions of nation, national heritage and the public good have come to be evaluated before, during and after conflict. Charged with pride and burdened with pain, the material heritage of this region in many ways stood at the centre of the conflicts of the past twenty years, and would come to define the future of the nations of Syria and Iraq. Tracing the histories of the two national museums, from closure to reopening, through the vantage point of the antiquities in their collections, this thesis strives to illustrate how Syrian and Iraqi heritage has been appropriated and narrated in strategic and contested ways by a diverse network of invested actors, both locally and globally. Drawing on exhibitions and press material surrounding pivotal events in these museums’ biographies, this thesis argues that in suppressing the legacy of pain and trauma with which their patrimonies are inscribed, local and international culture professionals impeded post-conflict healing and inadvertently acted against the interest of the public good. Reconstructing the museum and its destroyed collections could serve to incite national introspection and to reconnect the peoples of Syria and Iraq with the heritage from which they have for so long been alienated, but if recent years’ heritage trauma remains unaddressed in the post-conflict museum, genuine healing may never be attained. In order to lay the groundwork for reconciliation, and to pave the way for the transformation of conflict, this thesis proposes agonistic dialogue as the means through which museum professionals and museum publics may collectively come to terms with the healing and hurting sides of their national heritage.","['Nation', 'National museum', 'Civic mandate', 'healing heritage', 'hurting heritage', 'agonistic dialogue']"
Ingebed sensationalisme in televisienieuws: Het oordeel van Nederlandse millennials over sensationeel nieuws op televisie,"Pauwels, Pim","['Pleijter, Alexander']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het doel van deze kwalitatieve studie was om meer inzicht te krijgen en om te begrijpen hoe millennials nieuws op televisie beoordelen.

Zestien Nederlandse millennials zijn in semigestructureerde interviews gevraagd naar de geloofwaardigheid en aantrekkelijkheid van een nieuwsitem van Omroep West met ingebed sensationalisme. In de literatuur wordt geclaimd dat millennials sensatie in nieuws ongeloofwaardig vinden, maar er wel een voorkeur voor hebben. Dit komt niet overeen met de bevindingen in deze studie. Onder de meeste Nederlandse millennials heerst er namelijk consensus dat hard televisienieuws met sensationele kenmerken ongeloofwaardig en daardoor niet aantrekkelijk is. Zij zien liever dat hard nieuws op een niet-sensationele manier wordt gebracht. Daarmee vormen millennials een homogenere groep dan op voorhand werd gedacht. De meeste millennials vinden dat sensationele elementen wel gebruikt mogen op de voorwaarden dat de sensatie niet ten koste gaat van de informativiteit van het nieuws en dat de sensatie een doel dient: het moet de interesse in nieuws aanwakkeren of het moet bijdragen aan de impact van het nieuws.","['sensationalisme', 'journalistiek', 'journalism', 'televisie', 'nieuws', 'constructieve journalistiek', 'aantrekkelijkheid', 'geloofwaardigheid', 'ingebed sensationalisme', 'millennials']"

In deze studie verken ik op welke wijze Heideggers overdenkingen ontvangen zijn door hedendaagse techniekfilosofen. Er blijkt dat deze ontvangst overwegend kritisch is. In het bijzonder laat ik zien dat, waar Heidegger de techniek interpreteerde als een massaal, alles overkoepelend wezen, er van hedendaagse techniekfilosofen gezegd kan worden dat zij een empirische wending hebben gemaakt naar concrete technische artefacten in hun omgangspraktijk. Hierna laat ik zien, door mij voornamelijk te richten op de postfenomenologie van Don Ihde en Peter-Paul Verbeek, dat deze empirische wending problematischer is dan zij door empirische techniekfilosofen wordt begrepen, omdat het ‘maatgevende’ aspect van Heideggers techniekfilosofie niet consequent genoeg doorgedacht wordt. Vervolgens geef ik een herwaardering van Heideggers techniekfilosofie en actualiseer ik hem door twee hedendaagse ontwikkelingen te benoemen die als symptomen gezien kunnen worden van de moderne techniek volgens Heideggers interpretatie: de universele normatieve maatstaf die uit het zicht raakt en de ecologische crisis aan de hand van respectievelijk Werner Marx en Paul Kingsnorth. Ten slotte richt ik mijn aandacht op een door hedendaagse techniekfilosofen vaak buiten beschouwing gelaten aspect van Heideggers techniekfilosofie: het ‘reddende’ in de moderne techniek. Ik geef een interpretatie van dit reddende aspect aan de hand van de poëzie van Hölderlin, Heideggers favoriete dichter. Ik laat zien dat volgens Heidegger de redding ligt in het opnieuw ‘dichterlijk’ leren meten in het huidige tijdperk, dat gekenmerkt wordt door maat- en afstandsloosheid.","['Heidegger', 'Techniekfilosofie', 'Maat', 'Techniek', 'Empirische wending', 'Gestell', 'Geschick', 'Hölderlin', 'Postfenomenologie', 'Geviert']"

The Readability of Roald Dahl’s work. A Comparison of the Readability of Dahl’s Children’s Fiction and Adult Fiction,"Van der Maas, Nora Yselle","['Foster, A.A.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores the readability of Roald Dahl's books. Specifically, it tests two adult books against two children's books to see if there is a difference between the language use of the two genres for Dahl. Did he change his language when switching from adult stories to children's books? The readability is tested through the use of the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and the Automated Readability Index tests. These tests showed that there is indeed a slight difference between the readability of the children's books and the adult books of Dahl. This was in line with the prediction based on the literature discussed on language development, children's books as a genre, and readability. However, the adult texts of Dahl turned out to be easier to read than expected and easier to read than the average of adult books. This raises the question whether Dahl really did change his language to fit his new audience, children, or if his adult books show that he actually has always written in a way that is readable for children.","['Dahl', 'Language Acquisition', 'Readability', 'Readability test']"

Uncomfortable Untruths in the Archive: The Irish Slaves Meme and the Creation of Controversial Social Media Archives,"O'Halloran, Claire","['Bloembergen, Marieke']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, the terms ‘fake news’ and ‘post-truth’ have entered into common parlance. The prevalence of social media has done much to aid the spread of conspiracy theories and false or hateful information online. Historian Sophia Rosenfeld has argued that social media platforms have created a ‘wild west climate’ in which fact and fiction are muddled and popularity rather than reliability dictates the type of information that is presented to users. The primary focus of this thesis is on the role archivists can play in preserving problematic and false information that has been created and spread on social media. This paper will focus on one particular case study of false and controversial information shared on social media: the so-called ‘Irish slaves myth’ or ‘Irish slaves meme’. One of the central questions of this paper is whether this content merits a place in an archive based on its importance as a historical record. Proceeding from this question, the paper will then consider the issues that an archival institution must address if it were to create such an archive.There are many special issues that an archival institution would have to consider when creating this archive, such as appraisal (determining the archival value of the material), preservation, arrangement, description, and ethics. This paper will study these issues as they apply to the creation of a hypothetical archive of the Irish slaves meme and it will attempt to offer some solutions.","['archives', 'social media', 'controversial']"

“At This Very Moment in This Work Here I Am:” A text written by Jacques Derrida for Emmanuel Levinas?,"Voorsmit, Levi","['Uljée, Rozemund']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"The influential relationship between the two twentieth century philosophers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida has profoundly challenged the way we perceive philosophy’s responsibility toward the other. While these philosophers in an ongoing exchange broach the question of the other’s response, there remains the question if the other can also respond to what they say. Challenging the attainability of “successful” dialogue, this thesis examines the limits of thinking the response of the other philosophically. It does this through an innovative reading of “At This Very Moment in This Work Here I Am,” a remarkable text by Derrida in which he examines what it means to write a response to the works of Levinas. It shows how such a response, in view of what Levinas writes, must necessarily fail. My reading of this text shows that we must nevertheless embrace the possibility of failure, even if it means putting Levinas’s entire work at risk, since the very finitude of my own response is also what allows the other to come in and respond. Seen this way, I propose that a reading specifically aimed at the “failures” at work in Derrida’s response to Levinas can be a viable strategy not only to arrive at a better understanding of this text, but also to come up with responses of our own.","['Derrida', 'Levinas', 'Other', 'dialogue', 'gender', 'silence']"

Meyer deel aan Operatie Product. Wat volgde was een veertiendaagse veldtocht waarbij de brigade meerdere grote steden veroverde waaronder Cheribon, Tegal, Poerwokerto en Tjilatjap. Het traject dat de V-brigade volgde was uiterst ambitieus. Het succes van de opmars hing grotendeels af van het vermogen van de brigade om cruciale infrastructuur intact in te nemen. Dit mislukte in de strategisch belangrijke Boemiajoe-pas, waardoor de opmars dreigde vast te lopen. Om zijn missie te voltooien, besloot de brigadecommandant om - tegen bevelen in - zijn troepen over een onverkend en moeilijk begaanbaar bergpad te sturen om zo de Boemiajoe-pas te ontwijken. Deze tweedaagse onderneming is bekend komen te staan als 'Meyer's Grote Omweg' en leverde kolonel Meyer uiteindelijk de Militaire Willemsorde op. Desondanks heeft deze gebeurtenis weinig academische aandacht genoten, en blijven vragen omtrent Meyer's beslissing onbeantwoord. Deze scriptie dient daar verandering in te brengen door de opmars van de V-brigade in Operatie Product te reconstrueren. Het doel van het onderzoek is om na te gaan wat de situatie was waar kolonel Meyer zich in bevond toen hij zijn gewichtige beslissing maakte. De scriptie zal concluderen dat Meyer's omweg niet alleen tot stand was gekomen door vijandelijke versperringen in de Boemiajoe-pas, maar voornamelijk het gevolg was van een te ambitieus operatieplan dat in de praktijk niet uitvoerbaar bleek.",

Chr. tot 4 n. Chr. koning van Judea. Hij is niet afkomstig van een koninklijke lijn en hij wordt aangesteld door buitenlanders. Hierdoor heerst onder zijn volk de opvatting dat hij legitimiteit mist. Herodes beoogt deze twijfel aan zijn rechtmatigheid weg te nemen. Hij vestigt zijn heerschappij daarom in de traditie van twee koningsmodellen. Als Jood in een gehelleniseerd gebied positioneert hij zich als erfgenaam van de hellenistische koningen en de Joodse koningen. Wat we weten over Herodes en zijn heerschappij, weten we door Flavius Josephus (37 n. Chr. – 100 n. Chr.). Josephus heeft twee werken geschreven waarin hij Herodes beschrijft: Bellum Judaicum (75 n. Chr.) en Antiquitates Judaicae (94 n. Chr). De portrettering van Herodes in Bellum I wordt beschouwd overeen te komen met het beeld van een hellenistische koning, terwijl het beeld van Herodes in Antiquitates algemeen wordt herkend als de beeldvorming van een tiran, die ver weg staat van het model van een hellenistische koning. Naast het beeld van een tiran, plaatst Josephus elders in Antiquitates Herodes in de traditie van de Joodse koningen. Josephus heeft in zijn oeuvre Herodes verbonden met het model van een hellenistische koning, met het model van een antieke tiran en met het model van een Joodse koning. In dit onderzoek wordt nader beschouwd of in Bellum Judaicum I het model van een hellenistische koning wordt vertegenwoordigd, of dat Josephus in dit vroegste werk al voorbereidingen treft voor zijn latere karakterisering van Herodes als tiran en van Herodes in verbinding met de Joodse koningschap.","['Josephus', 'Herodes', 'Tiran', 'Koning', 'Bellum']"
"""It Caught on Fire"": A 'Bottom-Up' History of the Urban Crisis in Greater St. Louis","Schipper, Douwe","['Rieger, Bernhard']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis looks at the Greater St. Louis urban area in Missouri and Illinois, USA, roughly in the second half of the twentieth century. It takes as its central theme the notion of urban crisis, which refers to a number of interrelated phenomena that arose in numerous American cities during the second half of the twentieth century. These include suburbanization, deindustrialization, depopulation, physical blight, pollution, and increases in crime, drug addiction, poverty, unemployment, and racial inequality. Much of the historiography that tries to explain the urban crisis approaches decline from an economic and statistical perspective, and focusses on long-term, large-scale developments. While this approach has been fruitful, it also creates a gap: it reveals little about cultural context and pays little attention to the agency and experience of ordinary individuals who experienced the urban crisis. In order to help fill this gap, this thesis examines documents that reflect personal experience or opinions, such as diaries, memoirs, interviews, and opinionated newspaper articles. More specifically, the thesis consists of three smaller case studies into specific aspects of St. Louis's urban crisis: residential segregation, public housing, and suburban deindustrialization. While this project does not lead to a new 'big picture' of urban crisis, it yields various new insights, which sometimes contradict the existing historiography.","['St. Louis', 'United States', 'Urban history', 'Public housing', 'East St. Louis', 'Racial segregation', 'Urban crisis', 'Urban decline', 'Urban decay', 'Deindustrialization']"

This research aims to capture the evolving role of museums by taking on the Museo de América as a case study. The Museo de América was chosen due to the limited international scholarly literature on the relationship museums in Spain, a once powerful and important colonial power, have with contemporary museological discourse. The research question is therefore, to what extent is the Museo de América able to create ‘contact zones’ and capture the changing narrative about indigenous communities in the Americas. This thesis uses Anthony Shelton’s methodology underlying critical museology as a set of tools as well as James Clifford’s concept of ‘museums as contact zones’. This research provides a better understanding of how an ethnographic museum in Spain addresses the colonial and authoritative practices in which museums were built on. The analysis of the Museo shows that some of the Museo’s underlying curatorial practices are consistent with Shelton’s methodological interdictions. However it also identifies a few limitations to the Museo’s capacity to navigate the challenges of bridging historical and cultural gaps across centuries. The most significant being the lack of an indigenous voice regarding the conquest itself. By including indigenous voices and presenting them as active participants, museums can play a critical role in providing visitors with the tools to better understand the evolution of modern society’s values.","['critical museology', '‘contact zones’', 'representation', 'indigenous people', 'indigenous communities', 'colonialism', 'Spanish Conquest']"

The Italian indicative/subjunctive alternation: insights from Probabilistic Grammar,"Occhini, Giulia","['Audring, Jenny']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In Italian complement clauses, the use of subjunctives can often alternate with the use of indicatives. While the phenomenon is well documented in the literature, little is known about the mechanisms operating behind mood selection in choice contexts. It is consensus that subjunctive choice is triggered by both language internal and sociolinguistic factors. Multiple studies have suggested that the power of each language internal factor to predict subjunctive choice is not stable across different sociolinguistic varieties. However, this has never been object of investigation, and the value that speakers attribute to subjunctives in different sociolinguistic varieties remains a confused matter. The aim of this thesis is to provide an overarching understanding of the function that speakers’ attribute to subjunctives in complement clauses across different diaphasic and diachronic varieties of Italian. A corpus study was carried out in order to gain insight into this issue. This research is conducted following the probabilistic grammar framework (Bresnan 2007), which investigates cross-lectal changes in the probabilistic constraints shaping linguistic variation through the usage of multifactorial statistical techniques. The results of this corpus study indicate that subjunctive selection in Italian responds to slightly different mechanisms in different sociolinguistic varieties. This is particularly evident from a diachronic point of view, as subjunctives in Italian are nowadays correlating with new semantic values with respect to the past.","['Mood selection', 'Probabilistic Grammar', 'Variationist Sociolinguistics', 'Corpus Linguistics', 'Italian']"
International renewable energy cooperation: a comparative study of Chinese and local influences in South Africa's quest for sustainable energy development,"Lewandowska, Katarzyna","['Gonzalez Vicente, R.', 'Wang, J.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In order to establish whether the South African energy industry is in need of external assistance to develop and successfully mature, this dissertation focuses on the commercial engagement between China and South Africa in the renewable energy industry for the purposes of attaining growth in South African renewable sources of energy. Research on this matter is juxtaposed to a more domestic answer to the issues of renewable energy generation in South Africa, namely the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). By drawing a comparison between these two, this thesis provides an answer as to whether Chinese external involvement in the South African renewable energy industry is contributing to a shift towards sustainable energy production. Ultimately, this dissertation provides an answer to the following question: To what extent has international energy cooperation, especially between China and South Africa, facilitated growth in the South African renewable energy sector when compared to the South African Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP)? With this question in mind, this thesis argues that the highly active Chinese actors in the South African renewable energy industry, mainly Huawei, are (most likely to remain) the main force driving South Africa’s transition towards sustainable development. This is supported with evidence proving the superiority of such actors in terms of experience, knowledge and the provision of technology tailored specifically towards the needs of the South African case as opposed to the efforts made by domestic firms and suppliers.","['energy governance', 'sustainable energy', 'international cooperation', 'reipppp', 'south africa', 'china', 'huawei', 'biotherm']"
The creation of an ethical Artificial Intelligence [AI] policy? An exploration into the early days of the European Union’s ethical rhetoric in the field of AI.,"Pender, Seán","['Oster, Jan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the European Union’s rhetoric in the field of ethical AI by aiming to pin their discourse to mainstream normative ethical theories. The literature review supplies a deep insight into the current discussions on-going in AI, as well as its sub-fields. This is followed by a critical analysis into ethics and AI and why there is a necessity for ethical considerations when using AI. A synopsis of the EU’s current position is explored prior to delving into the methodological decisions made in the cadre of this thesis. A document analysis of qualitative secondary data permits an analysis into two key documents: The AI High-Level Expert Group’s ethical guidelines, as well as an official European Commission communiqué on said guidelines. Finally, the normative theories introduced in the literature review act as a framework for analysing and evaluating the EU’s early AI rhetoric, in order to arrive at my conclusions in section 6.0. In doing so, this thesis aims to comprehend the EU’s ethical strategy for ethical AI.",['Artificial Intelligence Ethics European Union']

In de clinch met een hellenistisch watje: Apollonius' karakterisatie van expeditieleider Iason in Argonautica 1.1280-1362,"Kluitenburg, Thomas Pieter Martijn","['Jonge, Casper Constantijn de']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Griekse en Latijnse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Op basis van een systematische analyse van een sleutelpassage in Apollonius' Argonautica (1.1280-1362) betoog ik in mijn eindwerkstuk dat Iason in het epos gekarakteriseerd wordt als een nieuwe, hellenistische held. Mijn eindwerkstuk bouwt daarmee voort op de inzichten van andere geleerden, maar is tevens vernieuwend in de focus op de genoemde passage en in de systematische behandeling ervan. Apollonius’ karakterisering van zijn hoofdpersonage Iason interpreteer ik door middel van een close reading vanuit drie op elkaar aansluitende invalshoeken: literair, intertekstueel en metapoëtisch. Apollonius blijkt binnen de passage Iason te contrasteren met archaïsche en ‘Homerisch’ getinte helden en plaatst zijn hoofdpersonage zo op de voorgrond. Daarnaast bewijst Iason in de conflictscène (Arg. 1.1280-1362) de ‘beste expeditieleider’ (ἄριστος ὄρχαμος) te zijn door de ruzie met de ‘Homerisch getinte’ Telamon te beslechten. De nieuwe hellenistische held Iason neemt daarmee niet alleen een dominante positie in onder de Argonauten maar het personage weet zijn Homerische voorgangers zelfs te overtreffen. In mijn metapoëtische analyse betoog ik vervolgens dat Apollonius’ karakterisering van Iason de dichters houding tegenover de Homerische epische traditie reflecteert. De sleutelpassage, waarbinnen de ruziënde ‘Homerisch’ getinte Argonauten onder het leiderschap van een nieuwe ogenschijnlijk zwakke held zich met elkaar verzoenen, bewijst dat Apollonius zowel voortborduurt als afwijkt van de Homerische epen. De dichter blijkt een spel te spelen met de Homerische epische traditie en past tegelijkertijd vernieuwing toe in het epische genre. Mijn analyse van de conflictscène (Arg. 1.1280-1362) laat daarmee zien dat zowel het hoofdpersonage Iason binnen de Argonautica als het genre epiek onder Apollonius een ontwikkeling doormaakt.","['Apollonius Rhodius', 'Argonautica', 'Expeditieleider Iason', 'Intertekstualiteit', 'Metapoëzie', 'Close reading']"

A Question of Appropriatness,"Kiecker, Maximilian","['Oude Nijhuis, Dennie']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the mid-1980s German collective bargaining coverage of employees has continuously declined. Current explanations attribute this decline to structural changes in the German economy, but structural factors by themselves fail to explain why coverage has increased in other European Coordinated Market Economies during the same period. The resulting divergence in coverage can instead be attributed to differences in employer support for the use of statutory mechanisms to shore up collective bargaining. As shown here, German employers have, in contrast to employers elsewhere, continuously opposed such measures. Based on a set of semi-structured elite interviews and case studies, I analyse what explains this opposition. This thesis shows that German employer associations oppose a frequent use of statutory extension by default based on 1) a strong normative aversion to state intervention, 2) a normative appreciation of wage competition, and 3) the believe that statutory extension can itself undermine coverage. Furthermore, I demonstrate that when there are highly salient problems in a sector which employers believe can be remedied by statutory extension sectoral employers can overcome the German default position and use extensions however only to an extent that is perceived as strictly necessary.","['Industrial Relations', 'Statutory Extension', 'German Employer Associations']"

The effects of EU migration management on a third country: Multi-level governance of boat people (1992-2013) and the influence of the EU’s external border and migration policy on Morocco,"Ebner, Prisca","['Glynn, Irial']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis sheds light on Moroccan governance actors’ perspectives on the multi-level governance of boat people in the Western Mediterranean. The central argument is that the inclusion of third countries’ perspectives on EU’s external border and migration policy is crucial to enhance the understanding of governance realities. The research question is: How did the Moroccan state and civil society react to the increasingly multi-leveled and externalized EU migration governance from 1992 to 2013, in the context of irregular migration by boat? During a field study in Morocco, eleven interviews were conducted with (former) officials, national and international NGO´s. In a chronological analysis, migration and external border policies by the EU, Morocco and Spain are assessed and contrasted with statements from Moroccan stakeholders. Furthermore, this paper examines the agency of Moroccan governance actors in implementation and negotiation processes. The main findings are discussed in relation to the ‘gap hypothesis’, ‘mobility regimes’ and migration as a ‘bargaining chip’ in negotiations.","['migration', 'boat people', 'Morocco', 'externalization', 'third country', 'civil society', 'migration policies', 'multi-level governance', 'European Union']"

"Symmetry, ornament and lifelike animals: Images in naturalia collection books from the early eighteenth-century Dutch Republic","Jacobi, Carina","['Keblusek, Marika']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Collecting was a popular elite pastime in much of early modern Europe. Collections could include a wide range of objects, which were studied and displayed at home, and sometimes described and visualised in books. In the Dutch Republic around the turn of the eighteenth century, collections of natural objects were especially popular. The books that describe and show these collections are important sources for understanding how nature was appreciated and studied in the 18th-century Dutch Republic. However, from a modern perspective, the detailed images of often symmetrically arranged objects in these books are hard to understand as either 'art' or 'science'. This thesis explains how conventions from both natural history and applied arts, as well as certain religious ideas influenced these images. Using three case studies, D'Amboinsche rariteitkamer (1705) by Georg Rumphius, Het tweede deel van het wondertooneel der natuur (1715) by Levinus Vincent, and the Thesaurus (four volumes, 1734–1765) by Albertus Seba, the thesis shows that these conventions and ideas were used flexibly by different authors-collectors to suit their own purposes and approach to nature.","['History of collections', 'Early modern Dutch Republic', 'Natural history images', 'Printed book illustrations']"

Possessive Constructions in Kiroba: A Bantu language of the Mara region in Tanzania,"Oosterom, Noelle","['Mous, Maarten']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis is about the possessive constructions in Kiroba, which is a Bantu language spoken in the Mara region in Tanzania. The attributive possessive constructions consists of the associative and/or the possessive pronouns. The associative forms are made by the associative stem -a and the pronominal prefixes. Possessive pronouns consists of a prefix which agrees with the possessed noun and a stem which refers to the possessor. I divided the possessive pronouns into two groups: the personal possessive pronouns and the nonpersonal possessive pronouns. I made this division because in many Bantu languages the paradigms of possessive pronouns is reduced to only the personal possessive pronouns. The predicative possessive construction consist of the possessor noun, the copula verb, the word na ‘with’, and the possessed noun. The most remarkable and uncommon feature of the possessive constructions in Kiroba is that Kiroba has the whole paradigm of possessive pronouns: the personal and nonpersonal possessive pronouns.","['Bantu', 'Possession', 'Possessive constructions', 'Tanzania', 'Kiroba', 'Suba-Simbiti']"

A Call to Responsibility in Heidegger and Levinas,"Duijvenvoorde, Britt van","['Uljée, Rozemund']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This essay locates the “ontological difference” in Heidegger and Levinas in order to show how this difference presents a limitation in both philosophies. On the one hand, the “ontological difference” obstructs genuine thinking of be-ing in Heidegger. On the other, this difference is unable to signify the ultimate in Levinas’ ethics. In transgressing the “ontological difference”, both philosophers introduce the concept of the call that leads into two different notions of responsibility in terms of responding. Whereas Heidegger’s historical thinking of be-ing is an originary ethics in which responsibility is determined as responsiveness of Dasein to be-ing, Levinas’ ethics implies responsibility because of social relationship to the transcendent other person who is otherwise than being. In this essay, it is claimed that these two different notions of responsibility are not mutually exclusive. The very openness of be-ing in which Dasein and be-ing are enowned to each other in the counter-resonance of needing and belonging still admits for a Levinassian ethics of the transcendent other person, albeit not primordially.","['M.

The Child's Perspective in Henry James' What Maisie Knew and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird,"Janga, Illuzmar","['Newton, Michael S.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to argue that the child’s perspective elicits sympathy, empathy, and humor in order to evoke moral criticism in Henry James’ What Maisie Knew and Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird. The dissertation consists of three chapters. The first chapter focusses on how the young girl’s perspective evokes moral criticism through sympathy in James’ Maisie. Through a close reading of the novel, this section argues that the child’s point of view brings forth sympathy through a representation of the protagonist’s beleaguered benevolence and that this feeling, in turn, is amplified by the young girl’s growing awareness. In contrast, chapter two provides an analysis of the moral criticism induced as a result of the reader’s empathy with Scout in Mockingbird. The segment displays how the child’s perspective invites the reader to empathize with the young protagonist. Furthermore, it presents how Scout’s moral development highlights the amorality of the Maycomb community. The final chapter contains an exploration of the satirical sense in both James’ Maisie and Lee’s Mockingbird. The chapter analyzes how the young girl’s perspective elicits irony and thereby criticism of characters in the novels.","['pathos', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'American', 'irony', ""child's perspective"", 'criticism', 'James', 'Lee']"
Plichten tegenover de derde wereld - De poging van Thomas Pogge om ‘rechts’ te overtuigen van globale hulpverlening,"Wentzel, Jasper","['Meijers, Tim']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Thomas Pogge claims to close the gap between proponents of large-scale humanitarian aid to the third world, and those opposing such policy. Pogge turns this last group into his target audience by adopting an alleged core-principle of libertarianism, a premise that is often held among those who oppose large governmental programs, roughly the political ‘right’. According to Pogge’s argument, those holding onto the libertarian tenet must completely turn their stance on foreign aid around, as their principle actually prescribes moral duties of first world citizens to aid the third world in order to salvage inflicted damages. In this essay, I examine the actual persuasiveness of Pogge’s argument by assessing the similarity between premises used by Pogge and those held by his target audience. I do so by distinguishing two variants of Pogge’s argument, which both consist of three sub-arguments. Despite the occasional agreement, Pogge’s argument fails to concord with many key-premises generally associated with libertarians, liberals and conservatives. Due to the clash in between the two sides of the debate, Pogge’s tactic to reconcile them into one proposal fails to truly convince. I conclude that Pogge is more likely to sway his target audience by using their similarities to open a dialogue.","['Pogge', 'libertarianism', 'ethics', 'foreign aid', 'political right', 'human rights', 'moral rights', 'liberalism', 'third world', 'poverty', 'right violations']"

Ontvangende steden in Noord-Brabant en Friesland toonden bij deze bezoeken vele provinciale en stedelijke elementen die op een eigen identiteit wezen, wat zij samen lieten gaan met het vieren van nationale elementen. Het waren niet de regionale en nationale identiteit die elkaar uitsloten, maar eerder de socialistische identiteit en andere identiteiten. Als tegenstanders van de monarchie zorgden lokale socialisten voor veel onrust tijdens de bezoeken, die daardoor juist een samenbindende werking hadden op andere groepen (protestanten, katholieken en liberalen).","['nationale identiteit', 'regionale identiteit', 'monarchie', 'koningin Wilhelmina', 'koningin-regentes Emma', 'provinciebezoek']"

In this research project, we discuss three models of lexical processing (the BIA+ model, the revised hierarchical model, and the independent model).

In the experiment, we tested Dutch students of the French language with different levels of proficiency: 10 students with high language proficiency and 10 students with low language proficiency. We based the proficiency levels on the LexTALE test. The students participated in a semantic priming experiment in which the prime was offered in French and the image was to be named in Dutch. We expected to find a faster reaction time for students with high language proficiency and no influence of semantic priming for the low proficiency group, as follows the revised hierarchical model. This model explains this difference between groups by the links between lexical and conceptual representations in the two languages: these aren’t developed yet for low proficient speaker and thus we shouldn’t find an effect of semantic priming. However, our results support the independent model, in which there are no connections between language processing systems of different language in the brain.","['multilingualism', 'mental lexicon', 'semantic priming']"

Mother Tongue Interference in Students’ Writing at a Dutch Secondary School,"Marinus, Aukje","['Jeffery, J.V.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Mother tongue interference is suspected to be the cause of the disappointing results in writing exams of Dutch ESL students in their graduating secondary education year. Research confirms that L1 interference could be a problem since it mostly ensues in cognate languages, such as Dutch and English. As L2 learners are often unaware of their interference errors the problem can be persistent. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine to what extent and in what ways L1 interference is of influence on the writings of the Dutch ESL students. Therefore, two sub-questions were formulated: “What are the possible mother tongue interference mistakes for Dutch learners of English?” and “What is are the most frequent mistakes made by Dutch ESL students in HAVO 5?” An error analysis of the students’ writings was carried out, using a coding tool developed for this research. The tool, based on relevant literature on L1 interference and error analysis, provides an elaborate overview of possible Dutch interference. The major findings of this analysis are in the first place that the majority of the found errors are interference related revealing wrong word as the most frequently occurring error, however affecting all aspects of language on both a grammatical as well as textual level. In the second place, the data also show a teachers’ preference to focus on a selection of error patterns to mark. Finally, the analysis confirms the correlation between the nature of errors and the nature of assignments. Future research could focus on the most occurring errors. Moreover, the developed analysis tool can be used for future error analysis.","['mother tongue interference', 'second language acquisition', 'English language learners', 'error', 'adolescent literacy']"

This thesis provides a critical review of the development of the Filipino elite democracy and how it resulted in the existing combination of economic growth and forms of violence present in its society. The elite democracy in the Philippines has remained relatively stable and economically growing by relying on society’s instability through violence from ethnic and economic inequality. The competition that comes from modernization should eventually bring stability as wealth and progress is created, but it also establishes social conflict by creating clashes between classes. While they should counter each other, in the Philippines they complement each other. Different actors have influenced these processes, in the sense that these are not just diffuse complex processes of difficult explanation, but processes where specific actors have fomented forms of violence or contempt against others for a variety of reasons. Some of these processes have a colonial origin; others are directly related to the elite democracy and its corruption. Intentional and unintentional use of power to generate or stimulate modernization and so creating a wider division among different groups. The interests of foreign actors, elites, and minorities are highly intertwined within Filipino society.

De vier gedaanten van een … biechtvader? Een medische artestekst uit een religieus verzamelhandschrift in context,"Putten, Charlotte van","['Anrooij, W. van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit BA-eindwerkstuk staat de artestekst ‘Vanden vier aensichten eyns meysters’ centraal, afkomstig uit het religieuze verzamelhandschrift Leiden, UB, BPL 2473 (eind 15e eeuw, ook wel bekend als ‘de Dikzak’). Mijn hoofdvraag is: hoe verhoudt de profane tekst ‘Vanden vier aensichten eyns meysters’ zich tot de hypothese dat BPL 2473 is samengesteld door een biechtvader voor een (vrouwelijk-)religieus publiek? Het kader van mijn onderzoek is de materiële filologie. In deze benadering staat het handschrift zelf als materieel voorwerp en de integrale tekstuele inhoud daarvan centraal. In het eerste hoofdstuk voer ik daarom codicologisch onderzoek uit naar het verzamelhandschrift en bekijk ik de tekstuele inhoud ervan, om tot een beter begrip te komen van de plaats van de artestekst in het materiële en tekstuele geheel. In het tweede hoofdstuk maak ik een vergelijking tussen de artestekst uit Leiden en twee andere overgeleverde varianten van deze tekst uit Brussel (KB, II 3084) en Wolfenbüttel (HAB, Mf 141 (1)), om meer zicht te krijgen op de herkomst en het functioneringsmilieu van de tekst op zich. In het derde hoofdstuk voer ik literatuuronderzoek uit over de verhouding tussen het geestelijk ambt en een medische functie in de (late) Middeleeuwen. Ik concludeer allereerst dat de artestekst zeer waarschijnlijk gefunctioneerd heeft in een milieu van artsen of andere medici. Daarnaast stel ik dat het niet ongewoon was voor geestelijken zoals biechtvaders om zich bezig te houden met medische zaken. Tegelijkertijd wordt van geestelijken verwacht dat ze uit liefdadigheid geneeskunde beoefenen, terwijl de artestekst gaat over het probleem dat patiënten artsen niet willen betalen na genezing. De opname van ‘Vanden vier aensichten eyns meysters’ in BPL 2473 blijft dus opmerkelijk in het licht van de hypothese dat het handschrift is samengesteld door een biechtvader voor een (vrouwelijk-)religieus publiek.","['Middelnederlandse artesliteratuur', 'verzamelhandschrift', 'materiële filologie', 'Leiden', 'UB', 'BPL 2473']"

'Maar echt!'. Corpusonderzoek naar constructies met 'echt' in onvolledige zinnen voor het uitdrukken van convergente interpersoonlijke alignment,"Vissers, Paul","['Beliën, Maaike']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In de huidige literatuur over alignment wordt ervan uitgegaan dat het expliciet vaststellen van positieve interpersoonlijke alignment in het Nederlands enkel mogelijk is taalgebruikers naar zichzelf refereren in hun uiting. Hierin zou het Nederlands verschillen van het Engels, waar uitingen als same zonder referentie naar degene die de uiting doet expliciete positieve alignment uit kunnen drukken. In het Nederlands komt sinds enkele jaren echter de vaste combinatie maar echt voor in onvolledige zinnen, wat een vergelijkbare functie lijkt te hebben als combinaties als echt wel, echt hoor en echt hè in onvolledige zinnen. In dit onderzoek wordt de functie van deze echt-constructies gespecificeerd met behulp van de theorie over stancetaking en alignment. Hiervoor worden openbare Twittergesprekken geanalyseerd op de aanwezigheid van andere elementen in de directe co-tekst van echt-constructies die wijzen op de inname stance en het uitdrukken van alignment. Uit de gegevens blijkt dat echt-constructies voor komen met verschillende elementen die positieve alignment uitdrukken. Onder die elementen vallen alignment markers als ja en ook, het toepassen van parafrase en uitbreiding, het gebruik van emoticons, het toepassen van afwijkende interpunctie en onconventioneel hoofdlettergebruik. Vanwege de inbedding van de echt-constructies in deze elementen wordt geconcludeerd dat de echt-constructies markeerders van positieve interpersoonlijke alignment zijn. Of taalgebruikers bij het inzetten van deze alignment-markeerders volledige verantwoordelijkheid dragen voor hun stance, zoals bij het gebruik van same, is nog onduidelijk en lijkt sterk contextafhankelijk. Dat echt-constructies bruikbaar zijn voor het uitdrukken van positieve alignment kan het gevolg zijn van de hedge-functie van echt: het is een epistemisch bijwoord dat een hoge mate van zekerheid uitdrukt over de waarheid van een propositie, waardoor het ook een hoge mate van positieve alignment uit kan drukken. In de nieuwe constructie maar echt zou het kunnen dat maar deze hoge-graadlezing nog verder versterkt. Toekomstig onderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op het duiden van mogelijke functieverschillen tussen de varianten van de echt-constructie en deze verschillen met experimenteel onderzoek ondersteunen.","['echt', 'alignment', 'stancetaking', 'alignment marker', 'convergente alignment', 'corpusonderzoek']"
"Digital Textile and Dress Exhibitions, an Assessment","Dilitz, Lisa Maria","['Bass-Krueger, Maude']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In the last three decades, the world has changed tremendously because of the internet and new digital technologies. This change has affected the way how cultural institutions are working internally and also the external interaction with the public. Starting from the 1990s onwards, digital exhibitions have evolved. Digital textile and dress exhibitions are not restricted by time or place and grant broad public access to the collection of institutions. With the case study of the Textile Research Centre (TRC), this thesis shows the benefits and limitations of digital textile and dress exhibitions for opening up access to heritage collections and analyzes its prejudices and barriers. The research is carried out through a literature review, an extensive critical visual analysis and a digital lace exhibition that has been conducted in the frame of this work. The analyzation shows that virtual exhibitions are more accessible when providing a user-friendly layout, quality images of the objects, and the quality of information.","['digital exhibition', 'digitization', 'accessibility', 'textile collection', 'dress collection']"
