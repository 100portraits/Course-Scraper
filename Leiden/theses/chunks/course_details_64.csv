Turkey & Poverty: An Islamic Solution? Exploring the Possibilities and Implications,"Teijlingen, Noah Miguel van",['H.H.M. Taha'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In a speech about Islamic Economics, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has exclaimed his intentions to turn Istanbul into the centre of Islamic economics in order to tackle injustice and poverty. This article examines poverty in Turkey and the opportunities and limitations of the implementation of an Islamic economic system. It is based on academic literature written on a variety of topics, such as the zekat and microcredit, unemployment and neoliberalism. Based on this literature, the thesis discusses the potential affects of a transition from the current neoliberal system into an Islamic system. The thesis finds that Islamic economics offers possibilities for the alleviation of poverty, but that there are several obstructions as well as limitations. A form of Islamic economics, usually being divided in Islamic taxation (mainly zekat) and Islamic financing (banking), if applied correctly, could contribute to the decreasing poverty and inequality, but issues such as corruption and the undeclared sector, as well as opposition from the Turkish Armed Forces, can form potential obstacles to the President’s alternative system. The thesis found that Islamic banking currently much more resembles a ‘guise’ of the conventional banking system, and raises the question as to which extent it is possible to speak of ‘Islamic Economics’. More research should be done on Islamic Economics as to what it means, what it consists of and how it could be implemented in a modern, globalized and interconnected world.",

"Revolution, renaissance and rebranding: Temurid figures in Uzbekistani nation-building","Evans, Cameron",['Dr J.H.C Kern'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the forms, content, networks and function of Uzbekistani representations of Temurid figures, namely Amir Temur and Alisher Navoiy, across the Soviet and post-Soviet (Karimovian and Mirziyoyevian) eras in order to assess the degree of change and continuity in these components across time and the reasons for said change and continuity. After an introduction, an explanation of the methodology and a literature review related to the state of affairs in Central Asian Studies, and English and Russian scholarship on Uzbekistani nation-building and Temurid figures, there are three chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the early Soviet nation-building project in Uzbekistan (1920s-1940s) and the relationship of Alisher Navoiy and Amir Temur to this in the context of Soviet ethnogenesis and historiography. It also analyses the failed attempt at the rehabilitation of Temur in the 1960s due to said historiography and analysing the late Soviet context which laid the foundation for post-independence nation-building in which Temur and Navoiy have played an integral role. Chapter 2 examines the context of Uzbekistan’s newfound independence from 1991 onwards before taking a case study of the 1996 celebrations linked to Amir Temur’s 660th anniversary in 1996, analysing decrees, speeches, the use of public space, and a literary publication related to this anniversary and the relationship of a rehabilitated Amir Temur in particular to state legitimisation and nation-building in the Karimovian era. It finds that an Uzbekified and ""Universalised"" Temur was a key image in the domestic and international legitimisation of early post-Soviet rule. Chapter 3 turns to Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s presidency (2016-present), examining the context of this political and historical crossroads in post-independence Uzbekistan before turning to a case study of the 2021 celebrations of Alisher Navoiy’s 580th anniversary, looking at decrees and associated actions as well as an online forum from the British-Uzbek Society. It is argued that cultural diplomacy is seen as a way of domestically and internationally rebranding Uzbekistan in the post-Karimovian era, though the structure of the cultural diplomacy betrays deeper tendencies toward continuity.","['nation-building', 'amir timur', 'alisher navoi', 'amir temur', 'alisher navoiy', 'uzbekistan', 'state-building', 'karimov', 'mirziyoyev', 'soviet', 'post-soviet', 'cultural diplomacy', 'legitimisation', 'timurid', 'temurid']"

Esta investigación tiene como objetivo identificar los factores que permiten caracterizar el fenómeno de los falsos positivos como una práctica de terrorismo de Estado, haciendo énfasis en las medidas y estrategias de contrainsurgencia adoptadas desde el Estado colombiano para que estos hechos tuvieran lugar. A pesar de la considerable cantidad de producción investigativa sobre el fenómeno, una proporción importante de los análisis se aborda desde un carácter prevalentemente jurídico.

The golden age of South Korea and Taiwan's semiconductor industry,"Hattu, Simone",['Dr. Limin Teh'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The current digital age illustrates the importance of the semiconductor industry with particular attention on the dominance of South Korea and Taiwan within the semiconductor industry. This paper will focus on global semiconductor industry leaders, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Korean multinational company- Samsung, and how both companies became peripheral actors and maintained their key positions within the global semiconductor industry. The use of both qualitative and quantitative analysis will illustrate important data using charts (quantitative) to review Taiwan and South Korea's stronghold on the semiconductor industry. The case studies will be used to review how South Korea and Taiwan dominate the semiconductor industry. The thesis will also include a small section on how restrictions limit China's market share in this industry. Analysis of Samsung and TSMC companies illustrate how state intervention, company's approaches to technology innovation and organization of production, mainly specialization and localization led to their dominating success within the global semiconductor industry. This research paper portrays a clear overview as to why South Korea and Taiwan are key players in the semiconductor industry and why China is unable to reach its full potential. Samsung and TSMC portray how state involvement, shift towards high-technology industry, and cooperation between transnational companies allowed both countries to maintain their dominant position.","['semiconductor industry', 'Taiwan', 'South Korea', 'TSMC', 'Samsung']"
Stuck Between Giants: The case of Vietnam joining the Belt and Road Initiative in a time of precarious US global hegemony,"Vorstenbosch, Rueben","['Shidiq, A.R.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"With a ubiquitous contemporary discourse on China’s hegemonic rise and current territorial disputes in the South China Sea, China’s historical rivals joining the major power’s grand economic projects seems anomalous. This paper will show that despite historically problematic China-Vietnam relations, Vietnam still agreed upon joining the ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ (BRI) due to a dependence on China for national survival. More specifically, an economic interdependence forces Vietnam to cooperate with China on projects like the BRI, as Vietnam’s regime legitimation relies on economic growth. This reality is more so related to the implications of Vietnam hypothetically refusing, than to agreeing to join however. Defection instead of cooperating on the BRI, would make Vietnam’s economic growth precarious as Vietnam is familiar with how China reciprocates these choices. Although this still leaves multiple factors forcing Vietnam’s BRI membership an unlikely reality, this paper will show that these factors are overridden by the US as a significant actor when it comes to Vietnam's cooperation on the BRI. And when it comes to reasons why China has decided to integrate a ‘historical enemy’ into the BRI, one will find that China’s contemporary dependence on Vietnam is a significant variable in the matter. These findings will be made apparent by applying game theory’s prisoner's dilemma to the bilateral event of Vietnam joining China’s grand economic initiative.","['Belt and Road Initiative', 'Vietnam', 'China', 'United States', ""Prisoner's Dilemma"", 'International relations', 'international economic cooperation']"

Indonesia as the next Asian giant? How Indonesia’s international relations affect the country’s power status in an age of geopolitics,"Rodrigues Marques Catarino, Ana Catarina","['L. O. Black.', 'I. Hadiprayitno']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Indonesia has been regarded as a prospective candidate to great power status. However, because these propositions typically build on assessments from realist theory, they overemphasize a country’s material capabilities (e.g. territory, GDP, and size of population) while overlooking other relevant components of status formation. In analysing power status through the lens of identity and behavioural approaches, this thesis considers the role of a country’s international relations in status change, and assesses how Indonesia’s conduct in foreign affairs affects the country’s prospects of emergence. Considering that great powers are increasingly enacting geopolitical strategies it could be expected that, as a prospective ascendant, Indonesia would follow similar procedures. Yet, the country has not only refrained itself from adopting a realist stance, it has prioritised a hedging strategy based on multilateral cooperation with regional and major powers, one that uses ASEAN as the primary vehicle for maintaining Southeast Asian security and stability. As this thesis identifies, Indonesia’s behaviour in international relations therefore does not depict any of the major motives that are expected to drive great powers to adopt realist procedures, namely: seeking greater status acquisition, and conforming to the pressure of global trends. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily imply that Indonesia is disinterested in upgrading its international ranking, nor that the country is unlikely to emerge. Rather, it poses the possibility that Indonesia may rise in ways considered atypical to Western interpretations, and achieve a hybrid power status position that incorporates elements of middle and great power states.","['International Relations', 'Power Status', 'Indonesia', 'Geopolitics']"

It argues that the second-generation Chinese Dutch perceive the Chinese identity as a crucial part of them since it corresponds to their physical appearance and culture. Their Chinese identity is also fluid and changes through particular periods and situations as they belong partially to both groups and can thus behave accordingly. Moreover, Chinese language and family further determine the feeling of belonging towards the Chinese identity based on the mastery of the language and the active role that their family has in contributing to their language and cultural building. The finding of the study indicates the importance of sufficient handling of discrimination and mental support at school that should be given to the Chinese or other Asian-looking ethnic minority children during their crucial developmental stage, as all participants mentioned that they had experienced at least mild discrimination before.","['Chinese identity', 'Second-generation Chinese Dutch', 'Identity', 'Belonging', 'Chinese diaspora']"

Exploring the movement’s appeal to ecotheology will tell us something about the way in which Christian communities in the Netherlands have been adjusting to the rising awareness of the gravity of the environmental crisis. The paper relies upon an interpretative research method. Larger theoretical ideas about ecotheology have been used to make sense of the way in which the GroeneKerken movement promotes environmentalism amongst Christians in the Netherlands. This involved qualitative analysis of the movement through the lens of three different hermeneutical keys for interpreting the Bible ecologically: ecocentrism, environmental justice and environmental stewardship. It will be demonstrated that the GroeneKerken movement implicitly and explicitly invokes the ecotheological notions of ecocentrism, environmental justice and environmental stewardship in its promotion of environmentalism.","['ecotheology', 'environmentalism', 'Christianity', 'stewardship', 'ecocentrism', 'environmental justice']"

In order to answer this question, the first chapter provides some context to the development of the QAnon movement and their prediction of an event known as 'the Storm'. It also illustrates that the QAnon movement is similar to open source religions and consists of a strong participatory culture. The second chapter creates a theoretical framework, largely borrowed from religious studies' investigations in failed prophecy, in order to classify the different responses of QAnon followers to the failure of the Storm. The third chapter delves into these responses and categorizes them into different types. After studying these different responses, this thesis predicts that QAnon will fall apart into the smaller conspiracy theories of which it consists. The thesis concludes that open source religions are likely to respond to the failure of their prophecies in similar ways as QAnon.","['QAnon', 'Conspiracy theories', 'Failed prophecy', 'religious studies', 'open source religion', 'participatory culture']"

Rural-Urban Migrants' Aspirations in Contemporary Windhoek: A Namibian Case Study,"Nündel, Emma Elisabeth","['Williams, C.L.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In light of the emerging emphasis within migration studies on how aspirations inform migration trajectories and the integration prospects of migrants, this paper examines how rural-urban migrants’ aspirations relate to integration in contemporary Windhoek, Namibia. The aspirations of five male rural-urban migrants in Windhoek are discussed in semistructured qualitative interviews. Through the application of Paolo Boccagni’s categorization of migrant aspirations into ‘contents,’ ‘relational references,’ and ‘space-time horizons,’ and following the definition of ‘societal integration’ as used by Richard Bränström et al., this paper finds that a significant aspect of Namibian rural-urban migrants’ aspirations is the wish for societal integration. These findings indicate that it is valid to consider issues of integration as relevant for rural-urban migrants in Namibia, and that studying their aspirations can make the identification of different approaches for fostering societal integration possible.","['Rural-urban migration', 'Windhoek', 'Namibia', 'Societal integration', 'Aspirations']"

Floating urban dairy farms as an alernative to traditional dairy production,"Donker, Christel","['Hu, M.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"With cities having an increasing number of inhabitants, the need for an equally increasing amount of food has grown. Meanwhile, fertile land scarcity is becoming a larger problem as well. The Floating Farm initiative attempts to show how urban environments themselves can contribute to the production of dairy, combining it with educating urban dwellers. They had a circular design in mind which uses urban waste flows as much as possible, as well as processing the dairy themselves and sell the products in their own store and as locally as they can. This thesis analyses the practicalities that come into play when floating dairy farms become reality. The initiative is compared to traditional rural dairy farms with different sizes. With the help of estimations for the frequency and distance needed to provide the farms with feed and distribute the manure and dairy product, the total distance required was calculated for each farm. The farm in Scharendijke had the lowest distance to liter milk ratio, and the Floating Farm in Rotterdam the highest. This is due to the estimations for the many different parties involved in the feed and dairy products distributions. The high ratio for the Floating Farm makes the initiative not a great alternative, but a nice addition to urban life. Additionally, the farm can have a positive influence on the respiratory health of visitors.","['Dairy farms', 'farms on water', 'urban farm', 'health']"
Between market and state: homoerotic subtext in popular Chinese web series: A case study of “The Untamed”,"Bellemont, Florence","['Schneider, F.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the People's Republic of China, the state takes a didactic approach towards the diffusion of media and forbids the depiction of homoerotic relationships on the big and small screen. Chinese web series ""The Untamed"" (Chen Qing Ling 陈情令) however adapts a web novel containing an explicit homoerotic romance to public acclaim. This exploratory study examines how the directors of this series navigated government censorship and conveyed the homoerotic subtext between the two protagonists. In order to answer this, the thesis makes use of visual discourse analysis (divided into the layers of the image, the soundscape and the montage) on shot protocols as outlined as in Schneider (2012) while also building upon the theoretical frameworks of Van Leeuwen (1996; 2008), Kress and Van Leeuwen (2006) and Iedema (2004). The analysis is contextualized by a literature review spanning the topics of the history of homosexuality in China, the importance of representation and television, homosexual representation in the Chinese media landscape to end with the topic of the state approach to media and censorship mechanisms of web series. The thesis concludes that the directors successfully depicted homoerotic subtext by using a wide range of audio-visual and narrative techniques while leaving enough space for deniability, which might bring about more adaptations of such materials and influence public opinion about homosexual individuals.","['China', 'Political Communication', 'mass communication', 'censorship', 'visual discourse analysis', 'discourse analysis', 'semiotics', 'subtext', 'queer', 'homosexuality', 'homoeroticism', 'homosexual representation', 'danmei', 'web series', 'film analysis', 'television studies']"

The presence of the class struggle in Egypt, has influenced the way perpetrators and victims from certain classes are being perceived. Victims who are part of the upper-middle class in Egypt are overrepresented in the media, whereas women from lower classes who have experienced gender-based violence, are often neglected and their stories are mostly silenced. This class discrimination is also visible when analysing the treatment of perpetrators. Working-class, unemployed youth are often perceived as the typical sexual violator, while in reality women are being sexually harassed and assaulted by men from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Nevertheless, perpetrators of sexual harassment and assault that are part of the working-class, are overrepresented in Egypt and portrayed as if they are the only group that is guilty of these atrocities. This class discrimination is a result of the increasing securitisation of Egypt’s government, mostly after the revolution in 2011. This securitization has resulted in the working class in Egypt becoming even more marginalized and criminalized by nature”","['gender-based violence', 'Egypt', 'patriarchy', 'class struggle']"

Reviewing Reviews: Translators' Visibility in Dutch Critical Book Reviews,"Katerberg, Maya","['Valdez, S.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to investigate how critical book reviews contribute to translators’ invisibility. Lawrence Venuti (2018) presents examples of reviews of translated books from British and American periodicals, that illustrate the invisibility of translators (pp. 2-13). Several studies (Fawcett, 2000; Schulte, 2000; Bush, 2004; Valdez, 2009; Gray, 2017; Wardle 2020) have analysed the critical reviews of literary translations in prominent newspapers to ascertain translators’ visibility and image in their respective language fields. To gain insight into the translators’ image in the Netherlands, an analogous research was undertaken by analysing the critical reviews that were published between 1 January and 31 December 2020 in the Dutch newspaper NRC. This study has found that the majority of reviews that discussed translated books (60%), did not indicate what source language they were translated from. Additionally, in 73% of the reviews the name of the translator or translators was provided in a sidebar, but the translation was not discussed in the review itself. A tentative conclusion is that the trend in Dutch critical reviews is to take a translation for granted and to merely discuss the content and the style of the author, frequently supported by using ‒ paradoxically enough ‒ quotes in Dutch (86%). Translators are relegated to a subservient role and rarely receive acknowledgment for quotes that are used in critical book reviews, nor for their contribution towards the success (or failure) of the author.","['Translators’ Invisibility', 'Translators’ Visibility', 'Critical Book Reviews', 'Translation Reviews', 'Literary Translation', 'Dutch Translation']"

"Exploitation, Education, or Extermination? A Comparative Analysis of German Labour Policies in German South-West Africa and Nazi-Occupied Poland","Hove, Mila ten",['Dr Lukas Milevski'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The status of WWII Poland as a German colony remains debated. While some scholars argue in favour of a so-called “colonial-imperial paradigm” others explicitly reject any connection between German colonialism and Nazi-occupied Poland. Situating itself within this ongoing debate this thesis aims to provide a new perspective on German colonialism in Poland. By providing a comparative analysis of labour policies implemented in German South-West Africa (GSWA) and Nazi-occupied Poland this thesis hope to shed light on the controversial status of Poland as a German colony. Labour policies in particular pose an interesting lens through which to study the colonial-imperial paradigm as they touch upon a variety of dimensions that have been discussed at length within the wider literature. In particular, labour policy offers new insights into the role of ideology and violence in shaping economic relations in Germany’s colonies and Nazi-occupied Poland. As this thesis will show, the two cases show congruence in the fundamental motivations and structures of labour policy, however, at closer inspection, considerable differences can be observed. In particular, it will highlight the significant role of ideology in shaping Nazi labour practices and the unprecedented scale of violence experienced by Polish labourers. This research can be used as a starting point for further discussions about potential causal relations between German colonialism and the Nazi occupation of Poland as well as serving as a stepping stone to analysing the long-term economic consequences of the Nazi occupation of Poland.","['Germany', 'Poland', 'Labour Policies', 'Global Labour History', 'congruence analysis', 'WWII', 'postcolonialism', 'imperial-colonial paradigm debate']"

This article analyses the ethics behind Bio-art while comparing it to the importance of artistic freedom. Subjective motives to determine the artist's role are considered and compared to the value of the artist's motives. This article explains artistic freedom to be the very essence of art. The article showcases anthropocentrism and its structures in society. In Bio-art, one needs to look beyond the ethically challengeable artwork to find the anthropocentrism structured in society itself. In Bio-art, the agency of organisms, the artist and the artwork can play a role. Non-human organisms in art do not have agency in Bio-art. The agency lays in the hand of the Bio-artist to give rise to the agency of art. The motives of the artist need to be trusted to be able to imply messages through art.","['Bio-art', 'artistic freedom', 'anthropocentrism', 'agency of art']"

Obama and Trump: Classical Rhetoric in Modern Debate,"Lim, Jie Er","['Foster, A.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Most comparative studies have focused on Obama and Trump’s elocution (e.g. Hill, 2020) or invention (Bostdorf, 2017). Much less research has been done on both speaker’s arrangement and deviation from the classical prescripts. Nevertheless, arrangement is an important process that is omnipresent in different canons and complicated by nature as there is not one set framework of ordering. The lack of a set order is caused by the heavy influence the audience has on the disposition of a speech. This thesis will look at arrangement in a broader sense by investigating how information is ordered in various cannons of rhetoric. Finally, this thesis aims to answer the central question: is Obama or Trump the most successful classical rhetorical speaker in terms of arranging the information in their speech. To research this, I examined and compared one set of speeches by Obama and Trump with various classical pre-set orders. The classical orders that were used were the parts of speech by Cicero, the three appeals by Aristotle, and Aristotle's stock issues that Katula and Roth modified to suit the modern deliberative rhetoric. Stock issues are questions that frequently occur during argumentation. They can help the speaker anticipate what questions will be asked and help the critic ask appropriate questions (Katula and Roth, 1980, p. 184). The results showed that Obama’s speech was closer to the classical pre-sets than Trump’s speech. Obama incorporates each component of the arrangement, whereas Trump has shown to leave out certain components. These results propose that classical rhetoric is still prevalent in modern rhetoric and suggest how classical rhetoric can be altered to suit the present-day audience. With this thesis, I hope to have shed light on the value of classical rhetoric, in particular of arrangement, in modern debate.","['Obama', 'Trump', 'Classical Rhetoric', 'Arrangement', 'Dispositio']"

Twee lekker water: The Effect of Adjectives and Classifier when Ordering Drinks in Dutch,"Erkel, Ted van",['Prof.dr. J.S. Doetjes'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In Dutch, one can order a drink, denoted by a mass noun, using phrases such as: Ik will graag twee (glazen) rode wijn, ""I would like two glasses of red wine"". Interestingly, the usage of the classifier, in this case glazen ‘glasses’, is not obligatory. Borer (2005) argues that such sentences, without classifiers, are possible in a register she calls Restaurantese. This construction, however, is not possible with all adjective-noun combinations. Therefore, this study proposes two main hypotheses, similar to van Erkel (2020). First, one could argue that the acceptability of these configurations depends on the syntactic classification of the adjective. Second, one could argue that it depends on the relation between the adjective and the noun, which I refer to with the term combinability. There are different approaches one could take to define combinability. This study takes three different approaches: the collocation of the adjective and the noun; the familiarity of the combination; the chance one could find a combination on a menu, which I call the Restaurantese reading. Through different surveys, this study has shown that the syntactic level of the adjectives does not influence the acceptability of sentences in which you order drinks in Dutch. The combinability of the adjective-noun pair, on the other hand, plays a large role in the acceptability. This effect is, remarkably, not restricted to Restaurantese expressions. By comparing adjective-noun pairs that were ranking differently amongst the three approaches for combinability, I show that the Restaurantese reading is the best indicator for the acceptability of different adjective-noun pairs. Then I discuss the connection between the sentences with and without the overt classifier. I argue that the configurations without the overt classifier contain a covert classifier that introduces countability and the portion needed to express such sentences. Lastly, I note that the acceptability of these configurations is not set in stone. It is hugely dependent on cultural history and the usage of language by all its language users on the one hand, and one’s personal background and world knowledge on the other hand.","['mass-count distinction', 'combinability', 'adjectievs', 'classifiers', 'semantics', 'syntax', 'Dutch']"

The earthquake that occurred off the coast of eastern Japan triggered a powerful tsunami that in turn caused a nuclear meltdown. As with the Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe in 1995, most of the victims were elderly people. This paper articulates the causes of Japan’s elderly population’s vulnerability to (natural) hazards by examining to what extent neoliberalism aggravates the Japanese elderly’s disaster vulnerability by using the Disaster as a Social Vulnerability framework. The prevailing consensus in studies that utilize this approach is that neoliberalism and the most common developments associated with the neoliberal ideology, privatization, and decentralization4, harm people’s vulnerability. This paper shows that while processes associated with neoliberalism can exacerbate the Japanese elderly’s disaster vulnerability, as will be demonstrated by discussing the pension system, there is no evidence for the accuracy of this consensus regarding the healthcare system. Based on these insights, this paper concludes that the “neoliberalism aggravates disaster vulnerability”-consensus is too simplistic to consider the elderly population in Japan.","['Disaster', 'Disaster Studies', 'Neoliberalism', 'Ageing', 'Ageing Population']"

Currently, the analysis of coordination widely used within the Principles and Parameters-theory is to label them as conjunctive phrases (ConjP) with the conjunction at its head, the first element of the conjunction as the specifier, and the second element as its complement, as proposed by Munn (1978). In this thesis I plan to closely analyze this construction through established theories, previous studies and evidence found in English as well as several other languages when appropriate for the discussion. This thesis will focus exclusively on coordination of Determiner Phrases in order to establish an accessible basis for arguments for and objections against ConjP, as well as to easily foreground arguments dealing with case and agreement. From the compiled arguments I will present a judgement about the integrity of Munn’s structure. Therefore the purpose of this thesis is to find out whether coordinative phrases propose a significant problem to X’-theory, as is assumed in papers such as Borsley (2015).","['Syntax', 'syntactic theory', ""X'-theory"", 'Principles and Parameters', 'Coordination', 'Conjunction', 'Coordinative phrase']"

For a long time, separate social duties between men and women have led to the exclusion of Japanese women from particular careers and opportunities. Nowadays, the lack of women within Japan’s workforce is problematic to economic growth, and the gig economy might be a promising avenue for women to contribute to the economy. Through conducting case studies on the experiences of Japanese women engaged in gig work, this thesis reveals some of the issues and complications that accompany online employment relations for Japanese women. The results show that gig work does not address the main inadequacies that complicate women’s careers and work-life balance within Japanese society. Therefore, Japanese women looking to find aspiring and refreshing employment in the digital realm might come to find that online work does not offer them a getaway from women’s traditional social duties and career options.","['Gig economy', 'Gig work', 'gender', 'gender equality', 'employment', 'digital economy', 'digital work']"

The Brand of South Korea: A Video Analysis of Promotional Videos from Tourism Campaigns in 2017 and 2020,"Hoekstra, Mariëlle","['Nakamura, M.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis investigates what kind of nation brand the Korean Tourism Organisation and the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism desire to establish for South Korea through the 8 Faces of Korea Campaign (2017) and the Feel the Rhythm of KOREA Campaign (2020). A video analysis of the promotional videos from two tourism campaigns was conducted and individual components were identified and categorised in two main categories: globally affiliated and nationally unique. The video analysis reveals that the 8 Faces of Korea Campaign (2017) used a popular cultural export product to establish and familiarise the brand of South Korea, while the Feel the Rhythm of Korea Campaign (2020) portrayed South Korea’s brand identity through a modernised form of traditional Korean culture that is unique to the nation. The thesis concludes that the portrayal of the South Korean nation brand through the promotional videos of tourism campaigns changes accordingly with the shifts in the target audience and tourism policies of South Korea.","['Nation Branding', 'South Korea', 'Tourism', 'Tourism Campaigns', 'Video Analysis']"
The Discursive Construction of Us vs Them: A Critical Discourse Study of Migrant Representation in the Italian Press,"Arkell, Rebecca","['Jeffery, J.V.', 'Dorst, L.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In the West, discourse on and about migrants is often characterised by inclusive and exclusive discursive practices that contribute to constructing an “us” vs “them” dichotomy. In Italy, as well as in Europe, the rise of right-wing and populist parties has advanced an increasingly xenophobic and exclusionary rhetoric. Discriminatory ideologies are not innate, but they are produced and reproduced in society through discourse. The present thesis aims to uncover such discriminatory and exclusionary discourses and to understand how the dichotomous “us” and “them” relationship is constructed in a selection of Italian newspapers. This study investigates the discursive strategies employed in migrant representation in right-wing Il Giornale (IG) and centrist Corriere della Sera (CS) drawing from a combination of theoretical and methodological critical discourse study (CDS) frameworks, namely Wodak’s (2001) Discourse-Historical approach, van Leeuwen’s (1996) Social Actor approach, and KhosraviNik’s (2010) systematisation of CDS analytical categories. A final total number of twenty-six newspaper articles were qualitatively analysed. The study found that topics such as “arrivals”, “landings”, and “irregular arrivals” are particularly salient in both newspapers. The findings fit in with macro-level discourse on migration in Italy (and the EU) as well as with their migration policies that are almost exclusively focused on managing irregular arrivals. Amongst the most common discursive strategies identified in both newspapers are aggregation (presenting migrants in large numbers), objectivation (naming migrants with terminology that lacks the semantic feature “human”) and classification (naming social actors on the basis of their ethnicity, e.g. Tunisians vs Italians). Furthermore, Il Giornale was found to engage in explicitly anti-immigrant arguments drawing on topoi of financial burden, threat, law, and number.","['Critical discourse studies', 'migration', 'Il Giornale', 'Corriere della Sera', 'us vs them.']"

That's hilarious! Conversationele humor in sitcoms,"Casado Yanci, Sophie","['Boogaart, R.J.U.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Abstract In dit BA eindwerkstuk heb ik onderzocht welke soorten conversationele humor voorkomen in sitcoms. Ik heb dit gedaan door middel van het beantwoorden van mijn hoofdvraag ""In welke categorieën binnen conversationele humor van Dynel (2009) vallen de talige grappen die worden gemaakt in sitcoms?”. Voor dit onderzoek heb ik in eerste instantie een kwalitatieve analyse uitgevoerd en daarna een kwantitatieve analyse. Ten eerste heb ik twee afleveringen van sitcoms voor volwassenen en twee afleveringen van sitcoms voor preadolecenten bekeken en van iedere talige uiting waarna een lachband volgde besloten van wat voor soort humor hier sprake was en die, wanneer mogelijk, ingedeeld in de categorieën van conversationele humor die Dynel (2009) heeft opgesteld. Daarna heb ik een kwantitatieve analyse uitgevoerd om te bekijken hoe vaak iedere vorm van conversationele humor voorkomt. Aan de hand van deze analyses heb ik een conclusie kunnen trekken. Door de categorieën van Dynel aan te houden en zelf nog twee extra categorieën - “andere soort humor” en “geen humor” - op te stellen, heb ik de talige uitingen in de sitcoms die door de makers zelf als grappig worden beschouwd, gecategoriseerd. Alle categorieën van Dynel worden in de sitcoms gebruikt, maar wel in verschillende mate. Naast de bestaande categorieën van conversationele humor werden er ook veel potentiële grappen in de categorie “andere soort humor” ingedeeld. Na de analyse kwamen er uit deze categorie drie nieuwe categorieën naar voren: 1) Personage-specifiek, 2) Context-specifiek, en 3) Zelf-referentie. Deze categorieën kunnen ingedeeld worden in conversationele humor, doordat ze gebaseerd zijn op interactie.","['Humor', 'taalwetenschap', 'tumortheorie', 'conversationele humor']"

Abuse and Military Maladjustment in the South Korean Military: Influences of the Military Environment on Suicide of South Korean Conscript Soldiers,"Vajserman, Katja","['Green, C.K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since 1949, South Korean men are required to serve in the military for approximately 18 months. In 2018, South Korea's armed forces included around 608,000 active military personnel, including 107,000 conscript soldiers. In order to sustain an army this big, human welfare issues require significant care. However, with the current suicide rate in the military and the rising abuse reports, South Korea is facing internal threats. These internal issues could be of possible negative impact for the national defense of South Korea. This thesis looked at how the military environment and the military’s response on abuse and maladjustment issues allows for factors to occur which influence South Korean conscript soldiers to ideate and commit suicide. This was done by using Joiner's interpersonal psychology theory to analyze two recent suicide cases which have been reported by the media. It was found that the military environment in these cases allowed for all factors of the theory to develop. This in turn was linked to the suicide of the case subjects. The thesis also showed that the military's response and actions after the death of the soldiers were not in the favor of reflection and future prevention of such cases. This thesis has contributed to the understanding of conscript suicide in the South Korean military by analyzing the role of the internal military environment.","['South Korea', 'South Korean Military', 'Military', 'Suicide', 'Abuse', 'Military Maladjustment', 'Mandatory Military Service', 'Conscripts', 'Suicide Rate']"

Testing Schwarz’s Framework for Abolitionist Politicians: Politics Equals Normative Ethics,"Oei, Timo",['Wouter Kalf'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis I start with the assumption that politics equals normative ethics and argue to what extent politicians that do not use moral concepts (and thus endorse the abolitionist answer to the “Now what?” question within the Moral Error Theory) are able to communicate with people that do use moral concepts. As such, it focuses on whether abolitionists can engage in normative ethics without using moral concepts. Schwarz’s theory is posed which provides a framework for doing so and I argue that this theory comes with flaws as seen in problematic scenarios. I also argue that some of these problematic scenarios are solvable by adding to her theory and that her theory comes with two problematic scenarios that are theoretically unsolvable. The proposed solutions are meant to show how these can enhance the relevance of the theory. It is also argued that a possible solution to the theoretically unsolvable problematic scenarios is that abolitionist politicians, when adhering to Schwarz’s theory, can temporarily divert from her theory by conceding to using moral concepts just to be able to communicate with people that do use moral concepts. This thesis uses the case of the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate how these problematic scenarios can occur in practice. This thesis concludes that, while Schwarz’s theory provides a framework that allows abolitionist politicians that do not use moral concepts to effectively communicate with people that do use moral concepts, Schwarz’s theory comes with problematic scenarios for which I show how her theory can be improved. Furthermore, it is also concluded that her theory sometimes fails to provide these abolitionist politicians the full ability to effectively communicate within the practice of normative ethics without using moral concepts. Additionally, I propose further research is needed to improve the shortcomings of Schwarz’s theory that arise whenever her criteria C1 comes into play, which is often inevitable.","['Moral Philosophy', 'Political Philosophy', 'Moral Error Theory', 'Metaethics']"

"“My phone is like my office”: Youth, refugees and digital livelihoods in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania","Demirdirek, Mira","['Wilson, M.C.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The introduction of biometric SIM card registration in January 2020 requiring proof of citizenship or legal status highlighted the critical importance of mobile telephony to the livelihoods of refugees in Dar-es-Salaam. Under the Tanzanian asylum regime, legally registered refugees are neither allowed to leave their camps nor work formally. On the other hand, urban refugees with no legal status depend on mobile connectivity for creating a livelihood informally. With formal employment opportunities limited even for Tanzanian citizens, new forms of mobility in the digital era and translocal connections become lifelines for new opportunities. This thesis explores the ways in which youth in Dar-es-Salaam, both refugees and citizens, creatively use and appropriate mobile phones and social media to navigate their livelihoods. Based on interviews, focus group discussions, and digital observations during three months of research in Dar-es-Salaam, this thesis identifies three common ways of using mobile phone and social media for income generation outside of secure employment: digitally mediated communication with financial supporters, intermediation in sales transactions, and commerce via social media. The findings suggest that the interplay of both online and offline and local and translocal networks allows urban youth to capitalize on their social ties successfully. While this inventive appropriation of mobile technology enables youth to overcome the challenges of urban life, this thesis also highlights the limitations of digital mobility in resolving structural inequalities.","['youth', 'urban refugees', 'mobile telephony', 'social media', 'digital mobility', 'livelihoods']"

Batik Belanda: A Critical Review of Batik Representation in Dutch and Indonesian Museums,"Brussel, Tim van",['Dr. Elena Burgos Martinez'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on batik Belanda, which is the wax-resist dyed cloth produced in Indonesia, made during the Dutch colonisation period of Indonesia by Western female entrepreneurs. Dutch and Indonesian museums have large collections of batik Belanda. The Dutch Council of Culture aims to return looted colonial art, and improve the representation of colonial art in museums. However, batik Belanda is not included in this discussion. Therefore, this thesis aims to discuss batik Belanda as a form of colonial art in order to raise awareness and to provide a critical approach to the current representation of batik Belanda in Dutch and Indonesian heritage museums. Twelve experts were interviewed, and three museums - the Tropenmuseum, the Wereldmuseum and the Batik Danar Hadi Museum were visited. The results of the research show that the current approach to batik Belanda is Westernised. Museums exclude the multi-cultural ethos of batik, and instead focus on stylistic differences between batik patterns. In addition, museums do not consider batik Belanda as colonial art and is therefore not included in the discussion on returning looted art. This implies that the current representation of batik Belanda in Dutch and Indonesian heritage museums is Western-dominated. Moreover, a lack of acknowledgement to the multicultural roots and the imbalanced power relations defines the current representation of batik Belanda.",['Batik Belanda – Dutch Indies – colonial art – textile mobility– textile ethics – resist dyeing – batik']

These will be compared with one another and a conclusion will be drawn discussing which humoristic instances are translated using which translation strategy. The hypothesis that subtitlers have to settle for the omission of words or phrases to fit the spatial and temporal constraints belonging to audiovisual translation will be tested by researching the various alternative strategies a subtitler can choose from, and which have been chosen by the subtitler of the abovementioned sitcom. An overall conclusion will be drawn, with reference to the results and their analysis, concluding that a subtitler can use a wide variety of strategies, and how subtitlers can use those strategies when subtitling humoristic instances in other, similar, films or series.

This study investigates the negative connotations and metaphorical associations of five animals from a comparative and cross-linguistic perspective, to see if there are noticeable patterns among different languages. The factors influencing the development of metaphors and connotations are also explored. The data was collected from previous publications on the subject and compiled in an overview showing negative animal expressions from 61 languages. The results showed that genealogical relations increase the chances of connotations being shared between languages, and that geography and religion can also be of influence. The amount of internal variation also indicates that there is a degree of arbitrariness with regard to the development of metaphors.","['animal metaphors', 'connotations', 'negative expressions', 'swearing']"

Onzichtbaar en essentieel: De rol van zwart activisme in de homo-emancipatie in Nederland in de jaren tachtig,"Terdu, Thirza","['Shield, A.D.J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit essay heb ik geanalyseerd welke rol zwart activisme speelde in de Nederlandse lhbt-emancipatie in de jaren tachtig. Ik concludeer dat het verschillende rollen heeft gespeeld. Allereerst richtte zwart activisme zich op het vergroten van de zichtbaarheid van homoseksualiteit binnen eigen culturen, bijvoorbeeld door uit te komen voor hun seksualiteit tegenover familie en vrienden en hier met hen over te praten. Ten tweede waren zwarte lhbt-organisaties fundamenteel in het faciliteren van contacten binnen en tussen verschillende minderheidsgroepen door het organiseren van sociale bijeenkomsten en verenigingen waar deze groepen elkaar konden ontmoeten. Zoals D’Emilio stelde, waren de gezelligheidsverenigingen en gespreksgroepen even belangrijk voor de emancipatie van homoseksuelen als de formele vormen van activisme, omdat ze zichtbaarheid en herkenning boden aan minderheidsgroeperingen. Ten derde heeft zwart activisme bijgedragen aan de emancipatie van zwarte lhbt’ers door informatievoorzieningen en archieven op te zetten in Nederland, waar informatie over de geschiedenissen van verschillende culturele achtergronden in Nederland toegankelijk werd voor het bredere publiek. Ten slotte hebben zwarte activisten een belangrijke rol gespeeld in bestrijden van racisme en (seksuele) vooroordelen binnen de witte homogemeenschap. De Afro-Amerikaanse lhbt-activist Marscha P. Johnson zei: ’No pride for some of us, without liberation for all of us’. Deze bekende uitspraak benadrukt het belang van racismebestrijding binnen de lhbt-gemeenschap: witte lhbt'ers zijn niet vrij totdat zwarte lhbt'ers dezelfde vrijheid delen.","['activisme', 'zwart', 'jaren tachtig', 'nederland', 'emancipatie', 'homo-emancipatie', 'lhbt+', 'SuHo', 'Sister Outsider', 'Strange Fruit', 'Flamboyant', 'Gloria Wekker', 'racisme', 'sjalhomo', 'COC', 'matisme', 'SEK', 'Homologie']"

Enhancing security through flexibility: How the Abe and Suga administrations are adding Japan’s security objectives to the agendas of Southeast Asian states,"Ninchritz, Claudius","['L.O. Black', 'A.R. Shidiq']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis argues that during the Abe and Suga administrations, Japan has been successful at pushing some of its key security objectives into the agendas of strategically important Southeast Asian states through the process of tactical hedging. Tactical hedging has allowed the Abe and Suga administrations to be flexible with its policy approach to the rise of China, allowing Japan to be firm on security issues in Southeast Asia when needed, while allowing room for friendly economic competition. This flexibility made security cooperation with Japan more viable for Southeast Asian states, as none of the countries wish to pursue a hard-line China containment policy. The Free and Open Indo-Pacific vision, which has seen notable alterations by the Abe and Suga administration to address the needs of their Southeast Asian partners, and Japan refraining from openly criticizing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are examples of Japan taking the concerns of its Southeast Asian partners into account. While still at an early stage, the results of Japan’s tactical hedging can be seen within Japan’s improved security relations with Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. These three countries, which belong to the largest economies of ASEAN, and are faced with China’s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, will therefore be used to support the importance of tactical hedging for security cooperation in East Asia.","['Hedging', 'Tactical Hedging', 'South China Sea Dispute', 'Southeast Asia', 'Japan', 'China']"

Eine semantische Analyse der Reflexiva des Deutschen und Niederländischen: wie sich deutsche und niederländische reflexive Verben voneinander unterscheiden.,"Jongejan, Christine","['Audring, Jenny']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Duitse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,de,"Es ist kein reiner Zufall, dass das Deutsche und Niederländische sich in vielerlei Hinsicht ähnlich Verhalten, denn sie sind schließlich Schwestersprachen. Reflexive Verben scheinen ein gutes Beispiel dieser Ähnlichkeit. In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden reflexive Verben im Deutschen und Niederländischen miteinander verglichen. Reflexive Verben werden mittels einer Wortliste, in der deutsche und niederländische Verben analysiert werden, in verschiedene Klassen unterteilt, die anschließend miteinander verglichen werden können. Es ist das Ziel dieser Arbeit um herauszufinden, ob deutsche und niederländische reflexive Verben sich systematisch voneinander unterscheiden. Ist es nur Zufall, dass verkouden worden ‘sich erkälten’ auf Deutsch reflexiv verwendet wird und im Niederländischen nicht, oder gehört das Verb zu einer größeren Gruppe der reflexiven Verben, die im Niederländischen nie reflexiv ist? Es hat sich ergeben, dass es tatsächlich systematische Unterschiede zu entdecken sind. Einige Klassen der Reflexiva, die im Deutschen reflexiv sind, sind das im Niederländischen nicht: die Klassen der Positions-, benefaktiven & malefaktiven Verben und die dekausativen inhärent reflexiven Verben mit belebtem Subjekt. Dekausative Reflexiva werden im Niederländischen überhaupt beschränkter als im Deutschen verwendet. Auch ist es bei manchen dekausativen Verben und agentiven Verben, die eine Körperbewegung ausdrücken, im Niederländischen möglich, das Reflexivpronomen weglassen. Im Deutschen ist das nicht der Fall. Wenn ein Verb für reflexiv markiert wird, wird die Betroffenheit des Subjekts betont. Das Deutsche betont diese Betroffenheit am meisten. Das Deutsche markiert semantische Rollen generell mehr als das Niederländische. Das sollte erklären, wieso das Deutsche die meisten Reflexiva aufweist und die Markierung auch nicht einfach weglassen will. Das Niederländische markiert semantische Rollen wiederum mehr als das Englische. Im Niederländischen werden Reflexiva auch mehr als im Englischen verwendet. Das Niederländische befindet sich daher zwischen dem Deutschen und Englischen. Sprecher des Niederländischen scheinen es einfach manchmal unnötig zu finden, die Betroffenheit des Subjekts zu betonen, deswegen kann das Reflexivpronomen bei manchen Verben weggelassen werden. Verben, deren Reflexivpronomina auch weggelassen werden können, gehören zu reflexiven Klassen, die dem Englischen fehlen. Das Niederländische scheint daher momentan dem englischen Weg zu folgen.","['Linguistics', 'reflexive Verbs', 'germanic linguistics']"
"""Wir haben gut connected"" A comparison of German-English and Dutch-English codeswitching in communication between strangers","Geuke, Suze","['Dr. H.N.M. De Mulder', 'Dr. M. Parafita Couto']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates German-English and Dutch-English codeswitching in conversations between strangers. The aim was to grasp speakers’ perceived norms towards using English in German and Dutch speech. In order to do so, this study draws comparisons between German and Dutch speakers’ codeswitching, as well as compares codeswitching towards strangers to previous findings on codeswitching amongst members of specific communities. The dataset consisted of spoken data from the German and Dutch version of the TV programme First Dates. Over 600 codeswitches from 74 German and 99 Dutch speakers were analysed. The analysis examined structural elements (e.g. word category) as well as semantic elements of the switch (translation equivalence). In addition to this, the analysis considered speakers’ sociolinguistic features (age, gender, etc.) to see how widespread codeswitching is amongst various speaker types. The findings include that speakers do not engage in “creative” switching (i.e. new formations regardless of standard English grammar) while communicating with strangers, in contrast to codeswitching between community members. Overall, Dutch speakers switched more often and the word categories of switches were more diverse than German speakers. This is likely due to the higher level of English exposure in the Netherlands. Moreover, accommodation in codeswitching (i.e. speakers adjust their behaviour either to emphasise similarities or emphasise differences) was correlated with whether partners wanted a second date. This suggests that speakers managed their codeswitching to moderate social distance. The use of codeswitching was not limited to specific groups (e.g. youth speakers); rather, the majority of the speakers used English expressively and functionally. These findings imply that codeswitching is generally perceived as acceptable in German and Dutch.","['codeswitching', 'anglicisms', 'accommodation', 'English in Europe']"

In the Dutch colony, the idea that Javanese worker showed a natural tendency for laziness and lacked the urge to improve their material condition was highly influential and repeatedly invoked to justify coercive labor practices. Whereas the Dutch used to consider Javanese’s alleged laziness as a stable and in-built feature of their inferior “race”, this study shows that they increasingly started to treat it as a by-product of their deplorable socio-economic circumstances by the turn of the century. Given that the Cultivation System (1830-1870) robbed the Javanese off the fruits of their own labor, the Dutch asserted that the natives had failed to develop the “natural” materialist urges they associated with industrial capitalism. In attempts to cure Javanese agricultural workers of their supposed indolence, the agents of capital therefore endeavored to inculcate work ethic from above via the so-called Ethical Policy of 1901. This study not only documents this discursive change, but also aims to understand and explain it. To this end, it places the historical transformation of the stereotype against the background of the racial capitalist regime change it emerged from: the shift from a system in which natives were excluded from the White economy to one in which they were demanded to assimilate. My findings fill up the empirical lacuna on the circulation of this racial-economic trope in the late nineteenth century and advances the historiography on the topic by thoroughly embedding it within Black Marxist theorizing.","['Race', 'Laziness', 'racial capitalism', 'discourse', 'colonial Java']"

A Renovative Dialogue on Morality: Al- Ghazali and the Expansion of the Secular Horizon,"Bauer- Gauss, Fabio",['Dr. J. Li'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this paper we construe a renovative dialogue by placing the conception of morality that follows from Imam Abu Hamid al- Ghazali’s metaphysics in conversation with equivalent ideas from Friedrich Nietzsche and Michel Foucault, who are both defining thinkers of the Postmodern current. The dialogue primarily serves to clarify how exactly ideas from the traditional religio- philosophical system of the reviver of the Islamic faith may contribute to the expansion of the Postmodern horizon, whilst keeping an eye on its invaluable insights which promise to advance and enrich traditional thought. The central proposition of this paper is that Imam al- Ghazali’s epistemology is expansive to Postmodern thought in providing the philosophical ground for positive and fruitful deliberations on moral truth by synthesizing the faculty of reason with immediate experience (dhawq) with reference to the spiritual heart (qalb) of humans, which is an epistemic faculty of immediate insight into the nature of reality. We argue that traditional Islamic thought is relevant in the context of Secularism, because it answers to the Western surrender of Metaphysics, offering an experientiably verifiable method by means of which to engage in valid metaphysical and moral inquiry. To achieve this end we give a detailed exposition of Imam al- Ghazali’s multi- faceted, life- oriented ethics, critically examine some of the central propositions of Postmodern thought in relation to morality and place them into a dynamic dialogue with the Imam’s religio- philosophical system. Furthermore we present personal considerations supported by and harmonious with the Imam’s writings which question the validity of the nihilistic claims of its interlocutor. It is the purpose of the present endeavor to capture and deliberate about sensitive ideas which shape contemporary secular ideology in a rigorous manner, whilst opening pathways to the consideration that there might be more to reality than matter and ideology.","['Postmodernism', 'Nietzsche', 'Foucault', 'Human Nature', 'Soul', 'Islamic Philosophy', 'Sufism', 'Mysticism', 'Metaphysics', 'Ethics', 'Epistemology', 'Morality']"
‘PAN-ISLAMISM’: AN IMAGINARY THREAT? Knowledge formation about pan-Islam in transnational Orientalist networks 1876-1909.,"Kurnaz, Nuri","['Bloembergen, Marieke', 'Devji, Faisal']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Abstract: Sultan Abdulhamid II, is considered by many to be the creator of Pan-Islamism. An ideology that seeks to unite Muslims around the world under political leadership of one ruler. Today, this idea, which originated in a different colonial context, is still very much alive. That Abdulhamid was after a political instrument that undermined colonial authority is also accepted in historiography to this day. This research explains how this idea became accepted in academia and the public sphere due to a transnational network of Orientalists. Although each country had a different relationship towards the Ottoman Empire under Abdulhamid, Orientalists from those countries conducted their research on the Orient together in a connected international network. With the increasing academic achievement and connectedness of this network, their specific conclusions started to weigh more heavily. Internationally connected scholars influenced the knowledge formation during Abdulhamid’s reign between 1876-1909 to the extent that they introduced and adjusted certain terminology. Based on preserved correspondences, academic output and involvement in public debates traced in Dutch digital databases of newspapers, the understanding of the terminology they introduced themselves fell under their own authority. In the same era we also find a new form and changing practice of Orientalist research. The Orientalists started to travel more often and actually went to the Orient to carry out their fieldwork. As a result, more attention was paid to the religiopolitical sphere of the Orient fostering integration both ways. A shift in the perception of what was regarded science was the outcome. Scholars were expected to provide practically useful knowledge to one’s own country. As in the case of Snouck Hurgronje for the Netherlands, this turned the innovative Orientalist scholar into an authority who could provide the government practically useful knowledge. Scholars started to travel more often to the Orient while simultaneously staying involved in the European public and academic spheres. As a consequence, they were also seen as authorities in Europe. Because, who could better interpret the area than he who had seen it himself? Snouck Hurgronje and Arminius Vámbéry were two of the innovative mobile Orientalists that influenced knowledge formation regarding pan-Islam in the European continent from outside of it. Due to the authority their new method of Orientalist practice gave them, they found themselves in a position to be officially and publicly involved in matters related to Islam. Snouck Hurgronje’s acquired practical knowledge in the Dutch-Indies provided the international Orientalist network with an empirical gateway to the contemporary world of their subjects. Also, in the European public the same authority gave them a voice. Pan-Islam as a term was introduced, adapted and adjusted by independent Orientalist who conducted their field work for their own countries’ sake, but at the same time influenced academic and public opinion as well. Pan-Islam lends itself as a case study to understand knowledge formation as connected to colonial contexts, because the term was introduced and adapted by Orientalists whose authority derived from their new practical way of knowledge formation in the Orient.","['Abdulhamid II', 'Pan-Islam', 'Snouck Hurgronje', 'Arminius Vambery', 'Orientalism', 'Aceh', 'Ottoman', 'Dutch-Indies', 'Empire', 'transnational networks', 'Orientalist network', 'Orientalist congress']"

De Kranten van Babel: Het gebruik van politieke exoniemen in Nederlandse kranten,"Grijzenhout, Simon",['Astrid Vandendaele'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Soms zijn er meerdere namen waarmee steden en landen aangeduid kunnen worden. Welke naam je moet gebruiken, kan een lastige afweging zijn voor kranten wanneer die namen een politieke lading hebben. De Nederlandse naam ‘Wit-Rusland’ is bijvoorbeeld een exoniem van ‘Belarus’. Daar kan grondig over gediscussieerd worden binnen redacties. Dit onderzoek richt zich op die discussies en onderzoekt daarom de opvattingen van eindredacteuren en ombudspersonen. De discussie rondom politieke exoniemen wordt in dit onderzoek enerzijds in het kader van machtsstructuren binnen de taal, anderzijds in het kader van hoe redacties objectief proberen om te gaan met taalkwesties. Om het taalbeleid van kranten te onderzoeken, is er ook kennis nodig van het belang van taal in het algemeen. De woordkeus die dominant in de samenleving is, kan namelijk ook ons denken beïnvloeden. Daarom is er discussie over het gebruik van woorden die als politiek opgevat kunnen worden. Exoniemen zijn een voorbeeld van internationale taalkwesties die gevoelig kunnen liggen. Als taal politiek wordt, moeten redacties keuzes maken over hoe ze daarmee omgaan. Intern wordt er gediscussieerd over woorden en terminologie, maar het is lastig om objectief te blijven als woorden niet neutraal zijn. Het kiezen voor de ene of de andere term kan activistisch worden uitgelegd. Anderzijds hebben kranten een groot bereik en hebben hun taalkeuzes invloed op het taalgebruik van de maatschappij. Hoe gaan redacties om met die verantwoordelijkheid? Er is in het theoretisch kader speciale aandacht voor de rol van stijlboeken, eindredacteuren en ombudspersonen. Om tot een antwoord op de hoofdvraag te komen, is er zowel kwantitatief als kwalitatief onderzoek gedaan. Aan de hand van een tiental kwesties die in het verleden hebben gespeeld is een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse gemaakt van het gebruik van endoniemen en exoniemen. Hoe vaak de beide termen gebruikt werden in de jaren voor en nadat er taalveranderingen zijn doorgevoerd in het stijlboek of discussie over heeft plaatsgevonden, toont aan dat veranderingen in het stijlboek zeer effectief zijn. Wat voor beleid er wordt gevoerd op geografische namen, maakt uit voor wat er in de krant staat. Ook zijn er diepte-interviews gehouden met verschillende ombudspersonen en eindredacteuren. Ze hebben inzicht gegeven in de redactionele processen en de afwegingen die gelden bij gevoelige keuzes. De kranten proberen over het algemeen de politiek buiten hun taalkundige beslissingen te houden, maar beseffen dat hun woordkeus wel zo opgevat kan worden. Over het algemeen wordt de voorkeur gegeven aan duidelijkheid en leesbaarheid van de krant. De geografische namen die gebruikt worden moeten makkelijk te begrijpen zijn en goed ingeburgerd in de Nederlandse samenleving. Wel zijn er verschillen te constateren in de mate waarin kranten terughoudend zijn om beslissingen door te voeren. Waar bij NRC de ‘taalrealiteit’ voorop staat, kijkt de Limburger meer naar het beleid van andere kranten. Trouw wil graag haar eigen afwegingen maken, zonder politieke factoren en lijkt daarin terughoudend, terwijl de Volkskrant het minst bang lijkt om veranderingen door te voeren.","['Exoniemen', 'ombudsman', 'eindredacteur', 'mediataalgebruik']"

De meting van impact van nieuws: Een case study over het meten van de impact van de documentaire The True Cost via het model van Green-Barber,"van Kinschot, Emilie",['Dr. A.W.M. Koetsenruijter'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De rol van impact heeft bij journalistiek werk nu veel aandacht, ook op wetenschappelijk gebied. Betrokken partijen, zoals investeerders, stellen belang in de impact van journalistieke producten en ondervragen redacties daarover. Maar is impact van nieuws meetbaar en is daar een bruikbaar, wetenschappelijk verantwoord instrument voor? En valt het meten van impact wel binnen de professie van de journalist? Voor het vinden van duidelijke antwoorden op deze vragen, is het nuttig om een grondig instrument te hebben voor het meten van impact voor een afgebakend nieuwsonderwerp. Op al deze impactgerelateerde vragen proberen onderzoekers antwoord te geven. Zo heeft Green- Barber (2014) onderzoek gedaan naar impact op het journalistieke vlak. Uit haar onderzoek bleek dat impact gemeten kan worden op drie niveaus: macro-, meso- en microniveau en in verschillende categorieën: sociaal, cultureel en politiek gebied. In deze studie wordt impact gezien als het optreden van verandering in individuen, groepen mensen, organisaties, systemen en sociale of fysieke condities. Dat betreft dan bijvoorbeeld bewustzijn, kennis, gedrag, normen of beleid (Green en Patel in Powers & Curry, 2019, p. 2240). De scriptie onderzoekt de werkbaarheid van het model van Green-Barber door middel van een case study. Een case study is uitgevoerd naar Andrew Morgans documentaire The True Cost van 2015. ‘The True Cost’ behandelt de problemen in de wereldwijde kledingindustrie en laat daarbij alle mensen en plaatsen zien in de hele productieketen van kleding. De schaduwkant wordt daarbij vooral belicht door het tevoorschijn brengen van de werkelijke kosten van fast fashion’voor mens en milieu. Doordat deze case study de kledingindustrie behandelt, is aan het model van Green-Barber de categorie ‘economisch’ toegevoegd voor het meten van impact. In de opzet van deze case study is gekozen om het impactmodel van Green-Barber te gebruiken. Zij concludeerde over impact op journalistiek vlak, dat die gemeten kan worden op drie niveaus: macro-, meso- en microniveau, dat vormt de basis van het model. Dit onderzoek geeft nu antwoord op de vraag: Wat is de impact van de documentaire The True Cost volgens het model van Green-Barber en in hoeverre is dit model geschikt voor het meten van impact?","['Journalism', 'Impact', 'New Media', 'Case study']"

Enhancing security through flexibility: How the Abe and Suga administrations are adding Japan’s security objectives to the agendas of Southeast Asian state,"Ninchritz, Claudius","['A.R.

Black']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis argues that during the Abe and Suga administrations, Japan has been successful at pushing some of its key security objectives into the agendas of strategically important Southeast Asian states through the process of tactical hedging. Tactical hedging has allowed the Abe and Suga administrations to be flexible with its policy approach to the rise of China, allowing Japan to be firm on security issues in Southeast Asia when needed, while allowing room for friendly economic competition. This flexibility made security cooperation with Japan more viable for Southeast Asian states, as none of the countries wish to pursue a hard-line China containment policy. The Free and Open Indo-Pacific vision, which has seen notable alterations by the Abe and Suga administration to address the needs of their Southeast Asian partners, and Japan refraining from openly criticizing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are examples of Japan taking the concerns of its Southeast Asian partners into account. While still at an early stage, the results of Japan’s tactical hedging can be seen within Japan’s improved security relations with Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. These three countries, which belong to the largest economies of ASEAN, and are faced with China’s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, will therefore be used to support the importance of tactical hedging for security cooperation in East Asia.","['Hedging', 'Tactical Hedging', 'South China Sea Dispute', 'Southeast Asia', 'Japan', 'China']"

Smakman'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis addresses verbal and non-verbal aspects of Russian identity, namely word order and smiling. It aims at investigating whether Russian national identity is shifting and can be qualified as ‘Western’. In order to examine these aspects, the Matched Guise Test was used, which proved its efficiency in measuring verbal and non-verbal sociolinguistic aspects that existed in a particular language community. For this experiment, native Russian speakers (n=22) were offered to participate in two tests that focused on common and uncommon word order use and use of a sincere smile in a situation where it was not commonly used. In the first task, native Russian speakers were asked to evaluate two equivalent Russian phrases produced by a guise. The phrases were different in their word order. During the second task, a video scene was shown to participants where a stranger smiled sincerely when making eye contact with another stranger. Participants were supposed to assess both tasks across seven characteristics on Likert scales. The results of the first task were compared and correlated with gender and age, as were the findings of the second task. Overall, participants pointed out that uncommon word order and a genuine smile to a stranger could not be regarded as a Russian way of verbal and non-verbal behaviour. This led to the conclusion that participants were sensitive towards these aspects. Also, their responses supported the idea that both aspects contributed to Russian identity formation. Apart from that, the study revealed that female participants were more conservative concerning uncommon word order use, and younger participants were more sensitive towards the sincerity of a smile received from a stranger. However, according to previous research, more studies are needed in order to outline a clear-cut sociolinguistic situation in Russia, especially in measuring attitudes of its population by means of the matched-guise technique.","['sociolinguistics', 'language attitudes', 'the matched-guise technique', 'national identity', 'Russian']"

Facets of Ottoman Sexuality: Male Same-Sex Sexual Relations and Boy Prostitution in the Ottoman Empire,"Ari, Immanuella J.M.",['Dr. H.P.A. Theunissen'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"While opposite-sex and same-sex sexual intercourse are obviously as old as humanity, the discourse of sexuality as an identity is a quite recent phenomenon, an invented tradition. The terms heterosexual, homosexual, monosexual and heterogenit (bestiality) did not exist until the 1860s when they were coined by journalist Karl-Maria Kertbeny. Not only was this theory present in the West, it was also prevalent in the Ottoman Empire, where dominant religion Sunni Hanefi Islam condemned all sexual intercourse outside marital or concubinage relation between a man and a woman, including sexual intercourse between men. Although marriage/concubinage between a man and a woman has always been regarded as the favourable way of life in the Ottoman Empire, heterosexuality as a concept did not exist. Moreover, sexual contacts outside a marital or concubinage relationship did also happen. These included sexual contacts between men, sexual relations between women and sexual contacts with (female and male) prostitutes. Although female same-sex sexual relations did occur as attested by scarce sources, women’s activities seem to have gone unnoticed and consequently, undocumented. My aim in this thesis is to show that Ottoman men were not the conquering,“heterosexual,” pious Muslims the current Turkish president likes to portray them in order to create an ideal image to which the modern Turkish male citizen should mirror himself. Male same-sex sexual relations were omnipresent in the Ottoman Empire. These relations happened in the form of (love) relationships between adult men, adult men and (pre-) pubescent boys, between similar-aged pubescent boys and between paying men and boy prostitutes. Male prostitutes seem to have been mainly boys/youths and not adult men.","['Ottoman Empire', 'Male Same-Sex Sexual Relations', 'Boy/Male Prostitution']"

Stay safe kids! Risk society-framing over COVID-19 in Instagramberichten van nieuwsprogramma’s voor kinderen,"Mil, Linda van",['Dr. Tom van Hout'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Tijdens de crisis rondom COVID-19 stond berichtgeving in de media in het teken van het communiceren van de mogelijke risico’s van het virus: gezondheidsrisico’s, het aantal overleden personen en het wegvallen van ieders sociale leven. Bij het weergeven van rampen of crisissituaties in de media kan sprake zijn van de constructie van een zogenaamde risk society. Hierbij kunnen burgers het gevoel krijgen deel uit te maken van een maatschappij waarin geen controle bestaat over alles wat er gebeurt. Een dergelijke risicomaatschappij is dus een sociaal construct en kan gestuurd worden door media en overheden. De media kunnen het gevoel van leven in risico versterken, bijvoorbeeld door framing. Dit onderzoek geeft antwoord op de vraag ‘Hoe wordt COVID-19 geframed als risk society op Instagramaccounts van nieuwsprogramma’s voor kinderen?’ In het onderzoek worden Instagramberichten van de programma’s NOS Jeugdjournaal, Karrewiet en Logo! onderworpen aan een visuele framinganalyse. Aan de hand van theorie over frames in een risk society, kenmerken van een risk society en productiewaarden van het maken van nieuws voor kinderen, toont het onderzoek hoe de berichten bijdragen aan de sociale constructie van risico’s rondom COVID-19. Ook wordt geanalyseerd hoe dit samengaat de nieuwswaardes die bestaan in de weergave van nieuws voor kinderen. De resultaten van onderzoek verklaren dat risico enerzijds geframed wordt als iets wat ruimte biedt voor innovatie en waar een oplossing voor bestaat. Anderzijds draagt framing juist bij aan het idee dat de crisis veel risico’s met zich meebrengt: de berichtgeving wordt gekenmerkt door dramatisering en angst. Er is sprake van victimisering en anonimisering waarbij werkende burgers, mensen uit het buitenland en kinderen worden geframed alsof ze onzichtbaar zijn. Daarbij worden ze ook als slachtoffer van de crisis geframed. Dit in tegenstelling tot politici, media, wetenschappers en beroemdheden.

Conspiracy Theories as Critique of Ideology,"Faassen, Eric",['dr. R. Uljée'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Filosofie (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The current situation with regard to the covid-19 pandemic has given rise to an explosion of new conspiracy theories within the public debate. It is claimed that the virus was artificially created by the Chinese government to use as a weapon, that it is used as a ploy by our own government to secretly install harmful 5G radiation towers and that the vaccine against the virus contains a microchip by Bill Gates to track and control us. How do these wildly different stories relate? In this essay we will investigate what they have in common and how they work. Instead of simply dismissing conspiracy theories as lunacy, we will try to understand them and examine their claims and purpose. What exactly do they claim and why? Such a serious investigation into the concept of conspiracy theories is needed, as they do often seem to contain a kernel of truth. Conspiracy theories are rightly suspicious of authorities and the knowledge that is provided by these authorities. We will investigate this suspicion and evaluate conspiracy theories. Most importantly, we will be focusing on the link between conspiracy theories and ideology. How do conspiracy theories resemble social theory that cites ideology as a factor, and are we justified to say that conspiracy theories embody a critique of ideology?","['Conspiracy theory', 'ideology', 'epistemic authority']"
The Act of Return: Return of the Cultural Treasures From the Netherlands to Indonesia between Independence and present days,"Rubene, Olesja",['Prof.dr. M.J. Klokke'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,South and Southeast Asian Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The debate of restitution and the return of cultural treasures has been a hot topic in international media in recent years. France, Germany, the Netherlands and most recently, Belgium are the European countries that are trying to address these challenging questions from a different perspective. Undoubtedly, the return of cultural heritage is a complex and emotionally loaded subject for all the parties involved. For instance, in 2020 Congolese activist Mwazulu Diyabanza Siwa Lemba and his ‘comrades’ from the organization Unité Dignité Courage (UDC) took these matters literally in their own hands. They attempted to ‘restitute’ objects from three French museums: a museum in Marseille, Quai Branly, and Louvre in Paris, as well as from Afrika Museum in Berg en Dal, the Netherlands. From Afrika museum, Mwazulu Diyabanza took a wooden statue and live-streamed this attempt on the internet. Later, in 2021, he was charged by a court of Nijmegen. He has more pending court cases in France regarding the same acts of vigilantism. While for ‘outsiders’ this is an act of crime and an attempt of theft, UDC sees it as a noble deed of taking back what was ‘stolen’ from Africa by colonialists. The organization frames it as an act of ‘free speech’. News outlets semi-ironically labeled the Congolese activist ‘the Robin Hood of the restitution’.","['restitution', 'return', 'post-colonialism', 'Prajnaparamita', 'Diponegoro', 'Nusantara', 'NMVW', 'Museum Volkenkunde', 'colonial collections']"

The Strategic Use of Conceptual Metaphors in the Inaugural Addresses of US Republican and Democratic Presidents (2001-2021) A Critical Discourse Analysis,"Moor, Nicky",['Dr. J.V. Jeffery'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Metaphors are linguistic, rhetorical devices that have the ability to increase effectiveness of the perception by adding comprehensibility and relatability, thus boosting persuasion. Strategic manoeuvring by means of metaphor in political speeches is quite common, yet, only little awareness exists on the subject, especially in the political realm, which is why it is crucial to increase knowledge on this subject. The general purpose of this study is to increase knowledge of the strategic use of metaphors of US Republican and Democratic presidents’ inaugural speeches in the past 20 years, employing Critical Discourse Analysis to address how the strategic use of metaphors compares between the (first) inaugural addresses of President G.W. Bush, President Obama, President Trump, and President Biden, and how these metaphors function. The metaphors in the speeches were identified using existing literature and Lakoff’s Master Metaphor List (1991). Findings revealed that all four presidents’ most frequent conceptual metaphors were the journey, object, building, and war metaphors, which may be explained by both their high rate of conventionalisation and their exceptional rhetorical properties. Furthermore, the Democratic presidents used more different types of metaphors than the Republican presidents did. The Democratic and Republican Presidents used roughly the same number of metaphors relative to their speeches’ word counts. A follow-up analysis may help gain insights on whether voters’ perceptions of presidents are influenced by the inaugural addresses and the role of metaphors and other rhetorical tools in the political genre.","['Critical Discourse Analysis', 'President Bush', 'President Obama', 'President Trump', 'President Biden', 'conceptual metaphor', 'inaugural address', 'strategic manoeuvring', 'rhetoric']"
Making Sense of AGRA: Philanthrocapitalist Development Strategies for the Smallholders of Africa: Does the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa stand a chance of achieving its goals of food security and smallholder empowerment?,"Hargreaves, Matthew","['Henderson, C.V']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study explores the central research question of whether the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) stands a chance in achieving their self-prescribed goals of poverty alleviation and smallholder empowerment in Africa. To answer this question, I build a theoretical framework based on two agricultural development theories: agroecology and agribusiness development. This theoretical background allows for the empirical analysis of AGRA to take place with a specific focus on the program’s work in Kenya. I find overwhelmingly that AGRA is unlikely to achieve their goals of food security and smallholder empowerment due to their direct provision for the needs of agribusiness at the expense of smallholder sovereignty and autonomy. These findings show that AGRA is unequivocally shaped by legacy of the original Green Revolution, where marketisation, privatisation and profit incentives were pushed upon smallholders in the global south. After reaching this conclusion, I necessarily discuss the implications of AGRA as a failing philanthrocapitalist project, by drawing attention to the unique lack of accountability AGRA holds as part of a broader movement in privatising foreign aid. AGRA represents a threat to the future of smallholder livelihoods in Africa as it operates unchecked, protected by charitable narratives, all while serving corporate profit rather than smallholder farmers.","['AGRA', 'Philanthrocapitalism', 'Africa', 'Agricultural Development', 'Input-intensive farming', 'development goals']"

English and Sranan modals in simple sentences: a Comparative Analysis,"Mathurin, Darischa","['Liptak, A.K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis discusses and analyses the commonalities and disparities in syntax between English as a superstrate and Sranan, an English-based pidgin that is now a creole. As freed slaves and new generations of native speakers have continued using the creole, it has separated itself from the original context as a pidgin dependent on English lexicon and grammar. The study conducted for the thesis functioned as an opportunity to learn how modern-day Sranan modal expressions help demonstrate tense in simple clauses compared to modern-day English modals. The comparative analysis was based on the Burton-Roberts analytic methodology (2016), including syntactic trees, to aid in visualising relations between clauses and within phrases. A native speaker was interviewed to gain practical and implemental knowledge about the translations used in the analysis. Since English was the superstrate for Sranan, the sentences were translated from English to Sranan to ensure non-variable sentences with modals for comparison. After these translations, the syntactic structure of simple clauses, including modals in both languages, were compared, focusing on how modals may facilitate the specification of tense. A comparative analysis of English and Sranan simple declarative and interrogative clauses was conducted to discover potential patterns. These analyses revealed patterns in the simple clauses and verb phrases in English and Sranan that were influenced by modality. Each analysis demonstrated overlap and contrast between the languages in tense marking and verb inflection. By the end of the thesis, it becomes clear that, in English, there are differences in word order in clauses. English verb phrases can contain auxiliary and lexical verbs that influence tense in declarative and interrogative sentences. However, in Sranan, word order does not change in either declarative or interrogative sentences. Additionally, Sranan does not use auxiliary and lexical verbs in clauses to indicate tense, using tense markers instead to imply timeframe. Based on the results of the comparative analysis, it can be concluded that Sranan modals function differently than English modals in verb phrases and clauses. As Sranan modals do not directly influence tense, there is a need for another functional class, in this case, tense markers.","['English', 'Sranan', 'Modals', 'Verb Phrase', 'Comparative Analysis']"

The rapidly advancing multi-media and technological environment gives each citizen with a mobile phone the capacity to record their experience and share it instantly with the world via the internet yet the gradually disappearing cultural identity of the Iteso remains under researched. This multimodal work provides insight into Iteso cultural identity by archiving and analysing the Iteso traditional music and performance corpus, finding alternatives to ensure continuity of Iteso Knowledge in this error where the oral traditions are vanishing while urbanization and internationalization evict younger Iteso generations from their local villages of socialization with a promise of a better and modern life The introduction gives you insights into my main questions, purpose, motivation for this as well as my justification for this research. Chapter 3 is my methodology while in Chapter 4, I give a summary of the corpus in my video story plus some featured traditional instruments and a link to my findings in form of a video story in which I give answers to most of my research questions. I elaborate the question of Iteso identity in terms of origin, migration, basic characteristics, dressing, evolving, marriage customs, political structure, food and majoring on their music in relation to my own personal journey as an Iteso musician who left my village 20 years ago yet doing my best to keep in contact with my roots. In chapter 5, I draw conclusions and recommendations including the reality that Iteso culture could disappear with the next 50 years, yet there is no need to worry or merely complaining about this erosion, instead, we should maximize technology to archive a hybrid form of orality making it available in all modern formats, the “the internet never forgets”! Whereas a post-colonial renewal of Iteso cultural identity and knowledge is slowly happening as myself and my partners are establishing new avenues of reviving Iteso cultural music through Akogo Festival, Africa Safari Festival as well as my continuous archival research and music tours, I recommend more Afrocentric and citizen research to cover all aspects of the Iteso society. Also pertinent is a revival in the Iteso chieftaincy to drift away from English structuring and naming of Iteso a sacred organization that symbolizes Iteso pride, they should abandone the Iteso cultural union brand and adopt Ateker Iteso or concentrate on Einos Iteso Kopitane. A symbol of Iteso pride should be in Ateso not foreign languages","['African culture', 'African Music', 'Iteso', 'Ugandan Culture', 'Kenyan Culture', 'Cultural music']"

"China's Soft Power, Dutch Media and the Netherlands' China Strategy - A Media Analysis","Swaanen, Benedicte",['Karen Smith'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, the People’s Republic of China’s power has increased globally. However, China still experiences issues in relation to its soft power, which can be described as a country’s ability to attract and appeal through which one is able to persuade and get what they wish for. This recently has led to a deterioration of several of China’s bilateral relations, yet the Dutch government has expressed a desire to continue close cooperation with China. The 2019 Netherlands’ China policy calls for a more nuanced view of China and states that the Netherlands should cooperate with China where possible, while safeguarding the Netherlands interests and values. As China seems to have soft power issues within Western Europe, it can be questioned whether the policy actually aligns with the general perception of China within the Netherlands, as this alignment is generally expected within a democracy. In order to determine whether this is the case, a qualitative descriptive study has been conducted and a Dutch media content analysis has been performed. Research findings indicated that, while China was generally perceived negatively within the media and public opinion, the Netherlands’ China policy was much more neutral. Conclusions that can be drawn from these findings are that government policies may not necessarily reflect public opinion and that soft power might not actually be as important as frequently is assumed. Furthermore, it indicates that it might not be as important for a country like China to have soft power amongst the general public, as to be positively perceived within a country’s government.",

Diversiteit in het gebruik van stockfoto’s: Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar de diversiteit in stockfoto’s geselecteerd door beeldredacteuren op Nederlandse nieuwsredacties,"Boumann, Tamya","['Burger, J.P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,Deze scriptie onderzoekt de selectie van stockbeeld onder beeldredacteuren werkzaam bij Nederlandse nationale nieuwsmedia. Er is tegenwoordig steeds vaker kritiek op het functioneren van de media als het gaat om representatie. Dit onderzoek maakt inzichtelijk hoe beeldredacteuren het streven naar meer diversiteit en het selecteren van stockfoto’s ervaren. In dit onderzoek wordt er gelet op de selectie van beeld door beeldredacteuren als het gaat om diversiteit in de media. Het gaat in deze scriptie om stockfoto’s die online gebruikt worden door beeldredacteuren. Hierbij wordt de volgende hoofdvraag behandeld: Hoe selecteren beeldredacteuren werkzaam op Nederlandse nationale nieuwsredacties de diversiteit in stockfoto’s? Om beter in kaart te brengen hoe beeldredacteuren op bepaalde keuzes komen als het gaat om de selectie van beeld staat de theorie van Othering’ en ‘Gatekeeping’ staat in deze scriptie centraal. Het onderzoek is gebaseerd op een combinatiemethode van diepte-interviews en een praktische opdracht onder tien beeldredacteuren werkzaam bij Nederlandse nationale nieuwsmedia. Door middel van semigestructureerde interviews en een praktische opdracht onderzoekt deze scriptie de ervaringen van beeldredacteuren omtrent stockfoto’s en de representatie van de ‘ander’. Deze methodes geven inzicht in de ervaring van beeldredacteuren en ook meer duidelijkheid hoe zij te werk gaan. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat er in het algemeen consensus is over wat beeldredacteuren vinden dat diversiteit inhoudt. Volgens de beeldredacteuren is het zo dat het onderwerp van diversiteit en (stock)beeld steeds vaker op de agenda van redacties. Als het gaat om het beleid op redacties en de selectie van diversiteit in stockbeeld dan wordt er in het algemeen geen beleid uitgevoerd op de redactie. Er wordt vooral gesproken over de redactiecultuur en eigen beweegredenen als het gaat om de selectie van diversiteit in stockfoto's.,"['Journalistiek', 'fotojournalistiek', 'beeldredacteuren', 'diversiteit', 'inclusiviteit', ""stockfoto's""]"

For this single case-study, process-tracing of the negotiation, ratification, and implementation process of the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed in 2015 is conducted. The agreement is officially based on the pursuit of common values. Kazakhstan, as a cooperative authoritarian regime, shows high willingness to work closely together with the EU and to adapt to its view on democratic values. However, human rights violations from the part of the Kazakh government and state authorities do not seem to slow down the negotiation and implementation process of this important agreement. Alongside the process-tracing of the EPCA negotiations, the actorness of both Kazakhstan and the EU is analyzed. Finally, the research concludes that pragmatic interests from the EU side are predominant and that the adherence to values is not taken as a condition but rather as an objective. Doing so, the EU Parliament pursues a more value-based approach compared to the more pragmatic and encouraging behavior of the Council of the EU, the Commission, and the EU External Action Service. Moreover, integrating values in the cooperation is convenient for the reputation-conscious Kazakh government.","['EU External Relations', 'EU-Kazakhstan Relations', 'Post-liberalism', 'Cooperative Authoritarian Regime', 'Central Asia']"

While a specific motivation can be hard to pinpoint, the economic diplomacy tools they used are identifiable from agreements, public correspondence by officials or news articles that discuss reactions to the projects. Considering the case studies and the blueprints of the Free and Open Indo Pacific strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative, it is possible to conclude that Japan follows with the FOIP nearly the same or at least a very similar strategy to the BRI of China. The case studies do not always remain within the established movements of the BRI and FOIP in the used framework. The movements are along the axes of economic diplomacy primarily are between commercial and trade diplomacy. China in particular shows that it is willing to go further than Japan with using the tools of commercial diplomacy. Moreover, China is also willing to go further than Japan if they are not getting a formal participation in the BRI from another country, compared to the FOIP.","['BRI', 'FOIP', 'economic diplomacy', 'Belt and Road', 'Free and Open Indo-Pacific', 'Japan', 'China']"

"Estne Semen Sanguis Christianorum? Martyrdom, Noble Death and the Christianization of the Roman Empire","Smit, Olaf",['Jürgen Zangenberg'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In older scholarship, it was often claimed that Christian martyrdom contributed significantly to the conversion of the Roman Empire. This assertion, however, has been significantly criticized in recent decades, so that conversion in response to witnessing acts of Christian martyrdom now appears to have been relatively minor. In order to both elaborate on and critically evaluate these criticisms, the present thesis compares a number of Christian and ‘pagan’ texts from the second and third centuries CE that deal with martyrdom and/or ‘noble death’. While the thesis pays attention to issues surrounding the scale on which martyrdom occurred and the extent to which witnessing the torture and execution of Christians may have inspired conversion, its main focus is on the importance of martyr texts to the Christianization of the Roman Empire. ‘Christianization’ here is used in a more general sense, and includes not only conversion, but also the formation of Christian (group)identity and the catechesis of new members. With regards to the possibility of Christian texts being used to convert outsiders or instruct the newly-initiated, the thesis works from the assumption that these ‘pagan’ audiences would have been more likely to adopt a favourable view of Christian martyrdom – and perhaps concomitantly, Christianity – insofar as its (literary) representations presented it as similar to noble death. Simultaneously, the thesis argues that Christian martyr texts contain several unique elements, principally religious in character, that allowed them to out-live ‘pagan’ noble death traditions like that of the Acta Alexandrinorum. These shared and unique aspects are recovered through an in-depth analysis and comparison of a number of Christian and ‘pagan’ texts. All in all, the findings of the thesis generally agree with earlier revisionist publications, and suggest that conversion induced by martyrdom was rare, and that the importance of martyr texts to Early Christianity mostly lay in their ability to provide Christian groups with powerful communities identities and moral exemplars.","['Martyrdom', 'Noble Death', 'Christianization', 'Christianity', 'Roman Empire', 'Tertullian', 'Perpetua', 'Polycarp', 'Acta Alexandrinorum']"

The effect of empty pause manipulations on the perception of competency-based trustworthiness of native and non-native speech; using different levels of implied expertise,"Meijden, Tessa van der","['Jong, N.H. de']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Trust is an important aspect of daily-life communication. We decide whether to trust someone based on just a face or a voice. Trust is part of credibility and is invariably connected to expertise. Previous research on credibility, expertise and trustworthiness has shown the impact of disfluencies on all three aspects. However, it has often focused only on native speech, and never used the duration of empty pauses as a fluency measure. The current study investigated the effect of empty pause manipulations in both native and non-native speech on perceived competency-based trustworthiness in two scenarios, differing in the level of expertise. Recordings of a native and a non-native speaker were manipulated phonetically, which resulted in two conditions: long empty pauses (LongPauses) and no empty pauses (NoPauses). The perceived competency-based trustworthiness of the speakers was measured using a 5-point likert-scale, based on McCroskey’s (1966) authoritativeness scale. Results indicated a significant effect for scenario and an interaction effect between scenario and nativeness. Post-hoc t-tests showed that the native speaker was perceived as significantly less trustworthy than the non-native speaker in the non-expert scenario. Second post-hoc t-tests showed that the native speaker was perceived as significantly more competency-based trustworthy in the expert scenario, than in the non-expert scenario. This same effect was not found for the non-native speaker. Follow-up questions showed that listeners in the native group indicated that the implied expertise in the scenarios did affect their judgements of the speaker, while the listeners in the non-native group indicated it did not.","['Competency-based trustworthiness', 'communication', 'perceived competency-based trustworthiness', 'native speech', 'non-native speech', 'speech fluency', 'empty pause durations', 'authoritativeness scale', 'implied expertise', 'expert scenario', 'non-expert scenario']"

De Volkskrant als linksgeoriënteerd medium heeft een merkbare afkeer van Wilders en Baudet en zoekt de confrontatie op. De Telegraaf is een rechts kanaal dat minder moeite heeft met de ideologieën van de rechtspopulisten, de krant neemt een gematigde positie in ten opzichte van de uitingen van de politici. Opvallend is dat de FvD-leider aan het begin van de onderzoeksperiode nog een relatieve onbekende is en weinig aandacht trekt, terwijl Wilders vrijwel de gehele periode stabiel het nieuws beheerst. De bevindingen van dit onderzoek tonen aan dat de uitingen van Wilders en Baudet passen in de rechtspopulistische theorie en de werking van de hedendaagse media beide politici in staat stelt te scoren en te agenderen.",
"Sérieux, les jeunes kiffent total un langage grave stylé ! L’emploi de l’adjectif à la place de l’adverbe en -ment lui correspondant.","Cuchet, Sylvie","['Doetjes, J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,fr,"Les jeunes utilisent une forme de langage qui leur est propre et en perpétuelle mutation, qualifiée souvent de langage jeune. Ce faisant, ils constituent un facteur important de changement linguistique. Les études existantes démontrent l’existence de ce phénomène en se concentrant sur les jeux sur le lexique comme le verlan, la troncation ou l’emprunt à d’autres langues. Ce mémoire porte sur ce qui semble constituer un jeu morphosyntaxique très présent dans le langage jeune contemporain, celui de la recatégorisation, et plus particulièrement la recatégorisation de l’adjectif en adverbe. On rencontre en effet fréquemment l’emploi de certains adjectifs à la place des adverbes en - ment leur correspondant (j’ai total planté à la place de j’ai totalement planté). J’identifie dans ce travail 15 adjectifs autorisant cet emploi. Je démontre qu’il s’agit de cas de recatégorisation et non d’apocopes et classe les 15 adjectifs en 2 groupes en fonction de leur rôle dans la phrase. Pour 8 d’entre eux, utilisés comme adverbes d’intensité, et sur lesquels porte la majeure partie de ce travail, je propose que la recatégorisation soit le moyen choisi par les jeunes pour se créer de nouveaux marqueurs d’intensité percutants, selon le besoin constant, largement reconnu dans la littérature, de renouvellement de cette classe de mots. Pour les 7 autres adjectifs adverbialisés, dont les correspondants en -ment sont des adverbes de manière verbaux, je suggère que leur emploi (se laver rapide ou faire quelque chose tranquille) engendre un transfert de modification du verbe vers le sujet et que cela pourrait s’insérer dans une dynamique plus large de besoin d’expression par le locuteur de son attitude face à l’action, besoin créé par un emploi intensif des émoticônes.","['Langage jeune', 'jeu morphosyntaxique', 'adjectif', 'adverbe', 'intensité', 'changement linguistique', 'recatégorisation']"

The Psychological Roots of Ecologically Destructive Consumptive Behaviour: Ecological Alienation and Self-Alienation,"Mourits, Rebecca",['Jan Sleutels'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"Humanity’s excessive consumptive behaviour is the primary cause of ecological destruction. Yet, neither lowering consumption nor production levels seem to be addressed in environmental policies and thus remain notably high. Therefore, this dissertation investigates the psychological roots of humanity’s ecologically destructive consumptive behaviour. My hypothesis is that ecological alienation and self-alienation are the main, compounding factors of ecologically destructive consumptive behaviour. Ecological alienation leads to devaluation of nature. As environmental values are paramount to sustainability-driven behaviour, devaluation of nature decreases the prevalence of such behaviour. Additionally, I argue that humanity’s excessive consumption is driven by consumptive addiction whereby individuals substitute their authentic physical, mental and emotional needs with consumption; and that this consumptive addiction is rooted in self-alienation. I suggest that ecological alienation and self-alienation are themselves rooted in the modern industrial worldview and its related value systems, and that these factors influence and reinforce each other. Ultimately, what is necessary to counter ecologically destructive addictive consumptive behaviour might be exactly what runs the risk of being indefinitely destroyed because of it: humanity’s reconnection with nature.","['philosophy', 'psychology', 'ecology', 'nature', 'ecological destruction', 'ecological alienation', 'self-alienation', 'consumption', 'addiction', 'consumptive addiction', 'trauma', 'stress', 'alienation', 'self', 'other', 'inferior other', 'maté', 'hegel', 'beauvoir', 'sartre', 'levinas', 'values', 'environmentalism', 'deep ecology', 'needs', 'authentic needs', 'desires', 'indigenous', 'modern industrial', 'capitalism', 'covid-19']"

(Unborn) Black Lives Matter: The Black Pro-Life Movement and Racial Justice Activism in 21st Century America,"Oosten, Isabel van","['Pargas, D.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the United States, the abortion rate of black women is almost five times higher than for white women. The black pro-life movement preaches against abortion by claiming it is a tool for black genocide, committed by the largest abortion provider Planned Parenthood. They argue that abortions are marketed towards minority communities as part of population control policies. By linking abortion to racism, black pro-life organizations have combined racial justice activism with pro-life activism. This study focuses on two major black pro-life organizations: LEARN, founded by Reverend Clenard Childress, and The Radiance Foundation, founded by Ryan Scott Bomberger. By analyzing their online content on websites, social media and other online appearances, this thesis sets forth an analysis of the organizations’ positioning towards other racial justice activism movements such as the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Lives Matter Movement. The black pro-life organizations position themselves significantly more positively towards the Civil Rights Movement than the Black Lives Matter Movement. Due to overlapping religious ideology, the black pro-life organizations align their own racial justice activism with the Civil Rights Movement and frame themselves as the true civil rights successors. The Black Lives Matter Movement is not faith-based, more radically pro-abortion, and adheres to fundamentally different principles than the conservative pro-life organizations, resulting in the black pro-life movement rejecting the Black Lives Matter racial justice activism as hypocritical and contradictory to the civil rights legacy.",

De Telegraaf is een rechts kanaal dat minder moeite heeft met de ideologieën van de rechtspopulisten, de krant neemt een gematigde positie in ten opzichte van de uitingen van de politici. Opvallend is dat de FvD-leider aan het begin van de onderzoeksperiode nog een relatieve onbekende is en weinig aandacht trekt, terwijl Wilders vrijwel de gehele periode stabiel het nieuws beheerst. De bevindingen van dit onderzoek tonen aan dat de uitingen van Wilders en Baudet passen in de rechtspopulistische theorie en de werking van de hedendaagse media beide politici in staat stelt te scoren en te agenderen.","['Framing', 'nationale identiteit', 'rechtspopulisme', 'Geert Wilders', 'Thierry Baudet']"
Partnership Peacekeeping: African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM),"Verwaal, Isa","['Smith, K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the peacekeeping partnership between the African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN), in the context of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). It investigates the question: “How did the AU and the UN institutional (in)compatibility impact the effectiveness of AMISOM?” Both the practical and executive sides of the institutions involved, and the congruence between the mandate, resources, and activities undertaken are considered when evaluating the effectiveness of the mission. This is done using the congruence component of the analytical framework of Effectiveness of Peace Operations Network (EPON). This part of the framework describes the strategic intent, mandate and aims to understand whether the mission has achieved its mandated tasks, and the extent to which there was consensus about this among various stakeholders. While the mission had a clear mandate, the main form of logistical support, the United Nations Support Office for AMISOM (UNSOA), was not designed to do its job. Mainly because it had roots in the UN’s bureaucratic system, UNSOA was never able to meet the expectations of the mandate and objectives of AMISOM. The partnership between the AU and the UN was born out of the mutual recognition that alone, neither of them could cope with the multitude of security challenges facing Somalia. The mission had a peace-enforcement nature but was unable to successfully carry out its mandate and objectives because of the limitation of using peacekeeping logistics. The inability of overcoming the institutional differences between the two organizations has led to the failure to accomplish the mission’s mandate and the additional objectives and has led to an ineffective peacekeeping partnership that was not successful in living up to its full potential. For future peacekeeping partnerships, this means that working on a more equal and consistent relationship between the AU and the UN will likely improve the effectiveness of the collaboration and the mandate, objectives, and activities of the mission.","['peacekeeping', 'partnership peacekeeping', 'institutional (in)compatibility', 'AMISOM', 'United Nations', 'African Union']"

Osmaanse en Turkse Mannelijkheden in Diriliş: Ertuğrul,"Janssen, Rik","['Theunissen, H.P.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The Turkish TV series Diriliş: Ertuğrul has received worldwide media attention for its political-ideological implementation and its international viewership. This is especially interesting since the series responds to contemporary issues. That is why I wondered how masculinity is presented in the series. This study addresses the question to which extent Ottoman or Turkish ideas on manhood influence masculine ideals. Firstly, I will give an overview of the pre-modern Ottoman male ideal, focusing on the image of the sultan and discussing the impact of dervishes. I will continue discussing the modern ideal man in the late Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic. This era shows a change from Islamic masculinity to a more nationalistic interpretation; however, similarities continue to exist, mainly the dominant and militaristic masculine ideal. In the final chapter, I will discuss the presentation of masculinity in the series. The impact of masculinity is supported by the consequences of the series and the reactions of viewers. This presentation of masculinity is compared to pre-modern Ottoman and modern Ottoman/Turkish manhood, showing that Ertuğrul embodies a combination of male values both from the Ottoman-Islamic and nationalist-modern periods. The outcome shows potential for further research into modern Islamic masculinities.",

I refer to Frantz Fanon's theoretical narrative of the psychological alienation of (former) colonial subjects to construct my analytical framework, to examine the works of Fukuzawa Yukichi, Tawada Yōko and Mizumura Minae. In the case of Fukuzawa, one of the leading intellectuals in Meiji Japan, I unfold the complexity of local intellectual response to the invasion of Western civilization, to offer an overview of the historical background. In the case of Tawada and Mizumura, two distinctive figures in contemporary Japanese literature characterized by their transcultural writing that transgresses conventionally defined boundaries, I examine the theme of alienation and the distortion of identity in a situation where a Japanese is placed in confrontation with the overwhelming force of Western culture, as presented in their works.In my analysis, I hope reveal the resemblance between the situation that the authors in question deal with and the experience of the black population as is portrayed in Fanon's text, which hopefully would draw attention to the complicated picture of (post)colonial experience in Japan.","['Fanonism', 'contemporary Japanese literature', 'postcolonial alienation', 'cultural decolonization']"

The speaker at the centre of the case study is a Dutch learner of English, and she is observed in conversation with three different interlocutors: one British (interlocutor A), one Dutch (interlocutor B) and one American (interlocutor C). Among the results were three notable shifts in the speaker’s speech behaviour; two were related to pronunciation and concerned her realisation of certain vowels and the postvocalic /r/, the final one was a shift in register or choice of words. There were no instances of accommodation found in the other examined variables. This shows how for an individual, there may be some areas of speech in which communication accommodation will occur more rapidly than in others.","['communication accommodation theory', 'convergence', 'second language acquisition', 'Dutch', 'social identity theory']"

Deze traditie, waarmee in 1986 werd aangevangen, was een reactie op de hoge werkloosheid in die tijd. Meer nog dan in andere Westerse landen werd in Nederland de economie bovendien gezien als een exacte wetenschap, die door middel van modellen accuraat de toekomst zou kunnen voorspellen. Maar er lagen wel degelijk ideologische veronderstellingen aan de basis van de modellen van het planbureau. Sinds de jaren '70 had daar een omslag plaatsgevonden van Keynesiaanse naar neoklassieke modellen. De toenemende invloed van de doorrekeningen in campagnetijd liet partijen echter weinig keuze: om serieus genomen te worden, moest je wel doorrekenen. Dit faciliteerde zowel de 'no-nonsense' managerspolitiek van de kabinetten-Lubbers, als de gedepolitiseerde consensuspolitiek van Paars. Tegelijkertijd leidden deze bestuurdersmentaliteit en het gebrek aan strijd in de politiek tot de Fortuynrevolte van 2002.","['Centraal Planbureau', 'economische planning', 'neoklassieke economie', 'neoliberalisme', 'consensuspolitiek', 'Ruud Lubbers', 'Wim Kok', 'Pim Fortuyn']"

The banker's banker: Hope & Co. and the credit crisis of 1772-1773,"Geest, Patrick van der","['Antunes, C.A.P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I examine the interaction between the business strategy of the Amsterdam banking house Hope & Co. from 1756-1780 and the credit crisis of 1772-1773. Hope & Co. played a central role in the unfolding of this historical event, whereas on the other hand, the crisis had a decisive impact on the Hopes’ business strategy. Before the credit crisis, the Hopes operated prudently and consistently, and the firm acted as a market-regulating institution. However, in the runup to the crisis, Hope & Co. became increasingly involved in large-scale financial speculation in London and Amsterdam. Subsequently, in the aftermath of the crisis, the Hopes returned to a strategy of caution. They diversified their business portfolio by investing in the loan sector and gradually shifted from mercantile activities to financial services. Moreover, as the last major family firm in Amsterdam, Hope & Co. affirmed its market-regulating role, henceforth becoming the banker’s banker. This thesis emphasises the importance of credit governance structures for the resilience of markets and merchant communities. The fact that Hope & Co. established itself as a market-regulating institution poses a challenge to new institutional economics. It raises questions on the role of family firms in (the governance of) early modern credit structures.","['Eighteenth century', 'Early modern entrepreneurship', 'Financial crises', 'Business strategies', 'Credit crisis of 1772-1773', 'Amsterdam', 'Hope & Co.']"

"""A Fair Opportunity"" The American Abolitionist Movement and Fugitive Settlement Projects in Canada West in the 1850s","Groeneweg, Willem","['Pargas, D.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the decades prior to the Civil War, several abolitionist initiatives in Canada West led to the founding of independent black agricultural communities. These initiatives generally functioned by setting up a financial fund to buy plots of land from the Canadian government, reselling those to black settlers, many of them fugitives from slavery. This thesis looks at how the three fugitive communities active during the 1850s — the Dawn Settlement, the Elgin Settlement, and the Refugee Home Society’s Settlement — were of importance to the American abolitionist movement, looking at their function in American abolitionist literature. How were the Canadian fugitive communities portrayed in American abolitionist literature and in what ways did they contribute to the goals of the American abolitionist movement in the 1850s? It concludes that fugitives were key to the contribution these communities made to the abolitionist movement, nuancing former depictions of the communities as initiatives mostly informed by American middle class ideals of self-improvement, and shows the importance of taking a transnational perspective in approaching the communities.","['Ontario', 'fugitive communities', 'abolitionism', 'Elgin', 'Buxton', 'Dawn', 'Refugee Home Society', 'Canada', 'Canada West', '1850s', 'Underground Railroad']"

Buitengewone zelfportretten in een veranderende tijd: Zelfportretten van Helene Schjerfbeck,"Geneugelijk, Margreeth",['Dr. J. C.

In de kunsthistorische literatuur over Helene Schjerfbeck komt naar voren dat vooral de persoonlijke omstandigheden van de kunstenaar van invloed zijn geweest bij het vervaardigen van de zelfportretten. In dit werkstuk wordt onderzocht in hoeverre sociaal maatschappelijke omstandigheden en de opkomst van het feminisme deze werken hebben beïnvloed. Het doel hiervan is een breder beeld te schetsen van de factoren die mogelijk van invloed zijn geweest bij het maken van de zelfportretten. Het onderzoek wordt uitgevoerd door middel van historisch en kunsthistorisch onderzoek. Daarnaast is een visuele analyse uitgevoerd van een representatief aantal zelfportretten die een beeld geven van de ontwikkeling en de stijl van de zelfportretten gedurende het leven van de kunstenaar. Conclusie van het onderzoek is dat het veranderend denken over identiteit en het hierbij creëren van een eigen identiteit, terug te zien is in de zelfportretten van Schjerfbeck. Onderzoek over de context toont aan dat het feminisme positieve invloed heeft gehad op de kunstenaar. Representatie, stijl en vormgeving van de zelfportretten vanuit feministische theorieën, levert geen eenduidige conclusie op.
