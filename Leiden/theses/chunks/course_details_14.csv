Trait Hedonic Capacity on Alleviating Negative Emotions through Luxury Consumption and the Effects of a Price Discount,"Yaman, Elif","['Vliek, M.L.W.', 'Van Dijk, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study aims to examine the effects of hedonic goal pursuit on psychological wellbeing operationalized through luxury consumption, as hedonic pleasure is the primary goal consumption (Khan, Dhar, and Wertenbroch, 2004). We will examine (1) the individual differences concerning THC to alleviate negative emotions after an imaginary luxury product purchase and (2) the effects of price discounts on the alleviation of post-purchase negative emotions concerning the high price of luxury products. Furthermore, the effects of THC on purchasing intentions regarding the chosen product and the rumination after the purchase will be studied. The participants (N = 106) were presented with five luxury products to choose one from, and were requested to complete the questionnaire adhering to that chosen product. A mixed-design repeated measures ANOVA with a counterbalanced within-subjects method was conducted to measure these effects. The results indicated that THC predicted postpurchase negative emotions as predicted. Furthermore, discount alleviated post-purchase negative emotions and post-purchase rumination, and increased purchasing intentions towards a chosen luxury product. However, THC’s effects on rumination and purchasing intentions with and without the presence of discount were not captured.","['hedonism', 'consumption', 'luxury goods', 'goal-pursuit', 'priced discount', 'rumination', 'purchasing intentions']"

Predicting Eating Disorder Severity by Combining Intra-Individual Network Models and Machine Learning Models: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Zwieten, Noa van","['Fried, E.', 'Wever, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by extreme symptom heterogeneity within diagnostic categories, which complicates treatment and inherently causes high relapse rates. The ability to predict ED course in individuals would support clinicians in identifying early warning signals of relapse and to intervene accordingly. Traditional approaches have considered EDs as the shared origin of all symptoms which are reflective of a disorder, hindering prediction as it does not allow to unravel mechanisms of symptom progression. Network analysis provides new insights on EDs as it allows to model symptoms as networks of mutually causal relationships. However, most network analysis studies are limited as they only allow for conclusions on group-level at one single time point. By using time series data and intraindividual networks we can incorporate both individual and temporal information yielding insight in within-person variations over time. In this proof-of-concept study, we predicted ED severity using time series and intra-individual network features derived from ecological momentary assessment data in a transdiagnostic ED sample (n = 63). We explored whether time series and network features added to model performance on top of demographic and clinical features using machine learning and what features were most predictive of ED severity. Our findings show no convincing evidence that time series and network features improve predictive accuracy. Nonetheless, some time series and network features were identified as important, highlighting their potential clinical value. We consider our proposed combination of intra-individual networks and machine learning as a starting point towards personalized prediction of psychological outcomes.",

"The development of cut off points for multi dimensional constructs: Comparison of a model based clustering approach to percentile norms, standard scores and normative comparisons","Woestenburg, Dion","['Wilderjans, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Cut-off scores can be useful guides for researchers, clinicians or respondents in interpretating responses on psychometric instruments. Statistical methods involved in the development of cut-off scores are predominantly based on univariate analysis and in the presence of an observable criterion variable or normative sample data. To date, little is known about statistical procedures in defining multiple cutting scores for several latent variables within a multidimensional construct (i.e., subscales of a questionnaire). This study aims to evaluate the discriminatory power of various univariate and multivariate methods in cutting score development, and to explore a model-based clustering approach in setting cut-off scores for (sub)scales of multidimensional questionnaires. The investigated approach aims to cluster the responses on multidimensional constructs by using model-based clustering to classify respondents into ordered groups. Subsequently, cut-off points were identified as the intersection points of kernel density curves between the clusters or as (sub)scale split-rules in predicting cluster membership by the use of classification trees. A simulation study was conducted to compare the methods under medium and large sample sizes, various psychometric circumstances (the magnitude of factor correlations and item loadings), and across simulated homogenous and heterogeneous populations. Results of a simulation study show this model-based cluster approach is often preferred over percentile norms and linear standard scores in terms of discriminatory power, especially in defining two cut-off points. Recommendations for model selection and strategies to obtain cut-off points are given. Future research should focus to integrate the presented methodology into a case study using existing questionnaires to examine substantive implications of the calculated cutting scores. This study gives an overview the commonly known statistical techniques involved in cut-off score attainment, provides a multivariate framework to evaluate the discriminatory power in setting cutting scores, and lays out a promising novel application of model-based clustering in developing cut-off points for multidimensional questionnaires.","['multi-dimensional constructs', 'cut-off points', 'model-based clustering']"

Association between parent and infant attention bias: the role of parental anxiety,"Belt, Stacey van den","['Nimphy, C.', 'Van den Berg, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Anxiety disorders run in families. Therefore it is important to have a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to this familial aggregation of fear. More anxious individuals show more attentional bias and for infants this attentional bias might be a risk factor for anxiety later in life. Therefore this study aimed to investigate whether parental anxiety mediates the association of parental attentional bias and infant attentional bias towards threatening faces. Methods: A cross-sectional research with 220 families invited by the municipality was done. Both parents of the infants filled in the Depression, Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). One of the parents and the infant did an eye-tracking experiment in which they looked at dynamic faces with different emotional expressions. The statistical analysis was done with 187 infants between 5 and 19 months old and their parents. Results: After performing a mediation analysis with PROCESS, against expectations parental attentional bias was not positively related to infant attentional bias towards threatening faces. Also, parental attentional bias was not positively related to parental anxiety. Similarly, parental anxiety was not positively related to infant attentional bias. Discussion: Attentional bias might indicate a greater risk for anxiety in children later in life. Due to mixed findings, future studies should focus on other developmental pathways underlying an attentional bias in infants and its consequences. Also, other possible elements which might underlie an association of attentional bias between parents and infants should be investigated further.",

Effects of Interpretive Signage in Zoos on Visitors’ Conservation Intentions,"Knook, Esra","['Doesum, N. van', 'Weiden, A. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Interpretive signage is the most commonly used channel by zoos to deliver conservation messages to visitors. These signs include aspects of animal biology, lifespan and taxonomy. Research to the effectiveness of interpretive signage in zoos in influencing visitors’ conservation intentions is inconclusive and the link with attention to these signs has not yet been sufficiently investigated. This study examined the relationship between visitors’ attention to signs and conservation intentions and whether this relationship is mediated by visitor’s conservation attitudes. In a correlational design, 200 participants were asked to recall their last zoo visit and answer questions in an online survey. In line with the expectations, the results showed a positive association between visitors’ attention towards interpretive signage and conservation intentions. Visitors’ attitudes towards conservation partially mediated this relationship. It was concluded that when visitors devote attention to on-site interpretive zoo signage, this type of conservation education can be effective in influencing visitors’ intentions towards nature conservation through its influence on attitudes. Possible explanations for the results are discussed and implications for theory and practice are made.","['interpretive signage', 'zoo signage', 'conservation education', 'conservation intention', 'conservation attitude']"

The Effect of Temporal Dynamics in Unconstrained Smartphone Interactions on Premotor Potentials,"Velinov, Luka","['Ghosh, A.', 'Wurm, F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Our current understanding of the neural signals entailing motor preparation is heavily based on tightly controlled laboratory experiments, which studies movement under prohibitively narrow constraints. Despite a large body of literature on motor related cortical potentials (MRCPs), neural motor preparation in real life situations in still poorly understood: Insights from experimental studies often explore movement in low-dynamics contexts, meaning that most aspects of the movement are controlled by the experimental design rather than the participant. However, real life movements are more dynamic and display higher degrees of freedom, such as movement frequency, amplitude, speed, or spontaneity. In this study we address the temporal dynamics of touchscreen taps during unconstrained smartphone use and how they affect premotor EEG potentials. We used hierarchical linear modelling in order to determine how simple dynamics in inter-movement intervals can affect MRCPs. We found movement-preceding spatial and temporal clusters of EEG activity that are significantly affected by intervals to adjacent smartphone touches. Our results indicate that shorter intervals to previous touches result are related to a smaller amplitude of the readiness potential (RP) component, while shorter intervals to following touches are related to increased RP amplitude.",
"The relationship between the interaction of job demands and job control and recovery experiences in employees working from home, and the possible moderating role of boundary control","Hana, Emma","['Verhoeven, C.', 'Wijn, N. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"As previous research shows that recovery experiences have many benefits for employees, it is important to investigate which factors are related to and important for recovery experiences. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the possible moderating role of job control in the relationship between job demands and recovery experiences and in the relationship between job demands and boundary control, and the possible moderating role of boundary control in the relationship between the interaction of job demands and job control and recovery experiences in employees who work from home. It was hypothesized that job control would serve as a moderator in the relationship between job demands and recovery experiences and in the relationship between job demands and boundary control. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that boundary control was positively related to recovery experiences and that boundary control moderates the relationship between the interaction of job demands and job control and recovery experiences positively. There were 151 participants, who were employees who work from home due to COVID-19, with the age of 19 to 66 years who completed an online questionnaire about their job demands, job control, recovery experiences, boundary control and some demographic- and background variables. A multiple hierarchical regression analysis was performed to investigate the four hypotheses. Contrary to the expectations, the results showed that job control did not serve as a moderator in the relationship between job demands and recovery experiences and in the relationship between job demands and boundary control, and boundary control did not serve as a moderator in the relationship between the interaction of job demands and job control and recovery experiences. However, as expected, the results showed that boundary control was positively related to recovery experiences. The present study contributes to the existing literature and to the development of interventions that aim to increase recovery experiences, because it provides evidence for the positive relationship between boundary control and recovery experiences. Future research is needed to investigate this relationship in a longitudinal research design, in order to draw conclusions about the causality of this relationship for the development of interventions.",

For this, we created an online survey and presented respondents with an open-ended question relating to their general worldview and combined different items from conspiracy belief scales that we expected to relate to psychedelic drug users. The results relating to the anthropomorphism questionnaire showed that psychedelic drug use is related to increased anthropomorphism. However, even though this study also showed that anthropomorphism predicts believing in conspiracy theories, psychedelic drug users proved not to be more likely to believe in conspiracy theories than people who have never taken psychedelic drugs before. Responses to our open-ended question showed that many psychedelic drug users tend to be increasingly open-minded and re-evaluate their attitudes or beliefs after their psychedelic experience, but showed no indication of conspiratorial thinking. In contrast to this finding, we also found that an increased frequency of psychedelic drug use did predict conspiratorial thinking. This study gives a very detailed insight into the experiences during and after the use of psychedelic drugs, thereby extending on previous studies investigating psychedelic drug use and its effects.

What ever Happened to Jean Rouch’s 2CV ? Chronicle of a Bricolage in Films and Cars,"Blumberg, Jerome","['Saptari, R.', 'Postma, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Cars have been for years dominating our lives and landscapes and are deeply shaped by our culture. By focusing on a particular car, a 2CV, and its reconstruction, observing and analyzing its social life, as a commodity as well as an object linked to a particular history since it was the former car of anthropologist-filmmaker Jean Rouch, these study and concomitant film contribute to reveal specific aspects of the relationship between man and car, mainly through the concept of bricolage, that Rouch was also familiar with in his filmmaking. The opposition between bricoleur and ingénieur is revisited, through a detailed film-based ethnography with the diverse participants and situations encountered during a three-month fieldwork, in a follow-the-thing type case. Cars are also envisioned as religious objects that have their cathedrals, worshippers and sorcerers. They are machines but they have their part of humanity, that interacts with us. The perspective is enriched by a physical and practical approach to fieldwork shared with participants, and as an actual making together in a practice-led research during the reconstruction of the car. Inspired as well by Jean Rouch’s approach, filmmaking is thus considered a way of acquiring knowledge as well as facilitating a relational fieldwork.",
Assessment of Short-Term Suicide Ideation Predictors Using Ecological Momentary Assessment: A Case Study,"Juricova, Nina","['Nimphy, C.', 'Kivelä, L.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Suicide remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, however, our knowledge on the short-term predictors and short-term fluctuations in suicide ideation and behaviour is limited and has only recently began to be studied. The main objective of this case study was to investigate the associations between suicide ideation and its proximal risk factors and to extend the evidence on the short-term variability of suicide ideation as well as its risk factors. Data was collected using Ecological Momentary Assessment four times a day over 21 days, providing repeated measures of suicide ideation, affective states of sadness, anger, guilt, and shame, cognitions of hopelessness, burdensomeness, and loneliness, social interactions, and stressful events. Actigraphy was used to obtain objective data on sleep parameters. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to investigate the associations with the predictors and concurrent suicide ideation, and variability was assessed using the Root Mean Squared Successive Differences. Our findings suggest that sadness and anger are associated with concurrent suicide ideation. Of note, however, is this relationship between anger and concurrent suicide ideation where increased anger was associated with decreased suicide ideation in our subject. Furthermore, the current study provides additional evidence on the short-term variability in suicide ideation and its proximal risk factors of affective states, cognitions, and sleep. Our findings highlight the need for repeated assessments in clinical and research settings that not only consider severity but also variability of suicide ideation and its risk factors. The current study warrants further replications in large scale samples.",

While some states successfully achieve democratization at an alarmingly fast rate, other states remain stagnated for years, sometimes even decades, ultimately being labeled as failed democratization attempts. Specifically concerning former Soviet Union (USSR) states, many have attempted democratization, yielding vastly different results. Some states, such as Estonia, have successfully democratized, and are now officially considered to be a democratized state. However, other states, such as Moldova, have been unable to progress further towards democratization, plagued by political, social and economic unrest. When looking at the case of Ukraine, we see a similar situation as Moldova—a stagnated process of democratization, plagued by unrest and conflict. However, in the case of Ukraine, there is still a chance at democratization. How will this become so? Why is it that some former USSR states have achieved democratization, while others have fallen behind and stagnated? This thesis will focus on evaluating the role of third-party mediation and Russian interference in the democratization of Ukraine, specifically considering the Eastern Ukrainian War in Donbas. This research will draw from established factors of successful democratization and apply several theories to analyze the impact Russian interference and failure of third-party mediation efforts during a conflict have on these factors. The research finds that Ukraine’s path towards democratization has been stagnated in part due to the failure of credible third-party mediation to monitor Russian aggression and commitment to ceasefire agreements. The visible effects can be seen during, and after, the War in Donbas. This research builds on existing factors of democratization in order to analyze a new argument of why democratization has failed, using the new factors of credible third-party mediation and Russian intervention again the theoretical framework of multidimensional prevention and the commitment problem.",

The relationship between loneliness and the cortisol awakening response: a meta-analysis,"Oostveen, Bauke","['Becker, J.M.', 'Brosschot, J.F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: Loneliness is widely experienced by the population and is related to several negative health effects. These effects may be partly due to enhanced activation of the stress response, despite the lack of frequently occurring stressors in loneliness that are commonly believed to explain stress responses. However, according to a new stress theory (GUTS), the stress response is a default response, which is only turned off when safety cues are present. In loneliness the primary source of social safety is missing, which might explain an increased stress response, which can be measured by looking at the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Purpose: Testing, using meta-analysis, the positive effect of loneliness on the CAR and whether this is moderated by age or duration of loneliness. Methods: Eligible studies were sought using a keyword profile in Web of Science. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to study the relationship between loneliness and the CAR, meta-regression analyses were performed to study the effect of possible moderators. Results: Six studies (n = 1,396) were included in the meta-analysis. No significant positive relationship between loneliness and the CAR was found. Also, no moderating effect of age on the relationship was found. The moderating effect of duration of loneliness could not be studied due to missing information. The results suggested a negative relationship between loneliness and the CAR. Conclusion: Although the hypotheses were not confirmed, several important implications for future research are given, such as the need to incorporate duration of loneliness and conformation to general guidelines in assessing the CAR. Further research is needed to draw definite conclusions about the relation between loneliness and the CAR and about what it means for the GUTS.","['Loneliness', 'CAR', 'GUTS']"

Design: In a pretest-intervention-posttest control group design, 102 students (mean age 18.2 years) participated in either coaching or a regular tutoring period at an institution of vocational education in the Netherlands. Method: Students were randomly assigned to the experimental or control condition. Questionnaires of wellbeing, perceptive inclusion, and attitudes to learning were completed pretest and posttest, while coached students completed an additional two questionnaires of coach and coaching perception. Results: There was a statistical trend in gains of mental health wellness in the experimental group compared to the control group, while the effect of coaching on perceptive inclusion and learning attitudes were not significant. The perception of coaching could predict gains in learning attitudes and perceptive inclusion, and a statistical trend showed perception of coach could predict learning attitudes. Conclusion: Evidence-based coaching methods can be implemented into educational institutions as an intervention to promote mental health wellness, while further research should investigate the importance of coachee perceptions of the experience and their coach to achieve coaching benefits.","['coaching', 'mental health wellbeing', 'perception of inclusion', 'attitudes to learning']"

Therefore, one objective of this study was to thoroughly explore how interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive awareness relate to accuracy in emotion recognition as well as the level of perceived emotional intensity. Another objective was to examine the association between interoceptive awareness and body appreciation. A sample of 99 participants completed a facial emotion recognition task measuring accuracy and intensity ratings of five facial expressions – anger, fear, happiness, sadness, or a neutral expression. Additionally, self-reported measures were used to assess the participants’ interoception and body appreciation. As expected, we found a positive relationship between interoceptive awareness and perceived emotional intensity. However, we could not find a significant positive relationship between the other explored variables. One use of a potential link between interoception and emotion recognition as well as body appreciation could be to assist treatment of clinical conditions. Therefore, we suggest further exploration of this link.","['interoceptive accuracy', 'interoceptive awareness', 'emotion recognition accuracy', 'perceived emotional intensity', 'body appreciation']"

The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a dynamic test of reading and writing in children with and without dyslexia. Additionally, the influence of working memory on learning and reading is investigated. The study uses a pretest-training-posttest experimental design and includes a preliminary investigation of working memory, participants are 78 school-aged children. Test instruments are altered for online administration to comply with covid restrictions. Our findings show that the dynamic test is effective for prosodic awareness, but not for phonemic awareness. No significant differences between children with and without dyslexia were found. In regards to working memory, there is some indication of a relationship between working memory and reading, but the current study provides no support for a relationship between working memory and learning. In order to properly investigate the influence of working memory on reading and learning, more research on these topics should follow as the dynamic test is improved upon.",

Older employee ’s access to Flexible Work Arrangements during work tenure as a means of protect ing Post Retirement Health,"O'Dea, Michael","['Hiele, K. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Recent pension policy reforms in the Netherlands have resulted in the delayed retirement of older workers. Researchers are concerned that this increase in the retirement age will have a detrimental impact on the health of retirees. In light of this, it has become increasingly important to identify organisational strategies that both increase the longevity of employees and safeguard their post-retirement health. Flexible work arrangements are a potential HR policy that could achieve this. This study used data collected as part of the first and second wave of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Pension Panel Survey. Out of 5312 total participants, 2421 retirees were included in this study (m=61, female= 45.9%). We used a conditional change regression analysis to examine the effect of perceived access to work-place flexibility, work-time flexibility and phased retirement during the work tenure on the change in pre- and post-retirement self-perceived health. We interpreted the results as the change effects on pre-retirement self-perceived health Wave 1 to post-retirement self-perceived health Wave 2. We defined effect size according to Cohen’s d (small= 0.2, medium=.05, and large= .08). Scores were coded in the current study so that a higher value indicated a better health status. Our results indicated that phased retirement was associated with a small positive effect on the change in pre- to post-retirement self-perceived health (Cohen’s d = .1719739, t(2456) = 2.08, p < .025). We did not find any evidence to suggest that work-time flexibility (Cohen’s d = -.0507841, t(2456) = -0.18, p < .05) or work-place flexibility (Cohen’s d =.0049062, t(2456) = 0.11 , p < .05) had a significant effect on the change in pre- to post-retirement self-perceived health. Future research should develop a more multilevel understanding of age-related HR policy by examining the impact of organisational climate. We recommend corporations looking to adapt to their ageing workforce should encourage flexible work arrangements that promote a smooth transition into retirement.",

The Influence of Observational Learning on Placebo Analgesia and the Mediating Effect of Pain Expectation,"Arema, Sascha","['van Lennep, H.', 'van Beugen, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"There is an increasing demand from health professionals to develop recommendations about evidence-based and ethical use of placebo effects in the clinical practice, but the underlying mechanisms behind the placebo effect are not all known yet. One of these mechanisms is observational learning, which is the topic of this study. The current research has two research aims. First, the influence of observational learning on the placebo effect is investigated. Second, the mediating effect of pain expectations in the role of observational learning on the placebo effect is studied. Based on previous findings it was expected that observational learning would induce placebo responses and that pain expectations would mediate this effect. Twenty-three healthy students from 18 to 30 years old participated in this study, which was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Placebo analgesia was measured as the difference in pain scores between the activation and the deactivation of a sham device over the course of 18 trials. Pain scores were given on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), with scores between 0 and 10. Placebo analgesia was compared in two groups: an observational learning group and a control group. Both groups received painful stimuli in combination with fake activation ore fake deactivation of a sham device. Participants in the observational learning group watched a video in which a model showed analgesic effects after every pain stimuli when the sham device was activated (ON) but not when the sham device was deactivated (OFF). The control group also got to see a video, but in this video there was no relation between the pain scores of the model and de activation/deactivation of the sham device. The results show that observational learning did not lead to placebo analgesia (F(4.392,92.228) = .557, p = .710). Furthermore, pain expectations did not mediate the relation between observational learning and the placebo effect (b = 0.01, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.10]). These findings contradict previous research that did find a placebo effect induced by observational learning and a mediating role of expectations. Future research should focus on the circumstances in which observational learning does induce a placebo effect. When observational learning does induce placebo responses, the mediating factor of pain expectation should be re-evaluated.","['Placebo Effect', 'Placebo Analgesia', 'Social Learning', 'Observational Learning', 'Pain Expectation']"

Learning that Benefits Others: The Effects of Oxytocin on Prosocial Learning and the Role of Empathy,"Mirheli, Babak","['Fried, E.', 'Jansen, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Humans do not only act to benefit themselves but also others, i.e. they engage in prosocial behavior. This is especially true for people high in empathy. A prerequisite for prosocial behavior is that people learn how to obtain benefits for others (prosocial reinforcement learning). Studies indicate enhancing effects of oxytocin on prosocial behavior; however, little is known about the relationship between oxytocin, learning to benefit others, and empathy. This study investigated the effects of oxytocin on prosocial reinforcement learning and whether these effects differ based on empathic abilities. Method: A double-blind placebo-controlled cross-sectional study was conducted. Healthy male participants (N=28) were administered 24 international units of intranasal oxytocin or a placebo and performed a prosocial learning task in which they could earn a monetary reward for oneself, another person, or no one. Empathy was measured with the online simulation subscale (Reniers et al., 2011). Results: Results revealed no significant difference in prosocial learning when participants received oxytocin or placebo. Further, the effects of oxytocin did not significantly differ when empathy was taken into account. Conclusions: Findings suggest that oxytocin does not facilitate prosocial learning. Further, empathy did not have an influence on the effects of oxytocin on prosocial learning. Although the findings did not provide supportive evidence for the Social Salience Hypothesis (ShamayTsoory & Abu-Akel, 2016), the current study revealed new insights on potential effects of oxytocin on reinforcement learning in a prosocial context considering empathy.","['Prosocial learning', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Oxytocin', 'Empathy']"

Why and when is expert-patient support effective? A randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of expert-patient support in the online treatment of eating disorders,"Verboon, Kyra","['Spinhoven, P.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Many individuals with eating disorders (EDs) do not receive appropriate treatment. It is therefore important to make treatment more accessible. This can be done through online interventions. Online interventions can be enhanced by the use of guidance, e.g., by expert patients. However, little is known about why and when expert-patient support is effective. Objective: The aim of this study was to clarify why and under which conditions expert-patient support may be effective in reducing ED symptomatology. Specifically, self-efficacy was investigated as mediator and perceived similarity as moderator in the relation between offering expert-patient support and ED symptom reduction. Methods: Participants (n=355) were recruited via the websites of Featback, WEET and Proud2Bme and were aged 16 years or older and had self-reported ED symptoms. They were randomized to four conditions: (1) Featback, an online self-help program for eating disorders (2) Weekly expert-patient support via chat or email, (3) combination of Featback and expert-patient support, and (4) waiting list condition. Online assessments were completed at baseline, post-intervention (8 weeks after baseline), and at one-year follow-up. Outcome measures were ED symptoms, self-efficacy and perceived similarity. Results: Self-efficacy was not a mediator and perceived similarity not a moderator in the relation between expert-patient support and ED symptom reduction. However, perceived similarity, which was not correlated with actual similarity, was a predictor of ED symptom reduction: people who felt more similar to their expert patient experienced a greater reduction in ED symptoms. Conclusions: Findings of this study indicate that people who perceive a higher similarity between themselves and the expert patient have less ED symptoms after one year, suggesting that the treatment of EDs can be enhanced by effective employment of expert patients.",
The Power of Words: The Effect of Parental Verbal Threats versus Safety Messages on Child Acquisition of Stranger Avoidance: The Moderating Role of Child Temperament,"Lith, Sophie van","['Aktar, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Social anxiety loads in families. In the present study, we focus on verbal threat and safety information from parents to their children as a potential pathway in the parent-tochild transmission of anxiety. We used avoidance behavior towards strangers to measure the child's reaction to the verbal transmission of anxiety. We aimed to explore whether children with higher levels of fearful temperament show more avoidance behavior towards the strangers after receiving verbal threat information. Methods: Children between 4 and 6 years old (N= 68) participated in the study. The children were accompanied by their primary caregiver (63 mothers). The manipulation consisted of the primary caregiver priming the children with threat/safety information about the two strangers. Avoidance behavior was observed during the interaction task, which consisted of a short conversation with two strangers after manipulation. Results: The findings reveal that verbal threat information regarding strangers provided by their caregivers did not significantly increase avoidance behavior in children and there was no support for the idea that children with a more fearful temperament show more avoidance behavior towards strangers paired with threat information. Conclusion: The current study expands the current knowledge of the effect of verbal threat information from parent to child by showing that parental verbal threat or safety information did not alter their children’s avoidance of strangers. Furthermore, the current study contributes to previous research by showing that the influence of verbal information about strangers from parents to their children are not irrespective of behavioral inhibition levels.",

The Effects of Parental Attachment on Internalising Problems in Adolescents with a Parental Chronic Medical Condition,"Holloway, Joseph","['Aktar, E.', 'Sieh, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Internalising problems in adolescents with a parental chronic medical condition have been associated with many predictive factors. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of parent attachment on internalising problems and specifically anxious/depressed behaviour, and to identify the potential influence of gender on this association. The data used were from a Dutch study from Sieh et al., (2012) which was conducted on 149 adolescents aged between 10 and 20 years (m = 15.1 years, 59.7% female), all with at least one parent with a chronic medical condition. Adolescent outcomes were measured using the Screening Instrument for Adolescents of Parents with Chronic Medical Condition (SIAPCMC), which was administered at two time points, a year apart. Parent attachment was measured with alienation from mother and alienation from father on the IPPA, and internalising problems were assessed with internalising problems and anxious/depressed behaviours on the Youth Self Report. A regression analysis showed alienation from the mother and alienation from the father both significantly predicted internalising problem scores, and alienation from the mother significantly predicted anxious/depressed behaviours, thus concluding quality of parent attachment significantly effects internalising problems. Girls were found to be more likely to develop internalising problems and anxious/depressed behaviours as a result of lower quality of parent attachment than the boys. The results support the suggestion of a targeted intervention to increase attachment security through increasing the perceived availability of the parent, and consequently reduce the likelihood of the development of internalising problems.",

"ADHD, Mental Health and Attitudes towards School: A Network Approach","Šėmytė, Gintare","['Fried, E.', 'Kooistra, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsive behavior. This disorder affects areas such as academic functioning, social interactions, and general mental wellbeing. The current study aimed to investigate how these domains are connected in adolescents with ADHD as compared to their peers without the disorder. To examine this, we employed the network approach which allows to model the statistical relations of multiple variables as a network, where separate associations between variables can be observed. The current study used data from sweep 6 of the Millennium Cohort Study, a longitudinal study from the UK following a cohort of children throughout their lives. The final sample consisted of two groups (healthy and ADHD) with 185 14-year-old participants in each group. Networks of the following variables were estimated: hyperactivity, conduct problems, emotional symptoms, peer problems, prosocial behavior, mood and feelings, academic self-concept, school motivation, and truancy. Completed analyses showed that the ADHD network had higher global strength, i.e., the number of connections in the network. This demonstrates the potential stronger associations between variables relating to school, peers, and mental wellbeing in children with ADHD and indicates possible different mechanisms of the disorder. We also found conduct problems to be the most central variable in both networks, suggesting it may be a factor with complex and meaningful relationships to other variables of interest. Overall, the current study encourages future research to investigate ADHD in academic contexts more closely and focus on mental health-related factors.",

EF plays an important role in the regulation of behaviour in daily life. EF impairment can therefore lead to problems with functioning in daily life. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a difference between AN patients and HC’s in EF. In addition, it was investigated whether there is a correlation between EF, eating habits and BMI-SDS. The final aim of this study was to investigate whether EF improves in patients with AN after a one-year follow-up. In each case, the total EF scores and the scores on the 12 subscales of EF were examined. Methods: The study population consisted of 126 girls aged 12-22 years (M= 18.42; SD=2.35), 57 girls belonged to the AN group and 69 to the HC group (M age AN=17.98; M age HC= 18.84). The participants completed the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) and the Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated for the baseline measurements and for the follow-up one year later. Several independent-samples t-tests, linear regression analyses and a linear mixed model analysis were performed as analyses for the results. Results: No differences were found between the AN group and the HC’s with regard to total score of EF, but the AN group did show significantly lower flexibility (p< .001), emotion regulation (p< .001) and taking initiative (p= .001) compared to the HC. However, the AN group did report significantly more orderliness and neatness (p< .001) than the HC. BMI-SDS and eating habits were not associated with the total score of EF, even after adjusting for the confounders depression and age of onset. The subscales taking initiative (p= .029, inhibition (p= .006) and working memory (p= .010) turned out to be negatively associated with BMI-SDS and eating habits. Finally, there appeared to be no significant change in the total score of EF between the baseline measurement and the follow-up after one year for patients with AN. No significant change was found for the subscales either. Conclusion: AN patients showed impairment on certain subscales of EF, but the overall EF score was not different from the HC’s. The impairment found in subscales of EF did not change from baseline measurement after one year of follow-up. However, the participants in this study were all diagnosed with AN less than a year ago. Further research with a longer follow-up time is needed to find out whether this conclusion is the same for patients with chronic AN or patients who have recovered.",

Internalizing problems in children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,"Feith, Lotte","['Ten Hoopen, L.W.', 'Van der Hiele, K.', 'Habers, G.E.A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) are at a high risk for an intellectual impairment and experiencing psychiatric symptoms. Internalizing problems, such as anxiety and a depressed mood, are among the most prevalent reported psychiatric symptoms in patients with TSC. These problems often precede more severe psychopathology, especially when they remain unrecognized. Despite this, research on this subject is still remarkably scarce, especially in children. A factor that seems to be positively associated with internalizing problems is intellectual ability. A major research question that arises is whether more internalizing problems are related to higher intelligence levels in children with TSC, which was examined in the current study. As TSC1 is related to less (severe) intellectual impairments compared to TSC2, a differentiation was made between these mutation types. Additionally, we explored whether internalizing problems increased with age, as would be consistent with findings in the general population. Methods. To test these hypotheses, internalizing problem scores (a parental report on the child behavior checklist) and intellectual ability (using different age- and range-appropriate intelligence and developmental tests) in a non-selected sample of children with TSC (N = 95, Age (Mean (SD) = 10.46 (4.25), 46.3% female, 28.5% TSC1) were assessed. To examine the association between internalizing problems and intellectual ability, several hierarchical regression analyses were performed. Externalizing problems, age, sex and the number of prescribed anti-epileptic drugs were included as control variables. For the exploratory hypothesis, this study tracked symptom severity over two follow-up visits in a subset of our patient population, using several paired sample t-tests. To additionally check whether internalizing problems became more severe in (early) adolescence we selected 15 children (66.7% female) for the childhood/adolescence subgroup. Within these groups, sex- and mutation related differences were also considered. Results. A significant model was found (F = 10.53, p <.001) in which externalizing problems (B = .55, p <.001) and age (B = .28, p <.005) were positively associated with internalizing problems. However, intelligence levels were found to have no influence. Furthermore, internalizing problems tend to increase with age (p <.001). Between childhood and adolescence, this increase was predominantly observed in girls (p = .03). Boys did not seem to experience more internalizing problems during this transition period. Lastly, a trend was found in which only a mutation on the TSC2 gene was associated with more internalizing problems over time (p <.005). Conclusion. This study could not confirm an association between internalizing problems and intelligence. However, our results indicated that internalizing problems increased with age, especially in girls. Since these behaviors contribute to the burden of the disease, it is of great importance that all involved professionals are sensitive to internalizing problems. A regular and thorough evaluation of internalizing problems should therefore always be part of the psychiatric assessment.","['tuberous sclerosis complex', 'internalizing problems', 'children', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'intelligence/developmental quotient', 'TSC1', 'TSC2', 'sex differences', 'age', 'externalizing problems', 'AED use']"
"The Interplay between Intelligence, Psychotic-Like Experiences and Psychopathology in Adolescents","Stam, Mark","['Schuitema, I.', 'Houdt, C. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Psychotic like experiences (PLE) play a role in the development of psychotic disorders. However, less is known about the clinicopathological significance of PLE for the development of nonpsychotic disorders. The current study examined the association of PLE with non-psychotic disorders in adolescents. Secondly, I proposed that this association between PLE and non-psychotic disorders would be moderated by intelligence. The aim of this study is to gain a broader understanding of the development of disorders and to give foundation for interventions concerned with early detection and prevention. Methods: A sample (N=430) of Dutch adolescents aged 13- to 18-year-olds were recruited as part of the iBerry prospective cohort study. The current study is a cross-sectional observational study based on its baseline data. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire (PQ-16) regarding PLE and were subjected to an intelligence test (SON) and a structured interview (MINI) to assess psychiatric disorders. Using logistic regression analysis and moderation analysis I investigated associations between PLE, the presence of non-psychotic disorders and intelligence. Results: The logistic regression model was statistically significant (χ2 (8) = 25.337, p = .001) and explained 15.3% of the variance in non-psychotic disorders. The control variables age, gender and educational level were also taken into account in the analysis. PLE was the only significant predictor (p < .001) and provided an odds ratio of 5.00 (95% CI = 2.16 - 11.56). Because of this wide confidence interval this effect can be considered small to big. The proposed moderating effect of intelligence on the association between PLE and non-psychotic disorders could not be found (p = .179) in the current sample. Conclusions: The results support a model of psychological vulnerability in which subclinical psychiatric symptoms could be indicative for non-specific psychiatric disorders. Further research is indicated to better understand the underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance of PLE in relation to transition to clearly defined psychiatric disorders. Research is also indicated to explore the possible protective role of intelligence in this transition.",

Turning Lemons into Lemonade: Can groups turn a threat into a gain?,"Ettejjari, Said","['Molenmaker, W.E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social dilemmas arise when individual and collective interests conflict. Some crises-like social dilemmas, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, comprise two parts: people must cooperate to prevent a disaster (public bad) but once prevented, i.e., a turning point was reached, positive externalities are generated (public good). Our study aims to expand the literature by studying cooperation, coordination, and motivation in such crises-like situations. We formulated the Adversity-Opportunity model (AOM) as a modified public goods game, introducing a negative initial group account to model ""turning a bad into a good” and the turning point. In a mixed-factorial experiment, we measured participants' social value orientation and afterwards allocated them into three conditions. While contributions in the AOM condition could leave/turn the group account negative/positive, it could only remain negative (Public Bad condition) or is only shared when positive (Public Good condition). Within subjects, we varied the negative initial group account, while prompting expected and most appropriate contribution after each decision. Our results showed consistently high cooperation in the AOM across turning points, while social dispositions were a significant predictor of cooperation. We argue that when cooperation always is continuously beneficial, coordination is not required, and people cannot deduct a convergent collective and individual interest. A common interest to avoid over- or underspending could have enabled participants to form expectations and thus partially coordinate their choices. A public bad fostered marginally larger contributions than a public good interaction, after accounting for dispositions. Further research is necessary to confirm our findings and assess follow-up questions.","['Public Goods', 'Social Dilemma', 'Framing', 'Threat', 'Covid', 'Cooperation', 'SVO', 'Psychology']"

Aim: The aims of this study were to analyse gender differences in burnout levels of students in the Netherlands and look into students’ suggestions on burnout prevention. Methods: Students from vocational training institutes and institutes for higher education in the Netherlands (N = 743) completed an online questionnaire that investigated burnout. Survey items included: burnout measure short version (BMS) and a custom-made questionnaire for students’ suggestions. Results: 40.48% of the female participants and 22.22% of the male participants indicated they had a high level of burnout. Burnout scores of females students (Mdn = 3.70) were higher than those of male students (Mdn = 2.90), with a small but statistically significant difference, U(nfemales = 582, nmales = 135) = 27519, p < .001. Students’ suggestions on burnout prevention focus on (a) mental health information and resources, (b) interaction between students and schools, (c) academic pressure, (d) schedule and organisation, and (e) study load. Conclusion: Despite the limitations, burnout was present in our sample, with small but significant gender differences. Schools and policy makers should look into students’ suggestions on burnout prevention.",

The use of antipsychotics in patients with a borderline personality disorder and verbal auditory hallucinations,"Gils, Amy van","['Blom, J.D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Verbal auditory hallucinations (VAH) are experienced by 46% of the patients with a borderline personality disorder (BPD). They may constitute a persistent source of distress. In patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, the first choice of treatment for such hallucinations is antipsychotics. Since the effectiveness of these compounds in BPD is largely unknown, the current study focuses on the effectiveness of antipsychotics on VAH in patients with BPD. Method: Patients with BPD who experienced VAH were interviewed with the aid of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales – Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (PSYRATS - AHRS). To assess improvement over time a pre- and post-test was carried out. A logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the likelihood that receiving antipsychotics was predicted by the degree of suffering from VAH in patients with BPD at pre-test. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to investigate improvement over time in degree of suffering and general functioning. A Man-Whitney U test was used to investigate the expectation that patients with BPD and VAH who use antipsychotics experience a larger decrease in the degree of suffering from VAH than patients with BPD and VAH who do not use antipsychotics. Results: Among the 23 patients thus assessed, no improvement over time was found in the degree of suffering or in general functioning when using antipsychotics. Conclusion: Antipsychotics may not be effective in treating VAH in patients with BPD. Future research among a larger patient group may need to take into account the types of antipsychotic prescribed, dosages, and duration of treatment.","['borderline personality disorder', 'antipsychotics', 'verbal auditory hallucination']"

"The role of music familiarity in the relationship between mood, arousal and cognitive performance","Akan, Dariya","['Schaefer, R.', 'Middelkoop, H.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Several studies have shown that listening to music can have short-term cognitive enhancement properties. These effects have been explained by the mood-arousal hypothesis, which suggests that listening to music can briefly heighten one’s mood and arousal, and this can consequently temporarily improve cognitive performance. There is limited evidence showing that familiarity with the music might intensify this relationship between mood, arousal and cognition. Therefore, in the present study we investigated this potential effect in a sample of 80 healthy, predominantly Dutch older adults between the ages of 65 and 84. We predicted that higher music familiarity would be related to improvements in phonological working memory (forward digit span) and phonemic fluency (letter fluency) performance just after listening, as compared to without music listening, and that this effect would be mediated by enhanced subjective mood and subjectively reported or physiologically measured arousal. The results did not provide evidence for this specific mediational relationship. Nevertheless, it was shown that higher familiarity with the music was significantly associated with increases in subjective mood and arousal. Moreover, the participants who were less aroused had larger improvements in their phonemic fluency, when comparing their baseline scores to scores after music listening. The present results contradict the mood-arousal hypothesis and do not provide support for the previous findings regarding the beneficial effect of music on cognition. Nonetheless, they demonstrate that familiar music can improve one’s subjective mood and arousal, which might act as a useful tool when incorporating music into practice, both in a clinical and non-clinical context. Further research into the mood-arousal hypothesis is needed in order to establish clear relationships between the involved variables, thus help inform clinical decisions regarding the use of music in a therapeutic context.","['music cognition', 'mood-arousal hypothesis', 'familiar music', 'working memory', 'music therapy']"

Evaluation of the psychometric properties of the 16-item Prodromal Questionnaire,"Winden, Pauline van","['Kleine, R.A. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Early intervention of the Ultra High Risk (UHR) population is fundamentally important in preventing a potential psychosis. The two crucial steps in psychosis detection are the screening procedure for (subclinical) psychotic symptoms, via the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ) as well as a clinical interview, the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States. The aim of this study is to replicate an earlier study, by analyzing the psychometric properties of the PQ-16. More specifically, the cut off score will be evaluated, as well as the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value in a new and larger sample. An additional research question will be examined, specifically whether the level of distress that patients experience per symptom has added value in classifying someone as UHR on the CAARMS. 31,734 participants were included in the analyses. A ROC analysis was used to display the connection and trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity for every possible cut-off score. In this study, the most suitable cut off score was 6, with a sensitivity of 70%, a specificity of 60%, a positive predictive value of 30.7 and a negative predictive value of 88.6. Additional ROC curves were plotted to measure various levels of distress; the highest AUC value being 0.64. Therefore, the level of distress on the PQ-16 does not have additional value in predicting UHR on the CAARMS. To conclude, due to the sufficient psychometric properties and clinical benefits, the PQ-16 remains an accessible and feasible tool to screen for subclinical psychotic symptoms. Future research should consider further replication, including an equal range of PQ scores in order to generalize to a wider population.","['ultra high risk', 'at risk mental state', 'attenuated psychotic symptoms', 'psychosis']"

"The Musical Coping and Responsivity Scale: Creation, Validation & Predictor identification","Di Lorenzo, Kim","['Middelkoop, H.', 'Schaefer, R.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Music is not only a source of entertainment but also a means to influence an individual’s mental and physical health. Music therapy is an umbrella term for interventions using the diverse aspects of music that have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on well-being. However, the large interindividual differences in how people interact with music are often overlooked. A screening instrument retrieving individualized music-related personal information would be useful for clinicians to tailor music therapy to the person seeking music-related health support. The first aim of this thesis is to develop and investigate the psychometric properties of the novel Musical Coping and Responsivity Scale: a questionnaire providing an individualized profile of a person’s musical background and behaviour to serve as an intervention guidance tool. The second aim is to investigate whether gender, as well as practical and theoretical musical knowledge, can predict a person’s tendency to use music for regulating emotions. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was first conducted on a 75-item questionnaire completed by 746 participants (377 males, mean age 66.1 years, SD = 7.9, range = 42- 93) out of which 28 items were retained. The shortened version was administered in combination with other music-related instruments (Gold-MSI, BMRQ, IIIS) to a second sample of 859 participants (425 males, mean age 63.5, SD = 9.8, range = 40-96). Four factors were retrieved from the EFA and interpreted as: Emotional usage of music, Musical skills, Musical responsiveness & Musical engagement. The same factor structure was confirmed by the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93) and concurrent validity with other instruments were shown. For the second aim, a hierarchical regression analysis was conducted, finding significant main effects of “Musical skills” (β = .146, p < .001) and gender (β = .131, p < .001) but no interaction. These results indicate that the MCRS is a reliable and valid tool to use for music therapy orientation. Additionally, both musical skills and gender are factors predicting the likelihood of using music to regulate emotions, making them important characteristics to consider when tailoring music interventions.","['music therapy', 'musical training', 'emotion regulation', 'factor analyses', 'screening questionnaire']"

We focused on trait anxiety because high anxious individuals tend to have more trouble with controlling attention. This can result in having a hard time ignoring threatening information and negative thoughts can take over the thought process. Participants viewed photographs of faces whose gaze was directed to the left, to the right or forward. Target letters then appeared at the left or the right side of the photograph. The faces that were used had different emotional expressions (neutral or fearful). The results of this study showed that high anxious participants were not faster in orienting attention in response to the averted gaze in comparison to low anxious participants. In addition, high anxious participants were not slower in looking away from attention in response to a direct cue in comparison to low anxious participants. This effect does not seem to be enhanced by a fearful expression. This indicated that the orientation of attention can shift in the direction of the gaze even when it is opposed to intentions.",

Ex ploring n ovel environments to enhance memory: The role of novelty seeking,"Kraaijenbrink, Joyce","['Schomaker, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Animal studies have shown that the exploration of novel environments has a positive effect on memory. As shown in virtual reality studies, this positive effect of novelty on memory also seems to hold for humans. However, one study failed to find such a positive effect. It is possible that this is due to individual differences in the novelty seeking personality trait. Therefore, in this master thesis the effect of novelty on recall and recognition memory is identified and the role of novelty seeking in these relationships is addressed. Since novelty processing is associated with dopaminergic neuromodulation in the hippocampus and novelty seeking is related to dopamine sensitivity, it was hypothesized that novelty affects hippocampus-dependent memory (recall) and that this effect is moderated by novelty seeking. No effect was expected on hippocampus-independent memory (recognition memory). Participants in the study were familiarized with a virtual environment and later explored the same (familiar) environment again or a novel one. After this exposure, the participants performed a word-learning task, a visuomotor adaptation task and a landmark test. They also filled out questionnaires regarding their mood and the novelty seeking personality trait. Hierarchical regression analyses suggested that novelty exposure has no effect on memory performance. No moderating effect of novelty seeking was found. Bayesian statistics support this null finding. Future studies need to investigate the influence of individual differences further with a wider range of novelty seekers and the inclusion of the variables age and depth of processing.","['novelty', 'novelty seeking', 'recall', 'recognition memory']"

However, it remains unclear whether age deficits in MTL processes contribute to age deficits in novelty processing. The present study aimed to investigate this knowledge gap and to confirm previous findings reported by Schomaker et al. (2021) regarding the role of the MTL in novelty detection and later processing. Twenty-one patients with epilepsy with unilateral MTL resection and twenty-four matched healthy controls performed an adapted visual novelty oddball task, with two streams of stimuli presented left and right of a fixation cross, while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. The participants had to respond to infrequent target stimuli while ignoring standard and novel stimuli. Novelty detection, indexed by the N2, was reduced by MTL resections, shown by a smaller N2 for patients compared to healthy controls. Novelty processing, indexed by the P3, was not reduced in patients, shown by a larger P3 for patients compared to healthy controls. However, this might be due to collapsing of data in the patient group, since resection side was outside the scope of this study. Target processing, indexed by the P3b, was unaffected by MTL resections: no differences were found between patients and healthy controls. These results suggest that MTL structures, including the hippocampus and the amygdala, play a role in novelty processing. In contrast, MTL structures do not play a role in target processing since this was unaffected by MTL resections.","['novelty processing', 'hippocampus', 'medial temporal lobe', 'aging', 'epilepsy']"

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relation between different types of drugs (alcohol, cannabis, and hard drugs) and different types of crime (violent, drug-related, and property). It was expected that (1) alcohol users were more likely to commit violent crimes than cannabis or hard drug users, (2) cannabis users were less likely to commit drug-related crimes than alcohol or hard drugs users, and (3) hard drug users were more likely to commit property crimes than alcohol or cannabis users. Gender, SES, education, polydrug use, and conduct disorder were also taken into account. All variables were assessed using a structured interview in a sample of 209 youths who came into treatment for SUD at different treatment centers across the Netherlands. The key finding of this study was that the majority of this sample had committed multiple types of crime and were using multiple types of drugs, which made confirmatory analyses impossible. Exploratory analyses indicated that cannabis users were more likely to commit drug-related crimes than non-cannabis users and that there was no specific type of drug that increased the likeliness that a youth would commit multiple crimes.","['crime', 'drugs', 'substance', 'adolescents']"

This would suggest that alcohol consumption could have been consulted as a coping strategy to reduce negative affect. To test this idea, a mediation analysis was conducted, which suggested that the positive relationship between financial scarcity and alcohol consumption could be explained by the consideration of mental health problems. The results for the mediation analysis have shown that there is a significant positive association between financial scarcity and mental health. However, the relationship between mental health and alcohol consumption was not significant, which resulted in the mediation effects being nonsignificant. The relationship between financial scarcity and alcohol consumption was significant in the situation where mental health was not considered as in the situation where mental health was considered. However, in both cases, the relationship between financial scarcity and alcohol consumption appeared to be negative, which suggested that higher levels of financial scarcity were associated with lower amounts in alcohol consumption. To explain this negative association between financial scarcity and alcohol consumption and the absence of the mediation effects of mental health, further research on possible hidden variables has to be conducted.",
Perfectionism and Fear of Failure in Gifted Children,"Plooster, Jeanine","['Zanolie, K.', 'Asscheman, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Intellectually gifted children are often characterized as prone to perfectionism and fear of failure (Basirion et al., 2014; Chan, 2012; Cross & Cross, 2015; Speirs Neumeister, 2016). However, research findings on the association between giftedness and perfectionism seem diverging. In addition, no research on fear of failure among specifically gifted pre-adolescents has been conducted yet. Therefore, the current study investigated the possible differences between gifted pre-adolescents aged 10-12 years old and their non-gifted peers on perfectionistic striving (adaptive perfectionism), perfectionistic concern (maladaptive perfectionism) and fear of failure. An innovative aspect of the current study is that perfectionistic striving was measured with both implicit and explicit measurements. We found that (1) gifted and non-gifted pre-adolescents did not differ in the extent to which they strive for perfectionism, neither implicitly nor explicitly, (2) gifted pre-adolescents showed less perfectionistic concern than their non-gifted peers in the form of socially prescribed perfectionism, and (3) gifted and non-gifted pre-adolescents did not differ in the extent to which they showed general fear of failure. Collectively, the findings suggest that gifted preadolescents should not be characterized as vulnerable to fear of failure and perfectionism, both perfectionistic striving and perfectionistic concern. Additionally, our findings emphasize the importance of using both implicit and explicit measures when investigating perfectionism.","['Gifted', 'children', 'achievement striving', 'perfectionism']"
"Can't Stop Thinking About It: An FMRI Study on the Association between Brooding Trait, Salience Network Connectivity, and Heart Rate Variability","Reinken, Aischa","['Rover, M. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been linked to aberrant functional connectivity in large scale neural networks, such as reduced salience network (SN) functional connectivity, as well as decreased resting heart rate variability (HRV). It is unknown whether these features are present in depressed patients, as a consequence of MDD, or also present in healthy individuals at risk for depression, which would indicate their playing a broader role in the development of MDD. The current study aimed to investigate this in a healthy sample at risk for depression, using a cross-sectional, between-subject experimental design. To select a healthy sample at risk, individuals were screened for having a general tendency to ruminate. The intention was to include individuals with high scores on rumination’s facet of brooding, which is a pertinent risk factor for depression. Nevertheless, this screening was unsuccessful in selecting a sample at risk, since analyses revealed healthy levels of brooding. However, the present sample (N = 29) did display reduced HRV and elevated cognitive reactivity to sadness. Against prediction, no significant negative relationship was found between SN connectivity and brooding trait scores. As expected, SN connectivity was positively linked to HRV. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed connectivity within the right anterior insula to be positively linked to HRV. Given the healthy levels of brooding, no inferences can be made regarding this risk factor for depression development. Nonetheless, the results replicate the coupling of SN and HRV in a healthy sample, thereby providing further evidence of the SN’s role in autonomic modulation.",

Money or Misery? The Family Stress Theory in Times of COVID-19: The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the financial and mental well-being of Dutch citizens,"Mohr, Theresa","['Dijk, W. van', 'Dillen, L. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Family Stress Theory asserts that financial strain leads to a lower family relationship quality through the mediating role of mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a toll on societies and economies worldwide, causing many people to lose their incomes and cases of domestic violence to rise. In the present study we investigated the Family Stress Theory in the context of COVID-19 in order to have the necessary knowledge to counter negative consequences such as the increased physical child abuse during the pandemic. We wanted to know whether financial strain increased between the baseline average level of financial strain during the pre-pandemic years 2017-2019 and the post-pandemic onset months of the year 2020. Furthermore, we investigated whether a pre- to post-pandemic onset change in financial strain was associated with a pre- to post-pandemic onset change in family relationship quality and whether a change of mental health problems during the same timeframe mediated this relationship. We took data from 321 Dutch participants living in a household with a partner and at least one child from the nationally representative LISS panel. Results showed that financial strain was higher before than after the COVID-19 onset in the Netherlands. Furthermore, while the pre- to post-pandemic onset change in financial strain was negatively associated with a pre- to post-pandemic onset change in family relationship quality, this relationship was not mediated by a change of mental health problems during the same timeframe. Controlling for marital status had no effect. Although findings only partly support the Family Stress Theory in the context of COVID-19, insights are valuable because they give practical implications for governments and institutions that help preventing extreme cases of domestic violence such as paying increased attention to symptoms of distress.",
Het effect van het ingaan van de zomertijd op het slaap-waakritme. De verschillen tussen ochtend- en avondmensen.,"Kooiman, Lynnsey","['Dr. Rover, M. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The change to daylight saving time (DST) not only provides us with more excess to daylight but it also causes energy savings for half a year. Nevertheless, not everyone experiences the change to DST as pleasant. The human sleep- wake rhythm does not seem to synchronize well when changing to DST. An unsynchronized rhythm causes sleep disruptions and other negative health effects. To ensure human health, there is need for a solution. On one hand, it might be an idea to either abolish or adjust the change to DST. On the other hand, the group of people experiencing issues with the change to DST might be relatively small for this solution to be successful. To contribute to this discussion, the current study has been performed. This study focusses on the influence of chronotype on the change to DST. Chronotype has been proven to explain differences in sleep wake rhythms between individuals. The main research question was as follows: What is the effect of the change to DST on the sleep wake rhythm of morning and evening chronotypes? The findings of the current study show that both morning and evening chronotypes suffer from the change to DST regarding their time of wakening. However, a change in bedtime only occurred for evening chronotypes. In conclusion, since both morning and evening chronotypes experience disruptions due to the change to DST, it might be relevant to reconsider other solutions related to this change.","['zomertijd', 'slaap-waakritme', 'ochtendmensen', 'avondmensen', 'daylight saving time', 'sleep-wake rhythm', 'chronotype']"
Safety-II as a Different Approach in Healthcare: Investigating the Influence of Personality on Reporting Behavior,"Spaans, Reinout","['Groeneweg, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In hospitals, preventable incidents still occur and safety management may have reached its peak. Therefore, learning from these incidents is imperative to reduce preventable harm. A prerequisite for learning is the willingness of staff to report. A safety management mode known as Safety-II may yield benefits in reporting behavior. Based on existing literature, reporting behavior may be influenced by personality. This study aimed to investigate if the proposed safety management mode will increase reporting behavior. Additionally, this study investigated if personality is a significant predictor in reporting behavior. To test this, participants consisting of two groups i.e., calamity investigators (with training in Safety-II) and random medical staff (without training) were compared. Data was gathered by distributing questionnaires among participants; one for personality and one for reporting behavior. The reporting questionnaire was distributed on a second occasion, to measure implications over time. It was expected that training in Safety-II leads to an increase in reporting behavior. Additionally, it was expected that personality influenced reporting behavior. Results showed a significant difference in one facet of reporting behavior (i.e., perceived blame) between groups with training in Safety-II and without training. Extraversion and neuroticism were found to be predictors for one facet of reporting behavior (i.e., perceived criteria for events that should be reported). Implications may be that the training main focus is to exempt blame from being a factor in reporting. Implications may also be that personality is not a great predictor of reporting behavior. Future lines of research may focus on increasing the number of participating hospitals, perhaps even broadening the study across different nations, to examine cultural differences.","['safety management', 'safety-I', 'safety-II', 'personality', 'reporting behavior', 'healthcare']"
The effectiveness of trauma-focused treatment on suicidality and the moderating role of psychotic symptoms in patients with childhood-abuse posttraumatic stress disorder,"Hartmann, Juri","['Kooistra, M.', 'Mouthaan, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequent consequence of childhood abuse (CA) and is assumed to be more severe than PTSD from adult trauma. PTSD can be treated well with trauma-focused treatment (TFT), but comorbidities such as suicidality and psychotic symptoms have been viewed as contraindications for using TFT. Aim: To identify the effects of TFT on suicidality in a population with CA-PTSD as well as the moderating effects of psychotic symptoms. Method: Baseline and post-treatment assessments of suicidality were investigated in 150 adult patients with CA-PTSD. Moderating effects of psychotic symptoms at baseline were investigated. Results: A reduction of suicidality was observed (z = -2.43, p = .015); for the majority of participants suicidality decreased (n = 47), while some participants experienced no change (n = 27) or an increase (n = 29) in suicidality. Only few participants (n = 21) showed comorbid psychotic symptoms at baseline. Psychotic symptoms at baseline were associated with higher suicidality (z = 2.391; p = .017), but after correction for multiple testing, not with PTSD symptoms (t(148) = -2.22, p = .028) at baseline. Psychotic symptoms did not modify PTSD or suicidality outcomes at post-treatment. Conclusion: A reduction of suicidality may be an overall trend in TFT, but no change or an increase in suicidality are also observed in participants. More research is needed on the role of psychotic symptoms. Suicidality should be closely monitored throughout treatment, and interventions to address immediate or extreme suicidality should be investigated further in future research.",

Optimizing thalamic segmentation and relating derived volumes to executive functioning in Parkinson´s disease,"Díaz Castiella, María","['Ruitenberg, M.', 'Middelkoop, H.A.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Apart from its motor symptoms, Parkinson´s disease (PD) is characterized by cognitive deficits; among these, executive functioning (EF) deficits are common. Stroke studies have shown a role of the whole thalamus, and specifically the medial nuclear group (Mng), in EF. Although in PD studies have shown volume loss in the thalamus and Mng, little is known about the relationship between this phenomenon and EF deficits in PD. We aimed to address this gap and examine the relationship between thalamic and Mng volumes and EF in PD. As the thalamus is difficult to segment due to poor tissue contrast, we also aimed to explore whether using Phase-Sensitive Inversion Recovery MRI scans in addition to T1 MRI scans (T1+PSIR MRI) would optimize automatic thalamic segmentation over using T1 MRI scans alone. A total of 76 PD participants underwent T1 and PSIR MRI scans and completed tests measuring verbal fluency, resistance to cognitive interference and planning abilities, which were used to calculate an EF composite score. We found that using T1+PSIR MRI scans resulted in a more accurate thalamic segmentation as shown by less thalamic overestimation especially in the lateral and anteroventral nuclear groups, and smaller thalamic and nuclear groups volumes. We used the derived volumes to relate to global EF performance. Results showed that total thalamic and total Mng volumes were not significantly related to global EF performance (β = .08, t = 1.24, p = .22; β = .16, t = 1.71, p = .09, respectively). Results of exploratory analyses showed a positive significant relationship between left (β = .16, t = 2.26, p = .02) and right (β = .18, t = 2.67, p = .01) thalamic volumes and left (β = .25, t = 2.84, p = .01) Mng volume and verbal fluency performance. In this thesis project we demonstrated that automatic thalamic segmentation can be optimized by using PSIR MRI scans. Although the association between thalamic and Mng volumes and global EF in PD is not supported in this thesis project, volumes seem to be specifically associated with verbal fluency. We propose that this could be due to the role of the Mng in cognitive flexibility. Supported by future longitudinal studies, our findings could have implications for early diagnosis and effective management of verbal fluency deficits in PD.","['Parkinson´s disease', 'thalamus', 'medial', 'executive functioning', 'verbal fluency']"

The psychological impact of being at-risk of a genetic neurodegenerative disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Bourdage, Renelle","['Ruitenberg, M.', 'Middelkoop, H.A.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study focuses on neurodegenerative diseases inherited in an autosomal dominant manner for which offspring are 50% at-risk of disease. Being at-risk of a genetic neurodegenerative disease has been shown to impact psychological well-being as some studies have reported significant levels of anxiety and depression in mutation carriers. Other studies have found no significant psychological impact in mutation carriers. In addition to conflicting results, few studies have examined the psychological impact in those atrisk before predictive-testing. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of being 50% at risk of an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease, defined by having a positive family history, on depression and anxiety as compared to healthy controls with no family history of dominant neurodegenerative disease. Additionally, we aimed to examine levels of depression and anxiety in different at-risk awareness groups (mutation carrier, mutation non-carrier or unaware) and different types of disease (Huntington’s disease and “Other”, e.g., familial Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia) compared to healthy controls. Seventy-two articles were included in the systematic review, 10 articles were included in the depression meta-analysis and seven articles were included for the anxiety meta-analysis. The systematic review showed that some studies reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression in at-risk individuals, particularly mutation carriers, compared to controls while other studies reported no significant difference. The systematic review also showed that; a) mutation non-carriers and partners of those at-risk were used as healthy controls; b) studies used similar instruments to measure depression and anxiety; and c) most studies were on Huntington’s disease. The meta-analysis for depression showed that those at-risk do experience significantly higher levels of depression compared to healthy controls (p = .05). The anxiety meta-analysis was non-significant. This study highlights the psychological needs for individuals at-risk and suggests future research to have; a) healthy controls that do not include non-mutation carriers and partners of those at-risk; b) better instruments to measure anxiety and depression in those at-risk; and c) to examine other neurodegenerative diseases in addition to Huntington’s disease.","['psychological', 'at-risk', 'genetic', 'neurogenerative', 'disease']"

A major factor for the effectiveness of rehabilitation is motivation to finish the program. Serious gaming has been found to create more enjoyment among populations, which leads to more motivation to participate in an activity linked to the game. Additionally, the use of music has also been found to be a motivating factor to complete an activity. This study aimed to find whether music can be a motivating factor in serious gaming. In particular, this study aimed to test the success of musical association with serious gaming. It was tested whether musical association with the game was associated with improved gaming skills in addition to the enjoyment of the game. The results showed no significant effect of musical association on skill improvement, as well as on game enjoyment. Further research is required with a more complete dataset in order to find significant effects of musical association on gaming skills and enjoyment. Further research into the effects of other types of music with an already existing association would also provide interesting results. Significant effects might indicate a new successful rehabilitation technique making use of music and serious gaming. However, if there is not an effect present between musical association and enjoyment and skill improvement in serious gaming, musical association does not need to be taken into consideration in order to create a successful serious game.",
Teleworkers Engage Less in Inattentive Eating: An Examination of the Effect of Teleworking on Inattentive Eating and Subsequent Snack Intake.,"Venema, Fleur","['Meer, F. van', 'Dillen, L. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Eating while being distracted (inattentive eating) increases the amount of snacking after the meal. This increased snacking can have negative health consequences. In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, snacking has increased. Another thing that has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic is the amount of people who are teleworking. While research on teleworking shows mixed results, several studies showed that teleworkers snack more and take less breaks than people who work on location. This study analyzes if there is a relationship between inattentive eating and teleworking. The data was collected by sending out an online questionnaire to people who worked from home or on location. Analyses were done to examine whether the two work locations differed on amount of lunch breaks, amount of attention for the food while eating, types of distractions and snacking behavior. The results showed that teleworkers take more breaks and pay more attention to their food while eating. Teleworkers were more engaged in distractions that decreased stress and thus also cognitive load. People who worked on location spent more time on their computer while eating. This is an activity with high cognitive load and related to more snacking in the afternoon. However, when controlling for interacting with a computer device, teleworkers did snack more. Overall, teleworking is not related to more inattentive eating, but is related to more snacking. So, the sudden increase of teleworking due to the COVID-19 pandemic has one positive side to it, as it is associated with less inattentive eating.",

Current study was part of a larger study on behavioral coping in the elderly. The research sample consisted of 244 Dutch elderly aged 65 and older from the general Dutch population. The respondents had completed one online self-reported questionnaire with different topics. One topic focused on behavioral coping (BERQ) and one focused on depressive symptoms (PHQ-9). Gender and religious support were questioned in the sociodemographics of the questionnaire. The relationships were studied using Pearson correlations, a multiple regression analysis and a moderator analysis. The results of the current study showed a negative significant correlation between 'actively approaching' and depressive symptoms. In contrast, 'ignoring' and 'withdrawal' had a positively significant correlation with depressive symptoms. It was expected that the other helping coping mechanisms and religious support would also have a negative significant correlation with depressive symptoms and that the relationships would be moderated by gender, but that was not confirmed. A possible explanation for this was the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic. When developing new interventions for the Dutch elderly, it could be helpful to teach them to actively approach problems, although further research is needed to confirm the findings of the current study and to explore the relationship between religious support and depressive symptoms.","['Behavioral coping', 'religious support', 'depression', 'elderly']"

The Relation between Stress and Threat-Related Attentional Bias: The Moderating Effect of Attentional Control on the Association between Stress and Attentional bias to High and Mild Threats,"Stamboliyski, Kaloyan","['Putman, P.', 'Kooistra, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Threat-related attentional bias is a dynamic process, determined by internal and external factors. Individual differences in attentional control, a core function of the executive system, is thought to modulate the expression of attentional bias. Attentional bias is also influenced by the threat level of a stimulus (mild and high). The effect of stress on attentional bias in relation to attentional control and threat level shows considerable heterogeneity. Aims and hypotheses: Investigate the association between attentional bias to different threat levels, stress and attentional control. Stress increases attentional bias towards all threats compared to the control condition. Attentional control moderates the effect of stress on attentional bias towards mild and high threats. Method: Sixty-four female participants completed a self-report attentional control measure, underwent a stress-induction (n = 32) or control (n = 32) procedure and completed the modified dot-probe task. Results: Attentional bias to high and mild threats was not affected by stress. Importantly, attentional control moderated the relation between stress and attentional bias to high threats. High attentional control was associated with an attentional bias towards high threats in the stress condition while high attentional control predicted an attentional bias away from high threats in the control condition on a trend level. This moderation effect was not shown for the association between stress and attentional bias to mild threats. Discussion: This study provides evidence that attentional control plays an important role in the manifestation of attentional bias to high threats in stressful and controlled situations in healthy individuals.","['Attentional Bias', 'Stress', 'Attentional Control', 'Threat Level', 'Dot-probe Task']"

However, it seems some people are not always willing to adapt, no matter how many valid reasons are provided. These observations may indicate the effect of a confirmation bias at play. This study aimed to research existence of confirmation bias in a reinforcement learning environment, while using gender as its main predictor to explore possible differences with the intent to better understand behavioral change resistance. The study had a 2 x 2 within-subjects design. 112 participants performed an instrumental learning task involving factual and counterfactual reinforcement learning, in part derived from a previous study by Palminteri et al. (2017). Following exclusion criteria, 99 participants were included for analysis (age = 25.29, SD = 13.27; 81.82% females). Contrary to expectations, statistical analysis showed no evidence of a non-zero mean confirmation bias in the population (Z = -1.260, p = .208, r = -.127). Additionally, no relation was found between the ability to adapt and confirmation bias (rs(97) = .197, p = .051), strengthening the previous finding. A difference in confirmation bias between men and women could not be supported by this study (U = 717, p = .913, r = -.01). Though these results were unexpected, they exposed opportunities to improve confirmation bias testing by controlling for autocorrelation of choice, metacognition and mental states. Finally, though results may have been influenced by effects from the current COVID-19 pandemic, it also provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study these effects by replicating this study afterwards.","['confirmation bias', 'gender differences', 'reinforcement learning']"

The Politics of Desirability: An Analysis of the Ethical Question,"Keijzer, Wouter","['Saptari, R.', 'Momtaz, F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"When a person or an institution has the ability to act upon what they believe is the best possible situation - or at least a relatively good set of circumstances - through changing real-life livelihoods, they engage with the politics of desirability. That means that they are positioned within the political playing field of actors with different degrees of power to act upon what they believe is desirable. This thesis is an attempt to discover truths about the political relationship between government - and the act of governance - and those whom are influenced yet not fully involved with the processes that influence them. The analysis builds upon two types of cases: one concerns general descriptions of regimes’ governance, rationales, techniques and ideologies; and the other concerns government responses to contestations to its governance. Each case is shortly analysed in regards to the concept of desirability. After presentations and short discussions of the cases, I present two different dimensions of critiques on government’s dealing with the matter of desirability: contingent issues, that can be found explicitly in the cases, but can vary amongst regimes; and inherent limits, which are present, by definition, in every attempt at governance from outside. The latter critiques come down to problematising the core asset of government in the political realm of desirability. That core asset is its position of power, in which it is able to act upon its own conception of ‘what is desirable’ without involving conceptions and lived experience of the people most influenced by the government action; but also in which it cannot overcome its limits - deriving straight from the asset - to do justice to the open-ended, ethical question of desirability.","['desirability', 'governance', 'ethics', 'anarchism', 'democracy']"

The current study examines the relationship between subjective experience of embarrassment and facial expression of embarrassment in children and adults. Specifically, it examined the differences in facial expressions of embarrassment between children (8-10-years old) and adults (18- 40-years old). It was expected that there would be a positive relationship between subjective experience and facial expression of embarrassment in both adults and children. Moreover, it was predicted that children would show more embarrassment in their facial expression than what adults would show. Participants were asked to do a social performance task, which consisted of singing a song. After they sang the song, participants were required to watch themselves. During this viewing phase, physiological measures and facial expression were recorded. Results showed no correlation between subjective experience and facial expressions of embarrassment for both children, and adults. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in facial expressions of embarrassment between children and adults. Future studies should focus on why this relationship between subjective experience and facial expression is found for basic emotions (such as anger and fear) and not for a self-conscious emotion such as embarrassment.","['Embarrassment in children', 'Embarrassment in adults', 'Subjective feeling of embarrassment', 'Facial expression of embarrassment']"

Embarrassment is a self-conscious emotion and little is known about how this emotion is experienced across ages. This study investigated any differences in the cheek temperature of young children (3.5-5-yo), older children (8-10-yo) and adults (18-40-yo), during an embarrassment-inducing task. Additionally, it was studied whether the response was influenced by the presence of an audience. To induce embarrassment, the participants were asked to sing a song while being recorded. Afterwards, the participants watched this recording while cheek temperature was measured. Participants were divided in two audience conditions. In the alone condition, participants watched the video on their own. In the audience condition, participants watched the video, while two researchers sat next to them in the same room. To examine whether there were differences in skin temperature between the age categories and audience conditions, a Two-way ANOVA was performed. It was expected that the 8 to 10-year-olds would have the greatest increase in cheek temperature, and the youngest children would have the lowest increase in skin temperature. Furthermore, it was expected that the presence of an audience would increase cheek temperature. The results of this study suggest that there are no differences in the extent to which embarrassment is experienced between the three age categories. Furthermore, audience condition did not influence the cheek temperature of the participants. Finally, age category and audience condition did not influence each other in this sample.","['self-conscious emotions', 'embarrassment', 'cheek temperature', 'blushing']"

In much previous research the role of attentional control and stimulus threat level in this process have been much neglected. The current study aimed to partly replicate two previous studies that did study these factors. Fifty-two female participants between the ages 18 and 30 completed the questionnaires for both trait anxiety and attentional control. Afterwards the participants performed a dot-probe task with neutral, mild and high threat pictures. Results showed that trait anxiety is related to on attentional bias towards mild threat but does not matter for high threat. Results also showed that lower attentional control resulted in more vigilance towards mild than high threat. Unexpectedly, we did not find significant results for the three-way interaction between threat level, trait anxiety and attentional control. We conclude that trait anxiety, stimulus threat level and attentional control are related to attentional bias, consequently it is very important to take individual differences for anxiety, attentional control and stimulus threat level into account.","['trait anxiety', 'attentional control', 'attentional bias', 'dot-probe']"

This visual ethnographic research was a way for me to live with and through the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions that it brought in my own country, the Netherlands. I have done fieldwork for almost three months at natural (outdoor) playground Het Woeste Westen (The Wuthering West), a place in Amsterdam where children can play with and in nature both ‘freely’ as ‘semi-organized’ with adult supervision. The study explores how children think of outdoor play as full of opportunities unavailable at home, what children do in the outdoors, and how their experiences shape their thinking about play and their relation to the material world. I have used audiovisual recordings, non-participating observations with interaction and visual elicitations. The result is a thesis in both written as ethnographic film form. The text includes both descriptions of observational video footage as written field notes, and transcribed video footage. The film aims at showing what I have seen and what I have been told by protagonists. My key research finding is that children weather by using the elements in their outdoor play. I argue that weather creates the world that they are in, which impacts how they play. Examples of this are moving more in winter weather to stay warm, jumping and sliding in mud as a fun activity and making fires to get warm and dry after a cold and rainy day.","['Elements', 'Play', 'Anthropology of Children', 'Weathering', 'Culture']"

In addition, research shows attentional control (AC) also moderates threat-related AB, counteracting the moderating role of anxiety. Angelidis, Hagenaars, van Son, van der Does, and Putman (2018) and Van Son, Angelidis, Hagenaars, van der Does, and Putman (2018) conducted dot-probe studies testing AB towards different threat stimuli on healthy participants and observed partially incongruent results. Research objective: This project aimed at firstly testing the moderating roles of trait anxiety and AC on AB towards different threat stimuli individually and secondly testing the moderating role interactively. Methods: 52 healthy students completed a self-report trait-anxiety and AC questionnaire. Additionally, AB was tested by letting the participants complete a dot-probe task with neutral, mild, and high threat level stimuli. Results: The moderating roles of trait anxiety and AC could only be partially confirmed with trait anxiety moderating vigilance towards mild threat and AC moderating vigilance towards high threat. However, trait anxiety and AC did not interactively moderate ABs to different threat levels. Discussion and conclusion: Individual differences in AC along with stimulus threat level importantly moderate anxious AB and need to be considered in future studies.",

Emotional expression of nursing home residents with dementia: Observations in day-to-day conversations,"Nulft, Vera van der","['Visser, M.', 'Pannekoek, J.N.', 'Middelkoop, H.A.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research on dementia has mainly focused on the cognitive impairments of the disease, whereas changes in emotional expressivity have received less attention. The present study used a second-person approach to examine differences in the natural emotional expressivity of people with dementia of different severities. This was done by observing natural interactions between a nursing staff member and 26 nursing home residents with mild, moderate, or severe dementia. The ten-minute conversations were recorded and the occurrence of typical nonverbal expressions of happiness (smiling, laughing), sadness (pouting mouth, looking away, sighing, crying), and anger (frowning, pressed mouth, raising voice) were labelled. Additionally, verbal expressions of emotions were labelled, based on typical signal words and sentences for each emotion (happiness, sadness, anger). It was expected that people with severe dementia showed fewer nonverbal expressions of happiness, and more expressions of sadness and anger, compared to people with mild to moderate dementia. Additionally, it was expected that people with severe dementia showed less discrepancy between verbally expressed emotions and nonverbally expressed emotions than people with mild to moderate dementia. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant increase in the expression of sadness between the mild (M = 194.43) and severe (M= 309.25) dementia group (p = .05). It was found that the severe group (M = 218.75) looked away significantly more than the mild dementia group (M = 121.57) (p = .01). Another repeated-measures ANOVA showed no significant differences between the dementia severity groups in the amount of discrepancy between verbally and nonverbally expressed emotions. Taken together, these findings indicate that people with severe dementia may express more sadness, whereas happiness and anger may stay the same across different severities. The results also suggest that the abilities to verbally and nonverbally express emotions do not decline at different rates in different disease stages. Taken together, the current study demonstrated that the second-person approach is an effective method for researching emotional expressivity of people with dementia. The findings may help family members and caregivers in understanding the emotional behaviour of individuals with dementia, which may improve care and quality of life outcomes.",
Political Ideology and Social Class: An Investigation into the Effects on Prosocial Behavior,"Heinz, Elena","['Van Doesum, N.', 'Lelieveld, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research has found significant effects of social class on prosocial behavior, but diverging findings for the influence of political ideology. In this study, the aim was to find out whether ideology influences prosociality towards people of a low or a high social class. This was investigated by conducting an online experiment with liberals and conservatives (N = 294), where they engaged in the social mindfulness (SoMi) task, which served as a measure for prosocial behavior. For the SoMi task, the participants were told to imagine they had an interaction partner who was either of a low social class or high social class. My hypotheses for this research were that liberals would treat targets of a low social class more prosocially than conservatives (H1), that conservatives would treat targets of a high social class more prosocially than liberals (H2) and that the tendencies towards low-class targets would be mediated by perceptions of deservingness and compassion towards them (H3). Although these hypotheses could not be confirmed, there was a significant effect of target class on social mindfulness, indicating that lower-class targets elicited more prosocial behavior than higher-class targets, in line with previous research. In addition to that, political ideology had a significant effect on social mindfulness when controlling for age, which showed that those identifying as very liberal acted more prosocially than those identifying as conservative.","['political ideology', 'social class', 'prosocial behavior', 'social mindfulness']"

Does the mHealth tool “The Box” influence Health Related Quality of Life in open heart surgery patients compared to standard care?,"Tilli, Renee","['Verhoeven, C', 'Janssen, V.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background Mobile health (mHealth), measuring physical data with medical devices at home, is often linked to patient satisfaction and improvements in measurable medical data like blood pressure, but improvements in mental health and usual functioning are often not considered. mHealth programme The Box combines measuring physical parameters with Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) to get a full scope on patients’ health after open heart surgery. The aim of this study was to compare HRQoL between cardiac patients following mHealth programme The Box and patients following standard care at 3 months after discharge. Methods Patients which underwent open heart surgery were assessed before their operation and 3 months after discharge with the EQ5D questionnaire, a five-dimension questionnaire (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The five dimensions can be calculated into an index score to compare HRQoL between and within groups, and the last question of the questionnaire provides the Perceived Overall Health (POH) score of a patient which can also be used to assess changes within and between groups. The Box group (n = 53) received mHealth for 3 months and a digital doctor’s visit, and the control group (n = 73) received standard care. Results Both The Box group (p = ,006) and the control group (p = ,005) improved over time in POH score, and The Box group also improved over time in index score (p = ,05). No significant differences in index score or POH score were found between the two groups after 3 months, when controlled for baseline values. However, the study did find a significant difference in The Box group over time for self-care (p = ,04) and usual activities (p = ,03). Conclusion Patients using mHealth do not have higher HRQoL than patients receiving standard care at 3 months, when controlling for baseline. However, self-care and usual activities did improve over time in The Box group. The Box does not perform better than standard care, but patients do improve on HRQoL over time. The improvement over time in combination with the improved accessibility of care, make mHealth a meaningful addition to health care.","['mHealth', 'cardiac patients', 'open heart surgery', 'Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)']"

Confirmation Bias in Reinforcement Learning and the Role of Regulatory Focus,"Habic, Vesna","['Sjoerds, Z.', 'Ghosh, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Studies linking confirmation bias and the spread of misinformation online have inspired us to research confirmation bias in reinforcement learning. Past research shows confirmation bias in reinforcement learning, as learners discount information opposing their beliefs, overestimating outcomes that confirm their choices. Furthermore, evidence suggests individual differences might be affecting confirmation bias. This thesis aimed to progress current research by establishing confirmation bias in reinforcement learning and investigating if regulatory focus affects it. We measured regulatory focus with a questionnaire and had participants complete a decision-based learning task. They learned from four possible outcomes: chosen positive, chosen negative, unchosen positive, unchosen negative. Confirmation bias was defined as a significantly higher preference for positive chosen and negative unchosen outcomes, meaning the outcomes that confirmed the learner’s choice. Our predictions were: 1. confirmation bias in reinforcement learning and 2. promotion and prevention focus will differ in their associations with confirmation bias. Our results showed no confirmation bias in learning, and we did not establish any associations between confirmation bias and regulatory focus. Results from our analyses contradicted what the previous research has shown. We discuss uncertainty, regret and attention as potential factors that affected the evaluation of outcomes in reinforcement learning. We believe all three factors affect the evaluation of information and can lead to other biased judgements apart from confirmation bias. We also discuss a notable methodological difference: our experiment was conducted remotely, online, instead of the usual laboratory conditions. We conclude that remote experiments benefit research, saving data collection time and possibly making the measurements more realistic, as participants do not directly interact with the researcher. Nonetheless, it is possible that because of the lack of laboratory conditions, mainly supervision, participants are less engaged in the task, which affects the quality of data collected.",

Stress van de zomertijd tijdens de COVID-19 pandemie: Effecten van leeftijd,"Mol, Marjolein de","['De Rover, M.', 'de Bruijn, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het coronavirus houdt Nederland al lange tijd in zijn greep. Dat jaarlijks in het laatste weekend van maart de klok een uur vooruit wordt gezet, maakt het er niet makkelijker op. De zomertijd is ingevoerd in 1916 en alhoewel een van de redenen het besparen van energie was, is hier weinig bewijs voor. Het verzetten van de klok kan een vermindering in slaapduur en het verlagen van de psychologische drempel voor stress tot gevolg hebben. Het is echter nog niet bekend wat de invloed is van de zomertijd op het slaap- en waakritme en het stressniveau in een tijd van COVID-19. In het huidige onderzoek is data verzameld van 21 maart344 tot en met 4 april. Het onderzoek begon met 51 participanten van 18 jaar en ouder. Een subset van 28 participanten zijn geanalyseerd voor de huidige onderzoeksvragen. Participanten hebben vragenlijsten ingevuld, om de stressniveaus, de impact van COVID-19 en het slaap-waakritme te kunnen bepalen. Participanten lieten na de zomertijd geen toename zien in stressniveau, er bleek geen significant verschil te zijn tussen jongvolwassenen en volwassenen en ook bleek de impact van COVID-19 niet groter te zijn voor jongvolwassenen. Bijna de helft van de participanten compenseerden voor het uur dat verzet door 27 maart op een eerder tijdstip naar bed te gaan. Bedtijden weken, na het ingaan van de zomertijd, af van de standaardtijd. Er is alleen bewijs gevonden voor het verband tussen het aantal uren slaap en het stressniveau van de participanten.",

How ostracism affects green consumer behaviour and the role of social identity of bystanders,"Steenvorden, Anne","['Bommel, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study focuses on the effect of ostracism and social identity of bystanders on pro-environmental consumer behaviour. It was expected that ostracised participants will display less pro-environmental consumer behaviour compared to included and overincluded participants, that the presence of pro-environmental bystanders lead to the most pro-environmental consumer behaviour, and the presence of anti-environmental bystanders to the least pro-environmental consumer behaviour. Additionally, it was expected that the difference between the pro- and anti-environmental bystanders in pro-environmental consumer behaviour is the largest for ostracised individuals and smallest for overincluded invidivuals. This online study included Cyberball to manipulate the level of inclusion and vignettes describing a shopping experience, including no bystanders, businessmen (anti-environmental) and healthcare workers (pro-environmental), to manipulate the social identity of bystanders. A choice test between an environmental-friendly or a conventional product (i.e. lamp, backpack, batteries) measured the pro-environmental consumer behaviour of the participants. The results provides evidence that the level of inclusion and the identity of bystanders does not seem to affect pro-environmental consumer behaviour. The gender differences and complexity of pro-environmental consumption provide enough opportunities for future research and new discoveries within this field.",

Improvement schemes and conservation initiatives often have negative environmental and socio-economic consequences, leading to all kinds of resistance. The present study was designed to determine how the influence of international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund is affecting (environmental) improvement schemes and shaping indigenous responses. This thesis is an essay in which I have put revised literature into conversation with each other. This study has found that the currently most dominant way of conceptualizing environmental matter – the discourse of sustainable development – is a persuasive slogan that disguises the capitalist end goals and neoliberal aspirations. Neoliberal environmental management, is not everything it promises to be and seems to be the rotten apple, spoiling true sustainability. Such environmental management in the name of development, accompanied by (unwanted) environmental and social impacts, leads to three kinds of responses: adaptation, resistance and protest.","['sustainable development', 'international financial institutions', 'discourse', 'environmental management', 'neoliberalism']"

However, underlying mechanisms are still left to be uncovered. This study opted to investigate one of these potential mechanisms, the diverse reaction of men’s and women’s self-esteem to social feedback. This study aimed to investigate gender differences in global trait self-esteem, as well as domain-specific state self-esteem in response to social feedback. This included an exploration of the role of the evaluator’s gender. Additionally, I assessed whether men expected to be liked more often by their evaluators and if the evaluators gender played a role. A sample of 214 young adults performed a social evaluation task in which they received approval, disapproval or no feedback on an online profile they created. After every 2-3 trials, they were asked to report on their self-esteem level. Results demonstrated no significant gender differences in global self-esteem, but men reported higher state self-esteem throughout the social evaluation task. Moreover, women’s self-esteem reacted more strongly to both social approval and disapproval. Self-esteem fluctuations of men and women did not depend on the raters’ gender. Compared to women, men expected more likes from all raters, but especially from other men. This study and following discussion support the notion that men have higher self-esteem and expect to be liked more by peers. Women on the other hand are more reactive to social feedback.",

Especially for pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) a sense of belonging is important in order to have positive experiences at school. The most important contributor to a sense of belonging at school is the staff-pupil interaction. The purpose of the current research is to investigate the relationship between a sense of belonging at school and staff-pupil interaction for pupils with ASD. The relationship will be investigated for boys and girls at primary school and secondary school. Participants are parents of 200 children with ASD between the age of three and seventeen years old. The parents filled in questionnaires about the well-being of their children in the school context. The current research showed that there is a strong positive relationship between sense of belonging at school and staff-pupil interaction for pupils with ASD. No differences were found in the levels of sense of belonging at school and staff-pupil interaction between boys and girls and between primary and secondary school.,"['ASD', 'Sense of Belonging', 'Staff-Pupil Interaction']"

Our self-esteem can be influenced by a lot of factors, intelligence – especially giftedness – being one. As we navigate through adolescence, a lot of things change, including our attachment. All these big shifts in our lives causes our self-esteem to fluctuate. The current study examined the impact of self-esteem on peer attachment, and whether giftedness affects this relationship. Participants included Dutch preadolescents (N = 96) that either attended a regular (N = 45) or a gifted (N = 51) primary school. Self-esteem and peer attachment were measured using the Competency Experience Scale Child (CBSK) and the Inventory of Peer and Parent Attachment (IPPA) respectively. These results were then compared between gifted and typically developing children using a linear regression analysis (LRA). The findings indicated a significant relationship between self-esteem and peer attachment for typically developing children, but a nonsignificant relationship for gifted children, suggesting that giftedness does influence this relationship. The current study emphasizes the need for more knowledge on giftedness.","['self-esteem', 'peer attachment', 'giftedness', 'preadolescents']"
From Economic Commodity to Societal Participant: Views on Female Empowerment in South Sudan,"Teeuwen, Annefleur","['Longo, M.', 'Vergerio, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examines the interpretation of the concept of female empowerment from two perspectives: that of local South Sudanese, both men and women, and that of Europeaid, the EU delegation in charge of a female empowerment project in South Sudan. In order to conduct this research, focus group discussions were held among the local South Sudanese, both men and women, and an in-depth interview was held with Anna Dmitrijewa, the programme manager of Europeaid’s South Sudanese delegation. This research expands the literature on female empowerment, as it is a unique case study conducted in a new nation state struggling with different views on gender roles in national law and customary law. It illustrates the comparability and discrepancy between Europeaid, as an outside party, and the local South Sudanese. All parties indicated that the economic side to female empowerment is relevant, though each group focused on economics differently. The South Sudanese women focused on economic autonomy and rights to property and inheritance, the South Sudanese men focused on making resources available, while both groups stayed cautiously away from social change. Europeaid focused very much on how economics can determine women’s social value and attempts to counter that, directly linking economic and social empowerment. Furthermore, the three parties all agreed that legal empowerment was necessary as a method to defend women’s rights, even though the parties did not have the same view on women’s rights. This research therefore illustrated that female empowerment, the format it should take, and its necessity was viewed differently by each party, particularly social empowerment being viewed as necessary by Europeaid, and unnecessary or even undesirable by the local men and women. Nevertheless, economics remained in the centre position for all parties.",

Western Balkan EU Accession Process: a Rocky Road or Trapped in the Waiting Room?,"Hogervorst, Louise","['Kursani, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the Western Balkan states became independent and wanted to become EU member states. The region consists of Kosovo, Serbia, Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2020, still, none of the countries in the West Balkan region have succeeded in entering the EU. Besides not having met all of the conditions for membership, there are other factors that hold the aspiring member states back, such as the non-recognition of five of the EU member states. Therefore the Balkan region is still in the EU’s ‘waiting room’. The existing literature cannot explain what is more important in the accession process of the Western Balkan states: the conditions or the cost-benefit analysis of the EU. The research question in this thesis is: what explains best Kosovo’s place in the EU’s ‘waiting room’: the unmet conditions by the Western Balkan state or the cost benefit calculations of the organization? Kosovo is a least-likely case for entering the EU and this case will be analyzed by interviews and literature analysis. The conclusion is that the cost-benefit calculations of the EU are more important than the unmet conditions, in the case of Kosovo.",

Associations between attachment styles and self-esteem fluctuations in response to social feedback in young adulthood,"Korelin, Anna","['Wever, M.', 'Will, G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Self-esteem is partially formed through social evaluations. After receiving approval from others, we feel better about ourselves. Attachment styles, the ways individuals relate to other people, influence both views of the self and how feedback from others is perceived. To understand how attachment styles impact on self-esteem responses to social feedback, the present study explored how approval and disapproval feedback affect self-esteem levels in young adults with different attachment styles. A sample (n = 48, 37 women, M age = 21.5) consisting of young adults performed a social evaluation task in which they predicted whether others would like them based on some information about their general tendency to like other people. Subsequently, participants received feedback about whether these people like them or not and then reported on their self-esteem repeatedly. Consistent with prior research, disapproval feedback lowered self-esteem, especially when it was unexpected. These self-esteem responses were not modulated by attachment styles. Securely attached individuals reported higher self-esteem and expected to be liked more often. Fearful-avoidant individuals reported lower self-esteem and less predictions to be liked. Anxious-preoccupied individuals reported less predictions to be liked. Together, these results show that attachment styles impact views of the self and others, but do not modulate self-esteem fluctuations in response to social feedback from strangers. The findings can be further implemented to understand how attachment styles impact self-esteem and how the nature of social feedback influences attachment system activation and self-esteem responses.","['attachment', 'self-evaluation', 'interpersonal perception', 'social approval']"

On the use of WeChat among Chinese international students to create a sense of home,"Uildriks, Tamara","['Pels, P.', 'Holsgens, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"WeChat is one of the most used social media in China. While few Dutch people use it, the app remains popular among the many Chinese students in the Netherlands. This popularity abroad evokes the question what this platform has to offer for people living in a different country and how it relates to a sense of ‘home’. Within social media research, a call is made to study social media using a non-media centric approach, focusing on the context in which it is used. Within this research, I study WeChat as used by three international Chinese students, and how they use WeChat to create a sense of home. Through digital observation and film, I examined how participants use WeChat, how they create a feeling of home while studying in the Netherlands, and the connection between these two. Overall, this study found that for a sense of home, relations, materiality, and a sense of security are important, for participants to both adjust to the Netherlands and recreate a sense of the ‘former home’. Their use of WeChat provides a tool to realise these different aspects.","['home', 'WeChat', 'belonging', 'materiality of belonging', 'social media', 'digital ethnography']"

Using a constructivist perspective, this thesis researches the relationship between foreign-policy and individual decision-makers. To do so, this thesis composes the belief-systems of Barack Obama and Donald Trump and provides an overview of their administration’s foreign-policy towards China. Thereby it uncovers the relationship between the two phenomena. The belief-systems are composed though qualitative narrative analysis of speeches, delivered by the men throughout their time as president. The overview of American foreign policy towards China is composed though an inductive analysis of official foreign-policy documents. My research findings indicate that, for this specific case, there is indeed a relationship between the belief-systems of Barack Obama and Donald Trump and their administration’s foreign-policy towards China. Although the nature of this research does not allow for generalization, this thesis proves that the relationship between belief-systems and foreign-policy is important to research.",
US Energy Security and the rise of China,"Hjorth, Yrsa","['Van Meegdenburg, H.', 'Nattar, K.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The study investigated through a theory-testing setup the notion of whether offensive neo-realist assumptions hold true in the case of US-energy considerations of its own energy security, something that has previously not been studied in the literature. The analysis did this in regards to China as the main adversary of the United States today. Through a process-type tracing method the paper analyzed three crises; the 1973 oil crisis, the 2000’s oil crisis and the 2000’s gas crisis over two subsequent presidential terms. The findings indicated that the offensive neo-realist assumptions of the US vigorously pursuing its own energy security and sabotaging China’s did not hold true. The findings did however show that the US still pursued its own energy security goals on the international arena in a moderate, yet assertive manner, more aligning with the theoretical tenets of defensive neorealism. Further research on whether or not the defensive neorealist findings hold true regarding US-China relations across time would be beneficial to the theoretical debate.","['US', 'China', 'offensive neorealism', 'defensive neorealism', 'energy security', 'international system']"
The Belarusian Boomerang. How the Belarusian democratic opposition influences the foreign policy of the European Union,"Steenbergen, Daphne","['Beck, F. M.', 'Van Meegdenburg, H.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to understand how the Belarusian democratic opposition influences the foreign policy of the European Union regarding Belarus by applying the boomerang pattern from Keck and Sikkink (1998) on the case. The main argument of the study is that the boomerang pattern has to be complemented with the theory of resource exchange to understand the mechanism behind the pattern. Resource exchange holds that influence over policy can be exchanged for a valuable resource. The mechanism is expected to work because transnational advocacy networks from a country neighbouring the EU have security as a valuable resource as stability at their home state enhances both domestic and European security. The research shows that the boomerang pattern is present between the Belarusian democratic opposition and the EU. Nonetheless, the thrown and caught boomerang are not similar because the resource of security is incorporated in the caught European boomerang and not in the thrown Belarusian boomerang. Therefore, the success of the boomerang pattern depends on the process and not on the resource presented by the transnational advocacy network to the international ally. In other words, the overlap between the presented and perceived resource determines the success of the boomerang pattern.",

EU Mediterranean Renewable Energy Policy: clean motives? Assessing drivers of EU renewable energy policy in its Southern Neighborhood,"Groot, Dennis de","['DeRock, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Environmental sustainability has become increasingly important in global politics and the promotion of renewable energy has received growing attention. Through its Southern European Neighborhood Policy, the European Union invests in renewable energy in the MENA region, which has long lagged behind global renewable energy production while having major renewable energy potential. Though the EU stresses partner state development and climate goals as drivers for the ENP policy, existing literature has critically assessed the intentions of the ENP as a whole, suggesting that more Eurocentric motives drive this policy. Another set of literature surrounds the geopolitics of renewable energy and the consequences based on them. Various geopolitical incentives have been attributed to renewable energy promotion. However, there has been little formal theorization concerning the motives behind the renewable energy policy of the European Southern Neighborhood Policy. This thesis seeks to assess the intentions of EU policy for renewable energy in its MENA partner region.",

Public affairs-kantoren en beïnvloeding in Den Haag,"Vermeulen, Felix","['Castenmiller, P.G.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie is onderzocht welke strategieën public affairs-kantoren hanteren om invloed uit te oefenen op de politieke besluitvorming op nationaal niveau in Nederland. Dat is gebeurd aan de hand van semigestructureerde interviews met acht public affairs-kantoren. Uit de resultaten blijken de participerende kantoren hetzelfde doel te hebben - politieke beïnvloeding -, daartoe een soortgelijke aanpak te hanteren en daarbij dezelfde lobbytargets voor ogen te hebben. Hierbij geven zij echter wel allemaal aan dat dit sterk kan variëren per casus en blijkt dat er ook tussen kantoren verschillende voorkeuren zijn wat betreft aanpak. Duidelijk is wel dat er één kader bestaat waarbinnen gewerkt wordt. In alle interviews kwam aan bod dat public affairs-kantoren de politiek proberen te beïnvloeden met een integrale aanpak die voorbij zogenaamd ‘ouderwets’ lobbyen kijkt, waarbinnen een keuzepakket aan te nemen stappen bestaat, die hoofdzakelijk gericht zijn op het beleidsproces en waarin het zwaartepunt ligt in de ambtelijke voorbereiding. Dit werpt een nieuw licht op activiteiten van lobbyisten omdat de focus in het kader van hun lobbyactiviteiten ten onrechte vaak gericht is op beïnvloeding van politieke en bestuurlijke kopstukken, in plaats van op de ambtelijke voorbereiding.",

Deze scriptie onderzoekt hoe de pers heeft kunnen functioneren tijdens de coronacrisis. Om erachter te komen dit functioneren heeft gewerkt tijdens de coronacrisis zijn zeven politiek journalisten geïnterviewd op semigestructureerde wijze. Uit de wetenschappelijke literatuur over het functioneren van de politieke pers blijken drie kernpraktijken: de politiek observeren, documenten analyseren en interviews afnemen. Dit onderzoek wijst erop dat het observeren van de politiek door journalisten niet goed heeft kunnen plaatsvinden omdat fysiek contact tussen politici en journalisten afgenomen is door de coronamaatregelen. Ook zijn drie kerntaken van de journalistiek vastgesteld: het informeren van het publiek, het uitdragen van de boodschappen van politici en het controleren van de overheid. Het informeren van het publiek is bemoeilijkt door de informatieachterstand en inhoudelijke eenzijdigheid die de coronacrisis meebrachten. Het controleren van de overheid is verstoord door diezelfde informatieachterstand en door het verschuiven van de macht van coalitie naar kabinet, waar journalisten moeilijker ingangen lijken te vinden. Dit onderzoek concludeert dat er aanwijzingen zijn dat het functioneren van de politieke journalistiek in Nederland in bijna al haar facetten is aangetast. In de toekomst dient aandacht te worden besteed aan de informatiepositie van de journalistiek als de macht verschuift van coalitie naar kabinet.",

We test the prediction that a focus on discovery of new information vs a focus on specific information that is missing creates more interest, more motivation to explore, and less confusion towards complex innovations, while perceived complexity is predicted to remain the same. In total 102 participants were tested. They were presented with message framing manipulation, which put their focus on either general discovery or specific information that is missing, after which they had to read texts containing complex information. In contrast to our expectations, complexity did not remain the same across conditions. Participants in the diversive frame condition rated the information about the innovations to be more complex than the specific frame condition. Moreover, participants in the diversive frame condition were not more interested, more motivated to and less confused about the complex innovations than in the specific frame condition. Implication and future research of these findings are discussed at the end.","['interest', 'complexity', 'novelty', 'curiosity', 'complex innovation']"
