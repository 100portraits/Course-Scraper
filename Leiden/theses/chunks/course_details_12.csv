The effects of expectation and task-relevance on sensory processing in conscious perception,"Lagerman, Jet","['Gaal, S. de', 'Fahrenfort, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Identical sensory input may be perceived differently, based on expectations and goals. For example, object recognition is facilitated for expected or task-relevant objects. At the same time, unexpected objects are found to elicit a stronger neural response. These effects can be explained by predictive coding accounts of visual processing, presenting perception as a process of minimizing the difference between predicted and observed sensory input. However, as expectation and task-relevance are often conflated, it is insufficiently clear how these factors influence sensory processing in conscious perception. The current study aimed to investigate the relative influence of expectation and task-relevance on behavioral and neural measures of perception. During two EEG sessions, participants performed a task in which they discriminated between masked face and house images while we independently manipulated expectation and task-relevance. We find that images were more often correctly recognized when they were expected or task-relevant. In addition, we used multivariate pattern analysis to show that a classifier trained on sensory representations of face and house stimuli is better able to distinguish between expected or task-relevant face and house images than between unexpected or task-irrelevant images. These results suggest that expectation and task-relevance have independent effects on sensory processing. Finally, our results show that cue-based manipulations may activate sensory templates even before stimulus onset. We therefore recommend that future studies manipulate expectation and task-relevance without the use of explicit cues.","['visual perception', 'expectation', 'task-relevance', 'electroencephalography', 'predictive coding', 'consciousness']"

The Four-in-a-row task as a measure for complex planning in development.,"Looij, Bart van der","['Ma, I.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The four-in-a-row task is a planning task that was recently developed with the aim to measure the psychological construct of complex planning. Planning becomes more complex with an increase in the number of futures to anticipate, which consequently makes it more difficult to measure. Previous measurements have been proven insufficient in measuring complex planning. The current study aims to establish the construct validity of the four-in-a-row task, by investigating if performance on the task can be predicted by age related improvements in planning abilities, as measured by the subscale ‘anticipation of future consequences’ (AFC) of the Future Orientation Scale (FOS) (Steinberg, 2009). In the current study 150 American participants took part in an online testing session, in which they played 35 four-in-a-row games against a computer opponent that adjusted the difficulty level to the playing strength of the participant using a staircasing algorithm, and filled out the FOS. The participants’ reaction times and the difficulty setting of the computer opponents during their final three games were used as a measure of performance on the task. It was found that both reaction times and the difficulty setting of the computer opponent increased with age. Furthermore, it was found that age in interaction with the AFC score was able to predict both reaction times and the difficulty setting of the computer opponent, indicating a difference in how different age groups with strong planning abilities perform on the four-in-a-row task. As the findings of the current study underline the promise and importance of the four-in-a-row task as a measuring method for complex planning, several recommendations for future research are offered.",

Studies have shown that psychosocial factors might influence nocebo hyperalgesia and facilitate nocebo responses in clinical settings, thus worsening pain. This study aimed to identify whether social stress, fear of pain and pain catastrophizing influence the magnitude of nocebo hyperalgesia. Higher nocebo hyperalgesic responses were anticipated. Additionally, the potential mediating role of subjective stress was explored. Twenty-five healthy male and female participants were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental (social stress) and control (no-stress) conditions, which underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a friendly version of it (friendly-TSST), correspondingly. Fear of pain and pain catastrophizing were measured with the Fear of Pain Questionnaire-III and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Subjective stress was measured on a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale. A sham electrical stimulation device was applied to induce nocebo along with negative verbal suggestions of pain worsening. Thermal pain stimuli were paired with ON (nocebo trial) and OFF (control trial) visual signs during the acquisition and testing blocks of nocebo conditioning. The first nocebo and control trials of the testing block were compared to estimate the extent of nocebo hyperalgesia. One-way ANOVA, simple linear regression and mediation analysis with the method of bootstrapping were applied (P < 0.05). The one-way ANOVA was non-significant between the social stress and no-stress conditions (P = 0.74). Regression results were non-significant for fear of pain (B = - 0.38, P = 0.11) and pain catastrophizing (B = - 0.30, P = 0.22). Mediation analysis for subjective stress revealed a non significant indirect effect of - 0.009 (95% BCa CI [-1.10, 0.68]). Our study suggests that social stress does not appear to increase the magnitude of nocebo hyperalgesia and that fear of pain and pain catastrophizing might not predict higher nocebo hyperalgesic responses. In addition, subjective stress may not mediate the relationship between social stress and nocebo hyperalgesia. In conclusion, as social stress, fear of pain, pain catastrophizing and subjective stress can co-occur in clinical practices, future research could examine their potential cumulative effect on nocebo hyperalgesia.","['nocebo hyperalgesi', 'Trier Social Stress test', 'social stress', 'fear of pain', 'pain catastrophizing.']"

The relationship between experienced itch and avoidance of itch-related stimuli in male and female psoriasis patients,"Dannenburg, Olga","['Laarhoven, A.I.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current research aimed at finding a link between the amount of experienced clinical itch and amount of avoidance in male and female psoriasis patients. Itch due to psoriasis can cause decreased quality of life. However, research on the physiological effects of itch and psoriasis is limited. Based on a pain related theoretical framework it was deemed possible that avoidance of itch related cues might be present in psoriasis patients. Information from this research might be relevant for attention-related therapy for itch patients. First, it was expected that psoriasis patients avoided itch-related stimuli (H1). Secondly, it was expected that these avoidance reactions were predicted by the amount of experienced clinical itch. (H2). Thirdly, it was expected that male gender had a stronger moderating effect on this relationship (H3). Lastly, it was expected that male gender predicts the amount of avoidance stronger (H4). This was measured in a sample of N=49, of which 53.1% were male, through an approach-avoidance task (AAT) with itch and non-itch related pictures and faster reaction times indicating stronger approach or avoidance. Experienced clinical itch was measured through a self-report item on the ISDL. Statistical analyses were performed with two regression analyses, a paired samples t-test and a moderation analysis. No significant effects were found and all hypotheses were rejected. From the current research did not appear a link between the amount of experienced clinical itch and avoidance reactions. This did not differ between gender. Future research including patients suffering from moderate to severe itch (as opposed to the current sample), a larger sample size and avoidance measurements with a higher reliability is recommended.",

Secondly, we tested whether the emotional load of the communication in the vignette (neutral vs. enhanced) moderates the effects of vignette modality on emotional response and engagement. Methods Vignette modality (text, audio, or video) and emotional load of the vignette (neutral or enhanced) were varied in an online, experimental 2 x 3 within and between subject’s design. Healthy, cancer naive students (n = 208) were recruited as analogue patients and randomly assigned to one of the six conditions. All analogue patients were questioned about their state anxiety and engagement in the vignette using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Short Form and Video Engagement Scale. Results No difference was found in analogue patients’ emotional response (F(2, 205) = 1.441, p = 0.239) to the vignette, and engagement (F(2, 205) = 0.895, p = 0.410) with the vignette, when comparing the different vignette modalities. In addition, emotional load (neutral or enhanced) did not moderate the effects of vignette modality on emotional response (F(2, 202) = 0.391, p = 0.677) or engagement (F(2, 202) = 1.438, p = 0.240). Conclusion and implication The current study results suggest that it does not matter which modality is used when studying analogue patients‘ emotional response and engagement in vignette studies. We recommend repeating this study with a different analogue patient group (broader age range and/or patient population).",

Psychotropic prescription drugs are a critical tool in treating and controlling a variety of psychopathological conditions, which raises concern in terms of potential overuse and irrational use. Available data regarding the use and prescribing practices of psychotropic prescription drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic are inconsistent. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of investigating the change in psychotropic prescription drug use and dispensing in relation to COVID-19. Pub-med and Web of Science Databases were systematically searched, and a total of 30 studies were included (23 prevalence estimates, and 19 correlation coefficient estimates; total N = 5,133,032). The yielded findings demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 16.34% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 9.11 to 23.57) in prevalence estimates of psychotropic prescription drug use. Furthermore, the conducted meta-analysis yielded a small positive statistically significant correlation r = 0.11 (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.16), implying a small increase in psychotropic prescription drug use and dispensing pre relative to post COVID-19. The association between COVID-19 and adverse mental health, as well as the increased use of psychotropic medications, may lead to an upsurge in substance use related disorders and overdose-related deaths. This is important to know, given that many substance use treatment programs during the pandemic have been disrupted. It may be essential for policy makers and health officials to address mental and behavioral health through telemedicine.","['COVID-19', 'psychotropic prescription drugs', 'psychopharmacology', 'prescribing', 'dispensing', 'systematic review', 'meta-analysis']"

THE VOLUNTEER’S DILEMMA: The influence of observability and dependence on cooperative behaviour,"Rubingh, Fiona","['Kwaadsteniet, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objectives. In this study, the impact of observability and dependence on one’s willingness to cooperate has been investigated. Therefore, a volunteer’s dilemma was set up: a dilemma in which only one person from a group needs to make a sacrifice in order to create a benefit for the collective. Method. In total, 147 participants (aged 19-66) were divided over four different conditions. Each participant was asked to volunteer or not, in order to complete the group task. All participants belonged to a subgroup within a larger group. Subsequently, the decisions that were made by participants belonging to the dependence condition, also had consequences for the larger group. Participants in the observability condition, were being observed while making this volunteering decision. Participants in the Obs & Dep condition were both being observed and their decisions also had consequences for the larger group. Finally, a control condition was set up in which participants were neither being observed, nor dependent. Results. Participants belonging to the dependence condition did not volunteer significantly more compared to the non-dependence conditions. This was not in line with the hypothesis. Participants belonging to the observability condition, were also expected to volunteer significantly more. Against expectations, participants belonging to the observability condition, did not volunteer significantly more than was found in the non-observability conditions. Finally, a hypothesis was set up stating that most volunteering was expected to be found in the Obs & Dep condition. Results showed two unexpected significant results: participants in the control condition and the observability condition, volunteered significantly more compared to the Obs & Dep condition. Conclusions. None of the hypotheses that were set up beforehand, were confirmed. The conditions participants belonged to, did not cause the expected effects. It is possible that the sample that was used, already consisted of cooperative participants themselves. This is why the conditions people belonged to, could not make a significant difference. Further research is necessary to investigate whether our variables would make a difference when another sample is used and to investigate what the influence of an online setting exactly is.",

Does mood mediate the relationship between sleep and short-term suicidal ideation? A case study,"Chousou, Kleopatra","['Putman, P.', 'Kivelä, L.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research so far has shown that sleep is associated with and can predict suicidal ideation. One potential mediating variable in this relationship is mood, while studies have shown that mood is associated with both sleep and suicidal ideation. However, there is no known study so far on this topic. Therefore, the present single-case study aims at testing the mediation effect of mood on the relationship between sleep and short-term suicidal ideation using the Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) method. Both subjective and objective sleep quality measures were included. The study lasted 21 days, and the participant had to complete a short online questionnaire four times per day, administered on their phone. The questionnaire collected self-reported data on subjective sleep quality, mood, and suicidal ideation. Objective sleep quality was assessed using an actiwatch positioned on the participant's hand. Our hypotheses were that both objective and subjective poor sleep quality would lead to a subsequent decrease in positive mood over the day, which, in turn, would be associated with short-term (daily) increases in suicidal ideation. Two first-order autoregressive (AR[1]) multilevel models were developed, testing for each of the two sleep parameters separately. Statistical analyses revealed non-significant effects of both subjective and objective sleep quality on mood and suicidal ideation. However, results showed a significant effect of mood on suicidal ideation. This finding supports the importance of mood associations with suicidal ideation. We suggest that future research further explores the mediation effect of mood on the relationship between sleep and short-term suicidal ideation using larger samples and broader-item sleep scales.","['Sleep quality', 'mood', 'mediation effect', 'suicidal ideation', 'Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)']"
The influence of stressful events and momentary optimism on real-time suicidal ideation: A case study,"Kalshoven, Bente","['Putman, P.', 'Kivelä, L.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Suicide forms a leading cause of death in the world, but much remains unknown about the daily risk factors for it. Stressful events are known to precede suicide attempts, but no conclusions can be drawn about the proximal effect of stress on suicidal ideation and behavior. In addition, promising protective factors against stress and suicidal ideation, such as optimism, are yet to be studied in real-time. This case study aimed to discover more about the effect of stress on momentary suicidal ideation and whether optimism could protect an individual from the effects of stress. Methods: One participant was followed in daily life for 21 consecutive days, completing ecological momentary assessment (EMA) through a mobile phone app four times a day. EMA assessed stressful events, level of suicidal ideation and level of optimism. Simple linear regression analysis was performed to study the effect of stress on suicidal ideation and moderation analysis was performed to study the protective effect of optimism. Results: Stress was associated with momentary levels of suicidal ideation, with more stressful events being associated with more severe suicidal ideation. Optimism did not moderate the relationship between stress and suicidal ideation. Optimism independently was associated with momentary levels of suicidal ideation. Conclusions: Stress formed a significant risk factor for momentary suicidal ideation in a case study of daily predictors of suicidal ideation. Further replications of this study are needed to generalize the findings, but including stress management in treatment for suicidal symptoms might be particularly beneficial.","['suicidal ideation', 'stress', 'optimism', 'ecological momentary assessment']"

"The effect of brands competence and morality on purchase intention, loyalty, and gender","Hohmann, Leonard Alexander","['Wirtz, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Brand personality displays one of the most important subjects a brand has to manage to be perceived well by its customers. However, besides “competence”, past literature failed to identify “morality” as an essential brand personality and its possible impact on consumers’ behaviour. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between brands morality, brands competence, and consumers purchase intention. Further, brands loyalty and gender’s possible moderating effect on brands personality and purchase intention are analysed. Data was collected through a questionnaire consisting of 92 items, and answers from 185 respondents are analysed using correlational and regression analysis. The results suggest a positive relation between brands morality and both purchase intention and brand loyalty. Further, brands competence also displays a positive relation between both brand loyalty and purchase intention. No significant moderating effect of gender on brand personality and purchase intention is found. Finally, implications for brand management and future research are discussed.",
Moral Behaviour over Competence: The differing effects of brand morality and brand competence on brand loyalty as mediated by brand trust.,"Akhremchyk, Lada","['Wirtz, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Consumer behaviour and attitudes towards a brand have long been important for companies, therefore research has been very interested as to which variables affect consumer outcomes. Through the Brands as Intentional Agents Framework brands can be judged by certain personality characteristics just as a person. Most prior research has investigated the effects of brand warmth and brand competence on consumer outcomes, but here it is suggested to replace brand warmth with brand morality. Morality is becoming increasingly relevant to consumers and therefore this research intends to look at its effect, isolated from the other components of warmth. The study is survey-based (n=97), and a linear regression analysis was used to gain insight into the role of brand morality and brand competence in predicting two types of brand loyalty (cognitive and affective). Results confirm expectations that brand morality and brand competence significantly predict brand loyalty, with brand morality being the better predictor of the two. Still, significant results are not found for all included brands. Various implications for brand practice and future research are discussed.",
The Perception of Brand Personalities: The prediction of Purchase Intention by Perceived Brand Competence and Morality of Five Popular 21st Century Brands.,"Broersma Retavisca, Nicole","['Wirtz, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Brand personality research has focused on the perception of warmth and competence; however, literature has identified two sub-components of warmth: sociability and morality. In social and organization research, morality has been more influential than sociability and competence on evaluations and judgements. In consumer research, there is vast evidence showing the importance of competence on brand perception, however, there is limited information on the role of morality and how this influences consumer responses. For this reason, the current study (N = 105) investigated whether perceived brand morality and competence predicted purchase intention. Five global brands were evaluated through the use of an online self-report questionnaire. Both morality and competence were positively and equally related to purchase intention. Results further showed that elevation had no effect mediating the relationship between morality and purchase intention. This study gives insight into the role of morality on brand perception rather than warmth as a whole.",
Purchase Intention and the Relation with Brand Morality and Competence,"Schotanus, Jilske","['Wirtz, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Brand personality has been proven to influence consumer responses. A two dimensional model of warmth and competence is often utilized to study brand personality. However, the dimension of warmth consists of the components sociability and morality. In the current study, the relation between perceived brand morality and competence with purchase intentions is investigated, with brand trust and brand identification as possible mediators. Four hypotheses were tested with a survey (N = 105) evaluating five global brands. Results generally supported the hypotheses and showed that both perceived morality and competence predicted purchase intention, and brand trust was found to mediate both relations. Brand identification did not mediate the relation of competence and morality with purchase intention. This study can be used to optimize branding and advertising, as it provides an in-depth and specific understanding of the effects of brand competence, morality, and trust on consumer-brand relationships and resulting consumer responses.",

Perceived procedural fairness and local acceptance of wind park projects: The effect of voice in decision-making on perceived procedural fairness and local acceptance of wind park projects,"Esther, Durieux","['Mors, E. ter']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"n order to reach the goals of the international climate treaty, many wind parks must be built to reduce CO2 emissions. These wind park projects however, face a lot of resistance from local residents. This experimental scenario study examined what the effect is of giving local residents voice (voice vs. no voice vs. pseudo-voice) in the decision-making process of a wind park project on how local residents perceive the procedural fairness and to what extent they are willing to accept the project. The study also examined whether the effects of voice procedure on project acceptance are mediated by perceived procedural fairness. To examine these effects an experimental scenario study was conducted among residents of the United Kingdom (N = 168). Voice procedure (voice vs. no voice vs. pseudo-voice) was manipulated with a scenario followed by a survey. I predicted and found that offering local residents voice in decisionmaking leads to higher perceived procedural fairness, and as a result to higher project acceptance compared to local residents in the no voice or pseudo-voice situations. Furthermore, I predicted that the no voice situation would lead to higher perceived procedural fairness and project acceptance than the pseudo-voice situation. However, I did not find a significant difference on project acceptance, and the pseudo-voice situation led to higher perceived procedural fairness than the no voice situation",

Dit onderzoek bestond uit 199 deelnemers die woonachtig waren in het Verenigd Koninkrijk. Afhankelijk van de experimentele conditie lazen de deelnemers dat de inbreng van omwonenden omtrent het windmolenpark al dan niet werd gevraagd en in acht werd genomen. Ik verwachtte en vond dat inspraak aan omwonenden leidde tot meer waargenomen procedurele rechtvaardigheid en meer project acceptatie dan geen inspraak of pseudo inspraak. Daarnaast verwachtte en vond ik dat het positieve effect van inspraak (vs. geen inspraak, pseudo inspraak) op project acceptatie werd gemedieerd door waargenomen procedurele rechtvaardigheid. Verder verwachtte ik dat geen inspraak zou leiden tot meer waargenomen procedurele rechtvaardigheid dan pseudo inspraak, maar ik vond het tegenovergestelde verband. Tot slot verwachtte ik dat geen inspraak zou leiden tot meer project acceptatie dan pseudo inspraak, maar ik vond geen significant verschil. Deze studie toont het belang aan van het raadplegen van de mening van omwonenden, zodat omwonenden procedurele rechtvaardigheid waarnemen en het windmolenpark accepteren.",
The Effect of Voice in Project Development on Perceived Procedural Fairness and Trust in the Project Developer in the Context of Wind Park Siting,"Wille, Lara","['Wirtz, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This experimental scenario study, involving 176 UK participants, examined how the extent of voice opportunity affects residents’ perceptions of procedural fairness of the decision-making process and trust in the project developer in the context of planning a wind park close to their town. Furthermore, it explored the effects of voice opportunity on perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer. By means of a fictitious scenario, participants were allocated to one of three different conditions (voice, no-voice and pseudo-voice) with varying degrees of voice opportunity in the planning process. A questionnaire was used to measure perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer. As predicted, giving people a voice in the planning process, compared to no-voice and pseudo-voice, had a positive effect on perceived procedural fairness which again had a positive effect on trust in the project developer. Further, it was predicted that offering people pseudo-voice would result in lower perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer than not offering a voice opportunity. However, results showed that offering pseudo-voice resulted in more perceived procedural fairness than not offering a voice opportunity, whereas no difference in trust in the project developer was found between pseudo-voice and no-voice. The findings support that offering genuine voice is vital for perceived procedural fairness and fostering trust the project developer. Limitations and indications for future research are discussed.",

An experimental survey was completed by participants (N = 168) from the United Kingdom. They read an experimental scenario in which they were asked to imagine that they were residents of a fictitious town in which a wind farm was being implemented. The participants were randomly allocated to either the voice, no voice or pseudo voice in decision-making condition. I hypothesized and found that having a voice in decision-making resulted in higher project acceptance, perceived procedural fairness, and trust in the project developer compared to no voice or pseudo voice in decision-making. Further, the positive effects of voice in decision-making (vs. no voice vs. pseudo voice) on project acceptance, as predicted, were mediated by perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer. Finally, the project acceptance, perceived procedural fairness, and trust in the project developer were the same for pseudo voice and no voice in decision-making. This study implies that it is important to provide the local public a genuine voice in the decision-making process of a wind farm’s implementation.

The present study experimentally investigated the effect of local residents' “voice” on perceived procedural fairness of the decision-making procedure and willingness to accept the wind energy project's implementation. An online survey was published on Prolific, in which participants (N = 199) were asked to sympathize with a fictitious town where they were residents and a wind farm project was planned. The experimental conditions were; no-voice, voice and pseudo-voice. The amount of “say” the residents had in the decision-making process of the project and whether their input was taken into account, differed between conditions. I hypothesized and found that participants who had an opportunity to voice their opinion and had their ideas implemented, perceive the decision-making process as more fair than those who were in a no-voice or pseudo-voice situation. Contrary to my prediction, participants in the pseudo-voice situation perceived the process as more fair (instead of less fair) than those in the no-voice situation. As predicted, the voice situation led to a greater willingness to accept the project than the pseudo-voice and slightly higher than the no-voice situation. I further predicted that the no-voice situation would lead to higher acceptance than the pseudo-voice situation, but found no difference in acceptance between the two conditions. Finally, the results provided evidence for the idea that effects of voice procedure on project acceptance are mediated by perceived procedural fairness of the decision-making process when comparing voice to pseudo-voice and no-voice situations.","['voice', 'pseudo-voice', 'wind energy', 'procedural fairness', 'project acceptance']"

Previous research has shown that perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer are important factors in the implementation of wind parks and can decrease opposition. The present experimental scenario survey study (N = 176) among UK respondents examined whether giving local residents voice (vs. no voice vs. pseudo-voice) in the project implementation, can positively influence perceived procedural fairness of the decision-making process, and in this way increase trust in the project developer. In line with our predictions, we found that having voice resulted in higher perceived procedural fairness of the decision-making process, and as a result higher trust in the project developer, compared to no voice and pseudo-voice. Also, we found that having pseudo-voice led to higher perceived procedural fairness of the decision-making process than no voice. Contradictory with our prediction that no voice would result in higher trust in the project developer than pseudo-voice, we found that trust in the project developer was higher for no voice than pseudo-voice. Additional analyses showed that this effect was mediated by perceived procedural fairness. This surprising finding highlights the importance of the ability for local residents to have voice in decision-making projects, and the detrimental effects on perceived procedural fairness and trust in the project developer when people think their input is not taken into account. To get a clearer understanding on how these effects of pseudo-voice work, more research should be performed.",

In 2018 (before the pandemic), in 2020 (first peak, just after the first restrictions in the Netherlands) and in 2021 (third peak, to study long-term-effects), vitality and psychological flexibility were assessed. Analysis of variance, controlling for age, gender, education and marital status, showed that vitality was significantly higher in 2020 (EM mean = 46.29) compared to before the pandemic (2018, EM mean = 44.89, p = .009) and in long-term lockdown (2021, EM mean = 45.08, p = .002), but the effect size was small (partial η² = .004). There was a significant large effect of psychological flexibility on vitality (p < .001, partial η² = .176). An interaction effect of psychological flexibility and year was studied and no significant results were found (p = .942), meaning there was no difference in the effect of year on vitality between people with higher PF and lower PF. These results suggest a small effect of the pandemic but a large effect of psychological flexibility on vitality with no difference between the three years.",
"The link between stress and physical wellbeing during the pandemic, and how psychological flexibility might benefit this relationship","Vermeulen, Yulin","['Koppert, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a global health crisis that continues to demand different forms and levels of measures to protect general health. Previous research has linked the crisis to increases in stress. Stress, however, has been proven to negatively influence physical health. This study hypothesized that feeling more stressed during COVID-19 (compared to normal levels) would be related to worse physical health. Furthermore, this study hypothesized that psychological flexibility would buffer this relationship. The study was carried out with a questionnaire that was spread through social media. The questionnaire was spread at two moments (March to April in both 2020 and 2021), and measured stress level during COVID-19 in comparison to normal, physical health (SF-36), and psychological flexibility (FIT-60). The study was a non-clinical convenience sample (N = 2755) made up mostly of highly educated young women. More than half of respondents reported to feel at least a little bit more stressed than normal. Feeling more stressed than normal was associated with lower physical wellbeing (P < 0.0001). Psychological flexibility was a significant predictor of physical wellbeing (P < 0.0001) but was not a significant buffer (P = 0.251). The results show that many people report to feel more stressed during the pandemic, and this in turn is negatively associated with physical wellbeing. Furthermore, our findings suggest that enhanced psychological flexibility could improve physical wellbeing in the population. The exact relationship between stress, physical wellbeing, and psychological flexibility is a subject of further research.",
Psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,"Poeran, Ajay","['Koppert, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has changed the lives of many people around the world. The measures taken by governments to limit the spread of the virus created negative stressors which can eventually lead to negative consequences in the long term for the human capital. Factors such as social isolation, restrictions on sports facilities and gyms led to a substantial decrease in physical activity during the pandemic. These changes and measures could especially be difficult to handle for people with certain diseases, such as people suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) since the condition is already linked to a variety of negative stressors such as negative life events, occupational problems, and an overactive lifestyle. Not much research has been done into the effects of the negative stress during times of COVID-19 on patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The purpose of the current study is to assess whether physical health declines during times of COVID-19 and whether the physical health of patients with CFS declines more rapidly than people without CFS during times of COVID-19. The second main goal is to investigate whether the negative effects of COVID-19 stress on physical health could be buffered by psychological flexibility through mindfulness. A survey is used to collect data regarding the physical wellbeing and psychological flexibility of the Dutch population at three separate time frames, 2018, 2020, and 2021. The data from the survey is analyzed through an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The physical health of patients with CFS seemed to be lower each year compared to the non-CFS group. Contrary to what was expected, physical health increased throughout the years for people without CFS, while the physical health of people with CFS remained relatively stable. Lower mindfulness was associated with lower levels of physical health. These could implicate the importance of increasing mindfulness through, for instance, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).",

Compared to the data in 2018, young adults did not have lower levels of mental health in 2020. But mental health was reduced during the second peak in 2021. According to the analysis, higher levels of psychological flexibility did not buffer the effects of the pandemic on mental health in 2020, but it did buffer in 2021. Overall the results suggest that the mental health of young adults reduces during the COVID-19 pandemic and that psychological flexibility can, on long term, have a buffering role on mental health for young adults during COVID-19.",

Verwacht werd dat er meer stress werd ervaren naarmate de pandemie langer aanhield, en dat het mentaal welbevinden lager was tijdens (2020 en 2021) dan voor de pandemie (2018). Uit eerder onderzoek is gebleken dat het accepteren van stressvolle situaties voor een hoger mentaal welbevinden zorgt. Daarom werd verwacht dat acceptatie als buffer voor stress werkt tijdens de pandemie. Het onderzoek bestond uit een online vragenlijst met de Short Form health survey en de Flexibiliteitsindex test, afgenomen op drie momenten (2018, 2020 en 2021). Er is een significant verschil gevonden in de hoeveelheid stress die wordt ervaren naarmate de pandemie langer aanhield, maar omdat de bevolking in 2020 en 2021 gemiddeld tussen ‘niet meer/minder gestrest’ en ‘een beetje meer gestrest’ scoorde, is de afname in stress tijdens de pandemie niet sterk. Het mentaal welbevinden verschilt niet significant tussen 2018, 2020 en 2021; ondanks de pandemie blijft het mentaal welbevinden gelijk. Acceptatie zorgt voor een beter mentaal welbevinden, maar er kan geen conclusie gemaakt worden over acceptatie als buffer voor stress tijdens de pandemie. De sample van dit onderzoek is echter niet homogeen; er zijn significant meer vrouwen, hoogopgeleiden en mensen in een relatie",

Stress en mentaal welbevinden bij mensen met ernstig overgewicht ten tijde van het Coronavirus,"Donk, Odette van der","['Koppert, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Omdat ernstig overgewicht een van de risicofactoren is voor een ernstiger verloop van COVID-19, is het van belang om onderzoek te verrichten naar de mentale gezondheid en het stressniveau van deze groep. Twee afzonderlijke vragenlijsten (SF 36 en FIT-60) zijn afgenomen bij Nederlandse respondenten vóór (2018, N = 531) en tijdens de Coronapandemie (2020-2021, N = 3191). De groep met ernstig overgewicht ( N = 168) is vergeleken met de groep zonder ernstig overgewicht op stress en mentaal welzijn (N = 3146) terwijl er gecontroleerd werd voor leeftijd, geslacht, opleidingsniveau en burgerlijke stand. De interactie cohort x ernstig overgewicht is meegenomen om te onderzoeken of er met name voor mensen met ernstig overgewicht een verschil te zien was in het mentaal welzijn ten tijde van de pandemie vergeleken met ervoor. De interactie cohort x mindfulness is daarnaast meegenomen om te onderzoeken of mindfulness helpt omgaan met Covid-gerelateerde stress. De bevindingen van de huidige studie tonen aan dat mensen met ernstig overgewicht significant meer Covid-gerelateerde stress ervaarden dan mensen zonder ernstig overgewicht. De resultaten tonen echter geen significant verschil aan in mentaal welzijn tussen deze twee groepen. Er was geen significant verschil te zien in mentaal welzijn tussen de jaren voor zowel mensen met als zonder ernstig overgewicht. Wel 3 blijkt mindfulness een significante voorspeller voor mentaal welzijn te zijn, hoewel mindfulness niet persé effectiever is tijdens de Coronapandemie.",
The impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric patients’ mental health and the influence of psychological flexibility,"Kooijman, Suzanne","['Koppert, T.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"OBJECTIVES: Worry and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can worsen psychiatric patients’ mental well-being. The objective is determining the psychological impact of the pandemic on people with and without a psychiatric disorder, and to establish whether psychological flexibility buffers this impact. METHODS: Data from three separate online surveys in the Dutch population in 2018 (pre pandemic), 2020 and 2021 (both during the pandemic) was analysed for people with (psychiatric group, n = 434) and without (control group, n = 2871) a psychiatric disorder. COVID-related worry and stress (measured in 2020, 2021), mental well-being and psychological flexibility levels were analysed with covariate-adjusted analysis of variance. RESULTS: The 2021 levels of COVID-related stress and worry were compared with those of 2020. The psychiatric group was more stressed and worried than the control group. These levels were higher in 2021 than 2020. However, compared to the 2018 sample, the level of mental well-being was higher during the pandemic for people with a psychiatric disorder, though it was lower for the control group. Psychological flexibility did not moderate interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric patients reported heightened levels of worry and more stress than usual during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their mental well-being was better during the pandemic compared to before. No buffering effect for psychological flexibility was found. From the results we conclude that the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric patients seems small. However, we did not differentiate between disorders. The results suggest general psychological care can be sufficient for most psychiatric patients.",

This ability is called interference control, a cognitive function that is not fully developed until adulthood (Nigg, 2000). The aim of the current study was to investigate whether immature interference control of children are indeed the underlying reason behind the interference effect observed on Stroop-like tasks. This was done by calculating children’s, adolescents’ and adults’ stability of reaction times and interference effects within a single testing session. Data from the performance on four different Stroop-like paradigms (colour-object; positionobject; number-object; and picture-word) of participants from five age groups (6, 8, 12, 16, and 20 years old) was used to carry out this investigation. It was predicted that, overall, there would be a stability of reaction times and interference effects across two session halves. Furthermore, it was predicted that the stability of interference effect would vary when comparing different age groups and experimental paradigms, with older age groups showing more stability and greater variability between paradigms. Results of the current study found an asymmetrical result with evidence for high within-session stability of reaction time with no effect of age or paradigm and less strong, albeit similar, results for interference effects.",

Accordingly, this study examined among financial donors of charitable organizations a) whether violation of the psychological contract undermines the willingness to donate money to the charitable organization, and b) the psychological processes that may make financial donors perceive a violation of the psychological contract. The research participants were members of the Amazon Mechanical Turk online platform who adopted the role of financial donor (n = 91). The research had a consecutive 1X2 experimental design. Specifically, the participants were first randomly allocated across the experimental condition about investment of the organization in helping its clientele and sustaining the relationship with donors (high/low). Thereafter, those participants who had been assigned to the ‘low investment condition’ were randomly allocated across an experimental condition about justification for the low investment (yes/no). As predicted, ANOVAs showed that financial donors who were presented information about low investment of the organization in helping its clientele and sustaining the relationship with donors reported the least perceived organizational reciprocity, integrity, and transparency. A second ANOVA indicated that for the participants allocated to the ‘low direct investment’-condition, the justification for the low investment did not influence perceived organizational reciprocity, integrity or transparency. Further, moderation regression analysis showed that the trust of financial donors in the charity does not weaken the negative effects of low investment on perceived organizational reciprocity, integrity or transparency. Finally, regression analyses showed that among financial donors, perceived non-reciprocity and non-integrity of the organization instill perceived psychological contract violation as a predictor of willingness to donate, negative word-of-mouth, and perceived organizational prestige. Theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and suggestions for new research are discussed.","['willingness to donate', 'psychological contract theory', 'donors', 'organizational investment of resources', 'organizational reciprocity', 'organizational integrity', 'organizational transparency', 'trust', 'justification']"

Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the predictive value of the use of passive and active coping styles on the development of depressive symptoms within the first year after trauma. It also aimed to assess potential gender differences within this association. Methods: 556 traumatic injury patients participated in the study. They were recruited from two academic hospitals in NL completed the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D) and the Utrechtse Coping Lijst (UCL) questionnaire at T2. The UCL contained the active coping styles Active Approach, Social Support, Emotional Expression and Reassuring Thoughts and the passive coping styles Palliative Reaction, Avoidance Behaviour and Passive Reaction Pattern. Linear Mixed Models were used to analyse the data. Results: Greater use of Emotional Expression style predicted higher overall depressive symptoms. Greater use of Avoidance Behaviour and Passive Reaction Pattern predicted higher overall depressive symptoms and Palliative Reaction predicted lower depressive symptoms over time. A higher score on Active Approach significantly predicted lower depressive symptoms specifically for men. Conclusions: Different effects have been found in men and women for active coping styles. Most passive coping styles create a risk factor for depressive symptom severity regardless of gender. Implications entail risk monitoring and possible training interventions. Inconsistent results make implementation of intervention strategies difficult.",

Mismatch Negativity in Refugees with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Bernardsdóttir, Berglind","['Middendorp, H. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: Information processing impairments are frequently observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Yet, the neurobiological underpinnings of these impairments are not well understood. Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an event-related potential (ERP) that is thought to represent early sensory change detection. Previous electro-encephalography (EEG) studies on MMN in PTSD have revealed inconsistent results, with findings of both enhanced and reduced MMN amplitudes. Objective: We aimed to extend previous MMN findings to trauma-affected refugees, a PTSD population that often presents with complex, chronic, and severe forms of PTSD. Methods: We examined amplitudes and latencies of MMN in 25 refugees with PTSD and 20 healthy refugee controls matched on age, sex, and country of origin. We employed an MMN paradigm with three types of sound deviants: frequency, duration, and frequency-duration combined. Furthermore, associations between MMN amplitudes and clinical scores of PTSD and functioning were examined. Results: There were no significant differences in MMN amplitudes or latencies in PTSD versus control participants, following any of the deviants. Exploratory analyses revealed a significant sex-by-group interaction effect on MMN following the frequency-duration combined deviant, with enhanced MMN amplitudes in women with PTSD compared with controls. This pattern of findings was not found for the other deviants. Significant associations were found between MMN amplitudes and clinical scores in women only. Conclusion: Our findings point towards sex-differences in the underlying mechanisms of PTSD in refugees, highlighting the need of considering sex in future MMN studies.",

Anxiety disorders are considered to be the most common psychiatric disorder. Knowing underlying mechanisms can help to improve treatment effectiveness. Thus, the study researches the association of anxiety, rumination, heart rate variability (HRV) and the Default Mode Network (DMN). Previous studies indicate a relationship between the factors. The DMN has been found to be essential for self-related cognitive activity. Its functional connectivity (FC) has been shown to be impaired in major psychiatric disorders. Research Question. The study investigates described associations within a population of high trait ruminators, rumination being experimentally manipulated. It is hypothesized that an increase in rumination is associated with lower HRV. High anxiety levels are expected to be related to lower HRV. The FC within the DMN is expected to be affected by rumination. The resulting DMN effect size is predicted to be associated with HRV and anxiety. Methods. A cross-sectional, within-subject experimental design was implemented. The sample consists of 33 female healthy participants who filled out the Penn State Worry Questionnaire and Ruminative Responses Scale. The FC within the DMN was assessed carrying out a working memory task and being cued with memories inducing rumination. Results. Solely a significant positive correlation has been found between anxiety and rumination. Brain areas of the DMN showed an increase in FC during rumination induction compared to rest condition. This effect was significantly negatively related to HRV. Conclusion. The significant relationship between rumination and anxiety should be considered in mental healthcare institutions. The FC of the DMN needs further research to derive practical value.",

How Perceived Control Can Influence One’s Willingness to Contact One’s Creditor,"Flynn, Conor","['Seip, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Currently, a lot of people are living in debt, in fact in some developed countries, the amount of people holding debt can be as high as 80%. This debt can lead holders to face financial hardship and with this often arrives both physical and mental health consequences. Previous research has been promising in examining how an increase in perceived control can be related to both self-management and higher satisfaction. Control has also been found to have links to ones coping behaviors. Thus, an experiment was created in which we looked to see whether an increase in perceived control had an effect on participants overall willingness to contact a creditor, accept financial help, and their coping behaviors. This was done through the use of an experiment involving two creditor letters, in one participants perceived control was manipulated, while the other letter served as the control. In line with our predictions and previous literature those in the manipulation group did show higher willingness to contact and used more problem focused coping, however, there were not significantly differences in scores on avoidant tendencies.",
Motivation towards garden greening behaviour,"Groen, Roos van","['Weiden, A. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Green gardens are a solution to heat, dryness, and flooding, which is a big problem in Leiden. However, the majority of gardens in Leiden is grey. The municipality of Leiden would like to stimulate their citizens to create more green gardens. Previous research found intentions and motivations to be positively associated with environmental behaviours. Moreover, autonomous motivation is thought to moderate the intention behaviour relationship. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between intention towards garden greening, autonomous motivation and actual garden greening behaviour. This study found intentions to significantly predict garden greening behaviour, explaining 13% of the variance. With a dichotomous approach, autonomous motivation was found to be a predictor of garden greening behaviour, but not a moderator of the intention behaviour relationship. In order for the municipality of Leiden to stimulate their residents to green their garden, follow-up research looking into possible moderators of the intention-behaviour gap and autonomous motivation is necessary",
Parent - adolescent discrepancies in perceived family functioning: Relations with adolescent trauma and depression severity,"Verheij, Martine","['Hoorn, J. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background The experience of trauma and the presence of dysfunctional family functioning are important predictors of adolescent depression. Concerning family functioning, different family members tend to provide discordant data about family processes. This discordance may provide information about family functioning itself and may be related to adolescent depression. More insight in family patterns in relation to depression may support clinical decision making. In the present study, we investigated the relation between trauma and depression, and whether adolescent, mother, or father perceived family functioning moderated this relationship. In addition, we examined how discrepancies between adolescents’ and parents’ perceptions of family functioning were associated with adolescent depression severity. Methods Our sample consisted of N = 8 adolescent-father-mother triads and 2 adolescent-mother dyads (60% girls, Mage = 16.6 years), recruited from multiple mental health care units in the Netherlands. Adolescents were between 12 and 18 years old and diagnosed with major depression. In addition, they had all experienced at least one traumatic event related to their depressive symptoms. Self-reported family functioning, depression and trauma symptoms were assessed at baseline in this multi-informant study. Results Regression analyses demonstrated no significant relation between trauma and depression severity, nor between family functioning and depression severity. On average, adolescents and parents reported only minor differences in perceived family functioning. Regression analyses demonstrated that these differences were not significantly associated with adolescent depression severity. Moderation analyses showed that the relationship between trauma and depression of the adolescent was not influenced by adolescent, mother, or father perceived family functioning. Discussion Findings are not in line with previous research that emphasizes the existence and predictive value of informant discrepancies, but the small sample size of the present study makes the results rather inconclusive. Nonetheless, the current study provided a novel contribution to the study of family functioning in relation to depression severity in a specific traumatized sample of depressive adolescents. For future studies, we suggest a larger sample size and the use of polynomial regression analysis to investigate patterns between family members and their relation with depression severity.",['Early adolescence · Depressive symptoms · Trauma · Family functioning · Multiple informants · Parent-adolescent discrepancies']

This study examined how the relation of a feedback mismatch between the participant and the judge after a social task (giving a speech), effects the self-feeling of the participant. In addition we examined if there is a direct effect of anxiety related measurements and self-esteem to self-feeling and if these measurements also moderate the relation between the feedback mismatch on self-feeling. Twenty participants (mean age is 20.60 years, 18 women) were tested in a self-speech paradigm, while EEG and ECG was measured. After giving the speech, participants rate their own performance and finally the participants received ratings from a judge. A multilevel analysis was employed to look for effects on self-feeling. Results provided significant evidence for the relation of feedback mismatch on self-feeling. Also direct significant effects for social anxiety (LSAS), self-esteem (RSES), fear of negative evaluation (BFNES) on self-feeling are found. Significant evidence was also found for moderating effects of social anxiety (LSAS) and fear of positive evaluation (FPES) on the relation of feedback mismatch on self-feeling. Together these findings confirm that feedback mismatch does effect self- feeling and that anxiety related measures (LSAS and FPES) show significant effect on the relation of feedback mismatch on self-feeling. The findings of this study demonstrate that long-term endurance of high scores on social anxiety, low(er) self-esteem and fear of negative evaluation can make people more vulnerable for developing social anxiety disorder (SAD) and further deteriorate social anxiety, self-esteem and self-feeling overall if not treated.","['Speech task', 'Self-feeling (SF)', 'Feedback mismatch (MM)', 'Self-Esteem (RSES)', 'Fear of Positive Evaluation (FPES)']"

Preferences for the distribution of climate costs over different countries, taken wealth and pollution level into account","Noorle Jansen, Lisanne van","['Stallen, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Climate change is a collective problem and a serious threat the whole world. To stabilize the climate pollution globally, a lot of money is necessary to mitigate climate change. But what is fair in who is going to pay? In the current study the preferences of citizens from 51 countries have been collected about how they feel the climate costs should be distributed across different countries when the wealth and the pollution level of the participating countries were taken into account. Additionally, it was researched if those preferences changed when participants got specific information about their own country’s wealth and pollution level. Besides, we examined if the distributive preferences differed between people living in developing and developed countries. According to this research we can conclude that people have a preference to allocate the climate costs according to countries’ wealth and pollution level, with a higher allocation as a country has a higher wealth or pollution level. Additionally, people who knew that they were living in a low wealth or low pollution level country decided to allocate more of the climate costs to themselves, compared to people who did not have that knowledge. Furthermore, there was no difference found between distributive preferences of climate costs of developing versus developed countries. These findings provide insights into what people feel is a fair distribution of climate costs between countries based on their wealth and pollution levels. Further research to other factors is necessary to contribute to the solution for a fair distribution of the climate costs.",

Sex Differences in Self-regulation from Childhood to Adolescence,"Heidemann, Jana","['Wierenga, L.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The importance of self-regulation has repeatedly been shown in various areas, such as risk-taking, school performance, and delinquency. Across several Western countries, a trend has been noted in which boys are scoring worse on self-regulation measures than girls. This can appear as early as kindergarten with individual differences in self-regulation seemingly stable over time. As higher levels of self-regulation are related to higher well-being and health, it is important to close the gap between males and females. Nonetheless, there is a lack of studies on children and adolescents that visualize sex patterns as they age. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to test three hypotheses: (1.) Females have significantly higher self-regulation scores in childhood, and 2.) Females have significantly higher self-regulation scores in adolescence, and 3.) There is a significant overall difference in favor of females. A significant sex difference in favor of girls could be found in childhood, but not in adolescence in which boys and girls aligned. The overall sex difference of both groups was significant in favor of girls. This suggests that boys are catching up with girls as they age. Further research needs to be done to see if this trend in adolescence can be replicated. If this is the case, more research is needed to understand why males are performing worse on variables significantly related to self-regulation despite a closing sex difference.",

Self-efficacy and optimism are important psychological resilience factors that support individuals’ coping with pain. This study is aiming to investigate if self-efficacy could be manipulated in order to increase and decrease participants’ pain endurance, as well as the role of optimism in the relationship of self-efficacy and pain endurance. Research questions: Would individuals with increased self-efficacy have higher pain endurance? Is the effect of self-efficacy on pain endurance stronger for individuals with higher optimism scores? 36 individuals were recruited for the experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to high and low self-efficacy groups, and their self-efficacy was manipulated accordingly with verbal suggestions. A manipulation check with a self-report VAS scale was introduced to assess the effect of the manipulations. Pain endurance was measured by a cold pressor task (CPT), while optimism was measured by the Lifestyle Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R) scale. Pain endurance levels of low and high self-efficacy groups were measured via an independent t-test, and the interaction effect of optimism as a moderator between self-efficacy and pain endurance was investigated via a moderation analysis by PROCESS macro in SPSS. The manipulation check showed no significant difference between the scores of the high self-efficacy group and the low self-efficacy group, t(34) = -1.635, p = 1.111. Results showed that there was no significant difference between the pain endurance levels of the low self-efficacy group and the high self-efficacy group, U = 153, p = .77. The moderation analysis showed that while the model was significant, optimism did not have a significant interaction effect (b = -3.42, t(32) = -.62, p = .54). Even though the study is still in progress; the preliminary results are not in line with the related empirical literature. More active involvement of participants in self-efficacy manipulations, a larger sample size, and further investigating the role of optimism is recommended for further assessing the role of self efficacy and optimism in coping with pain.",

Gender in International Development: A Feminist Institutionalist Approach to Gender Mainstreaming at the World Bank,"Zoppi, Margherita","['DeRock, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The World Bank is the most important global agency involved in international development. This paper looks at the World Bank’s efforts in achieving gender equality in developing countries. Despite the implementation of Gender Mainstreaming policies aimed at bringing a gender perspective into every department of the organisation, the gender gap is still present in many member countries, particularly in non-social sectors like agriculture, energy, finance, and transport. Because international organisations like the World Bank derive much of their authority from their expertise, the aim of this research is to investigate the technocratic approach to gender mainstreaming adopted by experts in the above-mentioned non-social sectors, and how such an approach influences the implementation of gender mainstreaming policies. More specifically, the research argues that the adoption of a technocratic approach stems from the gendered nature of the World Bank and its neoliberal nature. The analysis adopts a Feminist Institutionalist framework to test the hypothesis that informal institutions like the technocratic approach adopted by experts hinders the performance of formal institutions, namely gender mainstreaming practices. After an in-depth qualitative discourse analysis of relevant documents, reporting on the Bank’s gender mainstreaming efforts since the implementation of the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals, this research finds that in those sectors where a technocratic approach to gender mainstreaming is predominant, the adoption of technical solutions is privileged to achieve gender equality. However, these solutions significantly limit the effective implementation of gender mainstreaming policies in developing countries.",

Russian secessionism in Kazakhstan: The failure of creating a successful secessionist movement among ethnic Russians in northern Kazakhstan in the 1990s.,"Brink, Jeffrey van den","['Kursani, S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis attempts to explain what ethnic Russians in northern Kazakhstan prevented from creating a successful secessionist movement in the 1990s. The first part of the thesis tests five preconditions of Wood (1981) and shows that favourable conditions in Kazakhstan were present. These conditions would make attempts at secession of the ethnic Russian minority more likely to occur. The second part explains why serious attempts at secession, despite the favourable conditions in Kazakhstan, did not take place. In this part, the analysis is carried out on three levels, as suggested by Siroky (2016): 1) Russian organisations in Kazakhstan, 2) Kazakhstan’s government, 3) Russia’s government. The analysis shows that mobilisation, an important factor explaining attempts at secession, was not possible due to internal problems and inefficient leadership in the Russian organisations, combined with repressive policy of the Kazakhstani authorities and a lack of support from the Russian government.",

In this paper, the legality of a potential military intervention into Yemen under the doctrine of R2P is researched. This paper aims to increase the knowledge of the Responsibility to Protect and its legal framework. First, the legal framework of the Responsibility to Protect doctrine is outlined, demarcated, and applied to the current situation in Yemen. Thereafter, a discourse analysis on the public opinion in the United States and the United Kingdom about Yemen is performed to indicate the reason for the reluctance to start a military intervention. The findings of this research demonstrate that the reluctance of the United States and the United Kingdom is caused by a potential escalating conflict between major powers and the absence of a primary humanitarian purpose. Therefore, two principles of the legal framework of R2P are not applicable and hence, a military intervention into Yemen would be illegal under the doctrine of R2P.",
