Meeting life in Plum Village: Engaging with precarity and progress in a mediation center,"Knibbe, Guido","['Littlejohn, A.', 'Maaker, E. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"With increasingly pressing and widespread ecological, social and personal crises, the forward march of progress has come to a dead end, and this time is ripe for sensing precarity, as Tsing (2015) announces. A sense of precarity is prevalent among practitioners in the Plum Village meditation center. In a case study, I join practitioners to encounter opportunities for engaging with the challenges of precarity and new possibilities for progress. With these experiences I point out the relevance of the Plum Village tradition in our earthwide precarious predicament. My aim in this thesis is to speak to the possibility of changing with mindfulness practice the dualist worldview that is at the root of widespread unsustainable progress practices. The devastating consequences of the forward march toward limitless growth demand a change of direction. My commitment to sustainable, inclusive living leads me to assess to what extent wholesome directions emerge for people and our planet in the other-than-modern views and practices that are taught in the Plum Village tradition.",

Self-efficacy in simple motor tasks,"Dettner, Aaron","['Does, W. van der', 'Bruton, A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This Electroencephalography (EEG) study examined the generation of taskspecific selfefficacy, the confidence in one’s ability to perform a given task successfully, on a neural level. The proposition was that selfefficacy shows in Mirror Neuron System (MNS) activity, which is indicated by suppression in the frequency range from 8 to 13 Hz, the muband. This musuppression was measured whilst participants (n = 6) watched prerecorded videos of themselves performing short, simple motor tasks in three different viewing conditions. The three viewing conditions were thought to induce different levels of selfefficacy. In two conditions, there was statistically significant musuppression compared to the reference viewing condition. Further, a new score to measure musuppression, the relative musuppression score rmu, was introduced. This rmu score could be used as a neurophysiological marker to reliably measure musuppression in clinical and nonclinical subjects. Then, this score was crosscorrelated with the state anxiety score of the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory. An inverse relationship as reported in previous studies could be seen. But, given the low variance in state anxiety scores and the small sample size, no statistically sound confirmation of said relationship could be made.",

The Role of Temperament in the Verbal Transmission of Social Anxiety from Parents to Children,"Gard, Christina","['Aktar, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is common, but little research is done on children with SAD. One origin of fear is verbal transmission, i.e. the receiving of threatening information. In frightening situations, one’s heart rate (HR) increases. However, in some studies no heightened HR was found in people with SAD. This might mean that the link between stressor and HR is moderated. Behavioural inhibition (BI) was found to be such a moderator. In our study, we examine the following two research questions: What is the effect of exposure to verbal expressions of anxiety (versus safety) from parents on their children’s physiological reactions to strangers? Are the physiological responses more pronounced with temperamentally fearful children? Methods. Together with their main caregiver, 51 children between 4-6 years of age came to the lab after both of their parents had filled in the Behaviorual Inhibition Questionnaire (BIQ) for them. Children had a conversation with two strangers, one at a time. Before the conversation, parents told the children that one of the strangers was friendly, while the other one was mean. Throughout the experiment the children’s HR was measured. Results. Children’s HR neither was significantly higher during the threat condition, nor did BI cause a significantly increased HR. Conclusion and implications. The results do not suggest a significant effect of verbal transmission on HR. Also the child’s temperament did not significantly alter that effect. More research on young children needs to be done to develop early interventions for children at risk of SAD.",

"Data-stimulated effects of cafeinated coffee on working memory after a stressor, moderated by the EEG theta/beta ratio and trait cognitive performance anxiety","Scholten, Eveline","['Putman, P.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Catecholaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex has an inverted U shape relation with executive control, and the EEG theta/beta ratio (TBR) is a potential indicator of this activity. We hypothesized that consuming caffeinated coffee brings acutely stressed people with a high basal TBR towards the optimum of their executive cognitive performance, while it drives people with a low basal TBR away from the optimum. Moreover, we tested whether low trait cognitive performance anxiety (CPA) is associated with improved performance after caffeine consumption, and high trait CPA with decreased performance after caffeine intake. In our study design, 120 healthy student participants filled in the Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale and we measured their EEG. Subsequently, participants consumed either caffeinated (n = 62) or decaffeinated coffee (n = 58) in a double-blind procedure. Thereafter, all participants underwent the Leiden-Performance Anxiety Stress Test, which is a stress-induction method, and completed the n-back task that measures working memory. Using synthetic data (simulated by thesis supervisor P. Putman for educational purposes) because the COVID-19 lockdown prevented us from collecting real data, we discovered that caffeinated coffee improves working memory after a stressor in people with a high basal TBR, while the opposite applies to people with a low basal TBR. Additionally, we found no moderation by trait CPA or interaction effect of caffeine, TBR, and trait CPA. We conclude that TBR should be considered when studying individual differences in the effect of caffeine on executive control when under stress.",

MAPPING WHAT’S MISSING: An examination of how immigration becomes politicised through an interpretative analysis of the missing Faroese word for the term immigrant,"Djurhuus, Sanna","['Longo, M.', 'Ragazzi, F.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to answer the research questions when does the word immigrant become a salient political issue. Migration and the immigrant have never been a more pressing issue to solve, and with current global trajectories they are likely to become even more central to international politics in the years to come. Academic literature remains adamant on finding the explanatory factor(s) for why and how the immigrant is politicised through political language, and from the perspective of understanding this political polarisation for the sake of preventing the harm to immigrants, this is an important and worthwhile pursuit. But this thesis argues that the Faroe Islands are a deviant case, as it contains all the common quantifiable explanatory metrics, yet immigration is not politicised. This contradicts the common correlative theories and instead connects the politicisation of immigration to the fundamental aspect of being a sovereign state and argues that the duty of discussing the phenomenon of immigration necessitates the words to define the debate, and it is the introduction of these words into the common sphere that sharpens, and therefore politicises, the immigration topic.",
Investigating the relationship between pain tolerance and the electrophysiological response to errors: the role of individual differences in impulsivity,"Sklatinioti, Michaela","['Bruijn, E. de', 'Giezen, A. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Physical pain and error processing have indicated a neurophysiological overlap. They both activate the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) through which is originated the error-related negativity (ERN), a reflection of error sensitivity. Thus, our research was based on the hypothesis that people who are more sensitive to one type of alarm - pain - might also be more sensitive to a different kind of alarm signal - errors. Impulsivity was also investigated, since it has been related to the same neural network, and small ERN amplitudes have been linked to high rates of impulsiveness in reaction-time tasks, indicating dysfunctional inhibitory learning. Healthy volunteers (N = 65, mean age = 20.3 years), performed the Error Responsibility task, a variant of the Eriksen Flanker task, during EEG data recording, and filled in the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ). No significant relation was found between pain and error sensitivity. Attention impulsiveness was significantly associated with ERN and pain sensitivity. The absence of the neural shared sensitivity might not be warranted due to the measurement of pain only with a self-report questionnaire. Notably, it was replicated that highly impulsive people show reduced ERN, indicating inefficient error processing. Future studies could research whether the type of instrument for pain measurement influences the depiction of a common sensitivity between pain and error processing. Lastly, the results regarding impulsivity could assist existing treatment guidelines for clinical populations that lack inhibition control, being at risk of adopting dangerous methods to heal painful experiences.",

About the detrimental effects of poverty: How subjective financial scarcity negatively affects cognitive performance,"Schoof, Yasmin","['Ruigendijk, H.', 'Pliskin, R.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study examines the effect of financial scarcity on cognitive performance by not only measuring the objective, but also the subjective aspect of scarcity, contrary to earlier research in this field. Cognitive performance was measured by means of a cognitive control task and a working memory task. A moderating effect of cognitive load was tested by randomly assigning participants into either a ‘difficult’ or ‘easy’ condition, determining the level of difficulty of the financial scenarios they had to solve. This effect could not be rejected, nor supported. By use of the Psychological Inventory of Financial Scarcity (PIFS), this study finds support for the relationship between subjective financial scarcity and cognitive performance. More specifically, we demonstrate an effect on cognitive control, while no support was found an effect on working memory. This study underwrites the importance of a measurement of subjective financial scarcity and encourages future research to uncover the true impact of the cognitive load in the minds of the poor.","['subjective financial scarcity', 'objective financial scarcity', 'poverty', 'effective income', 'PIFS', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive control', 'working memory']"

Sympathizing With Antiheroes: A Study of Narrative Transportation and Moral Disengagement in Adolescents,"Clingman, Elsa","['Bos, E. van den', 'Boelens, H.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the extent to which adolescents feel lost in a fictional story (i.e. narrative transportation) affects the extent to which they justify or forgive the protagonist’s immoral actions (i.e. moral disengagement). Ninety-two Dutch secondary school students (37 males) between 12 and 16 years of age participated and were randomly assigned to an instructed fiction or uninstructed fiction condition. While participants in both conditions read the same story, only those in the former condition were instructed to immerse themselves in the narrative. Participants then completed the Narrative Transportation Scale and a moral disengagement questionnaire. Contrary to expectations, this study did not find a significant link between transportation and moral disengagement. Moreover, the transportation-enhancing instructions appeared to be ineffective. Although the results indicate transportation does not affect moral disengagement in adolescents, several limitations of the study suggest that further research is warranted.","['fiction', 'moral disengagement', 'narrative transportation', 'adolescence']"
Data blinding in psychology: Introducing a tool and practical guidelines for common analyses,"Rooij, Robert-jan de","[""Veer, A. van 't"", 'Huisman, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Making unplanned decisions during data analysis can increase the likelihood of finding evidence that unjustly supports a hypothesis. To reduce this bias, Data blinding hides certain aspects of the data in order to allow researchers to make data-dependent decisions (e.g., checking assumptions to ensure the right analysis is chosen) without knowing the influence of these decisions on results of a hypothesis test. In this study, we examined the suitability of different blinding techniques for three common analyses in psychology: independent samples Student’s t-test, analysis of variance (Type III sum of squares and F-test), and linear least squares regression. For each analysis type, we evaluate whether data blinding techniques interfere with assumption checks and whether they constrain p-hacking. Based on these criteria, we recommend data blinders to center group means for the independent samples Student’s t-test and ANOVA, and to scramble predictor names for regression. We provide guidelines for researchers and data blinders for each step in the data blinding process and introduce a tool that allows data blinders to easily apply the data blinding techniques to a dataset (i.e., the “blindData” R-package). It is discussed how data blinding, combined with preregistration, benefits the integrity of research output.","['data blinding methods', 'blind analysis', 'p-hacking', 'psychology']"
"The effects of brand traits on brand evaluation, positive eWOM intentions and the role of product type","Knaap, Tom van der","['Wirtz, C.', 'Steinel, W.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"An understanding of how brand traits influence brand evaluation and positive eWOM intentions is important for companies because it could help them to optimize their brand for success. Based on social perception literature, this study (N = 179) investigated the effect of perceived brand morality, sociability and competence on brand evaluation and positive eWOM intentions. The study also looks at the role of product type. This was investigated using an online survey on six existing brands. The results indicated that morality, sociability and competence together predict a positive brand evaluation. Yet, there is no clear individual contribution from any one of these three brand traits. Additionally, brand competence was the only trait that predicted positive eWOM intentions concerning the brands. No effect for product type was found. The results did not clearly support the hypotheses, but suggest that morality in brand perception is not as important as in social perception. Further research is needed to get a better understanding of the influence of brand traits on consumer behavior.",

The effects of rhythmic repetition and preference on urge to move,"Lange, Dion de","['Schaefer, R.', 'Houdt, C. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"A stroke is a worldwide health-care issue, yet rehabilitation methods for the motor disabilities that are common after a stroke remain limited. This paper explores the possibility of using music therapy to fill in this gap, taking a deeper look into which musical predictors have influence on the urge to move. In the paper we will specifically look at the influence of repetition and musical preference on the urge to move in healthy participants. Based on literature it was predicted that both predictors would have a positive influence on the shown urge to move. The study contained 41 healthy participants. Participants listened to rhythms varying on repetition and syncopation, after listening to the rhythm they had to rate them on scales regarding; familiarity, urge to move, beat clarity and preference of a rhythm. The goal of the first hypothesis was to study the influence of repetition on urge to move. This was tested by comparing the urge to move for repetitive and non-repetitive rhythms by using a paired t-test. The results suggested that repetition has a significant positive influence on the amount of reported urge to move. The goal of the second hypothesis was to study the influence personal preference for a rhythm had on the urge to move. This was tested by using a mixed model analysis to compare preference on a personal level to the reported urge to move. The results suggested that when a participant heard a rhythm, he/she liked, they were more inclined to report a higher urge to move. Future research should focus on applying the results of this paper into the actual patient group. This way it will become clear if the results are generalizable and possibly applicable into rehabilitation. Besides this, the experiment could be conducted with a movement task to replace the urge to move scale to gain a more objective view of the results.",
An event-related potential study on social performance monitoring in social anxiety: the role of responsibility,"Yassen, Noha","['Bruijn, E. de', 'Giezen, A. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"People with social anxiety symptoms (SAS) have an inflated sense of responsibility towards the mistakes that might cause them embarrassment or humiliation. This event-related potential (ERP) study examined individual differences in SAS in social performance monitoring through focusing on the role of perceived responsibility in error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe). Healthy volunteers with low (N = 22), specific (N = 26), or generalized (N = 17) SAS took part in the study. Participants completed a Flanker task under the observation of a co-actor in three conditions where their errors resulted in one of the following negative monetary consequences: no harm, harm to oneself, or harm to the other. Behavioural findings suggested an opposite direction of responding to errors between two groups where the low showed more impulsive response patterns, while the specific one showed a cautious one. Moreover, ERP results showed no group differences and unaffected ERN and Pe across conditions. However, an exploratory analysis comparing only generalized and low SAS groups showed that people with generalized SAS displayed enhanced ERNs when they were responsible for other’s compared to their own bonus, but not after controlling for OCD symptoms. These findings suggest that inflated sense of responsibility in generalized SAS is more relevant to situations that involve responsibility towards others compared to oneself. The study also highlights the need for investigating the impact of perceived responsibility in social performance monitoring of people with SAS, but then by explicitly focusing on mistakes that trigger embarrassment.","['error-related negativity', 'event-related potential', 'social performance monitoring', 'social anxiety symptoms', 'responsibility']"

Previous research has shown perceived brand personality traits to affect consumer behavior. This study aims to determine the relation between perceived competence and perceived morality on consumer purchase intention and brand evaluation, including a possible moderating role of perceived brand gender cues. An online survey was conducted with 178 participants. The results showed that morality predicted consumer purchase intention as well as brand evaluation. Competence only positively influenced consumer purchase intention. Surprisingly, a contradicting negative interaction was found between competence and morality on consumer purchase intention. Furthermore, competent perceived companies have more purchase intention when they are perceived as masculine. The findings of this study confirm the importance of perceived brand traits and introduce perceived morality, consumer brand evaluation and perceived brand gender cues as new valuable variables in these relations.","['Perceived competence', 'perceived morality', 'purchase intention', 'brand']"

Negotiators who ask themselves the question: ‘how can we expand the pie instead of sharing it’ reach better agreements. This research was affected by the measurements resulting of COVID-19 and therefore partly executed the way it was intended. The experiment (N = 74) tested value creation amongst negotiations with unequal power distribution. Negotiators participated in a role playing game where they had to negotiate about four issues and had the possibility to add 3 more optional issues. The challenge to expand the pie for both players was found in the mandatory-optional paradigm, a payoff schedule specially designed for this research. Participants were divided into two benefit conditions (powerful could add more value or the powerless could add more value). Results were analyzed out of our two control conditions and showed that the powerful players reached higher outcomes than the powerless players and thus seemed better in adding more value. This however, was not found. The difference in adding more value to the agreement between the two players was not significant. Reasons, limitations and implications are discussed and suggestions for further research are proposed.",

Feasibility and preliminary effects of the High Intensive Trauma-focused Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: a Pragmatic Clinical Trial,"Graaf, Sofia de","['Mouthaan, J.', 'Giezen, A. van', 'Zepeda Méndez, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Early studies show promising evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of intensive Trauma-Focused Therapy (TFT) programs for patients with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Little is known about the most effective treatment formats with regard to the therapy dose and frequency. The current study examines the effects of the High Intensive Trauma-focused Therapy (HITT) on the feasibility, tolerability, safety, and symptom outcomes. Methods: A Pragmatic Clinical Trial (PCT) was conducted with 16 treatment-resistant patients with PTSD who failed to respond sufficiently to previous treatment. The HITT treatment consisted of two five-day inpatient programs with Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, exposure, and trauma-sensitive yoga. Primary outcome was measured with the PCL-5 at the beginning and end of both HITT-weeks (T1 to T4). Clinically Significant Changes (CSC) and Reliable Change Indexes (RCI) were calculated. Results: No patients dropped out of treatment and no symptom exacerbations or adverse effects occurred. RCI and CSC from T1 to T4 showed that four patients recovered, two patients improved, and ten patients remained unchanged after treatment. The corresponding effect size on the PCL-5 between T1 and T4 was large (Cohen’s d = 0.88). Conclusions: Results demonstrated that the HITT-program was feasible, tolerable, and safe for all treatment-resistant patients and beneficial for six of these patients. Randomized controlled trials are needed to replicate these results and study the effectiveness of this treatment to further improve TFT formats. Also, future research is necessary to early select treatment-resistant patients who benefit from treatment to develop more cost- and time-effective treatments.","['Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)', 'Pragmatic Clinical Trial (PCT)', 'intensive treatment', 'Trauma-Focused Therapy (TFT)', 'treatment-resistant', 'Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)', 'exposure', 'Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TSY)', 'feasibility', 'preliminary effect']"
Effect of heart rate variability and the moderating effect of ketamine on resting-state brain connectivity in the default mode network,"Korbee, Rebecca","['Rover, M. de', 'Verkuil, B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Introduction: The default mode network (DMN) is a large intrinsic network in the brain, which seems to be affected in depressed patients. Also, aberrant heart rate variability (HRV) is often found in this population. Ketamine is thought to be a fast-acting antidepressant and has shown to have an effect on HRV and intrinsic brain connectivity. In this study, the effect of HRV on resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN and brain activity of areas within the DMN that were significantly correlated with HRV was examined. Also, it was investigated whether ketamine moderated this relationship. Method: Twelve healthy men received an intravenous ketamine or placebo infusion on two occasions. Resting-state functional connectivity and HRV were measured before, during, and after infusion. Dual-regression was used to obtain DMN connectivity scores, while a whole brain analysis was done to determine which brain areas were correlated with HRV. Raw digitized electrocardiogram (EKG), obtained with a pulse oximeter, was analyzed in order to extract HRV data. Multilevel analysis was used to determine the effect of HRV and ketamine on resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN and brain activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and the left postcentral gyrus. Results: DMN connectivity strength was negatively related to HRV, but positively related to activity of the right dlPFC and the left postcentral gyrus for the placebo condition. Ketamine was associated with a more profound effect of HRV on DMN connectivity and brain activity within the postcentral gyrus. Discussion: The present results complement recent studies that show that HRV is associated with connectivity strength in the DMN. Implications for the relevance of using ketamine in depressed patients are discussed. Initial increases of DMN connectivity are followed by a decrease in the DMN, which may be beneficial for depressed patients who generally show hyperconnectivity within the DMN. Results thus imply that ketamine has a moderating role in this.","['DMN', 'fMRI', 'HRV', 'ketamine', 'physiology']"
Influence of Drug Use on the Link between Peer Rejection and Reactive Aggression,"Linden, Fleur van der","['Groep, I. van der', 'Bexkens, A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research has shown that (chronic) substance users often experience difficulties during social interactions, making it difficult for them to maintain meaningful relationships or even causing them to harm others. How are aggression and drug use linked and why are drug users more prone to use aggression? This is an important question for prevention and intervention. Earlier studies found an association between reactive aggression and substance use with mediation of peer rejection. Therefore, the present study investigated whether drug users show more reactive aggression than non-drug users after receiving negative social evaluation than after getting neutral or positive feedback from their peers, and whether male drug users show more reactive aggression after receiving negative social evaluation than female drug users. The population of interest is a nonclinical sample, for this is a pilot study for a larger study. The sample has a response rate of N = 40 with (17 males, 23 females, M = 22.77, SD = 3.07.) The Social Network Aggression Task was used in this study. Some significant findings were conducted. The study by Achterberg et al. (2016) was replicated, using the SNAT and conducting significant findings, for it makes the SNAT adequate to research the effect of social feedback on reactive aggression. The results in the current study show that taking into account the different types of drugs used would be very useful to lead to different outcomes. In future studies, it would also be interesting to focus on (sub-)clinical groups and the differences between non-clinical and (sub-) clinical groups, on different types of drugs or different doses, and on the influence of gender roles, rather than gender differences per se.",
Handling Missing Values in Multi View Data with Stacked Penalized Regression,"Schouten, Frederiek","['Fokkema, M.', 'Ginkel, J. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Excessive data collection can be expensive to perform and process. Feature selection methods such as penalized regression are useful techniques to exclude less relevant features from a prediction model. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to multi-view data, as it ignores the grouped structure of this type of data and valuable information may be lost. For multi-view data Stacked Penalized Regression (StaPLR) can be used for view selection. A challenge arises when missing data is present, especially when complete views are missing. Using listwise deletion, the most common method to deal with missing values, on these datasets will therefore likely lead to a lot of information loss. In this thesis the effect of mean substitution, single Bayesian regression, multiple Bayesian regression and predictive mean matching on the predictive accuracy and sparsity of StaPLR are compared on different missing data scenarios on an existing dataset containing items from the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ). In addition to traditional feature imputation, StaPLR offers the possibility to impute view-level predictions when views are missing completely, which can decrease the computational burden. To evaluate the performance of the missing data methods, 27 missing data scenarios are created with features missing either randomly or within the view structure. Predictive accuracy is measured with AUC, and sparsity by the number of views StaPLR selects. Multiple imputation works well in terms of predictive accuracy, but when quantities of missing values increases they do not work well in terms of sparsity. Mean substitution could potentially be an acceptable alternative to multiple imputation when features are missing randomly. View-level imputation performs similar as feature-level imputation for most methods when views are missing completely, and could therefore be used for these methods to decrease the computational burden. This thesis is the first step in handling missing values with StaPLR. Future research directions include repeating this research on more elaborate multi-view data structures, where the views are collected from different sources, to identify whether these effects are found under different circumstances.","['stacked penalized regression', 'staPLR', 'missing data', 'multi-view data', 'multiple imputation']"

How to integrate multimodal information to improve classification performance? Comparison of multimodal approaches to distinguish Alzheimer patients from healthy controls based on high-dimensional neuroimaging data.,"Heijnen, Marlijn J.H.","['Wilderjans, T.F.', 'Weeda, W.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"An often-encountered challenge in neuroscience is the reliable prediction of a subject’s disease status based on brain data to, for example, disentangle Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients from healthy control (HC) subjects. In this regard, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been applied successfully to study the functional and structural differences between the brains of AD patients and HC’s. However, when using fMRI data for AD classification, the complex multivariate nature of these data faces researchers with two main statistical challenges that need to be appropriately addressed to improve the AD classification performance: high dimensionality (i.e., the data containing many variables/voxels) and multimodality (i.e., the data consisting of different brain modalities, like structural and functional brain information). In this study, both statistical challenges are tackled. To address high dimensionality, dimension reduction is proposed. Regarding the multimodality challenge, a ‘concatenated strategy’, which consists of a simultaneous dimension reduction of the information present in all the modalities involved, is compared to a ‘separate strategy’, which reduces the data for each modality separately. Combined with these strategies, three common feature extraction methods are compared in terms of classification performance: (1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA), (2) Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS-R) and (3) Generalized Regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RGCCA). Testing these methods and strategies on multimodal data consisting of three different neuroimaging properties that are related to AD, it is found that the best classification accuracies are obtained with PLS-R (compared to PCA and CCA) and the concatenated strategy (compared to the separate strategy). PLS-R combined with the concatenated strategy, however, is outperformed by a whole-brain analysis applied to all data modalities simultaneously and performs at the same level as a whole-brain analysis applied to one of the brain modalities used (i.e., the structural one).",

In order to answer this question, the participants of this study were divided into three groups of families (consisting of one adolescent and at least one parent). The distribution of these groups was based on the depression severity score of the adolescent as measured by the PHQ-9 (low, mild and moderate to severe). The families in each of these groups participated in three interaction tasks (i.e., a problem solving task, an event planning task and a reminiscence task). After participating in each of these tasks, the adolescents and their parent(s) both separately completed the same questionnaire regarding parental behavior during the task (listening skills, empathy, criticism and dominance). Subsequently, the groups of adolescents and their parent(s) were compared, based on their evaluations of parental behavior during the tasks. The results of these comparisons showed no significant associations between the severity of the adolescents’ depressive symptoms and their as well as their parent(s)’ perception on parental behavior during the tasks. In addition, there was no significant association between the severity of the adolescents’ depressive symptoms and parent-adolescent discrepancies regarding the evaluation of parental behavior during the tasks. This implicates that the results of this study are rather discrepant with the theoretical framework regarding the depression-distortion hypothesis.","['Adolescent depression', 'parental behavior', 'interaction tasks']"
The effect of objective and subjective financial scarcity on cognitive performance,"Bruijn, Loes de","['Ruigendijk, H.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of our study was to disentangle the effects of both objective and subjective financial scarcity on cognitive performance. Financial scarcity depletes the cognitive capacity, leaving less resources for other tasks. In daily life, this means that people in poverty make less wise decisions in daily life regarding obligations and appointments, diet, schooling, and ironically expenditure. However, the effect of subjective financial scarcity has not yet been studied. We expect to find that both subjective and objective financial scarcity have a negative effect on cognitive performance, and that they interact with activation of thoughts on finances. In our procedure, we assessed the subjective financial scarcity that people experience with the Psychological Inventory of Financial Scarcity (PIFS) in addition to traditional objective financial measures and general demographics. Then, thoughts on personal finances were activated with a prime, after which the cognitive capacity was measured with the hearts and flowers test. The results show no effect of the prime and of both the objective and subjective financial scarcity of our participants on the performance of the hearts and flower test. However, with alterations in the procedure, we expect to find results in line with our hypothesis.",
Gentrification of Place: Neighborhood perceptions of Amsterdam North,"Oosten, Tobias van","['Suidgeest, K.', 'Littlejohn, A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Within the context of over-saturated cities and global exponential urban growth, the context of Gentrification has gained increasing academic and interdisciplinary momentum. This ethnographic research engages with the notion of the Gentrification of Place, by analyzing the way redevelopment programs are experienced by neighborhood inhabitants of Amsterdam North. The research encompasses a multimodal approach, as both literary and audiovisual component encompass the way inhabitants of historic neighborhoods experience urban change bound to Gentrification. The findings suggest that institutional place-making practices bound to the past, have generated collective notions of disregard, and stigmas that are accentuated when experienced through new place-making practices today, employed as part of ongoing neo-liberal policies, manifested through Gentrification. To further engage with the political aspects of the Gentrification of Place, Lefebvre’s urban spatial theory will be engaged with. Urban changes crystalize through altered notions of livability of neighborhood inhabitants, that lead to the experiencing of a precarious state of experiencing Place. The audio-visual component, composed by a collaborative photo project and by the ethnographic film Tijd voor Noord (Time for North) engages with similar notions, and functions as an ethnographic bike ride through Amsterdam North. The film explores perspectives of neighborhood brokers, who are affected by the changes bound to their neighborhoods.",
Psychological safety as a predictor for innovation: How psychological safety and diversity can contribute to innovative behaviour,"Middelkoop, Cerianne van","['Groeneweg, J.', 'Band, G.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Working in teams has become common in many organisations. In studies about the performance of teams, psychological safety has become an popular topic. Psychological safety describes an atmosphere were employees feel comfortable speaking up about their concerns and new ideas. As the performance of an organisation is often dependent on innovation and innovative behaviour, we propose that psychological safety can positively predict innovative behaviour. Additionally, diversity was studied, specifically the characteristics age, gender, and work experience, and their individual influences on innovative behaviour and psychological safety. Previous research has shown mixed results about the performance of diverse teams, therefore it is necessary to extent research in this field. Data was collected using an online survey with questions regarding innovative behaviour and perceived psychological safety by employees from a Dutch organisation (N = 375). First, we used a simple linear regression to map the relationship between innovative behaviour and psychological safety. Second, we performed a simple linear regression to find the individual influences of age, gender, and work experience on respectively innovative behaviour and psychological safety. Additional analyses were performed to extend insight into the relations and internal structures of these constructs. Results showed that psychological safety is a positive predictor of innovative behaviour and that work experience can predict innovative behaviour in certain circumstances. We conclude that psychological safety can predict innovative behaviour and that diverse characteristics are unlikely to influence both constructs separately. However, further research is necessary to explain the role of diversity in this relationship, as this study has not been able to measure diversity as a team characteristic. Further suggestions and limitations are discussed.","['psychological safety', 'innovation', 'innovative behaviour', 'diversity', 'work experience', 'gender', 'age']"

It was hypothesized that 1) with a higher BAS-Reward score, participants will deviate more towards a reward distractor, 2) with a higher BAS-Reward score, participants will have larger reaction times with a reward distractor, 3) with a higher BIS-score, participants will deviate more away from a punishment distractor, 4) with a higher BIS-score, participants will have a larger reaction time with a punishment distractor and 5) gender moderated the four previous hypotheses. Methods: In this experimental, within subject study design, participants (N=32) completed a conditioning task and a hand movement task, and filled out a self-report questionnaire that measures BIS/BAS tendencies. The obtained participant sample was balanced in terms of gender and had an age range of 18 to 35 years old. Results: The results of this study did not reveal any significant effects for BIS and BAS-Reward on goal attainment, measured by maximum absolute distance and reaction time. As no significant results were obtained, it was not possible to perform a moderation analysis with gender as the moderator. Conclusion: Within this research it did not become apparent if being approach- or avoidance- oriented had an influence on goal attainment in the context of valenced distractors. Nor was it possible to see if gender moderated these effects. Reasons as to why no effects were visible had to do with e.g. the low sample size and the possible decreasing conditioning effect during the hand movement task. Therefore, further research should look into these two limitations.","['goal attainment', 'BIS', 'BAS', 'valenced distractors', 'gende']"

Music interventions are used to manage stress on both physiological and psychological stress outcomes. If we have a better understanding of the role of preference, the effect of positive feelings in the context of music therapy can be better evaluated. To examine the difference between self-selected preferred and non-preferred music on the human stress response, 11 participants were assigned to three conditions. Two conditions consisted of music listening, both listening to self -selected preferred or non-preferred music. The other condition was a positive control condition, where participants were exposed to a Cold Pressure Test (CPT), consisting of keeping both feet in cold water of three degrees for two minutes. As the control condition was intended to always cause a physiological response in a stressful situation. During the experiment, the electrocardiogram was measured continuously with the variables heart rate and heart rate variability, and self-rated valence of the participant’s emotional state before and after the music or CPT. The results showed a statistically significant increase in heart rate for the CPT condition, compared to both conditions with music listening. In addition, in the condition with preferred music, there was an indication of lower heart rates and higher valence after listening to self-selected preferred music. However, these results were not significant. Together these results may suggest that listening to music is an effective way of affecting physiological measure of stress (in particular heart rate) and valence, where self-selected preferred music is more effective. Nevertheless, this cannot be said with certainty, because the study has yet to be completed with, for example, more participants and other measures.",

There has been a dearth in knowledge about the interactions between psychological variables that can jeopardise university students into becoming suicidal. Aim: By exploring these interactions cross-sectionally using network analysis, this study sought to deduce risk profiles for student suicidality from 464 university students with self-reported mood and stress problems. Methods: Suicidality and clinical risk factors such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress were assessed using 13 self-report questionnaires. Interactions between those variables were analysed via connectivity and centrality indices in 114 and 74 participants identified at high risk for suicidal thoughts and suicidal attempts, respectively. Results: Symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress, and anxiety displayed large interconnections in either centre. Perceived burdensomeness connected heavily with suicide thoughts and subjective symptoms of depression. Study-related stressors demonstrated centrality only at risk for suicide attempts. Conclusions: Suicide prevention programs for university students may benefit from targeting critical interactions between mental vulnerabilities for suicidality. Suicidal thoughts may be influenced especially by affecting perceived burdensomeness. Changes in depression may be crucial for achieving effects on perceived burdensomeness, posttraumatic stress, and anxiety.","['suicide ideation', 'suicide behaviour', 'risk factors', 'university students', 'network analysis']"
Attaining your goals: The influence of approach- and avoidance tendencies and personality traits on hand-movement trajectories in the context of valenced distractors,"Fokké, Viva","['Sjoerds, Z.', 'Mulckhuijse, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction. Goal attainment in the context of valenced distractors may be influenced by motivation systems and personality traits. There are two motivation systems: the behavioral approach system (BAS) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS). BAS seems to react to rewarding stimuli and seems to be related to Extraversion. BIS is thought to be responsible for avoiding punishment and seems to be related to Neuroticism. In this study, I hypothesized that BIS/BAS sensitivity has an effect on goal attainment. Furthermore, this study looked at the influence of personality traits. It was hypothesized that personality influences BIS/BAS sensitivity and that this in turn had an effect on goal attainment. Methods. Goal attainment was measured using a hand-movement task that featured valenced distractors. During this task, participants (N=32) were asked to move an avatar towards a black target. Presented next to this target was a distractor that was associated with either reward, punishment, or was a neutral distractor. Deviation towards or away from the distractor was hypothesized to be associated with one’s sensitivity to either BIS or BAS. Results. People with a higher BIS sensitivity were more likely to move away from punishment stimuli. BAS, however, seemed to have no effect on goal attainment. Furthermore, people with neurotic traits seem to have more BIS tendencies. BIS, however, seemed to have no further mediating effect on the relationship between Neuroticism and goal attainment. Conclusion. In sum, this study provides a unique method of measuring goal attainment in the context of valenced distractors. Through this method (i.e. the examining of hand-movement trajectories) underlying factors that may influence goal attainment (e.g. motivation, personality, etc.) may become apparent.","['goal attainment', 'BIS/BAS', 'valenced distractors', 'personality']"

The results partly support the hypotheses and indicate that perceived competence and perceived morality both relate to purchase intentions. In addition, for non-profit organizations, purchase intentions are mostly predicted by morality, whereas for for-profit organizations, competence most strongly predicts purchase intentions. The results further show that women’s purchase intentions are most strongly related to perceived morality, whereas men’s purchase intentions are related to perceived competence. Lastly, organization type and gender seem to have important moderating influences on the relationship between brands’ trait dimensions and consumers’ purchase intentions. Importantly, advertising organizational morality and competence appears to be an effective strategy for companies to keep consumers interested.","[""brands' traits dimensions"", 'perceived morality', 'perceived competence', 'purchase intention', 'type of organization', 'gender', 'for-profit', 'non-profit']"

Het congrueren van emoties en gedragingen kan ertoe leiden dat individuen zich mede gaan synchroniseren in hun fysiologische activiteit (Golland, Arzouan, & Levit-Binnun, 2015). Er is echter nog weinig bekend over of fysiologische synchronisatie kan leiden tot gedrag synchronisatie wat betreft de emotionele aandachtsbias. Deze scriptie heeft tot doel te onderzoeken of fysiologische synchronisatie kan leiden tot gelijktijdige gedragsovereenkomsten in de emo-aandachtsbias. Voor het vaststellen van de fysiologische synchronisatie maat wordt er data overgenomen vanuit een eerder onderzoek. Voor het toetsen van de aandachtsbias wordt er gebruik gemaakt van de Dot-probe taak. De participanten (n = 54) worden opgedeeld in dyades. Binnen elke dyade wordt het gemiddelde verschil van de emo-aandachtsbias bepaald. Deze score wordt, met gebruik van de Pearson’s R, gecorreleerd aan de fysiologische synchronisatie maat van de dyade. Er wordt verwacht dat een hogere fysiologische synchronisatie maat leidt tot gelijkwaardiger gedrag op de Dot-probe taak. Gebaseerd op de Bayes factor zijn er drie mogelijke uitkomst scenario’s opgesteld: het alternatieve, ambigue en nul scenario. Daarmede is de ‘Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS)’ schaal toegevoegd. Hiermee wordt er onderzocht of de mate van het gevoel van overlap gecorreleerd is aan de fysiologische synchronisatie maat en aan het gedrag op de Dot-probe taak. De resultaten van het alternatieve scenario representeren situaties waarin er sprake is van een sterk effect van de fysiologische synchronisatie maat op de gelijktijdige gedragsovereenkomsten in de emo-aandachtsbias. Dit effect is bekeken voor de emoties woede, walging, angst, verdriet, blijheid, verdriet en verrassing. Hierbij is het effect het sterkst bij de emoties woede en verdriet. De resultaten van het ambigue en nul scenario representeren een situatie waarin er meer anekdotisch bewijs geleverd moet worden of waarin er geen sprake is van een verband. Daarnaast leidt een hoge fysiologische synchronisatie maat tot een hogere maat van gevoel van overlap wat leidt tot gelijkwaardiger gedrag op de Dot-probe taak.

Moreover, the positive relationship between feeling personally more responsible for the consequences of household gas use upon climate change and having stronger positive personal norms towards disconnecting from the gas grid was moderated by the perceived social norms towards disconnecting from the gas grid.

Area-level socioeconomic status functions as a predictor for cognitive flexibility in patients with psychiatric disorders,"Jansen, Rachel","['Chavez-Baldini, U.', 'Ruitenberg, M.', 'Houdt, C. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Patients with psychiatric disorders often experience problems with executive functioning, including cognitive flexibility, planning, and working memory. Prior results on healthy subjects suggest that a low Socio-Economic Status (SES) might be related to such problems. However, little research has been done regarding the relationship between deficits in executive functioning and SES within psychiatric populations. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the possible relationships between the SES and three executive functions in patients with psychiatric disorders using a transdiagnostic approach. We also tentatively explored the relationship between SES and executive functions as a function of the different diagnostic groups to evaluate whether this relationship itself is transdiagnostic. Method: A total of 298 patients diagnosed with different psychiatric disorders were included in this study: schizophrenia and psychosis (103), major depressive disorders (100), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (95). The participants’ cognitive flexibility, planning, and working memory was evaluated using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). The area-level SES (an index for SES) data were obtained from the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP). Results: Area-level SES was significantly negatively related to cognitive flexibility (β = -.043, p = .007). However, area-level SES was not related to planning (p =.072) nor to working memory (p = .412). The relationship between area-level SES and executive functioning by diagnostic category was non-significant (p = .355). Conclusion: The results of the current study indicated that a high area-level SES was associated with a higher degree of cognitive flexibility. The study also suggests that the relationship between area-level SES and cognitive flexibility cuts across psychiatric disorders and could be considered as a transdiagnostic mechanism. Healthcare providers could use area-level SES to predict which patients might require extra attention regarding deficits in cognitive flexibility. This study can also function as a steppingstone for future research into the relationship between SES and executive functions in psychiatric populations as it provides insight into the pitfalls and possible remedies for applying aggregate (area-level) data at the individual level.","['area-level socioeconomic status', 'cognitive flexibility', 'executive functions', 'psychiatric disorders']"

"Changing Tides: between Pura Vida, tourism and landownership: In the Nicoya Peninsula of Costa Rica","Herrero, Sergio Romo","['Postma, M.', 'Pels, P.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Costa Rica is a country known for its natural beauty and eco-friendly attractions, making it an attractive country to visit or migrate to. The main focus of this research is to get a closer look at how Costa Rican life has changed over the years as landownership laws have affected the landscape of the Pacific seashore in the peninsula of Nicoya. Tourism has become the primary source of work in the area of Montezuma, giving new meanings to a lifestyle often referred to as ""Pura Vida."" As other sources of income, such as fishing, diminished over the years due to changing environmental policies, the local people in the surroundings of Montezuma have had to change their lifestyles to adapt to the growing tourism industry. This research builds on the experiences of four main interlocutors, each of them representing a different way of life in the village. Luis, Irene, Israel, Rolando, and his wife, Maria, who all explain what the consequences of changing environmental policies are for them, and what the so-called ‘Pura Vida lifestyle’ means to them, now it has taken over as the national ‘slogan’ to attract tourists. In the accompanying documentary (Changing Tides) and text, I explored how their lives are being transformed by tourism and how national policies that include landownerships laws are affecting the lifestyle of the old and new inhabitants in the area. Visual Ethnography was used as a method in order to better convey the sense of ‘Pura Vida’ and how the different characters that are the protagonists in the film relate to their land, life and changes in lifestyle over the last 40 years in Montezuma.",
The effect of anxiety on visual processing under threat,"Hill, Alice","['Mulckhuyse, M.', 'Sjoerds, Z.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Emotion is known to affect our perception. Research has shown that fear, in particular, affects our perception by enhancing the processing of coarse low spatial frequency (LSF) information at the cost of detailed high spatial frequency (HSF) information. This biased LSF processing may be mediated by the subcortical or cortical pathway to the amygdala. However, findings on whether the subcortical pathway processes automatically are contradictory, and some studies found a mediation effect of anxiety. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate whether the processing of LSF information is automatic during threat and whether this is moderated by anxiety. Method: We used a high and low load visual working memory (VWM) task while participants performed a visual orientation discrimination task of LSF and HSF gratings, under safe and threat of shock conditions. Anxiety levels were measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: Using data from a previous similar experiment, we found a significant interaction effect of spatial frequency by VWM. We found significant main effects of spatial frequency and VWM; there was no main effect of threat condition. Conclusion: Our results indicate that LSF information was perceived more accurately than HSF information, that visual information was perceived more accurately under low than high VWM load and that this was not affected by risk of threat. Due to these results, we were unable to test for automatic processing of LSF stimuli under fear. To investigate this further, as well as to examine whether this is affected by anxiety, more research is needed.","['visual processing', 'visual working memory', 'spatial frequency', 'threat', 'anxiety']"
The Mediating Role of Eye Gaze Behaviour Between Trait Affective Empathy and Empathic Accuracy,"Ankermann, Connor","['Wever, M.', 'Elzinga, B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research has shown that trait affective empathy and empathic accuracy as well as trait affective empathy and eye gaze behaviour are positively correlated. Furthermore, it is known that the eye region is highly expressive by portraying a wide range of social clues including feelings, expectations and information about interpersonal relationships. It is therefore possible that people who have higher levels of trait affective empathy have higher levels of empathic accuracy because they tend to look more towards the eyes of another person. The current study, therefore, investigates whether eye gaze behaviour mediates the relationship between trait affective empathy and empathic accuracy. A sample of 110 adults filled in the subscale “empathic concern” of the IRI (Davis, 1983) and did a computerized empathic accuracy task inspired by Aan het Rot and Hogenelst (2014) while being eye tracked. Trait affective empathy was found to positively correlate with eye gaze behaviour. Yet, trait affective empathy and empathic accuracy as well as eye gaze behaviour and empathic accuracy were not found to significantly correlate. The primary explanation is therefore that people who have higher levels of trait affective empathy tend to look more towards the eye region, which is in line with the past findings, but are not more empathically accurate. That trait affective empathy and empathic accuracy were not found to correlate is in contrast to past investigations. Alternative explanations, possible threats to validity, suggestions for future investigation and implication for the clinical field are discussed.","['Trait affective empathy', 'empathic accuracy', 'eye gaze behaviour', 'empathy', 'eye tracking']"

Visual processing during threat: What happens to your perception in life threatening situations?,"Kuipers, Adriaan","['Mulckhuyse, M.', 'Sjoerds, Z.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Emotions have an effect on perception. When in a life-threatening situation processing of coarse visual features is enhanced. Studies show that inducement of fear increases low spatial frequency processing. It is argued that this process facilitates the direct subcortical route. This study investigates if this process is automatic. We will replicate an experiment that measured the effect of a threat on low and high spatial frequency processing and we will add the manipulation of visual working memory. High visual working memory load results in ongoing processes in the visual cortex. When low spatial frequency processing does not show increasement in the high visual working memory load condition this indicates that the visual cortex is included in this process and that the process therefore is not automatic. We expect the process to be automatic therefore we hypothesize that high visual working memory load has no effect on the facilitated processing of low spatial frequency information when induced with fear. The performance on accuracy on low spatial frequency and high spatial frequency gratings of 24 participants was measured. To induce fear threat of shock was given. We found that threat does not have an effect on the processing of low spatial frequency and high spatial frequency stimuli for the low visual working memory condition as well as the high visual working memory condition. Therefore, we could not test if this process is automatic or not. We conclude that the inducement of fear was not successful and that manipulation checks were needed to explain our findings.","['visual perception', 'spatial frequency', 'visual working memory', 'fear inducement']"
The relationship between chronic exposure to road traffic noise and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Andree, Rosa","['Brosschot, J.F.', 'Dijk, S. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Long-term exposure to road traffic noise is associated with the prevalence of hypertension. To understand more about this exposure-response relationship, it is essential to examine this association with baseline blood pressure measurements. However, theories of possible mechanisms explaining the chronic physiological effects of road traffic noise exposure are limited. Furthermore, the findings of epidemiological studies investigating this relationship are inconsistent and different factors seem to influence the strength of the relationship. A critical evaluation of these studies seems warranted. Purpose: This study aims to gain more theoretical and empirical insight into the association between road traffic noise and resting blood pressure measurements. Methods: Web of Science, PubMed and reference lists were used. Six articles were included, consisting of information about ten studies. A meta-analysis on the association between road traffic noise and blood pressure among adults was performed. The ten effect size estimates were based on the data of 146,339 subjects in total. Results: A 0.195 mmHg (95% CI: 0.004, 0.386) higher systolic blood pressure per 10 dB increase was found. Road traffic noise was not associated with diastolic blood pressure. However, the sensitivity analysis revealed stronger associations with diastolic blood pressure for high-quality studies and stronger associations with systolic blood pressure for nighttime noise exposure. Conclusion: Long-term exposure to road traffic noise had a significant positive association with systolic blood pressure, perhaps strongest at night, and a nonsignificant positive association with diastolic blood pressure. The significant moderating effect of study quality on diastolic blood pressure is a possible explanation for this inconsistency. Further research is required to get a more comprehensive understanding of the association between road traffic noise and blood pressure.","['Stress', 'noise', 'chronic stress response', 'road traffic noise', 'blood pressure', 'systolic', 'diastolic']"
The Relation Between the Error-Related Negativity and Inflated Responsibility Attitudes When Harm Comes to Oneself or Others,"Álvarez Ortiz, Nicolas","['Bruijn, E.R.A. de', 'Will, G.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Both an enhanced error sensitivity, measured in the electroencephalogram as the error-related negativity (ERN) and inflated responsibility attitudes, have been found to play a role in psychopathology. This was found especially in the obsessive-compulsive disorder, with both patients and healthy volunteers scoring high on symptoms showing elevated ERN amplitudes. The aim of the study was to investigate the relation of the ERN amplitude and responsibility attitudes as measured by the Responsibility Attitude Scale (RAS) in healthy participants. As both concepts may play a central role in the social life of individuals, we used a speeded choice reaction-time task that was performed both in a medium responsibility and high responsibility context where mistakes harmed the financial bonus of the participants and of an observer respectively. Healthy volunteers (N = 65) performed a social variant of the Flanker task while EEG recording were obtained. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the ERN amplitudes measured in the different conditions, that participants felt more responsible when performing the Flanker task under the high responsibility condition, and that there was a negative correlation between the ERN and RAS subscale pertaining to responsibility to oneself. We concluded that while the participants perceived one condition to require more responsibility, this either did not affect their performance or distress, or there was a ceiling effect. The negative ERN – RAS in the “self” subscale correlation was unexpected as it contradicts the previous literature on the subject. A possible explanation might be associated with the outcome expectation that participants with high responsibility attitudes had.","['error-related negativity', 'responsibility attitudes', 'flanker task', 'harmful mistakes', 'social performance monitoring']"

Such a new development in the field of reading is the Beeline reader. In the current study we examined the effects this reader has on reading time and comprehension while reading a digital text, for students from the University of Leiden (N = 19). Also considered the layout of the text, in which the length (long or short) and vertical distance (single or double) of the sentences differ within four conditions: short-single, short-double, long-single and long-double. Participants read regular and Beeline digital texts within all four conditions, while we measured their eyemovements. Afterwards they answered questions about the texts. No advantages were observed for the use of the Beeline reader, for reading time and comprehension. However, a significant effect was found for text layout for both regular and Beeline texts, regarding reading time. The observed trade-off between reading time and layout suggests that a long sentence length and single vertical line spacing induces more reading time. Whereas a layout with a long sentence length and double vertical line spacing (long-double) results in significant less reading time. Comprehension question were also answered most correct within the long-double layout, although a main effect for layout wasn’t found. These findings will be discussed and recommendations will be made regarding future research.",

Patients not recover fully or sufficiently to qualify for good end-state criteria; treatments that did not work or had to be repeated because of insufficient sessions attended increase waiting list times; early phases of treatment cost a considerable amount of money and resources. All this is likely to not pay off, since a larger number of sessions significantly correlates with improvement from PTSD and depression and an average number of sessions attended by early responders is between 6-7. The aim of this study is to investigate in which phase of the treatment do most of the dropouts occur, which patient and clinical factors are associated with the dropout and whether various types of treatment modality have different dropout rates. Sample contains 3084 patients getting treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder in Sinai center in Amsterdam. Bivariate regression analyses were conducted to examine relationship between demographic, clinical ant treatment variables in treatment dropouts and completers. Out of 3084 patients 2369 (76.8%) patients successfully completed the treatment, 715 (23.2%) dropped out, from those, 78 patients dropped out early. Contrary to predictions, more dropouts took place in later stages. Analysis showed that age was the only significant predictor variable of dropout.",

PS is the area surrounding an individual that includes the intimate and personal domain (within 1.50 meters of a person). We aimed to investigate the role of PS in seating behavior and to extend previous research by distinguishing an immediate PS consideration (i.e., considering PS in the immediate situation) from an anticipated PS consideration (i.e., considering PS also in a possible future situation). We conducted an observational study (N = 237), an open-ended question study (N = 40), and an experimental online study using a mixed-design (N = 325) in the context of choosing a seat in a railway station concourse. The results revealed that most participants chose a seat outside their intimate and personal domain. We concluded that people try to safeguard their PS. Furthermore, immediate and anticipated PS considerations both play a role in seating behavior; however, both are merely facets of PS rather than two exclusive concepts. With our results, we hope to extend the theory of PS as well as inform and possibly influence the design of seating arrangements to optimize people’s well-being in public areas.","['personal space', 'immediate personal space consideration', 'anticipated personal space consideration', 'seat choice', 'public area']"

In adults, eye contact can improve feelings of connectedness to and liking for another person, as well as mood. The present study examined whether eye contact could improve connectedness to and liking for other people in adolescents. Additionally, the influence of perceived levels of closeness (to parents, unknown adults and unknown adolescents) and inter-individual variation in autism spectrum symptoms was assessed. Participants (n = 61; 26.1% female) watched videos of themselves, an unknown adolescent, a parent, or an unknown adult of similar age as their parent either holding eye contact or averting their gaze. After each video, participants reported on their subjective feelings of connectedness to and liking for the person in the video, and their mood. Eye contact significantly improved all three aspects: connectedness, liking and mood. Participants felt most connected to their parents, liked them more and were in a better mood after looking at them, compared to unknown adolescents or adults. There was no evidence for the moderation of subclinical autism spectrum traits on the relationship between eye contact, connectedness, liking and mood. These findings highlight the importance of eye contact for connectedness to and liking for another person, as well as mood. They, therefore, have implications for interpersonal relationships and mental health. The present study points to a therapeutic potential of interventions enhancing eye contact: increased eye contact may contribute to an improved parent-child relationship, which is associated with better mental health.","['eye contact', 'connectedness', 'liking', 'mood', 'attachment', 'autism spectrum disorder']"

The mediation of parental stress on the association between children’s temperament and prosocial behavior,"Vervoorn, Merlijn","['Meulen, M. van der', 'Achterberg, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research suggests that a child’s temperament has a positive relation to its prosocial behavior. It also suggests temperament has a positive relation to parental stress, which in turn has a negative relation to prosocial behavior. In the current study we looked at a possible mediation of parental stress on the relation between a child’s temperament and prosocial behavior. We used a sample of n=114 children aged 8-10 and their parents. We used the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire (TMCQ) and the Parenting Daily Hassles (PDH) questionnaire to measure child temperament and parental stress respectively and we used a donating task to measure child prosocial behavior. We ran two different mediation models for two temperament subtypes: Negative Affectivity and Perceptual Sensitivity. We found a significant positive relation between the Negative Affectivity subtype of temperament and parental stress. Contrary to our expectations we found no significant relation between either of the two temperament subtypes and prosocial behavior, between the Perceptual Sensitivity subtype and parental stress, and between parental stress and prosocial behavior. Even though our expectations were not met, this study provides new insights in the relations between these three aspects of child development. The development of prosocial behavior is more resilient than we previously thought. Even when a child has a difficult temperament or a parent who experiences a high amount of stress, this does not necessarily mean a child can not learn to be prosocial.",
Does infant attention bias to threat relate to parental stress?,"Verweij, Bo","['Nimphy, C.', 'Garnefski, N.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Parental stress can have a negative impact on attentional bias in infants, which is an emotion processing construct. The present study investigated if parental stress is positively related to attentional bias towards fearful over happy faces in infants aged 5 to 19 months. The sample consisted out of 220 infants (male: 48,2%, female: 51,2%) and their 229 primary caregivers (male: 32,3%, female: 67,7%). The research has a cross-sectional experimental design. Attentional bias was measured with an eye-tracker, which measured dwell times in infants when looking at happy and fearful faces. Parental stress was measured with the stress-scale of the DASS. The analyses suggested that parental stress was not positively related to attentional bias of their infants, whereas other studies found that parental stress was positively related to attentional bias. These differences in findings may be due to the fact that SES-variables were not taken into account in the present study. Besides, attentional bias differs across age groups, but also age was not taken into account. Therefore, attentional bias is a dynamic construct, which needs to be further examined with respect to variables that influence the link between parental stress and attentional bias.","['attentional bias', 'parental stress', 'emotion regulation']"

In order to bridge the gap between research-based studies (i.e., efficacy studies) and everyday clinical work in education or community settings, this study was conducted under real-world conditions outside of the more constrained university environment. The aim of the current study was to: (1) gain knowledge about characteristics of youth and their families seeking treatment for school refusal in a real-world setting; and (2) to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of a CBT based treatment protocol delivered in an educational setting. Characteristics of ten young people were explored, and treatment effectiveness was assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results suggested that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly prevalent in youth participating in treatment for school refusal in a practice-based setting. Furthermore, increases in school attendance and decreases in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed after treatment. The promising preliminary findings of the study indicate that treatment of school refusal may be effective even for more complex cases with comorbid ASD, and when delivered with limited training and supervision. Thereby, the implementation of treatment for school refusal may become more likely in real-world practice.","['school refusal', 'cognitive behavioural therapy', 'adolescence', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'effectiveness research']"

Based on flow theory it is expected that learners can experience increased levels of skill and challenge (flow) and plenty of immersion and engagement in an educational escape room. Here we examined the best predictor and potential mediatiors of the psychological constructs skill, challenge, immersion and engagement in the relationship with perceived learning. Another goal in this research was exploring the potential individual differences in the experience of flow like age, gender, media experience, cognitive development and collaboration. For the purpose of our last goal, an extensive qualitative research was carried out to examine the group of learners who didn’t experienced flow while playing. The research also provides insight into positive points and improvements for escape room design in the future. Five school classes with students between 10-13 years (N=141) have played the educational escape room of the Bibliotheek Eemland for an hour. Through puzzles and mysteries, the students followed a storyline about a missing vlogger. Learning objectives were various 21st century skills such as social media understanding and programming. Data has been obtained with a self-report questionnaire and additional information from the teacher. It turned out that skill and challenge where the best predictor of the perceived learning. Interesting, because based on the theory, skill and challenge are used to express the degree of flow experiences. Collaboration turned out to be positive related to the flow experience. Most of the students experienced flow and high levels of immersion and engagement while playing the educational escape room, regardless of their personal characteristics. But indications are found for ‘a lot of previous experience with escape rooms’, which may be related to not experiencing flow.",

Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the social and personal norms about disconnecting from the gas grid on the perception about disconnecting from the gas grid, and if these relationships are moderated by social identification. An online survey was distributed (N = 240) among inhabitants within the municipality of Leiden. As predicted, the social and personal norms are important predictors in changing someone’s perception about disconnecting from the gas grid. When there is a social norm where it is normal to disconnect from the gas grid, people are more likely to change their personal norms and perception about disconnection from the gas grid according to this social norm. However, contradicting our predictions, identifying with the neighbors or with people that are important to you did not moderate these relations. These findings confirm that social and personal norms foster the perception about disconnecting from the gas grid. Moreover, the municipality can use these findings as a direction in further research or with developing interventions.","['social norms', 'personal norms', 'social identification', 'disconnecting from the gas grid', 'sustainability']"

Daarnaast werd Daltononderwijs vergeleken met traditioneel onderwijs op leraar activiteiten, en verwondering en intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen. Hiervoor werd een steekproef van 43 scholen verzameld. Zevenhonderddrieëndertig kinderen tussen de 9 en 14 jaar (M = 11.20, SD = 0.65) en 67 leraren deden mee. Kinderen vulden de Wonder Chart in om hun verwondering in kaart te brengen en een zelfreportage vragenlijst om inzicht te krijgen in hun intrinsieke motivatie. Leraren vulden de Wonder-full Education Questionnaire in om te meten in hoeverre zij verwondering stimuleren in hun leerlingen. Resultaten van dit onderzoek laten zien dat er geen verband is tussen de leraar activiteiten en verwondering in leerlingen. Anderzijds bevestigen de resultaten dat er een verband is tussen verwondering en intrinsieke motivatie. Dit betekent dat van kinderen met een hoger niveau van verwondering verwacht kan worden dat zij ook een hoger niveau van intrinsieke motivatie hebben. Deze positieve relatie wordt nog steeds gevonden wanneer er gecorrigeerd wordt voor het opleidingsniveau van de ouders en CITO-scores. De resultaten laten daarnaast zien dat leraren op Daltonscholen geen hoger niveau van leraar activiteiten hebben dan leraren op traditionele scholen. Het niveau van verwondering en intrinsieke motivatie bij leerlingen op Daltonscholen verschilt ook niet van dat bij leerlingen op traditionele scholen. Deze bevindingen kunnen suggereren dat het stimuleren van verwondering een manier is om intrinsieke motivatie van leerlingen te verhogen, wat bevorderlijk kan zijn voor hun schoolprestaties.",
Differential Learning Effects in a Probabilistic Serial Reaction Time Task.,"Vegt, Bas","['Kleijn, R. de', 'Heijnen, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Human behaviour consists largely of elemental tasks, which when performed in sequence make up larger actions. In the trajectory serial reaction time (SRT) task, participants move their cursors to one of four stimuli located at corners in a square-shaped grid. This task has been used to study implicit learning of motor skills. Of interest to the present study are results from Kachergis, De Kleijn, et al. (2014) in which subsequences were not learned unilaterally. Preliminary analysis carried out after the fact suggests this effect cannot be fully ascribed to diagonal or infrequent moves making certain subsequences harder. The present study aims to determine whether the effect is due to variations in distance, whether it is correlated with frequency, and whether its orientation frame is absolute or relative. 52 participants divided into two conditions, each of which saw subsequences in a different orientation, performed an online version of the trajectory SRT task. We discuss three main findings. First, no evidence was found to suggest relative distance played a role. Second, moves which occurred frequently were associated with lower RTs. Third, relative RTs per subsequence were the same between the two conditions, indicating the effect is relative to the orientation of moves made during training. Together these results lead us to conclude that higher frequency of certain moves during training leads to better post-training performance of subsequences containing these moves. Post-hoc analyses suggest this relationship might not be entirely straight-forward. In light of these outcomes and their implications, we discuss several opportunities for future research, as well as limitations and alternate interpretations.","['Sequential action', 'sequential learning', 'serial reaction time task', 'implicit learning', 'movement trajectory', 'action sequencing', 'visuospatial reference frame', 'statistical learning']"

Limiting Smartphone Use and its Effects on Anxiety:The Mediating Role of Fear of Missing Out,"Tsamouras, Dimitris","['Peter, S.', 'Boelens, H.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Smartphones facilitate everyday life and offer possibilities for entertainment and communication. Because of their widespread use they can affect the psychological state of the user. It has been found that high smartphone use correlates with anxiety and Fear of Missing out (FoMO) and that FoMO mediates the relationship between anxiety and smartphone use. However, most research is correlational. The current study conducted an experiment in order to investigate the effects of a two-week smartphone limitation on anxiety and FoMO in Dutch students. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group, which received instructions on how to limit smartphone use for 14 days, and a control group which continued smartphone use as usual. Anxiety and FoMO were measured at baseline and after the end of the intervention. We expected that the intervention would lead to higher decreases in anxiety and FoMO in the experimental group compared to the control group. We also expected that FoMO would mediate the relationship between smartphone use and anxiety. The results indicated that smartphone use, anxiety and FoMO did not significantly differ in the two groups. Moreover, no mediating effect of FoMO between smartphone use and anxiety was found. These results show that the intervention was not adequate in order to improve participants’ anxiety and FoMO, possibly highlighting the positive role of smartphones in everyday life. Due to several limitations, these study results can only be generalized to specific populations and future research should replicate this experimental design with a more representative population.","['smartphone', 'smartphone use', 'anxiety', 'fear of missing out', 'smartphone limitation intervention']"
The effects of previous cancer history on memory decline in older adults,"Gerards, Monique","['Schuitema I.', 'Houdt, C. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Cancer is a common disease and causes cognitive problems, including memory problems. Regardless of the type of cancer, cognitive impairment is a common outcome. In this study we expected to see the accelerated aging effect in participants reporting a history of any type of cancer. Research has shown that in addition to age, gender, the APOE ε4 allele and psychiatric diagnoses also influence memory performance after a cancer diagnosis. For this study, the data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) was used. Memory performance over time was analyzed. The variables were tested via a multilevel analysis, to see if there was any difference in memory function over time between the group of cancer survivors and individuals without a history of cancer. The first hypothesis tested was whether memory decline in older (healthy aging) individuals was accelerated in those with a history of cancer. In this study, no effect of a cancer diagnosis on memory was found over time. The second hypothesis was whether this effect was stronger in female cancer survivors than in male cancer survivors. This research showed that there is indeed a gender effect, in which women have better memory retention, but that this difference does not interact with a cancer diagnosis. As a third hypothesis, this research investigated whether the APOE ε4 allele had an influence on memory decline in individuals with and without a cancer diagnosis. It was found that the APOE ε4 allele appeared to have an influence on the course of memory retention in the group with a history of cancer, but that this result was most likely not reliable due to an analysis on a small sample. The fourth hypothesis tested was the influence of psychiatric diagnoses on memory performance. It was found that depression accelerated memory loss over time, but there was no interaction with other factors. Further research could investigate whether there is a difference between different types of memory performance after cancer treatment. It is also important to investigate this in different types of cancer and their different treatments.",
The Link Between Childhood Trauma and Suicide Attempts is Mediated by Emotion Dysregulation and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury,"Colak, Tülin","['Krause-Utz, A.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Suicide attempts are highly prevalent in borderline personality disorder (BPD), whereas risk factors still remain to be discovered. There is empirical evidence that childhood trauma might predict suicide attempts. The biosocial model by Linehan assumes that childhood abuse causes emotion dysregulation, which leads to dysfunctional behavior patterns, such as non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts. Still, the mechanisms underlying these links are not entirely understood. Therefore, it was investigated whether the link between childhood trauma and suicide attempts is mediated by difficulties in emotion regulation as well as NSSI in BPD. The results showed that difficulties in emotion regulation and NSSI indeed mediate the link between childhood trauma and suicide attempts, whereas non-significant results were obtained for a serial mediation model. Overall, both difficulties in emotion regulation and NSSI seem to be significantly related to suicide attempts in individuals who have experienced childhood maltreatment. To conclude, given the correlational design of this study, the causal interplay of these factors remains to be discovered.",
The relationship between alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms and the moderating role of caffeine in students: A cross-sectional study,"Otten, Lisa","['Berg, J.F. van den']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Studies suggest that alcohol consumption is related to more depressive symptoms and that caffeine consumption is related to fewer depressive symptoms. Caffeine consumption could interact with alcohol consumption to affect the level of depressive symptoms. Our study has focused on the relationship between alcohol and caffeine consumption and depressive symptoms, and to what extent caffeine moderates this relationship. Our cross-sectional study investigated 1276 Dutch students with an average age of 21.1 (SD = 2.8) years. Participants filled in an online questionnaire on depressive symptoms (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Rated) and a substance use questionnaire. Mean alcohol consumption was 4.8 (SD = 7) glasses per week and mean caffeine consumption was 601.9 (SD = 779) mg per week. Regression analysis showed a significant inverse relationship between weekly alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms (β = -.066, p = .034). Caffeine consumption was not related to depressive symptoms (β = -.027, p = .329). A significant moderation effect of caffeine was found (β = .125, p < .001). Additional analyses showed that alcohol consumption was only related to depressive symptoms when a moderate amount of caffeine was consumed (β = -.132, p = .021). Different mechanisms possibly play a role at high and low levels of alcohol and caffeine consumption, but the results are difficult to interpret. An active social life could be a confounder in the inverse relationship between alcohol and depressive symptoms and further research concerning this possible confounding effect and the moderation effect of caffeine consumption is recommended.",

The role of children’s temperament in the relation between parental sensitivity and children’s prosocial behavior.,"Muitjens, Aimee","['Drunen, L. van', 'Meulen, M. van der']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Humans have a psychological need to belong and in middle childhood peers become an important source to fulfill this need through peer acceptance. Peer acceptance has positive effects like increasing your well-being and social-status and decreases your chance of being bullied. Prosocial behavior increases peer acceptance because it is meant to benefit other people through sharing, comforting, and helping. Due to positive outcomes, factors influencing prosocial behavior are explored. Previous studies have looked at factors in early childhood and found that sensitive parents and better inhibitory control increases prosocial behavior. How temperament, specifically inhibitory control, and parental sensitivity can increase prosocial behavior in middle childhood is not fully understood. This study aims to investigate whether children's temperament mediates the relation between parental sensitivity and children’s prosocial behavior. Temperament determines the way children respond to their parents' sensitivity. Children with less inhibitory control respond more to parental sensitivity and improve their inhibition, which increases their prosocial behavior because children are better able to inhibit impulses that benefit themselves and behave more beneficial for others. The participants are part of a larger twin study (n=512) of the Leiden Consortium on Individual Development (L-CID). In the present study, a selected sample (n=170) was used. We did not reveal that children’s temperament, measured as inhibitory control, was a mediator in the relation between parental sensitivity and prosocial behavior. However, a positive relationship between children's temperament and prosocial behavior was observed. This study looked at parental sensitivity in a new way namely through observation but did not look at differences for maternal and paternal sensitivity. Perhaps future research could look at other factors than parents like peers and tv shows in middle childhood.",['Prosocial behavior in middle childhood']
Presentation anxiety in adolescents with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities: a study on the role of social trust and interpretation bias.,"Boer, Claudia","['Bexkens, A.', 'Bos, M.G.N.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying factors of presentation anxiety in adolescents with Mild to Borderline Intellectual Disabilities (MBID). This was done by addressing two key questions. Firstly, as people with MBID are at risk for developing an insecure attachment and an insecure attachment is related to low social trust, we investigated whether social trust is related to presentation anxiety in adolescents with MBID. Secondly, we studied whether interpretation bias is a mediator in the relation between social trust and presentation anxiety in these adolescents. Adolescents with MBID completed a series of questionnaires, namely the Children’s Generalized Trust Believes (CGTB), the Adolescents’ Interpretation and Belief Questionnaire (AIBQ) and the Personal Report for Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA). These questionnaires were administered to measure the adolescents’ levels of social trust, interpretation bias and presentation anxiety. Their teachers also rated the adolescents’ levels of presentation anxiety on the PRPSA teacher report. We found no evidence for a relation between social trust and presentation anxiety, both for self-reports and teacher reports. Furthermore, interpretation bias was no mediator in this relation. However, after specifying for interpretation bias in social situations, a positive correlation was found between negative interpretation bias in social situations and self-reports of presentation anxiety. In addition, we found a positive relation between social trust and teacher reported presentation anxiety. These results are taken to suggest that adolescents with MBID with a negative interpretation bias in social situations, experience more presentation anxiety. Furthermore, we can conclude that higher social trust in adolescents with MBID is related to higher reports of presentation anxiety by their teachers.","['Presentation anxiety', 'social trust', 'intellectual disability']"
Underlying Mechanisms of Presentation Anxiety in Adolescents with Mild to Borderline Intellectual Disability,"Berghuijs, Fenna","['Bexkens, A.', 'Bos, M.G.N.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study investigated possible underlying mechanisms of presentation anxiety in adolescents with a mild to borderline intellectual disability. Presentation anxiety was measured through self-reports and teacher-reports. Due to disagreements on whether presentation anxiety exists independently from, or as a subtype of, social anxiety, the present study investigated both anxiety-types separately. Participants were 14 adolescents with MBID in the age of 12-23 who completed abbreviated intelligence measures and questionnaires on the underlying mechanisms. Results showed neither a correlation nor a difference between self- and teacher-reported presentation anxiety. Moreover, self-reported presentation anxiety was positively correlated with social anxiety and negative interpretation bias, whereas teacher-reported presentation anxiety was not correlated with any of the variables. Hierarchical regression analyses controlling for IQ showed that peer attachment was a significant predictor for self-reported presentation anxiety and social anxiety. It is concluded that peers play an important role in the development of presentation anxiety in MBID adolescents and should therefore be a point of attention for schools, caregivers and treatments. Future studies should focus on including a larger sample and should consider including peer-reports.","['Intellectual disabilities', 'Presentation anxiety', 'Social Anxiety', 'Adolescents']"
De invloed van het gebruik van een draagzak door vaders op testosteronniveaus en sensitief ouderschap,"Hooftman, Silvie","['Bakermans-Kranenburg, M.J.', 'Buisman, R.S.M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Introduction: Parental sensitivity has been shown to be important for a child’s healthy development. Most research on parenting has been conducted with mothers, with research on fathering lagging behind. In the present study, we, therefore, focused on fathers. It was examined whether the use of an intervention that stimulated physical contact, i.e., a baby carrier, would increase fathers’ sensitivity, and whether this association was mediated by testosterone. Method: Participants in this study were 38 men (Mean age = 34.60, SD = 5.02) who recently became fathers. Infant age ranged from 8 to 12 weeks old at the start of the intervention. Fathers were asked to use a baby carrier for 21 days. Sensitivity was observed before and after the intervention in a free play setting. Use of the baby carrier was measured with warmth sensors on the baby carrier. Testosterone levels are measured by taking saliva samples. Results: Men used the baby carrier on average 33 minutes per day. Results showed no relation between the use of the baby carrier (i.e. physical contact) and testosterone and no relation between testosterone and sensitivity. This means that the relationship between physical contact and sensitivity was therefore not mediated by testosterone. Conclusion: Low levels of baby carrier use may not be enough to increase sensitivity in fathers. In addition, future research could include a larger and more diverse sample to examine the relations between physical contact, testosterone and sensitivity.","['fathers', 'sensitivity', 'baby carrier', 'physical contact', 'testosterone']"
Inhibition as a factor underlying susceptibility to peer influence in adolescents with MBID,"Lufuankenda, Zurayma","['Bexkens, A.', 'Boelens, H.H.', 'Wagemaker, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"It is known that adolescents with mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID) take more risks than typically developing adolescents. To gain more knowledge in which factors underlies this increased risk-taking, this study investigated whether inhibition capacity is a predicting factor of susceptibility to peer influence in adolescents with MBID. To investigate this, a group with adolescents with MBID was compared to a typically developing control group. The sample comprised of 27 completed questionnaires, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; in a peer or solo condition), assessing risk taking and a stop signal task (SST) assessing inhibition. Analyses indicated that (a) risk taking behavior increased when manipulated with peer influence; (b) peer effects were not different for adolescents with MBID than typically developing adolescents; (c) adolescents with MBID showed no lower inhibition response compared to adolescents without MBID and (c) inhibition was not a predictor for increased susceptibility to peer influence. Surprisingly, these findings were not consistent with our hypotheses. However, this is the first study investigating the underlying mechanisms for susceptibility to peer influence in adolescents with MBID. Results of this study may serve as key directions for future research.","['intellectual disability', 'peer influence', 'inhibition', 'adolescence', 'BART analogue risk taking']"

We expected that musical training and parental sensitivity had a positive effect on prosocial behaviour. Furthermore, we expected a positive relation of parental sensitivity on musical training. We used two behavioural tasks and a questionnaire to determine the constructs. The research sample was recruited from the longitudinal twin study of the Leiden Consortium on Individual Development. Multiple regression analyses were done. Our results indicated that musical training and parental sensitivity did not influence the prosocial behaviour in early adolescents. Furthermore, sensitive parenting had no effect on whether a child will attend musical training.

Effect of Post Encoding Task Difficulty on Episodic Memory Consolidation,"Ramakic, Dino","['Varma, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Decades of memory research have shown that memories are acquired in a fragile state and are strengthened over time, a process called consolidation. The research focused on the process of consolidation and what benefits and harms it. It was believed that rest and sleep are most beneficial for the consolidation of memories, but recently there have been studies showing that not all mental effort interferes with the quality of the consolidation. Autobiographical thinking might harm the process by introducing novel episodic memory processing while a 2Back task might suppress this phenomenon while not draining the episodic memory resources. In this study, we used a modified 0Back and 2Back delay period to ascertain how memory performance would be affected by different task difficulty and consequently different quality and quantity of thoughts. Participants went through an encoding period, where they learned faces, followed by the delay period, and lastly, a memory test was administered. Thought propensity was measured by random thought probes during the delay period. We hypothesized task-related thoughts to be associated with the 2Back condition and task-unrelated thoughts with 0Back. Furthermore, we expected similar memory performance in the two conditions. Our results showed that there were significant differences in the types of thoughts the frequency of them in the two conditions. Adding to that, 2Back memory performance was positively correlated with task-related thoughts. In conclusion, our results suggest substantial differences in types of thoughts between the conditions and relation between task-related thoughts and memory consolidation.",
Effect of Post Encoding T ask Difficulty on Episodic Memory Consolidation,"Ho, Macy","['Varma, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Recent studies showed that performing a 2-Back during post-encoding had similar facilitating effects on memory consolidation as wakeful rest, possibly due to a balance between the interreference effects of autobiographical thinking (suppressed during 2-Back) and the facilitating effects of offline replay (increased during rest) on memory consolidation. The current study investigates the relationship between autobiographical thinking and memory consolidation in a within-subjects design, by comparing two post-encoding periods differing in task difficulty: 0-Back and 2-Back. Participants (N = 22) performed two sessions of three blocks; an encoding task, a 15-minute post-encoding period, and a recognition task. Autobiographical thinking was measured via experience-sampling thought probes. We predicted autobiographical thinking to interfere with consolidation and more autobiographical thinking during the 0-Back compared to the 2-Back. We also expected equal memory consolidation across conditions, assuming increased offline replay during the 0-Back. As hypothesized, autobiographical thinking was higher during the 0-Back than during the 2-Back, and results showed no difference in memory consolidation across the post-encoding conditions. The present findings did not show a direct relationship between autobiographical thinking during post-encoding and consolidation. We argue that the failure to detect a relationship can be explained by the current study being underpowered, due to small sample size and the number of thought probes. In conclusion, results do show that manipulating task difficulty of the n-Back can be an effective method to affect autobiographical thinking. However, the relationship of autobiographical thinking and memory consolidation remains unclear, and requires further research.","['episodic memory consolidation', 'n-back task', 'task difficulty', 'autobiographical thinking']"
De invloed van machtsdistributie op groepsonderhandeling,"Taylor, Tumaini","['Steinel, W.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Volgens Van Tol (2016) heeft machtsdistributie invloed op hoe een groepsonderhandeling verloopt. Mensen met veel macht kunnen invloed uitoefenen op de beslissingen tijdens het onderhandelen. De resultaten van Van Tol (2016) geven inzicht op welke effecten iemand met totale macht (dictatorschap) zou kunnen hebben op een groepsonderhandeling tussen drie personen. In dit onderzoek worden deze effecten verder vergeleken met groepen waar er sprake is van gelijke macht of een baas (zonder beslisbevoegdheid). Daarmee wordt bedoeld bazen zonder totale macht. Er wordt voorspeld dat groepen met gelijke macht of met een baas gezamenlijk meer punten zullen behalen dan een groep met een dictator. Daarnaast wordt er verwacht dat groepen met een vrouwelijke baas de punten eerlijker zullen verdelen dan groepen met een mannelijke baas. Tot slot wordt er verondersteld dat vrouwen in de rol van dictator gezamenlijk meer punten verzamelen en opzichte van mannelijke dictators. Er is een rollenspel uitgevoerd met groepen van drie personen. Voor dit onderzoek zijn er in totaal n=276 respondenten geworven (n=138 vrouwen, n=138 mannen), verdeeld over n= 92 groepen.

Er is een klein verschil tussen de effecten van groepen met gelijke macht of een baas en groepen met een dictator. Vervolgens blijkt dat geslacht daarbij geen grote rol speelt. Uiteindelijk blijkt dat de groepen met een vrouwelijke dictator minder punten hebben behaald dan groepen met een mannelijke dictator. Concluderend kan er gezegd worden dat geslacht een kleine, maar geen significante invloed heeft op machtsgebruik bij groepsonderhandelingen.",
Effect of Post-Encoding Task Difficulty on Episodic Memory Consolidation,"Lunteren, Koen van","['Varma, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Previous research has shown that a post-encoding rest period has similar effects on ongoing memory consolidation as executing a 2-back task, due to a suspected balance between interference suppression (in 2-back) and spontaneous reactivation of memory traces (in rest). The current study investigates the relationship between post-encoding task difficulty, autobiographical thinking and episodic memory consolidation by improving methodological issues in previous work. Episodic memory consolidation in a 2-back condition is compared to a 0-back condition, while analyzing autobiographical thinking proportions. It is expected that autobiographical thinking negatively correlates with consolidation and that autobiographical thinking is higher in the 0-back condition, compared to 2-back. However, given the higher chance of spontaneous reactivation of memory traces in the 0-back condition, it is expected that both conditions show equal memory consolidation. In a within-subjects design, participants (N = 22) are shown face stimuli, which they later identify in a recognition test, after executing a 0-back or 2-back task. During these n-back tasks, thought probes are presented targeting autobiographical thinking (and other mindwandering instances). Results show no direct relationship between autobiographical thinking and memory consolidation, but previous studies are replicated by showing similar memory consolidation after performing the two n-back tasks. In conclusion, the results reinvigorate the idea of a post-encoding 2-back task resulting in similar consolidation outcomes as a less demanding post-encoding task. Moreover, the outcomes suggest that n-back task difficulty affects autobiographical thinking, but the direct effect of this process on memory consolidation requires further investigation, potentially in the form of a neuroimaging study.","['episodic memory consolidation', 'autobiographical thinking', 'n-back task', 'interference suppression']"
Op vertrouwen bouwen: De rol van leeszelfconcept in leesvaardigheid en leesgedrag van middelbare scholieren,"Philippa, Sylvia","['Mol, S.E.', 'Chung, S.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"The Dutch government has called for a “reading offensive” to ensure a drastic change in the reading development of Dutch high school students. This urgent call is a response to the significant drop of students’ reading ability over the past years. The “reading offensive” focuses primarily on making sure that students will read more. However, previous research suggests that reading selfconcept is a crucial aspect of reading ability, next to reading behavior and gender. This research study therefore examined reading behavior and gender in the relationship between reading self-concept and reading ability. Students from the first two grades in high school (N = 158; Mage = 13.11 years; SD = .69) completed online questionnaires and read two maze-texts. To analyze the data several correlations, a Pearsons chi-square test and hierarchical multiple regressions were performed. The correlations showed a relationship between reading self-concept and reading ability, but no gender differences within these two variables. Girls did read more than boys, although this was a small effect. There was no moderating effect of gender on the relationship between reading self-concept and reading ability. However, the relationship between reading self-concept and reading ability was moderated by reading behavior. Students with a low self-concept who considered themselves as ‘leisure readers’ had lower reading ability scores than students with a low self-concept who considered themselves as ‘non-leisure readers’. The difference between leisure and non-readers in regard to their reading abilities corresponds with a Matthew-effect and the “bad is stronger than good”-hypothesis, implying that negative experiences in reading have worse consequences than positive experiences, with self-concept being considered as a crucial counterpart of interventions improving reading ability, before improving reading ability and thereby improving reading behavior. Implications and suggestions for interventions and follow-up research are discussed.","['reading self-concept', 'reading ability', 'gender', 'reading behavior', 'Matthew-effect']"

The effect of dyadic synchronization on sustained attention,"Potter, Anna","['Boekel, W.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"in a working environment, colleagues are interacting which each other. During the more intense type of social interactions in the office, physiological synchrony takes place. This is the phenomenon in social interactions when the physiological activity (heartbeat, respiration and electrodermal activity) of a subject synchronizes with another person during an interaction. The current study investigates the effect of dyadic synchroniza2on on sustained attention. To that extent, 54 participants were divided into pairs (i.e. dyads). During the synchronization the subjects were told to look the other person in the eye for five minutes. Heart rate and Skin Conductance Level (SCL) were measured on each subject. After the synchronization the attentional lapses were measured, by full filling the Sustained-Attention-to-Response Task (SART). The results show that social interactions (i.e. dyadic synchronization sessions) can lead to a reduced sustained attention during the working tasks, shortly after the interaction. These findings show that there is an effect of synchronization following concentrated face-to-face contact, but the price may be a higher error rate in individual tasks immediately after the contact. Owing to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred during this research, this way of data gathering is not possible. The data on synchronisation were taken from a previous study by Behrens and the data for the SART test were generated with a simulated model. The results of this research based on a simulated model of the SART test, can be used to prepare a detailed study with real human subjects.",

Emotions have been studied for decades. Ekman was the first to introduce the six basic emotions of facial expression: sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and happiness (Ekman, 1999). The interaction between attention and emotion can be tested with the dot-probe task. This task tests for attentional biases (Koster, Crombez, Verschuere & Houwer, 2004). We simulate the participants grouped into dyads. These dyads are simultaneously synchronized, we examine the psychological effect. We expect that dyads who are in sync have similar results on the dot-probe task. We suspect that a high level of synchronization relates to even more similarity on the dotprobe task. With the Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) scale we test the overlap between participants and the degree of overlap of the participant in general. This whole thesis will be based on simulations due to Covid-19. Three scenarios are presented one supporting H1, another ambiguous situation and another supporting H0.",

Instead of examining subjects, data was simulated for the dot-probe task and the results on the LSAS. The physiological data associated with dyadic synchronization has been taken from a previous study. Since the data from this study is non-existent, the results are only hypothetical and therefore cannot be considered truth. The aim of this simulation is therefore to provide a design and working method for research in the future. In other words is this simulation useful for the pre-registration of similar research in this field. It can be concluded from the hypothetical results of this simulation that there is a relationship between the score on the LSAS and the degree of synchronization, but that there is no relationship between the score on the LSAS and the results on the dot-probe task.",

The association between mood states and diet in bipolar disorder,"Meer, Bart van der","['Koenders, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Two percent of the population in the Netherlands suffers from a bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder comes with a lot of comorbid mental and physical pathologies ranging from cardiovascular diseases, anxieties, to metabolic syndrome. Diet plays a role in the course of these comorbidities and bipolar disorder. Some research has been done into the effects of diet on mood but a lot of it is focused on healthy populations and people with a unipolar depression. This thesis will focus on the association between depression and mania and diet in people with bipolar disorder. In the current study diet was assessed with the food frequency questionnaire, in a sample of 34 recently diagnosed bipolar patients. Five foodgroups have been formed consisting of sweet rich foods, starch rich foods, fibre rich foods, protein rich foods and dairy products. There was only a small negative association found between starch rich foods and manic symptoms. A possible explanation might be that people with bipolar disorder in a manic phase are too busy and too distracted to eat.

The effects of fatigue and coping on work absenteeism in people with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis,"Parlevliet, Lyanne","['Kiele, K. van der', 'Egmond, E.E.A. van']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system. Symptoms include fatigue, worsening mobility, and cognitive impairment. Unemployment is common in the MS-community. Within 10 years of disease onset 50-80% of MS-patients will be unemployed. Absenteeism often precedes unemployment. Work absenteeism has been associated with several physical and psychological factors in MS, such as fatigue, and use of maladaptive coping styles. Our aim is to investigate both fatigue and maladaptive coping as possible predictors for work absenteeism. To our knowledge coping and fatigue have not been investigated together with respect to work absenteeism in MS-patients. It is important to study absenteeism to prevent future unemployment as much as possible. Method. We investigated 269 employed MS-patients (age 21-63, Mage = 42.09, SDage = 9.39, 77.3% female) of which 47 had been absent within the last seven days. Participants completed questionnaires regarding fatigue (checklist for individual strength), coping style (coping inventory for stressful situations), and work absenteeism. We conducted three logistic regression analyses in which absenteeism was the dependent variable. Fatigue was investigated with subjective fatigue, motivation, concentration, and physical activity as predictors. Coping style was investigated with task-oriented, emotion-oriented, and avoidant coping as predictors. The last analysis investigated both fatigue and coping as predictors for absenteeism with all previous predictors mentioned. Results. A model in which multidimensional aspects of fatigue predict absenteeism was significant (X 2 (4) = 30.46, p < .001), fatigue, concentration, and physical activity were significant predictors of absenteeism (Bfatigue = 0.04, p = .036; Bconcentration = 0.07, p = .011, Bphysical_activity = -0.03, p = .032 respectively). A model in which coping style predicts work absenteeism was non-significant (X 2 (3) = 5.88, p = .118). The model in which both fatigue and coping were investigated was significant (X 2 (7) = 30.80, p < .001), however this model did not yield any additional information. Conclusion. Fatigue, concentration, and physical activity predict work absenteeism for MS-patients. Possible interventions might be CBT or motivational interviewing, both these interventions can be used to minimize work absenteeism.","['multiple sclerosis', 'fatigue', 'physical activity', 'concentration', 'emotion-oriented coping style', 'avoidant coping style', 'work absenteeism']"

Although it is a widely used instrument, the AQ is not yet validated in non-western countries. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to measure the validity of the AQ in Iran and Malaysia. This is done by comparing these two countries by a more western country like the Netherlands. The total sample consisted of 377 participants, mostly students, from Iran, Malaysia and the Netherlands. The results revealed that a greater extent of autistic traits were reported in the non-western countries in comparison to the Netherlands. An adapted version of the AQ was used to examine whether there are cultural differences in socially accepted behaviour. Reportedly, autism-related behaviour in accordance of the AQ is more common and accepted in non-western countries than in the Netherlands. Additionally, a comparison of the amount of autism-knowledge is made between the Netherlands, Iran, and Malaysia. The participants from the non-western countries had less knowledge about ASD than the participants from the Netherlands. Only in Malaysia, the amount of knowledge was related to the amount of experience the participants had with people diagnosed with ASD. The results of this study will contribute to the development of an adapted version of the AQ, which is also valid in non-western countries.",
"Anxiety and empathic accuracy: the influence of anxiety symptoms, emotional valence and intelligence on empathic accuracy","Geersing, Foke","['Wever, M.C.M.', 'Elzinga, B.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Empathic accuracy indicates the ability to correctly assess the thoughts and emotions of others and is of importance to social functioning. Since anxiety is associated with cognitive and social deficits, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between anxiety and empathic accuracy, and to examine the influence of emotional valence and intelligence on this relation. This was investigated in a cross-sectional research design among adults of the general population (N = 110, N women = 62, N men = 48. Age: M = 48.42, SD = 5.52, range = 35-64 years) using an empathic accuracy task, the SCARED-A questionnaire and the subtests Vocabulary and Block Design of the WAIS-IV. Results indicated that anxiety symptoms and empathic accuracy were not related, until controlling for intelligence. Anxious individuals with high intelligence were less empathic accurate and anxious individuals with low intelligence were more empathic accurate. Emotional valence did not moderate the relation between anxiety and empathic accuracy. However, intelligence and emotional valence themselves were related to empathic accuracy, indicating that higher intelligence predicted higher empathic accuracy and positive valence predicted higher empathic accuracy outcomes compared to negative valence. The present findings replicated previous research findings on the influence of intelligence and emotional valence on the concept of empathic accuracy. In case future research could confirm the findings regarding the relationship between anxiety and empathic accuracy, this might contribute to the development of additional interventions to the treatment of anxiety disorders, since empathic accuracy is a trainable skill.",

De normen en waarden over wat normaal gedrag is kunnen variëren van cultuur tot cultuur en hierdoor kunnen kenmerken van autisme mogelijk verschillend worden geïnterpreteerd in verschillende culturen of niet worden opgemerkt. De verschillen in de AQ-score tussen personen uit Azië (Maleisië), het Midden-Oosten (Iran) en Europa (Nederland) werden in huidig onderzoek onderzocht. De onderzoekspopulatie bestond uit 377 participanten, waarvan 59,2% vrouw en 40,8% man. De mate van cultuurgevoeligheid van de items van de AQ is gemeten met een voor huidig onderzoek ontwikkelde vragenlijst, de CAQ, om te onderzoeken in hoeverre er gedragskenmerken zijn die in de ene cultuur als normaal sociaal gedrag worden gezien terwijl ze in een andere cultuur als afwijkend sociaal gedrag worden beschouwd. Hierbij werd een mogelijk significant verschil tussen de twee niet-Westerse culturen en de Westerse cultuur onderzocht. Uit een Factorial ANOVA bleek dat personen uit Maleisië en Iran een significant hogere AQ-score behaalden dan personen uit Nederland. Er bleek ook dat personen uit Maleisië een significant hogere AQ-score behaalden dan personen uit Iran. Er was verder sprake van een significante interactie tussen land en geslacht. Mannen uit de algehele populatie uit Iran en Nederland behaalden een significant hogere AQ-score dan vrouwen uit de algehele populatie. Er werden 18 items van de CAQ gevonden waarbij de scores van de participanten uit Maleisië en Iran vergelijkbaar waren, maar significant verschilden van de scores van de participanten uit Nederland. Er zijn vanuit voorgaande onderzoeken en vanuit huidig onderzoek aanwijzingen dat de AQ een cultuurgevoelige vragenlijst is en dat elke cultuur indien mogelijk zijn/haar eigen validatie onderzoek zal moet doen en bepaalde items zou moeten aanpassen of verwijderen om de AQ een valide screeningsinstrument te maken. De resultaten van de AQ in culturen waar nog geen validatie onderzoek naar de AQ is gedaan zijn daarom mogelijk minder betrouwbaar en zullen met voorzichtigheid moeten worden geïnterpreteerd.",
Comfort and Conflict. Does Pleasant Touch Modulate Cognitive Control?,"Ragnarsson, Hafsteinn","['Steenbergen, H. van', 'Mulckhuyse, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Cognitive control is ubiquitous in daily life. From academic success to eating healthy, cognitive control is needed to monitor and direct goal-driven behavior. Recent findings have suggested a link between cognitive control and affective states. Various types of positive affect have been shown to reduce adaptation to conflict in cognitive control functions. In this study, we examine the effects of positive affective touch on cognitive control and activation of corrugator supercilii (facial frowning muscle) during a Stroop-like conflict task. Positive affect was induced with brush stroking at the optimal speed (3 cm/s) to stimulate CT afferents in the forearm. We predicted that positive tactile affect would reduce conflict adaptation and transient corrugator response to conflict. Additionally, we predicted it would reduce sustained corrugator activation during three timeframes: Each trial block, each touch application and the first touch application of each trial block. We did not find robust evidence suggesting that positive affective touch modulates cognitive control, nor did we find that it reduced corrugator response to conflict. Furthermore, positive affective touch did not reduce the sustained corrugator activation in any timeframe. However, our findings showed that positive affective touch reduces the overall transient corrugator activation immediately following a trial response. We suggest that (a) some baseline amount of negative affect is inherent to action selection in conflict tasks, and (b) positive affective touch increases μ-opioid activation in the anterior cingulate cortex which suppresses negative affect. Lastly, we speculate why the affective quality of CT optimal touch might not be strong enough to produce behavioral changes in the Stroop-like conflict task used in this study.","['cognitive control', 'conflict adaption', 'corrugator supercilii', 'CT optimal touch', 'ACC', 'μ-opioid']"

Previous studies are suggesting that individuals with HL have fewer communication opportunities in comparison to typically hearing (TH) individuals, therefore have problems developing social strategies and competence. However, research is still lacking for prosociality in (pre-)adolescence with HL. The current study investigated spontaneous helping behavior in (pre-)adolescents with and without hearing loss, while also taking looking and smiling behaviors into account as prerequisite non-verbal communicative cues. 233 (pre-)adolescents between the ages of ten and sixteen took part in the study (Mean age= 146.71 months, SD=17.04), out of which 177 were TH and 56 had HL. Our results demonstrated that individuals with and without HL did not differ in their looking, smiling and spontaneous helping behaviors. There was no difference found in the target prosocial behavior between the different genders, parental education levels, or school types. Furthermore, age at amplification was found unrelated to looking and helping behaviors. Given our non-significant findings, we discuss the possible limitations of our research design such as group imbalances and lack of emphasis on certain individual differences, and address the literature gap in this particular clinical group during (pre-)adolescence.","['prosociality', 'spontaneous helping behavior', 'gender', 'parental education', 'school type', 'age at amplification', 'hearing loss']"

In the between-subjects design, the participants were tested in one of four different conditions: dynamic body, dynamic face, static body and static face of which the dynamic conditions included lineup videos of either the whole body with the face covered by a black box or only the face while the static conditions included still excerpts of the above mentioned videos from the dynamic conditions. Participants were then asked to identify the perpetrator from a previously seen crime video out of a lineup with six members. There was no significant effect in identification accuracy between those conditions, however, results indicated that the static conditions resulted in slightly better person identification accuracy compared to the dynamic conditions (p = .103). Previous research that sometimes suggests no correlation between confidence and accuracy in unfamiliar person identification was supported (p = .48).",

In addition, a distinction of static (stills) vs. dynamic (video) information was made. Participants (mostly undergraduate Dutch students) were randomly assigned to a condition combining these two variables (for example, a static face condition). They were shown an actor committing a crime. After this a distraction task was performed. Participants were then shown a sequential line-up and had to make an assessment of who they believed the perpetrator to be. Seeing the face or the body did not produce significant differences. Also, whether the information was static or dynamic did not lead to significant results. In addition, a brief analysis of the confidence-accuracy relationship and possible line-up position effects were also investigated. No significant effects were found for these relationships.",
Does language help?

Language is similarly combinatorial: sentences can be decomposed into words, describing aspects of meaning as separate entities. In this study we used artificial language and a visual search paradigm to examine whether combinatorial language can influence low-level visual perception. We predicted that items with combinatorial names (syllables referring to the features of the items) will initially take longer to learn than those with non-combinatorial labels (arbitrary names), but will become easier to identify over time. We also predicted that combinatorial names will be remembered better. There was no significant interaction of block and condition for reaction time and accuracy. As predicted, recall was higher for combinatorial labels in the combinatorial to non-combinatorial ones. We also found an interaction effect between set size and condition, which demonstrates that combinatorial labelling is processed differently than non-combinatorial labels. Overall, our findings support the idea that learning combinatorial labels is more cognitively demanding and requires more conscious computation compared to the associative recall of non-combinatorial labels.","['language', 'combinatorial structure', 'feature integration theory', 'visual search', 'artificial language']"

In dit onderzoek is er gekeken naar het verschil in het aantal correcte identificaties bij statische (stilstaande beelden) en dynamische (bewegende beelden) line-ups van het gezicht en lichaam. Er is een online Qualtrics experiment uitgevoerd waarbij de participanten (n = 101) een misdaadvideo en vervolgens een afleidingsvideo te zien kregen. Hierna kregen ze willekeurig statische of dynamische line-ups te zien van het gezicht of lichaam en moesten ze de dader identificeren of aangeven dat de dader niet aanwezig is. Verwacht werd dat dynamische line-ups van zowel het gezicht als lichaam voor meer correcte identificaties zouden zorgen dan statische line-ups. Het bleek echter dat de dynamische condities niet zorgden voor significant meer correcte identificaties. Ook bleek dat dynamische line-ups van het gezicht niet zorgde voor meer correcte identificaties. Ten slotte is er gekeken of het vertrouwen in het eigen antwoord meer correcte identificaties oplevert. Ook dit effect was niet significant. Vertrouwen in het eigen oordeel zegt dus niks over de prestatie. Dit onderzoek suggereert dat er geen identificatieverschillen bestaan tussen statische en dynamische line-ups.

Apart from interrogations and computer focused investigations, cybercrime, due to its recent growing occurrence, still lacks effective methods to detect those who are behind it. The goal of the present research is to validate a new method: Implicit Memory Method for Criminal Investigation (IMMCI), a psychological test that is designed to elicit true recognition memory from illegally visited internet sites. Our study was set up to answer the following question: to what extent is IMMCI a reliable method for measuring true recognition memory of internet sites that a person is unwilling to reveal? To answer this question we simulated visitors and not-visitors of digital displays: i.e. participants were divided into two conditions, called perpetrators and innocents. The experiment consisted of three sessions. The first two were exposure sessions (pictures of digital displays were presented) while the third one was the test session (recognition memory test and source memory test for the pictures presented at t1 and t2). IMMCI in the lab, showed that people are relatively good at true recognition memory of the displays, but poor at telling the temporal source. Overall participants were good at remembering whether they saw an item (recognition memory) but not so good at remembering when they saw it (source memory). In practice, this combined effect might be used in a memory method that reveals implicit knowledge of items seen in the illegal cyber space.","['recognition memory', 'source memory', 'cybercrime investigation']"

As expected from our hypotheses, we found that both adolescents with a somatically (H1) and mentally (H2) ill family member showed more depressive symptoms than the controls. We also found that adolescents with a mentally ill family member showed more depressive symptoms than adolescents with a somatically ill family member (H3). Further, when taken the mental and somatic group together, girls scored higher on depressive symptoms than boys (H4), and older adolescents scored higher on depressive symptoms than younger adolescents (H5). We found that especially older girls scored higher on depressive symptoms (H6). Furthermore, adolescents from a non-intact family scored higher on depressive symptoms than adolescents from an intact family (H7), and the lower educational levels were associated with more depressive symptoms compared to pre-university education level (H8). Results were significant but yielded a small explained variance.

Emotion processing in social anxiety: an impairment in emotion recognition or in self-evaluation?,"Akdag, Rüya","['Folz, J.', 'Boekel, W.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Socially anxious individuals are known to avoid many forms of social interaction. Since understanding emotions is essential for smooth social interaction, alterations in emotion recognition were previously assumed as one potential reason for this avoidance. Furthermore, this altered emotion recognition might be mediated by altered facial mimicry. However, metacognitive perspectives became more popular in psychopathology and might also be related to confidence in emotions recognition. In this study, we aimed to differentiate between alterations in emotion recognition (behavioral model) and alterations in self-evaluation (metacognitive model) in high socially anxious individuals compared to low socially anxious individuals. Participants completed both a facial mimicry and emotion recognition task with the addition of a confidence rating to measure self-evaluation. We hypothesized that, according to the behavioral model, high socially anxious individuals show altered emotion recognition and facial mimicry performance. In contrast, according to our metacognitive model, there should be no differences in emotion recognition and facial mimicry performance between groups, but high socially anxious individuals should score lower on confidence. The current study found support for the metacognitive model, namely that social anxiety does not seem to affect the ability to recognize and mimic emotions accurately. However, high socially anxious individuals feel less confident about this ability than less socially anxious individuals. Thus, lowered confidence in socially anxious individuals might affect the fear for social situations and therefore play an important role in the avoidance of social interactions.",

This study aimed at closing this gap, by assessing prosocial behavior in psychopathic and antisocial violent offenders as opposed to a non-offender group, after presenting them with positively valenced social situations. This was done by employing an Empathy Dictator Game (EDG), in which 50 participants were asked to distribute coins between themselves and a male or female target, which they previously observed in a neutral, positive, or prosocial situation. Results showed that while psychopathic offenders did not differ significantly in their coin offers from antisocial offenders or the control group, the prosociality of the social situation influenced higher coin allocation. This effect was especially strong for individuals higher in empathetic skills. Lastly, male targets generally received more coins than female targets. This effect further influenced the effect of the diagnosis of participants on prosocial behavior, yet not the effect of the valence of the social situation. Taken together, these results suggest that violent offenders lacking empathy do have the capacity to display prosocial behaviors under the right circumstances and practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.","['Empathy', 'Psychopathy', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Prosocial Behavior']"

Few studies investigated the role of expectations in pain modulation, while there are indications that pain sensitivity can be affected by expectations. The present study examined whether expectations modulated the effect of conditioned pain stimulation. Since earlier research indicated gender differences and physiological stress levels might play a role in CPM as a response to positive or negative information, the present study will take gender differences and objective stress levels (heartrate and skin conductance levels) into account. Healthy participants (57 of each sex) between 18 – 35 years of age were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: 1) participants were told positive expectations, that holding the non-dominant hand in a cold-water bath will decrease the pain intensity of the test stimulus (analgesia group), 2) participants received the information that the conditioned stimuli will increase the pain intensity of the test stimulus (hyperalgesia group), 3) participants received no information about the effect (control condition). Results were analyzed with a mixed ANOVA. The results show that positive or negative expectations modulated the CPM effect compared to the control condition (p = .006). This effect was not dependent on gender. Conditioning stimulation increased skin conductance levels, but not heart rate in the hyperalgesia group. Higher skin conductance levels as a response to negative information were more visible in males compared to females. The present study suggests that inhibitory CPM can be influenced by verbal suggestions, and that a dysfunction of descending inhibitory pathways seems not the only possible cause of a reduced inhibitory CPM. Future research could examine if positive expectations can influence the altered CPM efficacy in patients with chronic pain.","['pain', 'stress', 'gender']"

The data were analyzed relying on Repeated Measures ANOVA and Pearson correlations, using SPSS, and on Bayesfactor analysis, using JASP. The most important positive finding is that there is an interaction effect between the factors of healthiness and cue, indicating that if the food is healthy then cues have a significant positive impact on choice. The degree of self-esteem and the healthiness of food (processed or unprocessed) are unrelated to food choice. The relevance of cues under certain conditions is a factor that health campaigns should take into consideration.",

Despite its popularity to use Virtual Characters (VC) instead of confederates in VR studies, the effect of VCs on humans has not been sufficiently studied yet, especially regarding scratching behaviour. The present explores the effect of the presence or absence of a VC on humans’ scratching behaviour. There are two rationales behind the assumption that VCs affect scratching behaviour. The first is that scratching is shown more frequently under stress, but the presence of VCs can reduce stress. The second one is that participants want to adhere to social norms in front of a VC, which condemn scratching. For the present study, participants (n = 38) were immersed in a virtual environment using a Head-Mounted-Display. They had to describe itch-inducing pictures either while a VC was present or absent. The frequency and duration of the scratching behaviour of participants were recorded. Two two-sided paired t-tests were conducted to compare both scratch frequency and scratch duration in the VC present versus the VC absent condition. The findings show that the participants scratched less often and with a shorter duration when the VC was present compared to when the VC was absent, indicating that the presence of VCs can alter humans’ scratch behaviour. The results of this study can help to establish the use of VCs further and lay the foundation for a more in-depth investigation into scratch behaviour using virtual environments. However, more research is needed to investigate the underlying reasons for the observed behaviour.",

The Effects of Performance (Non)Contingent Reward on Cognitive Control,"Keytel, Brandon","['Prochazkova, L.', 'Sellaro, R.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The prospect of reward has increasingly been shown to influence modes of cognitive control. Recent work by Fröber and Dreisbach (2016) showed that performance contingent reward increases proactive control, while non-contingent reward decreases proactive control and possibly increases reactive control. According to the Metacontrol State Model (Hommel, 2015), the differential effects of reward on cognitive control can be understood as a tradeoff between cognitive persistence and flexibility. Persistence refers to a mode of control that allows for strong maintenance of goal-relevant information and the suppression of irrelevant information, while flexibility refers to a mode of control that facilitates switching between tasks by allowing for more efficient consideration of irrelevant information. While evidence suggests that contingent reward promotes persistence and non-contingent reward decreases persistence, it is not clear whether non-contingent reward promotes flexibility. The aim of the present study was to expand on previous findings by investigating whether contingent reward promotes persistence and whether non-contingent reward promotes flexibility, by employing two cognitive tasks that presumably benefit from either persistence or flexibility, namely the Simon task and the Attentional Blink task. Participants were allocated to three conditions (e.g., contingent, non-contingent, and control) and performed both tasks in a single session. Participant allocation and task completion were counterbalanced. Both performance contingent and non-contingent reward promoted cognitive flexibility in the Simon task, or at least decreased cognitive persistence, but had no effect in the Attentional blink task. While these results support the general finding that reward differentially modulates cognitive control, they further underline the importance of considering the cognitive paradigm used to assess changes in cognitive control.","['performance (non)contingent reward', 'cognitive control', 'metacontrol', 'simon task', 'attentional blink', 'cognitive persistance', 'cognitive flexibility']"

Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric factors related to functional impairment in patients with behavioral variant of Frontotemporal Dementia,"Salech, Gada Musa","['Hiele, K. van der', 'Ruitenberg, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The cognitive and neuropsychiatric deficits present in patients with the behavioral variant of Frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) impacts their functionality in the activities of daily living (ADLs). These activities are divided into advanced, instrumental, and basic domains, which begin to be undermined throughout the dementia progression. The detection of the cognitive and behavioral factors involved in the functional impairment of each ADLs domain is crucial for the implementation of suitable treatments. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with 27 patients with bvFTD in its early stage (< 2 years of evolution) and 32 healthy controls. A neuropsychological assessment was carried out wherein measures of cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and functionality were obtained. The informant- report Technology-Activities of daily living questionnaire was used to assess the percentage of functional impairment on advanced, instrumental, and basic ADLs. Therefore, higher percentages imply worse performance on ADL. To identify the best determinants for each ADLs domain, three separate standard multiple regression analyses were performed, considering each functional impairment as the dependent variable and executive function, social cognition, disinhibition, and apathy as independent variables. Results: For the basic ADLs, a model that explains 28.2% of the variability was found, in which apathy (β = 0.33, p = .02) and disinhibition (β = 0.29, p = .04) were significant predictors of functional impairment. Concerning instrumental ADLs, the model produced accounted for 58.8% of the functional variability, with apathy (β = 0.70, p < .001) and executive function (β = -0.30, p = .04) as the main contributors. Finally, in terms of advanced ADLs, the model found explains 52.9% of variance, wherein only apathy was a significant predictor (β = 0.69, p < .001). Furthermore, social cognition deficits did not show an influence on functional performance Conclusion: The results of this study show the strong influence of neuropsychiatric features such as apathy and disinhibition with the functional impairment of patients with bvFTD in its early stage. Apathy is the primary determinant of functioning for all the ADLs domains. These results could guide the planning of tailored interventions and quality of life improvement.","['frontotemporal dementia', 'functionality', 'activities of daily living', 'apathy']"

One way in which anxiety is transmitted from parents to children is through parental verbal information, which induces attentional biases towards threat-associated animals over safety-associated animals. However, this effect has only been researched with unknown animals as the subject of information. Therefore the current study aimed to investigate the effect of parental verbal information on children’s attentional bias in a social situation, using human strangers as the subject of information. Additionally, the moderating role of child social anxiety was explored. For this study, children (aged 4-6, N=52) visited the lab with their primary caregiver. The caregivers then transferred messages to their children about two strangers: one paired with positive information, one with negative information. After the children completed a social performance task with the strangers posing as judges, the children completed a visual search task with pictures of the strangers to measure children’s attentional bias towards the strangers. Also, child social anxiety was measured by parental report on a questionnaire. A repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant effect of parental verbal information on child attentional bias. Child social anxiety also did not affect this relationship. The absence of a significant effect of verbal information on attentional bias can be explained by the non-aversive experience children had with the strangers. If this possible extinction effect is found in future studies as well, it may have implications for the extended use of exposure therapy in the treatment of child social anxiety.","['social anxiety', 'verbal comments', 'attentional bias', 'children', 'parents']"
Enhancing extinction of fear using transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation: the role of anxiety,"Priem, Nienke","['Verkuil, B.', 'Kleine, R. de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"BACKGROUND: Exposure therapy, which is based on extinction learning, is the therapy of choice for several anxiety disorders. However, the remission rate is not optimal for adults with an anxiety disorder, which could be due to non-response or to the return of the original fear after exposure therapy. Persons with high levels of anxiety have more difficulties constructing and consolidating extinction memories. Stimulating the vagus nerve (tVNS) is a promising method of enhancing the process of extinction learning as shown in previous animal and human studies. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess whether participants with high levels of anxiety would benefit more from the addition of tVNS measured in US expectancy ratings and skin conductance response. METHOD: This paper is a reanalysis of the data from the study of Burger et al. (2018). In this study healthy humans participated in a prepared fear learning paradigm, spider pictures were used as conditioned stimulus. After the acquisition phase participants were randomly allocated to the tVNS condition (N=42) and to the sham condition (N=43) for the extinction phase. High- and low-scoring groups were created based on the state and trait subscales of the STAI. RESULTS: There were no differences found between the high- and low-scoring groups in the effectiveness of tVNS, although the low state group in the tVNS condition showed lower US expectancy ratings for the CS- trials. CONCLUSION: This distinct study does not provide conclusive evidence to support the direction of studying tVNS in a clinical sample.","['Fear acquisition', 'extinction learning', 'exposure', 'tVNS', 'STAI', 'state anxiety', 'trait anxiety']"

This study aims to uncover whether cultural differences between Eastern and Western countries affect the citizens’ attitudes towards robots. It does so by employing the Negative Attitude Towards Robots Scale (NARS) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure the explicit and implicit attitudes of a Japanese and a Dutch sample. On explicit measures, Dutch participants report significantly more negative attitudes towards robots when compared to Japanese participants. This difference might be explained due to variations in culture and the experienced level of exposure towards robots. On implicit measures, both groups report no significantly different attitudes. These similarities in implicit attitudes might be explained due to the Japanese participants’ worries about the influences robots have on society, negating the positive effects of culture and exposure. Our results are limited by a significant age difference between the Japanese and Dutch group.",

Japanese advanced robotic technology (Šabanović, 2014) serves as a prime example of possible variance in attitudes between Eastern and Western countries. The present study explored the influence of cultural backgrounds on implicit and explicit attitudes towards robots as well as the effect of human-likeness on the positivity of attitudes. Native Dutch and Japanese (n=80) participants were recruited at Leiden University and using the recruitment platform CrowdWorks in Japan. We hypothesized that both cultures would show a stronger implicit preference for humans over robots and more positive implicit evaluations of humanoid compared to mechanical robots. Furthermore, we assumed to replicate a previous study (MacDorman et al., 2009) concluding that, against common belief, Japanese participants would show no significant difference in robot acceptance compared to Western participants. The present quantitative study contains the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Negative Attitudes Towards Robots Scale (NARS). Our results show no significant cultural differences in the observed preference of humans over robots. Humanoids are preferred over mechanical robots while there are no differences in implicit robot evaluations between cultures. Japanese participants scored significantly lower on average on the NARS, showing more positive explicit attitudes towards robots. The validity of the interpretation of the results is lowered due to an unbalanced sample in age, gender and occupational level.","['cultural differences', 'robot appearance', 'robot acceptance', 'NARS', 'IAT', 'anthropomorphism', 'human-avatar interaction', 'human-robot interaction']"

Attention bias to threat in infants and parents: child temperament as moderator,"Leur, Dana van","['Nimphy, C.', 'Tollenaar, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Little is known regarding the specific mechanismsthat underlie the parent-to-child transmission of anxiety. A possible mechanism is the shared attention biases to threat. Also, there is little evidence regarding individual differences, such as negative temperament, in the earliest development of attention bias to threat. Fearful/ negative temperament can act as a risk factor for developing anxiety disorders later in life. This study investigated the relationship between parents’ and infants’ attention bias, and if negative child temperament strengthened this relationship. Attention bias was measured to fearful faces in infants (N = 220) ages 5 to 19 months and parents (N = 229) during an eye-tracking task. Infants’ negative temperament was measured with a questionnaire. Results show that infants looked longer towards fearful faces than happy faces. Parents did not pay this attention bias towards fearful faces. We found no relation between parents’ attention bias towards fearful faces and infants’ attention bias towards fearful faces. We did find an interaction between the attention biases and negative child temperament. In other words, the higher the infants’ negative temperament, the stronger the relationship between parents’ attention bias towards threatening faces and infants’ attention bias towards threatening faces. These findings support the idea that negative temperament is related to attention bias and that it could be a risk factor for future anxiety development.","['Attention bias', 'negative temperament', 'infancy', 'parents', 'anxiety']"

Current study is part of the SCORE research and aims to give insight in the relationship between challenging behaviour, restrictions of freedom and quality of life. After checking assumptions, a total of 75 participants have been included all of whom are residents of and receive care at a facility of Ipse de Bruggen. The Developmental Behavior ChecklistAdults (DBC-A) and San Martin Scale (SMS) are used as well as data on restrictions of freedom obtained from the client files. A multiple regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between challenging behaviour and quality of life and to investigate the possible mediation by restrictions of freedom. Results show that an increase in challenging behaviour predicts a lower rated quality of life. Results also show this relationship is most significant for ‘selfabsorbed’ and ‘socialrelating’ challenging behaviour. No evidence was found to support restrictions of freedom as a mediator. However an increase in restrictions of freedom has been found to predict a lower rated quality of life. This relationship is most significant for physical restrictions. This means two separate relationships with quality of life have been found. The biggest limitations of current study are a non-generalisable sample and the use of quantitative data for restrictions of freedom.

Electrocortical and behavioral responses during probabilistic learning through social feedback in relation to depression and social anxiety in young adults,"Topel, Selin","['Molen, M. van der', 'Kortink, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Depression and social anxiety are among the most prevalent and co-occurring mental-health problems related to difficulties in social decision-making and aberrant responses to social reward and punishment. Processing social feedback and integrating information from negative and positive outcomes are important for adapting behaviors and cognitions accordingly. Thus, in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying affective problems such as depression and social anxiety, it is crucial to investigate how they relate to differences in social feedback processing and learning through social evaluative feedback. This study aimed to investigate whether depressive and social anxiety symptoms in healthy young adults were differentially associated with how individuals learned through positive and negative peer feedback and electrocortical responses to social feedback which would help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the aforementioned affective problems. Nineteen participants (18-25 years old) took part in a novel social probabilistic learning task while concurrent EEG was being recorded. In this task, participants believed that they received acceptance and rejection feedback from actual peers. In reality, each of the four peers provided computerized feedback with assigned probabilities of 85%, 70%, 30%, and 15% acceptance. The participants showed positive expectancy and positive memory biases. Social anxiety symptoms predicted a lower positive memory bias. The participants learned the probabilities in the expected direction for each peer through trial-and-error over the course of the task. No differences in learning were observed in relation to depression and social anxiety. As expected, the time-frequency theta (4- 7 Hz) power was larger following unexpected rejection, particularly, in comparison to expected acceptance. However, delta power (1-4 Hz) was largest for both expected acceptance and unexpected rejection. There were no interactions between time-frequency responses and individual differences in depression and social anxiety. Our findings demonstrate that healthy young adults show positive expectancy and memory biases for social evaluative situations with peers which can be reduced by the level of social anxiety one experiences. These could be informative for professionals practicing in mental health such that they can target the way socially anxious individuals recall events in treatment. This study also shows that individuals use positive and negative social evaluative feedback to adapt their feedback expectations from others.","['depression', 'EEG', 'probabilistic feedback learning', 'social anxiety', 'social evaluation']"

Blush Mimicry and its Effect on Trust: How Blush Mimicry Influences Investment in a Virtual Character,"Penningh, Paulina","['Fasya, E.', 'Kret, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Mimicry has been researched regarding how it relates to the emotional contagion and therefore how it leads to feelings of empathy in others. Autonomic mimicry leads to synchronized physiological processes between two individuals, supposedly to create a feeling of connectedness and trust. Blush is a rarely investigated part of autonomic mimicry, a kind of physiological mimicry in humans that is not consciously controlled. Blushing has been associated with trustworthiness, a fundamental component to establish empathy. Previous research has shown that individuals who blush are perceived as more trustworthy and following the research on the emotional contagion, blush mimicry should have a similar effect. This study investigated whether individuals mimic a blushing Virtual Character (VC) and whether mimicking blushing establishes feelings of trust for a VC. Trustworthiness is investigated using a trust game, blushing is measured with skin temperature. T-tests were used to investigated whether individuals mimic blushing expressions of the VC, which resulted in inconclusive findings. Linear regression analyses were used to predict trustworthiness from participants’ blush. Blushing mimicry did not increase investment in the trust game. This result indicates that the mimicry itself might not be the basis of feelings of trust in others, despite previous findings. Perceiving and mimicking blushing might provoke different reactions from different individuals. Additionally, blush is triggered by emotions like embarrassment and guilt in social situations, which could be distorted by using VCs. Limitations include the lacking social context with the VC, the neutral content of the stories, and the sample size. Future research should investigate responses of individuals to VCs and control for external factors of facial redness.","['virtual characters', 'blush mimicry', 'blushing', 'trust', 'trust game']"

Eye contact and mutual eye gaze are important to infer other’s emotions and to share experiences. In particular, pupillary changes, dilation and constriction, provide implicit cues to infer internal states of an interacting partner: when one experiences pleasant feelings, pupils dilate. Individuals with larger pupils are evaluated as more friendly, attractive, and trustworthy than those with smaller pupils. During human interactions changes in pupil diameter synchronize, a phenomenon called pupil mimicry. In particular, dilation mimicry correlates with increased perceived trustworthiness. Aim of the hereby research is to further investigate the relationship between pupil mimicry and trust. To do so, we conducted an experiment in which participants listened to a series of virtual characters narrating neutral stories while changes in there pupil diameter were recorded via an eye-tracker, allowing us to assess the presence of pupil mimicry by participants. A questionnaire after each interaction, in addition to an investment game were exploited to measure level of trust. A simple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate whether pupil mimicry is a predictor for trust, selecting cases by neutral stories. Despite our predictions -based on previous studies-, results proved our hypothesis wrong showing non-significant results for three neutral stories. Results were significant concerning two stories but showing the opposite trend than the expected one. Within the discussion session, limitations of the study which might explain such results will be exposed.","['pupil mimicry', 'pupil dilation', 'trust', 'virtual characters']"

The Impact of Child Maltreatment on Empathy in Later Life,"Schubert, Michael","['Tollenaar, M.S.', 'Mouthaan, J.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"BACKGROUND: Child maltreatment is a global health problem affecting children across the globe, that can result in serious impairments in later life, taking the form of serious psychological disorders or impoverished social skills. Empathy belongs to one of these fundamental skills. The current study aims to replicate previous findings that childhood maltreatment history is associated with lower empathy levels. Generally, research distinguishes between affective and cognitive empathy. Hence, this study explores possible differences in impact of child maltreatment history on cognitive versus affective empathy. METHOD: This cross-sectional design involved 218 healthy participants between 18 and 79 years of age. To assess child maltreatment, the Dutch version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was used. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) were used to assess both cognitive and affective empathy. The sample was divided into maltreated and non-maltreated participants, by applying cut-off scores, and where compared with multivariate ANOVAs on MET mean arousal level, MET total accuracy, perspective taking (PT), empathic concern (EC), fantasy (FS) and personal distress (PD). RESULTS: The present study failed to replicate previous findings of associations between child maltreatment and lowered empathy. Furthermore, a difference in impact on the two forms of empathy was not identified. However, after the exclusion of outliers, an indication was found for impaired cognitive empathy in individuals with maltreatment history. DISCUSSION: The present study shows that possible selective effects of child maltreatment on either cognitive or affective empathy may exist. Knowing how maltreatment differentially affects individuals in later adulthood, can help to optimize both prevention measures as well as treatments dealing with the consequence of child maltreatment, e.g. individual training focusing on either type of empathy. Limitations of the present study are discussed.","['child maltreatment', 'cognitive empathy', 'affective empathy', 'abuse', 'neglect']"

All participants listened to ten virtual characters telling them neutral stories. During these stories the avatars displayed nodding and smiling behaviors and the participants were observed by the use of a webcam to see whether they mimicked the virtual characters and to see how often they displayed nodding and smiling behaviors spontaneously. As predicted, LAs showed significantly more smiling spontaneously than HAs. Thought not at significant levels, LAs also showed more smile mimicking than HAs. However, there were no significant results for the nodding behavior of the participants. These results indicate a need for further research into whether people with high social anxiety display motor behaviors less and whether this affects their mimicry behavior.",

Eyes don’t lie – Does social anxiety influence pupil dilation mimicry?,"Dietz, Lasse","['Fasya, E.L.', 'Kret, M.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Mimicry of behavior is a well-known phenomenon, thought to be important for social interaction. Some studies suggest that socially anxious individuals differ from the normal population in their mimicking behavior. This difference might be a sign of a mechanism involved in social anxiety. Previous research suggests a difference between autonomic and motor mimicry. Autonomic mimicry is related to the autonomic nervous system which is largely free of conscious influence, while motor mimicry is related to the motor areas and the mirror neuron system. In this paper the focus therefore lies on autonomic pupil dilation mimicry, ruling out conscious influence on mimicry behavior. This study aims to replicate previous findings that found a difference for socially anxious peoples mimicking behavior. The direction of the difference in mimicking behavior will be addressed in the exploratory part of this study in the case of significant results. Performed was a simple regression analysis between the independent anxiety score variable obtained using the LSAS-SR and the dependent mimicry score. The results were ambiguous to a certain extent. The first analysis, including a wider range of data, was significant. It suggests an influence of social anxiety on pupil dilation mimicry, with a higher anxiety score leading to decrease in mimicry, suggesting a possible mechanism related to mimicry differences in social anxiety. However the effect size was not very high. Subsequent analysis excluding very noisy data and cases with low signal coverage led to insignificant results, suggesting normal perception and response to pupil dilation mimicry for people with social anxiety.","['pupil dilation', 'emotional contagion', 'motor mimicry', 'autonomic mimicry', 'social anxiety']"
The Relationship Between Theta/Beta Ratio and Mind Wandering,"Ehmann, Isabell Sophia","['Putman, P.', 'Beurs, Edwin de']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The study examines the relationship between theta/beta ratio (TBR) and mind wandering (MW), an important aspect in the domain of attentional control. Contemporary research suggests that high TBR (the ratio of power in the theta band to power in the beta band) can be used as an indicator of attentional lapses, i.e. MW. To investigate this notion, an experimental study was conducted. 79 participants completed a sustained attention task while brain activity was measured using electroencephalography. Additionally, it was examined whether TBR is associated with impeded resilience to emotional interference during a working memory task. Moreover, the role of fatigue as a secondary factor was investigated as it potentially further deteriorates MW. No significant relationship between TBR and MW or WM could be found. Further, TBR was not associated with working memory performance. Finally, fatigue was not correlated to MW occurrence. In conclusion, the relationship between TBR and MW could not be confirmed. However, this study is a step towards studying internal experiences without reliance on introspection.","['mind wandering', 'theta/beta ratio', 'attentional control', 'working memory']"

With global shifts in priorities and the sudden momentum associated the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted this research, the opportunity to redesign an economic system that reflects the values of our community is significant. This paper explores the values of residents in Pernis, workers from the Port of Rotterdam and residents in Parramatta, inviting them to explore their own values and co-create a vision of the future. It uses a Futures Anthropology and Design Anthropology approach, incorporating a workshop to push the methodological boundaries of the discipline. This process revealed core values that align with the Sustainable Development Goals, which form the social floor of the Doughnut Economics model. This model is evaluated with respect to the visions of interlocutors and processes for better community engagement and co-creation are explored, with the suggestion that future anthropological research focuses on citizen’s assemblies as an improved method of participation. This paper finds that co-creative approaches are hindered by political, economic, green, built, technological and global infrastructures, but that they can also be facilitated by them. Through a cocreative approach, the ‘who’ of community can become transparent and resentment and scepticism towards government could be addressed. It is argued that if we are to develop regenerative communities there is much work to be done, but the key to this lies in co-creative, future focused research and engagement, with attention paid to the infrastructures that shape our communities in time and space.",

Individualising Inclusion: an ethnographic exploration into studying with dyslexia at Leiden University (Institute for Advanced Computer Science),"Murray, Sarah","['Boy, J.', 'Plájás, I.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Using the Disabilities studies and Anthropological method of entangled ethnography, this research found thatsome disability experts and parts of Leiden University aim for more explicit, systemic framing towards seeing studying with disabilities and dyslexia though the social model of disabilities. However, Leiden University has predominantly used an individualistic framework in keeping with the medical model of disabilities. Any changes or aims for the university usually occur also within the individualistic framework. Further, a possible culture of constructivism at LIACS aligns to the individualistic framing of LU to further put the blame and burden of studying with dyslexia onto the individuals with it. Although studying with a disability like dyslexia at LU isa centralised system and has many great experts working on it, there is an absence of knowledge on and education about studying with a disability and dyslexia in staff and students. This might have led to dyslexia primarily being dealt with using extra-time adjustments. A strategy of avoidance is highlighted as a way some students at LIACS deal with the barriers of studying with dyslexia. Overwhelmingly, even if some parts of LU wish for change towards the social model or beyond model of disability, LU currently operates with a medical model of disability in practice. Until active steps are taken to move past the medical model of disability at the university, it will be difficult to see what advantages might lie beyond.","['dyslexia', 'disabilities', 'studying', 'Leiden University', 'inclusion', 'individualising']"

Kijkend naar stereotypes hebben mannen een voordeel met onderhandelingen ten opzichte van vrouwen. Eigenschappen die nodig zijn voor een goede onderhandeling - die we tevens eerder toeschrijven aan mannen dan aan vrouwen - zijn dominantie en assertiviteit. De verwachting was dat vrouwen die macht toegewezen kregen hogere individuele uitkomsten hebben dan vrouwen die geen macht toegewezen kregen. Bovendien zouden groepen met mannen in de meerderheid lagere gezamenlijke groepsuitkomsten hebben, omdat mannen competitiever zijn. Vrouwen zijn juist coöperatief en groepen met vrouwen in de meerderheid zullen daarom hogere groepsuitkomsten behalen. Deze voorspellingen zijn onderzocht met een rollenspel experiment voor driepersoons onderhandelingen genaamd “Aloha Beach Club”, deze onderhandelingstaak werd uitgevoerd via videobellen. De resultaten vertellen ons dat er geen verschil tussen de geslachten is betreffende de groepsuitkomsten. Wel is het zo dat vrouwen zonder toegewezen macht lagere individuele uitkomsten halen dan mannen, maar zodra ze wel macht krijgen doen ze niet meer onder voor mannen. Een verklaring voor dit resultaat kan zijn dat door het videobellen de verschillen tussen de geslachten minder aanwezig en herkenbaar waren, waardoor er niet naar stereotypes gehandeld werd. What is the influence of power on the genders in three-person group negotiations? Looking at the stereotypes, men tend to have an advantage of women. Qualities that are needed for negotiations – that we assign to men more often than to women – are dominance and assertiveness. The expectation was that women that got assigned to a position where they are powerful, would get higher individual outcomes in negotiations than women who did not get assign to a position of power. Also, groups with a majority of men would get lower group outcomes than groups with a majority of women, because men are more competitive. Women are cooperative, and groups with a majority of women will get higher group outcomes. The expectations were tested in the three-person groups negotiation task “Aloha Beach Club”, the negotiation task was done by video calling. The results show that there is no difference between the genders in joint group outcomes. But they did show that women without any power get lower individual scores than men, but as soon as they are assigned to a position of power, they don’t get any fewer individual points than men. An explanation for this result could be that because of the video calling, the differences in gender were less present and recognizable, causing that stereotypes were not acted upon.",

During reading it is important that a child not only listens, but also actively focuses their attention to the tekst in the picture book. Various studies have shown that children who are being read to do not pay much attention to the written text in picture books. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of repeated reading, using highlighted text and using print-salient text to examine the attention on written text in picture books, by following the eye movements of 126 children in kindergarten using a Eye Tracker. The study is an experimental study with pre- and post-measurements and random assignment of the children to one of the six conditions. For all children, repeated reading and highlighting the text was observed to increase the amount of time the children looked at the written text in a picture book, than when there was no intervention. For adjusting the characteristics of the written text no positive effect was found. Future researcher is required to examine the effects of attentionorienting strategies on reading related outcomes. What also remains unclear is the specific outcome of this additional attention to the written text in picture books. It is unknown if these strategies lead to benefits or detrimental effects on other reading related components.",
Mogelijke risico- en beschermende factoren voor gedragsproblematiek bij internationaal geadopteerde kinderen,"Ramesar, Manisha","['Veen, R. van der', 'Voort, A. van der', 'Smeets, D.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Research has shown that internationally adopted children have more behavioural problems during their primary school period than their classmates. This study helps to gain insight into the effects of a risk factor (stressful events) and a protective factor (socioeconomic status) on behavioural problems of adopted children. More specifically, the central question addressed in this study was: what are the effects of recent stressful events (0-2 years ago) and SES on behavioural problems of internationally adopted children at the age of both 7 and 14 years? The dataset used in this study (N = 74) is part of the Leiden Longitudinal Adoption Study. The children (26 boys and 48 girls) have been adopted at a very young age (M = 10.19 weeks) from Sri Lanka, South-Korea and Colombia. Using the Teacher Report Form (TRF), behavioural problems of the children at the age of 7 and 14 were measured. During these measurements stressful situations and SES were established. ANOVA’s were performed to determine the effects of these factors on behavioural problems. The results show that based on the data used in this study, there are no effects of stressful events and SES on behavioural problems of internationally adopted children. Stressful events is not a risk factor for adopted children having more behavioural problems. Socioeconomic status is not a protective factor for adopted children having less behavioural problems. This may be explained by the specific sample and the SES of the families (mostly middle class). Further research with a more varied research group and other research methods is recommended.","['internationally adopted children', 'behaviour problems', 'risk factors', 'protective factors', 'Leiden Longitudinal Adoption Study']"

During each measurement, the confederate has performed one of the following behaviours: yawning, scratching, lip biting or face touching. The conditions were as follows: Pre-recorded (recorded video stimuli), Live Stream (live video stimuli) and Live Interaction (live stimuli). The analysis demonstrated that gender has no significant effect on the prevalence of all mimicry types. Social distance has been noted to have some arguable effects.

It is therefore important to understand the factors that influence food intake of young children to prevent obesity at a young age. In this research we have looked at one factor that might influence childs food intake: the responsive reaction to stop feeding when the child feels full (after the first few times of eating solid food, between 4 to 6 months old) and its relationship with the childs BMI (at the age of two). It is hypothesised that if the mother is less responsive towards the cues of satiety of the child, the childs own satiety recognition will develop poorly, leading the child to over-eat and therefore increasing the risk of a high BMI. We compare observed responsive reactions (Responsiveness to feeding cues scale, Hodges et al., 2013) with self-reported reactions (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire, Birch et al., 2001) to explain why researchers in earlier studies failed to find a clear relationship between responsive reactions and the BMI. Other factors that influence BMI, namely the temperament of the child and the education level of the mother, are taken into account. No relationships were found between the two types of measuring instruments of responsiveness, between the responsiveness and the BMI of the child and between the satiety recognition of the child and the BMI of the child, but there is a relationship between temperament of the child and the BMI of the child. Further research is necessary to understand how responsiveness relates to obesity in combination with other obesity risk factors and protective factors.","['responsivity to satiety cues', 'mother-child interaction', 'satiety recognition', 'BMI', 'obesity prevention']"

Twenty participants counted the eye blinks of a confederate in three social distance conditions, namely while watching a pre-recorded video, while having a live interaction, and through a live stream. During these conditions, the confederate performed the four mimicry behaviours. The participants also played investment games to measure trust and they filled in the Interpersonal Reactivity Index to measure empathy. This study did not find a significant relation between mimicry and empathy, nor between mimicry and gender. A negative relation was found between trust and mimicry, with lower levels of trust leading to more mimicry. A significant difference between yawning and face touching was also found, with face touching leading to higher levels of mimicry. However, the social distance condition that one was in did not influence the amount of mimicry. Adding empathy as a covariate also did not influence the results. Future research is needed to examine other factors that could influence the relationship between social distance and mimicry. For instance, it is possible that how comfortable one feels moderates this relationship or that people suppress behaviours to be polite.","['mimicry', 'contagious scratching', 'contagious yawning', 'contagious lip biting', 'contagious face touching', 'trust', 'empathy', 'social distance']"
The Effects of Spatial Social Distance and its Implications for our growing Digital World,"Roeder, Julian Simon","['Kim, Y.', 'Diana, F.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"As previous research has shown that various influences exist between social distance (""SD""), mimicry and social anxiety, this thesis examines the relationship between spatial social distance (""spatial SD""), mimicry, and social anxiety under the hypothesis that different levels of spatial social distance influence mimicry and decision making - and that this influence is altered by emotions and cognitions. This was done using an experiment with varying variables such as spatial social distance, amount of recorded mimicry and various social anxiety scores. The results of the experiment showed that the influence of spatial social distance has the same direction as the influence of social distance on mimicry. Further, the experiment documented that emotional states have a significant influence on the amount of recorded mimicry, as well as a more limited influence on the correlation between spatial social distance and the amount of recorded mimicry. However, differing from previous research related to spatial distance and mimicry, the experiment showed, that trait anxiety neither had a significant influence on the amount of recorded mimicry nor on the correlation between spatial SD and the amount of recorded mimicry. This result may guide further research for the benefit of both, online mental health, and marketing, by introducing a spatial dimension to customer and patient communication related research.",
A Common Metric for Depression Test Scores: Normalised T-scores,"Maria, Laurentia","['Beurs, E. de', 'Fried, E.']",2020,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Translating scores to a common metric provides advantages that support the applied collaborative care model in the Netherlands. McCall's T-score is frequently used, and the optimal approach to obtain this score is through Item Response Theory (IRT). However, IRT is complicated, requires dedicated software, and a large dataset. This study aimed to validate an alternative procedure to obtain T-scores from IRT. Methods: This study used data from an existing study, which comprised a population-based sample and a patient sample. We estimated the relation between raw scores and IRT-based T-scores with curve fitting and established conversion formulas to transform raw scores into calculated T-scores. We illustrated the process with raw scores from the Beck Depression Inventory, the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Rated, and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. We performed a correlational analysis to assess the validity of the calculated T-scores. We also determined cut-off values using ROC analysis. Results: The curve-fitting procedure resulted in third-order polynomial regression equations to use as conversion formulas. The validity of calculated T-scores was supported by their high correlation with theta-based T-scores. ROC analysis provided cut-off values, which were comparable to the previous studies, using raw scale scores. Conclusion: The curve-fitting procedure yielded sufficiently valid calculated T-scores for all instruments in comparison to the theta-based T-scores from IRT. The resulting cut-off values demonstrated that calculated T-scores were able to distinguish patients from the general population. The practical use of the results is discussed.",

Apart from this ar9cle, the study and its findings are presented in the ethnographic film Hé Meisje (‘What’s Up, Girl’). Findings reveal that women, in an effort to avoid uncomfortable situa9ons and as an answer to their fear of geKng physically harassed, o1en make evalua9ons on where to go or how to behave in public. This shows how they have incorporated the poten9ality of harassment into their daily lives.
