Changing the Hegemonic Discourse: the War on Terror from Bush to Obama,"Beekmans, Anne","['Gageldonk, Maarten van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The War on Terror was initiated by President George W. Bush as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The War on Terror was not just a concept, it was a range of strategies, ideologies and expectations to justify the American response to the attacks and an expression around which the American public could rally. It shaped the nature and the scope of the American counterterrorism strategy to the terrorist attacks, into a specific form of conflict. This thesis demonstrates what the two different counterterrorism strategies entailed, and the different interpretations President Bush and President Obama gave to the War on Terror. Bush approached the attacks as an ‘act of war’, and rationalized the event through the Just War theory. Whereas Obama framed the conflict as a ‘crime’, of which the perpetrators should be brought to justice, in order to end the conflict as quickly as possible. During his campaign, Obama gave the impression of a foreign policy strategy that radically moved away from Bush. However, Bush had embedded a strong hegemonic discourse regarding the War on Terror in society. This social structure was complex to change, since it was entrenched in rhetoric, media and real-life institutions. Thus, Obama faced great difficulty during his first term, in order to change this hegemonic discourse, and was severely limited in executing his intended foreign policy regarding the Middle East.","['War on Terror', 'hegemonic discourse', 'Obama', 'Bush', 'media', 'Middle East']"

Beperkingen op code-switching Nederlands-Spaans: de woordvolgorde in de naamwoordgroep,"Cruz Rico, Hector","['González González, Paz']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Dutch Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In verschillen gemeenschappen wordt er meer dan één taal tijdens dezelfde conversatie gesproken. Dit kan een manier of een stijl van spreken zijn waarin tweetaligen tussen twee of meer talen zich bewegen (Jeff MacSwan, 2000). Dit fenomeen wordt Code-switching genoemd. Dit fenomeen is sinds de jaren 50 veel bestudeerd (Walters, 2005) en er zijn taalkundigen die code-switching als een originele manier van taalgebruik zien en als een ontwikkeling van taalkennis bij tweetalige sprekers (Klimpfinger, 2007). Toch kan dit fenomeen alleen maar op basis van bepaalde morfosyntactische regels uitgevoerd worden (Poplack, 1980; Myers-Scotton, 1993; MacSwan, 1999; MacSwan 2000). In deze literatuurstudie kijk ik naar twee recente en controversiële visies op beperkingen op code-switching. De eerste visie die besproken wordt is het Matrix Language-Frame model voor code-switching (Carol Myers-Scotton, 1993). De tweede visie die ik over beperkingen op code-switching weergeef, is het Minimalist Program model (MacSwan, 1999). Het doel van deze literatuurscriptie is te bekijken welk van de bovenstaande modellen de beperkingen van de plaatsing van het bijvoeglijk naamwoord binnen de naamwoordgroep in code-switching Nederlands-Spaans kan verklaren.",['Codeswitching Nederlands Spaans']
Beatrix Potter’s Animal Characters: Resembling or Critiquing The 1900s Notion of the Child?,"Houdijk, Renate","['Newton, M.S.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Animals that dress up like children, but lose their clothes when they are in danger: how far does the anthropomorphism go in Beatrix Potter’s stories? Potter made her animal characters to resemble children, but she deliberately let them keep many of their natural animal instincts, too. These wild, animalistic characteristics are also seen in the pictures, which are naturalistic and scrupulously accurate. Because of the obvious presence of nature in the stories, it is hard to pin down the line between the human and the animal. But the animals in Potter’s stories were never meant to fully substitute for humans as in the traditional fable. They have kept their natural instincts and basic habits, and behave only like humans until they have to face a danger that is natural for animals of their kind, for example predators. The moment their instinct takes over, they tend to lose their clothing, and they start walking on four legs again. The role of mothers seems to be the key to anthropomorphism. They provide the link between the animal world and the human world, as in both they are wearing clothes (presumably), and are trying to teach their children good behaviour, according to the social class they are in. The clothing that Potter’s characters are made to wear by their mothers are mainly for them to look socially acceptable, which suggests middle or upper class, as in the lower classes the clothing was of smaller importance.The anthropomorphism is projected onto the child animals by their mothers, who seem determined to raise them correctly, exactly as human mothers in their time and class would have done. Thus we come back to Cunningham, with his suggestion that in order to understand the child, we should focus on the cultural construction of ideas concerning childhood, which in this case means the social class system of the 1900s.","['Anthropomorphism', 'Beatrix Potter', ""Children's Literature""]"

Grendles Mōdor: From Monster to Human,"Witkam, Jolene Priscilla","['Porck, M.H.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Despite the lack of a physical description on the poet’s part, Grendel’s mother is more often than not depicted as a monstrosity. Yet her monstrous nature is the topic of much scholarly debate (e.g., Carlson 1967; Kiernan 1984). Generally, scholars group the mother together with her son Grendel and the dragon, and paint her as a monstrous being consumed by evil intent. However, this traditional view has recently been called into question. Hennequin (2008), for instance, reads Grendel’s mother as a human female fighter, disregarding the ‘monster tradition’ of earlier scholars. The aim of the current study is to look closely at arguments both for and against the humanity of Grendel’s mother, before presenting its own critical view on this subject to strengthen the case that she should not be read as a monster but, indeed, as a human. Analysing the poem through a psychoanalytical lens and using Freud’s theory of the id, the ego and the superego shows that the text of Beowulf constructs the female antagonist as a human rather than a monster. Debating this ‘monster tradition’ and accepting Grendel’s mother as human will pave the way for new explorations of Beowulf and its characters, medieval conventions of ‘otherness’ and femininity.","['Beowulf', ""Grendel's mother"", 'Old English', 'Psychoanalysis', 'Monster studies', 'Id', 'ego', 'superego', 'Old English Literature']"

Lost in Translation: Translating Regional and Social Dialects in Popular Literature,"Noordermeer, Jessica","['Zeven, Katinka']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Translating a novel that contains one or more regional or social dialects can be a daunting task for a literary translator. It is therefore surprising that little research has been done by well-known translation theorists on the translation of dialects. One of the few scholars who has written about this subject is Peter Newmark in his A Textbook of Translation. He urges translators faced with this challenge to produce ‘… possibly classless speech’ and to leave out most of the dialect words (p. 195). This strategy of normalization is also suggested by Andrew Chesterman, where he names dialect normalization as one of his potential S-universals, which is a term used to ‘formulate a generalization about a difference between translations and source texts’ (Chesterman, p. 40). Although numerous scholars have written on the strategy of normalization in general (See e.g. Baker 1996; Kenny 1998; Mauranen 2007; Xia 2014), almost none have linked this procedure specifically to translating dialect. In fact, no clear strategy or procedure has emerged that could help translators overcome this challenge of translating dialectal elements in the source text. Therefore, this thesis will examine the question to what extent literary translators faced with regional and/or social dialects apply the strategy of normalization on several linguistic levels (syntax, lexical items, morphology, and orthography) in their translations. In order to examine this question, source text excerpts and their corresponding target text excerpts from two novels that contain a specific dialect were compared, namely Trainspotting and The Help. While Trainspotting is almost exclusively written in Scottish English, The Help contains examples of the African American Vernacular English dialect (AAVE) of some of the characters. These excerpts were compared with each other, focusing not on the entire text as a whole, but on specific linguistic levels within the text: syntax, lexical items, morphology, and orthography. This enabled me to examine to what extent (on which levels) the strategy of normalization was applied. Throughout my research, I will approach the notion of normalization as being ‘the tendency to conform to patterns and practices which are typical of the target language, even to the point of exaggerating them’ (Baker, pp. 176-177). I will therefore focus on those dialectal source text features that have been completely standardized to the norms of the target language in the translations of Trainspotting and The Help. The results seem to confirm that dialect normalization is an universal strategy used by literary translators to overcome the difficulty of translating specific dialectal elements in the source text. Normalization also seems to be used on all linguistic levels. However, the results show that dialect normalization is not exclusively used in these situations. Other procedures such as modulation and omission are also used to translate dialect speech, although most of these procedures work together with the strategy of normalization to standardize the Dutch target text. Furthermore, an important factor seems to be the original approach of the source text author in representing the original dialect in his or her novel. Irvine Welsh focused on the orthography in Trainspotting, resulting in a higher degree of dialect normalization on the orthographical level in the target text. Kathryn Stockett took a syntactical approach on dialect representation in her novel, The Help, resulting in a higher degree of dialect normalization on the syntax of the translation. Very few examples can be found in both novels where the author had used either an existing Dutch dialect, or had used irregular or marked language to create a similar dialect (or an effect of such) in the target text.","['Translation', 'Linguistics', 'Dialect']"

On a Journey to Metaphor in Song Translation: A Descriptive Study of Metaphors in Musical Song Translation,"Barnier, Manon","['Dorst, A.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Song translation is a relatively under-researched field in Translation Studies (Susam-Sarajeva, 2008, p. 187). Most studies that do exist revolve around singability (Low, 2003; Stopar 2016), singability and rhyme (Low, 2008), or fidelity to the source text (Franzon 2005). The combination of song translation theory and metaphor theory, however, is a virtually unresearched combination of fields. Low (2017) states: “[s]ong lyrics are often rich in metaphor” and he recommends that song translators, more than 'regular' translators, should “attempt to maintain the richness of metaphor” (p. 34). This thesis analyses three songs from musicals that have been translated from English to Dutch. These musicals are of different genres and for different audiences, to include the influence that these factors might have had on the choices of the translators. The musicals used in this study are drama musical Les Misérables (E: 1985; D: 1991), animated film musical Anastasia (1997) and romantic comedy musical Hairspray (E: 1988; D: 2003). Using the MIPVU (Metaphor Identification Procedure VU University Amsterdam [Steen et al., 2010]), this thesis analyses the metaphors in the three songs, in both the English source text and the Dutch target text. Subsequently, it attempts to establish how the translators dealt with the metaphors, and, ultimately, to see whether the fact that the target texts are singable translations of a song had any influence on the choices of the translator. This is endeavoured by answering two questions. Firstly, can the translations of the metaphors in songs be analysed by means of Newmark's (1981) and Schäffner's (2004) categorizations of procedures used in metaphor translation? Secondly, can singularities be explained through Low's pentathlon principle (2005) for song translation?","['Translation', 'Song', 'Musical', 'Metaphor']"
China’s soft power: an assessment of positive image building in the Middle East,"Osman, Romana","['Regilme, Salvador Santino']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"With the boom in the Chinese economy and its increasing influence in the global world order, China adhered to a new strategy that focuses on improving its image in the world by relying solely on soft power. China’s soft power strategy in the Middle East is little researched, however, the Middle East is of paramount global importance as the region is the world’s largest energy supplier. This thesis examines China’s soft power strategy and its key objectives in the Middle East through an in-depth analysis focusing on economic, cultural, political and military soft power initiatives. The findings of this research argue that China’s pivot towards the Middle East is primarily driven by its need to secure energy sources, as well as other economic interests. Its influence in the Middle East is rapidly increasing through these various soft power initiatives. Although China’s soft power strategy is mainly focused on economic and cultural soft power initiatives, political and military soft power initiatives have taken a larger focus in recent years. As China is gradually shifting from non-interference to limited-interference in the regions political and security affairs, it is committed to maintain and improve its image, which it attained solely through soft power, by not losing its neutrality while gradually becoming more proactive in the political and security field.","['China', 'Middle East', 'Soft power', 'rising power', 'Chinese', 'image building', 'energy', 'economy', 'power', 'politics']"

Lookism in South Korea: the Rising Critique and the Case of 200 Pounds of Beauty,"Vermeulen, Nena Chérise","['Han, Namhee']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Lookism has started to become manifested throughout the South Korean society which has led to the obsession of Koreans with the achievement of beauty, even to such extremes that cosmetic surgery is no longer a taboo and often even promoted to the people. Especially in the music industry the pressures to have to fit the Korean ideal beauty standard is extremely high. Korean idols are expected to have attractive appearances, as they are not only seen as role models for their fans; it will increase the success they will have in their musical career and will thus lead to a more promising future. Despite many people believing that this beauty obsession is just part of Korean culture, the critiques against the idea of lookism are rising. With comedy film being a means through which social and cultural critiques are often expressed, this thesis aims to analyze lookism in the context of South Korea and its music industry by arguing how the Korean film comedy 200 Pounds of Beauty uses its comedy genre to criticize lookism in South Korea.","['lookism', 'south korea', 'music industry', 'female representation', 'comedy film', 'appearance', 'beauty standard']"

"'Dat is toch een idioot voorstel, meneer Roemer?' Debatstrategieën om het ethos van de tegenstander aan te vallen en het eigen ethos te beschermen.","Delft, Patrick van","['Pilgram, Roosmaryn']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In het politieke debat bestaat de mogelijkheid om de tegenstander persoonlijk aan te vallen. De betreffende politicus heeft hiermee op het oog dat het ethos van de tegenstander met deze persoonlijke aanval geschaad wordt. Er zijn echter gevallen waarin niet de tegenstander, maar de spreker zelf wordt geschaad door zijn persoonlijke aanval. In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht of er strategieën zijn waarmee een discussiant het ethos van zijn tegenstander kan aanvallen zonder dat zijn eigen ethos daarmee geschaad wordt. De hoofdvraag van deze scriptie is dan ook: met welke strategieën kunnen politici een persoonlijke aanval inzetten in verkiezingsdebatten zonder daarbij het eigen ethos te verwaarlozen? Om deze vraag te beantwoorden zijn de verkiezingsdebatten van 2012 geanalyseerd. Er is gekozen voor een onderzoek naar verkiezingsdebatten, omdat het aannemelijk lijkt dat er in verkiezingsdebatten veel persoonlijke aanvallen aangetroffen kunnen worden. In verkiezingsdebatten speelt het ethos van de discussiant meer een rol dan in een ander debat, omdat kiezers op basis van verkiezingsdebatten kunnen bepalen wie ze willen dat ministerpresident van het land wordt. Vermoedelijk speelt het ethos van de discussianten een rol bij deze keuze, en het is daarom aantrekkelijk voor de politici om het ethos van de tegenstander aan te vallen. De verkiezingsdebatten zijn geanalyseerd aan de hand van analytische inductie. Er is voortdurend een hypothese opgesteld, en deze hypothese is aangepast naargelang er voorbeelden opdoken die strijdig waren met de initiële hypothese. Op deze manier zijn er een aantal strategieën gedefinieerd in het corpus, en deze strategieën zijn in te delen in een viertal categorieën. De categorieën van debatstrategieën vallen samen met de drie communicatieve niveaus van de taalhandelingentheorie: locutie, illocutie en perlocutie. Omwille van het materiaal is er een vierde categorie aan toegevoegd, namelijk de dialogische strategieën. Een locutionaire debatstrategie is een debatstrategie waarbij de vorm van de uiting de strategische manoeuvre bewerkstelligt. Bij een illocutionaire manoeuvreert de discussiant strategisch door middel van de inhoud van de uiting. Als er sprake is van een perlocutionaire debatstrategie wordt er strategisch gemanoeuvreerd met het effect van de uiting. Bij een dialogische debatstrategie wordt de strategische manoeuvre tot stand gebracht door middel van de interactie tussen de discussianten. Op basis van de bevindingen in het corpus kan gesteld worden dat er een op macroniveau vier manieren zijn om een persoonlijke aanval in te zetten zonder dat daarbij het eigen ethos schade ondervindt. Deze vier manieren zijn de vier categorieën zoals hierboven besproken. Binnen deze categorieën kunnen op microniveau een aantal strategieën worden onderscheiden. In deze scriptie worden een aantal van deze strategieën besproken.","['Taalbeheersing', 'Pragma-dialectiek', 'retorica', 'ethos', 'beleefdheid', 'debat', 'debatstrategie', 'politiek debat']"

On the diachronic development of the English comparative,"Klis, Anika van der","['Botma, E.D.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"It has often been observed that English is gradually shifting from a predominantly synthetic towards a more analytic language (see e.g. Lutz 1997; McIntyre 2009; Haselow 2011). This thesis examines whether this gradual shift can also be observed in the way that English marks comparative forms. Many present-day English adjectives can form the comparative in two ways: by morphological means, viz. by suffixation of -er (greener), and by syntactic means, viz. by the periphrastic construction more green. Given that variation is a prerequisite of linguistic change, and that English is becoming more analytic, we would expect a gradual replacement of morphological comparatives by periphrastic constructions. Previous studies have found structural and frequency factors that affect the choice between the morphological and periphrastic comparative (see e.g. Hilpert 2008; Mondorf 2009; Cheung & Zhang 2016). This thesis also aims to examine whether these factors have an effect on the diachronic development as well. This corpus-based study examines fifteen English comparatives between 1810 and 2015. A clear replacement of morphological comparatives by periphrastic constructions can be observed from the 1950s onwards. The separate diachronic developments of the fifteen comparatives illustrate that there are clear developmental differences between these comparatives. These differences can be explained by structural and frequency factors, as will be suggested by this thesis.",

Stylistic Choices in the Portrayal of Female Characters in Lord of the Rings,"Raaijmakers, Thijs","['Dorst, A.G.', 'Porck, M.H.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Being J. R. R. Tolkien’s most celebrated work, The Lord of the Rings has been subject to a myriad of academic studies and analyses regarding both its language and its contents. For instance, scholars such as Provost have studied how the language elucidates the central conflict. Additionally, Agøy and Drout have examined the story’s themes through its stylistic attributes, as well as the general aesthetic effects of these stylistic choices. Meanwhile, feminist readings like those of Enright and Green discuss the number and roles of female characters in the books, countering common criticisms that their paucity betrays Tolkien’s supposed sexist stance. However, the language and contents of the trilogy have yet to be combined into a single systematic study, which is where this thesis comes in. Using the stylistic approach to Politeness Theory (Brown and Levinson), Speech-Act Theory (Searle), and keynoting (Carter and Nash), this thesis will examine the text surrounding female characters in an attempt to reveal how stylistic choices affect their presentation. By focussing on stylistic choices, this study aims to clarify how the characters are portrayed, which may not be as obvious from their actions or their role in the plot. This way, this study explores whether the criticism of too few bland female characters in The Lord of the Rings holds true by examining how language contributes to nuances in their characterization.","['J.

Based on Herbert Spencer’s concept of the survival of the fittest, characters in novels by authors such as Émile Zola and Theodore Dreiser are fiercely competing individuals who are determined to gain economic advantage at the expense of others. Their behaviour is often described in terms of brutal nature, uncontrollable temperaments, and animal instincts. This comparison of human beings to animals - which in the case of naturalism is not merely metaphorical - is also at the core of what retail theory nowadays labels as impulse buying, a type of shopping behaviour without overt rational consideration and deliberation. According to retailers, lavish shop design was expected to provoke this new type of shopping behaviour, and, around the turn of the twentieth century, the naturalist novel tended to describe and explain this combination of manipulation and shopping behaviour.","['Literary naturalism', 'Shopping behaviour', 'Department store', 'Zola', 'Dreiser']"
"Up in the air: radio, identity and politics in the Dutch East Indies, 1927-1942","Kaan, Peter","['Schrikker, Alicia']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the relation between radio and identity politics in the Dutch East Indies (1927-1942). Although Indies radio in this early period is often dismissed as somewhat inconsequential or apolitical, this study argues that a better look at its cultural registers and the motives behind its development betray a significant relation between Indies radio stations and colonial identity politics. Whether it was the PHOHI, which was developed to strengthen Dutch identity and authority, the NIROM, which strongly segmented between eastern and western audiences, or the eastern stations, founded in reaction to the severe underrepresentation of eastern cultures, almost all stations were involved in the segmentation of Indies society. Although such segmentation might have affirmed the ‘rule of colonial difference’ and thereby strengthened colonial rule, this study argues that any such effect would have been weakened by the increasing number of audiences with hybrid identities, as these undermined the categories of colonial hierarchy. Meanwhile radio continued to catalyse the polarization of eastern and western identities, weakening the cohesion and stability of Indies society.","['Radio', 'Identity', 'Media', 'Plural society', 'Indonesia', 'Technology']"

Pathos als blijmaker. Het opwekken van positieve emoties in sportreclames voor consumeringsmiddelen die in eerste instantie niet aan sport gerelateerd zijn.,"Bronts, Anouk","['Pilgram, Roosmaryn']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie is onderzocht hoe pathos in reclames gebruikt kan worden om een poging te doen positieve emoties op te roepen bij ontvangers, door een positieve gevolgtrekking te maken tussen een sport en het product. Met die positieve gevolgtrekking wordt bedoeld dat het subject na inname van het consumeringsproduct plotseling erg goede sportprestaties kan leveren. De aanleiding hiervoor betrof een citaat van De Brauw e.a. (2016) waarin gesteld werd dat door de associatie met sport positieve emoties opgeroepen worden voor ongezonde producten. De vraag was daarom op welke manieren dit kan gebeuren. Pathos betekent het opwekken van emoties bij het publiek en is een technisch overtuigingsmiddel ontwikkeld in de klassieke retorica. Hierbij kunnen uiteraard positieve of negatieve emoties opgewekt worden, maar in deze scriptie staat de positieve variant centraal. Het blijkt dat pathos in reclames ingezet kan worden door middel van het gebruik van bepaalde stilistische middelen in vorm en beeld, of door het gebruik van humor. Na analyse aan de hand van de methode van analytische inductie zijn twee reclames geanalyseerd op het voorkomen van pathos, en hoe pathos opgewekt wordt in die reclames. Door toepassing van humor kunnen positieve emoties opgeroepen worden. Daarnaast kan de ontvanger een impliciete vergelijking maken met het subject in de reclame, waarbij dus het stilistische en/of argumentatorische middel van de vergelijking wordt gebruikt.","['pathos', 'emotions', 'ads', 'advertising', 'sport', 'unhealthy', 'ongezonde producten', 'consumeringsmiddelen', 'sportgerelateerd']"

Authenticiteit in beeldende snowboardjournalistiek: een etnografische studie,"Sie, Liza","['Hout, Tom van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Uit onderzoek blijkt dat authenticiteit een belangrijke rol speelt in de groeiende subcultuur van het snowboarden en dat het een opvallend invloedrijke functie binnen de snowboardjournalistiek vervult. Authenticiteit draagt bij aan de geloofwaardigheid en nauwkeurigheid van nichemedia (Koetsenruijter & Van Hout, 2014, p. 6) en vormt daarnaast ook een beeld van de normen en waarden van de subcultuur in kwestie. Om meer te weten te komen over hoe authenticiteit zich uit in de snowboardmedia en hoe sportredacties authenticiteit verbeelden, nemen we de beeldproducenten van snowboardcontent onder de loep. In deze scriptie wordt er door middel van een kwalitatief, etnografisch onderzoek gekeken naar hoe sportredacties (die bestaan uit redacteuren, fotografen en snowboarders) authenticiteit tot uitdrukking brengen in de beeldende snowboardjournalistiek. Het onderzoek toont door middel van onder andere interviews, veldnotities en casussen aan dat producenten authenticiteit op subtiele wijze verweven en implementeren in alle aspecten van beeldende snowboardjournalistiek. De sportredactie en de afdeling communicatie van de Nederlandse Ski Vereniging (NSKiV), de belangrijkste organisatie binnen Nederland op het gebied van wintersport, fungeert als uitgangspunt voor dit onderzoek. De data tonen aan dat beelden die worden geproduceerd voor gebruik binnen de snowboardjournalistiek minstens bepaalde cruciale factoren horen te bevatten om als authentiek te worden beschouwd door de producenten en consumenten van snowboardcontent. De natives van de subcultuur, ofwel kerndeelnemers van de snowboardwereld, vervullen in dit onderzoek zowel de rollen van trouwe lezers als producenten van snowboardcontent. Deze cruciale factoren zijn wellicht onzichtbaar voor snowboardleken, maar zijn juist de factoren die het beeld van de subcultuur en de bijbehorende normen en waarden vormgeven. Dit onderzoek geeft, door het in kaart brengen van de cruciale factoren van authenticiteit, inzicht in hoe ‘feiten zo waarheidsgetrouw, accuraat, evenwichtig en neutraal mogelijk worden weergegeven’ (Koetsenruijter & Van Hout, 2014, p.6) binnen de subcultuurmedia van de snowboardwereld. Aan de hand van situaties uit de praktijk schetst deze scriptie een beeld van hoe producenten van snowboardcontent een foto beoordelen en welke factoren daarbij een rol spelen. De analyse van de data wijst op een nauw samenspel van cruciale en ondersteunende factoren bij het bepalen van hoe legit (de snowboardterm voor authentiek) een foto is. In deze scriptie zullen de onderstaande factoren en hun bijdrage aan de authenticiteit worden toegelicht aan de hand van illustratieve voorbeelden (foto’s uit de casussen). De totale lijst factoren kent onder andere de volgende elementen die in dit onderzoek aan de hand van illustrerende beelden verder worden toegelicht: het landen, correct grabben, tweaken, de moeilijkheidsgraad en uitvoering van freestyle tricks; de vaardigheden, stance, stijl, invloed en houding van de snowboarder; de snowboarddiscipline; de reputatie van de fotograaf en de snowboarder; de compositie; de context; het doel van de foto; de kleding; de beeldbewerking. Vijf van deze elementen vallen binnen de categorie cruciale factoren: het succesvol landen van een trick; het succesvol grabben van een snowboardtruc; boven de coping van een halfpipe uitkomen; reputatie en invloed van de snowboarder en context waarbij de afzet en landing van een schans of het begin en einde van een rail duidelijk te zien dienen te zijn. Daarnaast vervullen een aantal factoren een ondersteunende rol. Dit zijn factoren als de kleding van de snowboarder en de compositie van de foto. Deze scriptie levert een bijdrage aan de lijst van elementen die authenticiteit in de wereld van de extreme sporten vormgeven, die nog niet door eerdere onderzoeken zijn geëxpliciteerd. De conclusie die uit de analyse naar voren komt, is dat de harmonie en balans tussen elementen bepalend is voor het niveau van authenticiteit. Hierbij speelt het concept van kairos (het vangen van het perfecte moment (van den Broek et al., 2010, p.101)) een kritieke rol.","['Authenticiteit', 'Snowboarden', 'Nichemedia', 'Etnografisch onderzoek', 'Subcultuurmedia', 'Beeldende snowboardjournalistiek']"

Stylistic features of Barack Obama’s State of the Union Addresses,"Szczesny, Barbara","['Dorst, Lettie']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper investigates Barack Obama’s style of speech. First of all, the purpose is to examine how Obama’s conceptual metaphors and other distinct style markers in his speeches frame himself and his views in terms of the three rhetorical appeals of ethos, pathos and logos. Second, it is intended to test whether the given style markers undergo any change or remain consistent over the period of his presidency. A quick review of his first and the last State of the Union Address reveals that his most recent speech makes use of humour and informal expressions like phrasal words and colloquialisms in contrast to the serious tone and official language of the first address. The methodology employed in this paper consists of the stylistic checklist by Leech & Short (2007), the Metaphor Identification Procedure (Pragglejaz Group 2007) and the Conceptual Metaphor Theory by Lakoff and Johnson (1980). The theoretical framework applied is based on the concepts of canons of rhetoric, metaphor and metaphor in politics as well as framing. An analysis using the above-mentioned theories and framework reveals how Obama frames himself, Americans as people, and how he structures the American realities of life in terms of three rhetorical appeals.","['stylistic features', 'Barack Obama', 'conceptual metaphor', 'style', 'framing', 'canons of rhetoric']"

Persona Projection Through L2 Pronunciation: The accents of English majors at Leiden,"Huttenga, Gezina Christien Dorothé","['Smakman, Dick']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In a threefold study linking sociolinguistics to the field of second language acquisition, I investigated what values students indexed through their L2 English accent. I related this to their identity. Indexicality is a framework that attatches linguistic variables to social meanings (e.g. Eckert, 2008, Trousdale, 2010, p. 48). The social meanings attached to speech are valued unequally across social groups, and therefore, some language is more likely to be heard and respected than others in a construct termed the ‘linguistic marketplace’ by Bourdieu and Boltanski (Eckert, 2000, p. 13). This study involved questionnaires (n=99), interviews (n=4), and investigations into students’ sound files (n=18). The majority of the students (71%) aspired to a British accent, which could be related to findings in the questionnaire: namely that students rated sounding native and intelligent highly. When interviewed, students stated that a British accent, and specifically Received Pronunciation (RP), sounded more intelligent, and had more prestige attached to it. Investigation by Edwards (2016) reveals that the British accent is still considered the default model in the Netherlands. Thus it appears they have appropriated this norm, and thereby maximise the value of their speech on the linguistic marketplace. Moreover, students likely wish to signal their intelligence and expertise by emulating the British ideal. In general, students sounded predominantly British in their sound files (52% on average), though they had 40% Dutch influence on average, and also traces of American influences, like t-flapping and rhoticity. Besides L1 interference this showed students also incorporated aspects of speech which likely had covert prestige for them. In general, students’ accent preferences signal their academic, professional identity, but do not seem to index all aspects of their identity. When applied to the wider L2 acquisition field, this study illustrates identity expression may not be a priority of learners; instead, they may wish to appropriate a most standard and accepted accent.","['second language acquisition', 'L2', 'pronunciation', 'indexicality', 'sociolinguistics', 'English', 'identity']"

De drogreden van de stroman in de Algemene Politieke Beschouwingen 2016.

In het fragment zijn Erdogan-aanhangers te zien die een NOS-verslaggever duwen tijdens een demonstratie voor het Turkse consulaat in Rotterdam. Tijdens de tv-show reageert Rutte: met een uitspraak waarin hij de woorden ‘pleur op’ gebruikt, de uitspraak is hem in de Algemene Politieke Beschouwingen van 2016 achtervolgd. Zijn collega’s hebben tijdens dit debat welgeteld 71 keer naar de uitspraak verwezen. Onderbouwing van eigen standpunt met behulp van de uitspraak van Rutte kan op een dusdanige manier zijn gedaan, dat dit heeft geleid tot een verdraaiing van het oorspronkelijke standpunt. Met behulp van de pragma-dialectische argumentatietheorie, wil ik gaan onderzoeken of ‘pleur op’ in de APB voorkomt als een drogreden van de stroman. De drogreden betreft de verdraaiing of vertekening van een standpunt. De pragma-dialectiek geeft een ideaalmodel voor een kritische discussie en manoeuvres aan de hand waarvan een drogreden van de stroman kan worden herkend. In de pragma-dialectiek worden duidelijke systematische en volledige analyses van verschillende drogredeneringen gegeven, die begaan kunnen worden in een discussie, wat deze theorie geschikt maakt voor dit onderzoek.","['Stroman', 'Drogreden', 'APB', 'Politici', 'Pragma-dialectiek']"

This thesis aims to explore the theme of death in these poems and will further delve into the possibility whether the thought of suicide is present in them. Elegiac poetry, featuring an implied deeper meaning of sorrow and grief towards the state of the soul and the earthly existence, has been a subject of research for many decades, especially for its deeper poetic meaning. By looking at relevant interpretations of the Anglo-Saxon elegies that have been suggested by scholars, this thesis will try to answer the question whether death, which is a recurring motif in Anglo-Saxon literature, is also present in the elegies. In addition, it will be shown how the theme of death comes into play when linked to the poet’s discomfort of the soul, and whether the thought of suicide can also be discovered in these poems. It is to be expected that the conflict of the mind in these ‘sad poems’ can be linked to the thought of death, thus proving that suicide is a theme that occurs in these elegies as well.",

Changing State-Market Relations and Development,"Wouwer, Rafael Van de","['Silva, Patricio']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In this thesis the objective is to understand why state-market relations change overtime and the main research question is: “How do changing state-market-relations influence the performance of the Brazilian energy sector and what has been the impact of the different roles of the state on (national) growth and development since the First Republic until the Dilma Administration (1889-2016)?” The objective is to study which model leads to the development of an energy sector that can be used to accomplish broad-based national development. Furthermore, it would be quite interesting to analyse why policy changes occurs. The reason for the choice for energy is an obvious one as it is essential for economic development. Furthermore, energy resources, subsoil or offshore, such as coal, uranium, and oil and gas, and renewable energy resources such as biomass, wind-, solar-, and hydropower form a vital public good and should be provided at affordable prices even in remote areas. Therefore, the relation between development and state ownership of energy resources will be investigated. In this regard, the performance during the First Republic (1889-1930) will be analysed to study the impact of “liberalism”. In addition, the impact of “structuralism” (1930-1995) will be studied. Afterwards, the impact of “liberalization” (1995-2002) will be compared with “neo-structuralism” under the Workers Party (PT) (2003-2016). In this thesis is chosen for almost all energy resources to demonstrate that the same pattern takes place in all energy sectors, and thus, even in sectors that are considered strategic or sensitive such as nuclear energy. In addition, it shows that sectors such as wind and solar pose massive potential for energy generation in Brazil and that those sectors are remarkably underdeveloped in the country. The case study also demonstrates that government policy has proven to be necessary to provide incentives for investors to develop them and that currently government policy does not stimulate investment in those sectors. The expectation is that ideally to achieve national development and to develop new sectors the state should own and protect it while providing incentives for growth but that in practice state-market relations change to keep expanding the exploitation of energy resources in a changing global economic environment, and that outcomes reflect the relative bargaining power of local, state and multinational capital. The expectation in regard to the role of the state is that its function is to facilitate capital, and to coerce labour. Hence, to provide financial incentives and easy access for mostly foreign capital while the other role for the state seems to be the appeasement of different actors that have the potential capacity and will to oppose the expansion of foreign investment and exploitation of energy resources through the strategic use of stick and carrot in a changing global economic context.","['Energy Policy', 'Changing State-Market Relations', 'Industrial Change', 'Economic Growth and Development']"

The Cut-up Literature of William S. Burroughs; Barbarians and the Future,"Damen, Joost","['Boletsi, Maria']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The focus of this thesis is on a mysterious group of beings encountered in William S. Burroughs’ (1914-1997) literary works: the Wild Boys. These Wild Boys are a personification of many of the central themes of Burroughs’ works, such as homosexuality, masculinity and violence, but also revolution, anarchism and utopianism. As embodiments of all the above themes, the Wild Boys offer much that is of interest in the present day political sphere because they exist as (and express) a reaction to some of the dominant ideological and social conflicts of Burroughs’ time. The structure of these conflicts may have changed but they have certainly not disappeared: family structures, masculinity and femininity, the capitalist economic paradigm, pacifism contra revolutionary desires and, last but by no means least, the relation of the West to ‘the rest,’ and in relation to this, American imperialism and its 20th century crises. Through the Wild Boys, Burroughs outlines an alternative form of social organisation which has its own internal contradictions and pitfalls, but which is ultimately concerned with possibilities of radical emancipation.","['cut-up', 'beat', 'resistance', 'barbarism', 'burroughs', 'avant-garde']"

Solving the Northern Territories Dispute: negotiation tactics under Abe and Putin,"Vogel, Annemijn","['Wakefield, Bryce']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"On April 27th of 2017, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Russia’s president Vladimir Putin met once again in Russia to discuss bilateral cooperation and the dispute surrounding the Northern Territories. Japan and Russia have been in conflict over the four southernmost islands of the Kuril Island archipelago ever since they were handed over to the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. While for many years the bilateral trade between Japan and Russia was stagnating, ever since the summit in Vladivostok in 2012, there has been an eastward shift of the Russian economy. In May 2016 Abe announced that they were taking a new approach in the negotiations. While many believe it to be disappointing, it can be argued that it is a long term negotiation tactic, which focuses on economic cooperation. Through analyzing the Japan Russia summits it can be seen that they have shifted from a positional bargaining strategy to a principled bargaining strategy, and how it gives a good possibility in solving the dispute.","['Northern Territories dispute', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'negotiations']"
"THE TRAGIC HERO AS A GUIDING FIGURE IN THE CULTURAL DISCOURSE OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT: NEW REPRESENTATIONS OF BLACK MALE IDENTITY IN 12 YEARS A SLAVE, SELMA, THE BIRTH OF A NATION, AND KENDRICK LAMAR'S ALBUM TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY","Morawetz, Ingeborg Maria","['Kardux, J.C.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Black Lives Matter movement (BLM) started with a hashtag: in 2012 Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi created the slogan “Black Lives Matter” after a case of police brutality that led to the death of seventeen-year old Trayvon Martin. From the guiding principles of BLM it becomes obvious, that the original idea behind the movement mainly focused on the inclusion of minority groups within Black communities, rather than only on racialized police violence. The movement gained great popularity not only with hashtag-users and participants in protests, but it was also immediately picked up by the media and in public debates, while numerous variations of the slogan emerged to either mock or hijack the movement. The media attention can be divided into three different kinds: reports about the movement in connection to the police shootings, reports about protests and current incidents, and a wider field in which BLM was connected to the cultural scene in the US from 2012 to the present: the cultural discourse. Part of this cultural discourse are Steve McQueen's movie 12 Years A Slave (2013), Ava DuVernay's movie Selma (2014) and Nate Parker's movie The Birth of a Nation (2016), all three historical dramas, as well as Kendrick Lamar's album To Pimp A Butterfly (2015). All four cultural productions were directly connected to BLM by the media. They were brought up in discussions about and within the movement, and, even though BLM was initially created in response to racially motivated police brutality, the three movies also triggered debates about other cultural and societal issues, such as the acknowledgment and representation of Black directors and actors in US cinema. The protagonists of all three films are black heterosexual men. Although Lamar's album provided the anthem of the movement, “Alright”, and addresses police brutality in the other songs as well, it also uses a number of common rap themes, treating women, for instance, from a male-centered and at first glance misogynist perspective. Especially when we look at other Hip Hop artists connected to BLM as well, it becomes clear that the pop-cultural narrative that is associated with BLM is actually about black heterosexual men. Considering that the three founders of BLM are, in their own words, “queer Black women,” this contextualization of the movement is surprising. This thesis investigates the incongruity between the original principles of BLM and its public appearance in (pop)cultural contexts that put a black male heterosexual narrative in the foreground.",

Towards Sustainable Models of Agricultural Development,"Jovanovic, Aleksandra","['Amann, Edmund']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Dictated by economic traits of progress via free trade agreements and profit-driven capitalism, the global paradigm of Neoliberalism has become the dominant framework of economic development in Latin America since the 90s (Hojman 194). Neoliberalism is a revival of economic liberalism in which government intervention is disapproved within economic sectors, and free and self-regulating competitive markets and the development of capitalist societies are promoted (Thorsen and Lie 2). Introduced in 1989, The Washington Consensus is seen as the template for Latin America’s engagement with neoliberalism. It is as well, an indication of the vast expansion of the ‘USA model’ of economic progress by powerful international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (Grugel and Riggirozzi 4). The neoliberal model was implemented via free market open economy policies (FMOEP), guided by the objective of economic decentralisation. Conditions for private profitability were established, cutting back the central role of the state within the economic sectors (Geddes 3151). Within the agricultural sphere, Neoliberalism aims for a system in which the control in agricultural production and resources happens via private corporations via profit-driven interests. This contrasts with the prior agricultural model of Keynesian economics, in which state power dominates within the agricultural sector, via the control and active role in the production process (Miyake 380). The spread of neoliberal agrarian reforms in Latin America promoted the framework of international trade and free trade, leading to the birth of the Global Farm Model within Latin America. Following the ideology of Neoliberalism, trade embargoes are portrayed as a restrictive factor on economic progress within the agricultural sector of a country (Betancourt 175). Within the context of Neoliberal expansion, Cuba is an unique exception within the region of Latin America, as it followed an alternative path to agricultural development, away from a neoliberal agricultural model. For more than 50 years, the United States (US) has imposed an economic, commercial, and social embargo against Cuba. This makes Cuba an interesting case study, in the broader context of Latin America and the dominance of Neoliberalism. Within the current ideology of agricultural development, climate change, and environmental degradation, the issue of sustainability has gained momentum in the agricultural sector. Looking through the lens of sustainable agricultural development, this brings the paper to the following research question: What are the economic, social, and environmental impacts of Neoliberalism versus Cuban-style policies on sustainable agricultural systems?","['Sustainable Development', 'Agriculture', 'Cuba', 'Brazil', 'Economics', 'Latin America', 'Urban Agriculture', 'Agribusiness', 'Neoliberalism', 'Trade Embargo']"

A.","Leersum, Sara van","['Churampi Ramírez, Adriana']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,es,"En las últimas décadas se ha visto que en el audiovisual indígena en Colombia – y hasta cierto punto en América Latina – ha ocurrido un cambio significativo en cuanto a la percepción del manejo de la videocámara y su relación con el “sujeto observado” y “observador”. El hombre blanco pasó de ser el principal autor a espectador y el indígena ahora es el autor y productor de este tipo de audiovisual que usualmente es visto por un público no indígena. Con este acontecimiento paradójico, el hecho que la cámara de video sea un elemento de invención no indígena, la llegada de este elemento audiovisual se ha visto como un paso para “descolonizar” y empoderar la cultura indígena, en vista de que con este instrumento se pueden crear nuevas imágenes, apartándose de la representación estereotipada colonial y así mismo la cámara se entiende como una herramienta de denuncia en contra de las actividades que perjudican a las comunidades nativas. Para este trabajo de tesis se pretende analizar el documental indígena Resistencia en la Línea Negra (2011) de Amado Villafaña Chaparro, Saúl Gil, y Silvestre Gil Sarabata, que expone las dos funciones de la videocámara mencionadas: para presentar una nueva imagen del indígena y comunicar denuncias. En este trabajo se propone investigar estas funciones de la cámara, y de otro lado se intenta averiguar cómo a través de este instrumento se expone la problemática del territorio sagrado indígena en la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, la Línea Negra. Para ello se analizará el video Resistencia en la Línea Negra en el caso concreto la ocupación del territorio sagrado por la construcción del megaproyecto Puerto Brisa S.

I identify the “Radicals” as a group of mostly young, female and poor individuals both instigating and reveling in the breakdown of an oppressive community. They were experimenting with a world turned upside-down, a grand social experiment both echoing and inverting the Puritan experiment Salem was built upon. The very society that oppressed them, Puritan New England, had set a precedent for dissent and the formation of a new, radical, society. I will argue the opposing group, the “Conservatives,” consisted of older, mostly male figures trying desperately to maintain the establishment. I will argue that their interpretation of the actions of the possessed was proposed with specific intent and was formative in the continuation of the crisis. The crisis was, therefore, not an inadvertent consequence of their fractured society, but a fulfilment of the desires of each group.","['New England', 'Witchcraft', 'Radical', 'Conservative', 'Community', 'Colonial America']"
The 14th Dalai Lama and the Tibetan diaspora - Lifes in Exile,"Steenbergen, Fleur","['Verhagen, Peter']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 1940, Tenzin Gyatso was enthroned as the 14th Dalai Lama in Tibet. During that time, Tibet was still a quiet area without any Chinese influences. Tenzin was 5 years old back then, but was treated with respect. The Dalai Lama is considered the highest authority, the spiritual and political leader by the Tibetans. A regent took over the governing tasks until the Dalai Lama was 18 years old. Meanwhile, in neighbouring China, something happened that drastically changed the calm situation in Tibet. In 1949, Mao Zedong comes to power in China and the Chinese republic’s days are numbered. Mao founds the People’s Republic of China on the first of October that year and China becomes a communist state; a state in which people are ‘raised’ to think and live according to communist manners. In the political field there is only one party possessing all power. Mao organizes the Chinese People’s Liberation Army - known as ‘the Red Army’. The Red Army enters Tibet in October 1950 and does not fear the Tibetan army’s resistance, as it is much smaller and poorly armed. The government of Tibet gives all the power to the Dalai Lama, who is 15 years old at that time. China decides that Tibet is an integral part of China now and gives the Dalai Lama a position in the Chinese government, in which he has little to nothing to say. This is considered the start of the Chinese oppression. During the Tibetan New Year in 1959, riots break out and the Tibetans massively protest against Chinese domination. The Chinese react to the protest by killing thousands of Tibetans; already 87,000 people are killed in the Lhasa region only. Villages and monasteries are burned down and the Tibetan government is dissolved. The Dalai Lama flees to Dharamsala, India, where he forms a government in exile. After this incident, more than 7,000 Tibetans cross the border and ask for political asylum in India. The diaspora of Tibetans and religious leaders leads to a spread of Tibetan Buddhism around the world, with the Dalai Lama’s influence not only limited to the community in Dharamsala. Other influential tulkus and lamas (such as Kaly Rinpoche, Ole Nydahl, Chogyam Trungpa and Khenchen Palden Sherab) found Tibetan monasteries in all parts of the world. In 1998, according to the Tibetan Planning Council, 111.170 Tibetans were living in exile (85,000 in India). A government in exile was formed just like other kinds of Tibetan institutes. This research study focuses on the role of the 14th Dalai Lama in the Tibetan communities in exile. In more detail, it provides the reader with an insight into the changes the Dalai Lama has undergone from political- to only spiritual leader and points out his primary concerns for the Tibetan communities. In addition, research on China’s role in the influence of the Dalai Lama is carried out. A final conclusion will link existing literature and give an answer to the main question by inserting my own interpretations. A study on this subject, furthermore, helps to better understand the Tibetan diaspora around the world and China’s role in the story today. This thesis consists of books from the Leiden University Library, focusing on the current Dalai Lama and Tibetan communities in exile and journals from different disciplines, such as sinology, anthropology, sociology, politics and religious studies.","['Tibet', 'Dalai Lama', 'Diaspora', 'Exile', 'China']"

"Does Money Matter in Islam Economics: Gold, Silver, Riba al-Fadl and Riba Nasi'ah","Verplancke, Tom","['Berger, Mauritz']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research deals with the question what the economic system based on precious metals (the natural situation) looked like in the Muslim world and if the evolution toward fiat money violated the commandments of the sharia concerning riba, particularly riba al-fadl and riba nasi’ah? These two forms of riba apply specifically to gold and silver, designated in the Quran and Sunnah as natural money. The evolution of money described by Fox and Ernst consists of five different stages, namely the natural situation where gold and silver are valued by their intrinsic value. This situation is sharia compliant but in the next stage coins were valued at face or nominal value, a violation of riba al-fadl which prescribes the exchange of weight for weight. Bank money is seen as the next stage, and this is problematic regarding riba nasi’ah as the exchange of gold and silver is deferred whereas the sources prescribe exchange being done on the spot. Paper money convertible to gold is the fourth stage. This again constitutes deferred exchange of metals, but also riba al-fadl as there is no 100% backing of the notes brought in circulation. Fiat money is totally divorced from gold and silver and is always brought into existence as a loan with interest. Islamic finance hasn’t really engaged with the topic of the permissibility of fiat money, but it appears interest in the subject is gaining traction as most Muslims feel that from an Islamic perspective there is something fundamentally wrong with the current financial system.","['Economics', 'Islam', 'Gold', 'Silver', 'Finance', 'Money', 'Riba', 'Coinage', 'Banking']"

This principle is called matrilineality. The Jews of Kaifeng China abided by the Jewish Law and Rabbinical Literature. In spite of this, the Kaifeng community inherited Jewish identity patrilineary. Through the study of source materials from Kaifeng, the present paper attempts to explain how it came about that the Kaifeng Jews upheld a patrilineal system of inheritance. Even more so, this paper argues against the teleological argument put forward by the existing scholarship on the issue by stating that the adoption of patrilineality was not a mere consequence of assimilation, but actually a conscious act of acculturation. The Kaifeng Jewish community continued to exist for centuries after the adoption of patrilineality, therefore it is wrong of the existing literature to suggest assimilation was the cause for the switch from matrilineality to patrilineality. The present paper argues that the Kaifeng Jews made the conscious decision to adopt a patrilineal system of inheritance, even if that meant going against Rabbinical Law.","['Joodse studies', 'Matrilineariteit', 'Yuhasin', 'Chinese Joden', 'Kaifeng', 'Joodse identiteit', 'Assimilatie']"

The United States’ Discursive power over Japan in the Japan-Russia relationship,"Linssen, Nathalie Y.G.","['Black, Lindsay O.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recent developments such as the Syrian civil war and the Ukraine conflict have put Russia and the U.S. at opposing sides just as Japan increasingly sought relations with Russia over the Northern Territories. The influence of the U.S. on the Russia-Japan relationship and thereby the Northern Territories dispute has been insufficiently researched. Using the Syrian Civil war and the Ukraine crisis as two case studies, the influence of the U.S.on the Russia-Japan relationship will be analyzed in this thesis. The theoretical framework will reflect on prevalent models with which to study Japan in international relations, considering Japan being either a reactive or adaptive state. To analyze the U.S.’ influence on the Russia-Japan relations and by proxy, the Northern territories issue, discourse analysis will be used. The discourse analysis will be looking for uses of discursive power: the ability to pressure another actor by the dominant power through the use of discourse. What is meant by discursive power and its significance to this research will be discussed in the methodology. This research will specifically look for forms of pressure, either explicit or implicit, that pressure Japan in the Ukraine or Syria case studies to sanction or take actions against Russia despite Japan’s interests in good relations with Russia because of the Northern Territories issue. Lastly, changes in the U.S. administration will be discussed briefly. The change from President Obama to President Trump has already caused a stir in the media discourse about the relationship between the U.S. and Russia, and between the U.S. and Japan. A brief speculation about the implications the change in administration might have is therefore necessary, since it is then established that the United State-Russia relationship will have an effect on the Russia-Japan relationship.","['beiatsu', 'gaiatsu', 'united states', 'Japan', 'pressure', 'russia', 'international relations', 'discursive power', 'case studies', 'northern territories', 'kurile islands', 'discourse analysis']"

This is also known as the male gaze, which illustrates the world from a male perspective.Subsequently, the notion of women as spectators and audience is neglected. The South Korean music industry is no stranger to this. As most K-pop girl groups are targeted at a male audience, studies concerning Korean girl group representation primarily focuses on the influence of the male gaze. This thesis purposes to analyze K-pop girl group music videos from a female gaze, which represents female artists from a female point of view. Subsequently, the female gaze provides a sense of empowerment as women are not objectified, instead, the woman is represented as an active player. As Girls’ Generation has a huge international female following, this thesis aims to explore how the female gaze plays a role in representing female empowerment in Girls’ Generation’s music videos.","['K-pop', 'Male gaze', 'Female gaze', 'Female empowerment', 'Music videos', 'South Korea']"
Revisiting the character of business incubators within the Russian Federation,"Johannes, Kirpestein","['Max, Bader']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Russische Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Business incubators (BIs) are considered to be popular tools to aid and accelerate the foundation of successful (technological) entrepreneurial companies. They typically support new start-up ventures with the aim that these will develop themselves into self-sustaining and effective businesses. However, the divergence in theoretical perspectives on the nature of BIs causes literature to hold discrepant views on the number of BIs in Russia. Therefore, explaining the operations of Russian BIs will serve existing literature to indicate the actual density of BIs in the country in perspective to the theoretical lens employed. Possibly, this will give future research an indication of the actual influence of BIs on economic innovation in Russia. This thesis concludes that the current operations of business incubators in Russia are highly divergent as a result of substantial differences in services offered. Besides, the scope in which an organization can be identified as a business incubator in Russia seems to rather unlimited, which causes enormous differences in the perception of BIs within the country. The majority of BIs are no more than empty office spaces lacking even the most basic facilities. This raises the question if the stimulated growth of business incubators within the Russian Federation turned out to be failed project.","['Russia', 'Business Incubators', 'quantative study']"
Op de kop af - Een onderzoek naar het effect van cijfers op de betrouwbaarheid van nieuwsartikelen.,"Melita, Misha","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie is onderzocht of er een positief effect is van de aanwezigheid van cijfers op het oordeel van betrouwbaarheid. Roeh en Feldman (1984) beschrijven als een van de eersten een verband tussen cijfers en betrouwbaarheid, en verklaren dit door de nothingbutthefacts uitstraling van cijfers. Ook Koetsenruijter (2011) stelt dat wanneer cijfers worden gebruikt in een nieuwsbericht, mensen die vaak als meer betrouwbaar ervaren (pp. 74). Deze kracht van cijfers is van retorische aard en wordt verbonden aan het begrip ethos. Dit begrip komt voort uit de klassieke retorica, en betekent dat een spreker zijn publiek overtuigt door zijn reputatie (Tal & Wansink, 2016, pp. 118). Dit effect wordt ook verwacht bij het gebruik cijfers in nieuwsberichten. Om dit effect te onderzoeken zijn twee onderzoeksmethoden gecombineerd. Ten eerste is een experiment ontwikkeld waarin respondenten werd gevraagd om op basis van betrouwbaarheid een selectie te maken uit een aantal gepresenteerde krantenkoppen. Sommige van deze krantenkoppen bevatten cijfers, anderen niet. Deze data is aangevuld met interviews. Uit de analyse van de interviewdata bleek dat er veel verschillende redenen waren voor respondenten om bepaalde krantenkoppen te selecteren, waarvan eigen kennis de belangrijkste was. Uit de analyse van de data van het experiment is geen significant verschil gebleken tussen hoe vaak krantenkoppen met cijfers werden geselecteerd, ten opzichte van krantenkoppen zonder cijfers. Uiteindelijk is geconcludeerd dat het onderzoeksontwerp te veel ruimte gaf voor het meespelen van eigen kennis, om een duidelijk effect van cijfers te kunnen onderzoeken. Voor deze conclusie zijn de kennistheorie van Kahneman (2011) en het onderzoek van Miller (2003) van belang. Miller (2003) stelt dat wanneer mensen over inhoudelijke kennis beschikken, zij zich minder snel zullen laten leiden door retorische middelen, zoals het gebruik van cijfers. “Logos verdrijft ethos,” stelt hij (pp. 201). Kahneman (2011) geeft met zijn kennistheorie twee mogelijkheden voor de verwerking van nieuwe informatie: door Systeem 1 en door Systeem 2. Bij Systeem 1 wordt nieuwe informatie verwerkt op een intuïtieve manier, terwijl beoordeling van informatie door Systeem 2 op rationele manier gebeurt. Het is aannemelijk dat een retorisch effect met name optreedt bij beoordeling van informatie door Systeem 1. Bij het experiment en de interviews is mogelijk te veel ruimte en tijd gegeven aan de respondenten, waardoor de meting een effect van Systeem 2 laat zien. Dit heeft er vermoedelijk toe geleid dat er geen effect is gevonden van de aanwezigheid van cijfers op betrouwbaarheid.","['journalism', 'numbers', 'credibility', 'reliability', 'experiment']"
"Normative or Market Power Europe? The Promotion of Labour Standards in Bilateral Trade Agreements of the European Union with South-Korea, Colombia/Peru and Vietnam","Dijkstra, Jeroen Matthijs","['Trojan, Carlo']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The European Union (EU) increasingly sees, presents and praises itself as a normative power in its foreign relations. In the realm of external trade policy, the alleged normative identity manifests itself in the promotion of social and environmental norms alongside trade liberalization. Within the literature on EU trade policy, there have been several reasons put forward to explain this phenomenon, which either perceive the EU as a Normative Power (NPE) or a Market Power (MPE) at its core. Although these two theories are often used as a conceptual framework to understand the normative dimension of EU trade policy, they have rarely been tested on their explanatory power. This paper aims to fill this lacuna in the literature by analysing the extent to which EU has acted as a NPE or a MPE in the promotion of labour standards in its bilateral trade agreements with South-Korea, Colombia/Peru and Vietnam. It will be argued that the NPE and MPE theory both fail to adequately explain the way in which labour standards have been promoted through the three trade agreements and brings forward the collusive delegation argument to explain how the Commission has managed to stay relatively immune from normative and market power interests and promoted its own specific agenda concerning the topic instead.","['EU trade policy', 'EU-Vietnam', 'EU-Korea', 'EU-Colombia/Peru', 'free trade agreements', 'Normative Power Europe', 'Market Power Europe']"

J'accuse...: Henri-Georges Clouzot's Judging of Morality in La Vérité,"Heidenrath, Ingrid","['Verstraten, P.W.J.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this thesis is to examine Henri-Georges Clouzot’s questioning of French morality in La Vérité (1960). La Vérité, which translates as The Truth, is not merely a courtroom drama about a crime passionnel; a closer look reveals that this film directed by Clouzot does not aim to judge its accused; instead, it is society’s morality that is put on trial. Viewing La Vérité resembles being prosecuted for lack of self-reflection. Clouzot holds up a mirror to the audience who are helplessly subjected to witnessing how Dominque Marceau becomes entangled deeper and deeper in a web of moral prejudice and prejudgement, only to realise that the spider is not solely the président des assises, nor the jury; it is primarily the observer who is responsible for Marceau’s predicament. In short, the truth seems susceptible to moral standards, but how, then, is the truth in fact true? And, moreover, how can truth and justice be compatible when morality interferes? Obscured by a dramatic veil of passion and beauty, these are questions that Clouzot presents his 1960s French audience and, although it was over fifty years ago, these are still very relevant questions to address. By means of his inconclusive subtlety, Clouzot asks for an active-reflexive commitment to his pursuit and he expects the viewer to put in effort and contribute by taking a standpoint through active reasoning and reflective thinking. Although engaging and innovative, La Vérité leaves a bitter taste as the ending is disquieting to an audience who accept the mirror that Clouzot is handing and take a close and honest look at its reflection.","['Henri-Georges Clouzot', '(French) film/ cinema', 'La Verite', 'morality', 'crime of passion', 'French legal system', 'truth', 'justice']"

Rhetorical Retrospect: Translation Procedures in the Video Game Lufia,"Vos, Christian de","['Dorst, A.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this thesis is to explore the translation procedures used in the localisation of video games. After reviewing existing literature on video game translation, which reveals that it requires different translation techniques, a new translation model is created and used to analyse Lufia, a role-playing game released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995. The empirical part of this study is conducted by means of a contrastive analysis between the North American version and the Dutch localisation of Lufia. The results show that the literal translation procedure is by far the most predominant technique and they therefore do not support the expectation that the video game was mainly translated creatively, as transcreation was used to a much lesser extent than originally hypothesised. In conclusion, even though video game translation requires translators to demonstrate a certain degree of creativity in their translations, adopting the literal approach remains most predominant.","['Transcreation', 'Translation procedures', 'Video games', 'Diegesis', 'Audiovisual translation', 'Video game localisation', 'Restricted translation']"

Pragmatics at work: Looking through the lens of shared intentionality,"Doi, Huong Anh","['Boogaart, R.J.U.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Pragmatic processing has always been an interesting topic which could shed light on perhaps one of the most intriguing phenomena of human beings, that of communication. In my thesis, pragmatic processing will be examined through an ‘outsider’ lens, that of ‘shared intentionality’. The notion of ‘shared intentionality’ (or collective intentionality) has been developed and studied within the realm of philosophy of action (Chant et. al, 2014: 1). A joint act between two or more agents is upheld by an infrastructure of ‘shared intentionality’, which imposes mutual commitment, support, and obligation from all agents in pursuit of a common goal. Communication, viewed as a joint act (Clark, 1996), might surely be examined through the lens of ‘shared intentionality’. The central idea focuses on how ‘shared intentionality’, subserving as the psychological infrastructure, accounts for pragmatic processing in communicative acts. Within the course of pragmatic processing, I would propose and argue that shared intentionality works side by side with the main pragmatic theories in helping both interlocutors reach the ultimate shared goal of the joint communicative act: that of the hearer arriving at the intended meaning by the speaker.","['Pragmatics', 'Shared intentionality', 'Collective intentionality', 'Speech act theory', 'Gricean Cooperative principle']"

The letters give an exceptional insight into the personal lives of men and women from all layers of the population in a time in Dutch history that was marked by almost constant war and the subsequent political, social and economic changes that came with these conflicts. Many of the letters are signed by women, which make the letter collection a rare source, since not many writings have been preserved from women living in this period, especially not from the lower class. For this reason, this edition focuses entirely on the female correspondence of the collection. The letters for this edition were chosen based on their geographic variation in order to give a broad picture not only of the lives of women from Doesburg, but from all over the Netherlands in the regarding period. To place the letters into context, this edition includes: an overview of the history of the Netherlands and Doesburg in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, of reading and writing in the Low Countries, of the position of women in the Netherlands, and provides a sketch of the Dutch postal system between 1777-1822.","['Doesburg', 'women', 'eighteenth century', 'nineteenth century', 'letters', 'Dutch Republic', 'postal system']"

Democracy and the Web: A New Player in the Field of Democratizing Politics?,"Gameren, Floortje van","['Weel, van der']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The invention of the Web has influenced the world drastically. Talking in real-time to someone on the other side of the planet is no longer an issue. Also, consuming information has become a lot easier and quicker; think about checking the weather or the news while you are waiting at the bus stop. Network technology has affected almost every part of our lives and therefore, expectations are high when it comes to what the Web can do more. Evidence are the many claims about the Web being a democratizing force in the case of politics for instance. The main question in this thesis is: To what extent does the Web as a thoroughly ‘democratic’ medium with its two-way traffic, helps the exchange of knowledge and thus is contributing to a democratic system in politics as much as its formal characteristics appear to promise? To answer this main question, this thesis will treat several questions first: What does a 'democratizing force' mean? And: What does it mean when someone claims the Web to be a democratizing force? With help from recent case studies, news articles and research in the field of new media, I tried to find answers to these questions.","['Web', 'Social media', 'Politics', 'Web 2.0', 'Democracy']"
"Why appeared in Spain Podemos, a populist party maintaining a radical left-wing perspective?","Hoogeveen, Quirine","['Heyer, Anne']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Populism in ideological sense focuses on the division within society between the common citizen who are opposing the elite. The common people disagree with the elite as they think that the elite are only acting after their own interest. A political party family that avail themselves of this populist outlook is the populist radical right, which has made a firm presence in the political arena of Western Europe since the 1990s. However, a country that is absent in this particular party family is Spain. Since the 1990s no populist radical right party has gained popularity in Spain. Moreover, in 2014 Podemos was established, a populist party maintaining a radical left-wing perspective. This thesis focuses on the question why in Spain a populist party with a radical left-wing outlook appeared, while in other countries in Western Europe the populist radical right party family has been evidently present. This thesis emphasizes the essential differences between left and right-wing populism when applying the theoretical framework of demand and supply factors to the Spanish citizens and Podemos, at the time the political party arose. This thesis states that at the time Podemos made their appearance there was a demand visible among the Spanish citizens for a left-wing populist party. Additionally, a part of the political preference for Podemos were based on these demands. Finally, regarding the way Podemos responded to the demand, i.e. the supply factor, the focus on political communication by the initiators of Podemos is highlighted.","['Podemos', 'left-wing populism', 'Spain']"

Russian-Dutch Relations: Business as Unusual,"Eilander, Nathan","['Frear, Matthew']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Dutch and Russian governments are not clear on what the deterioration in relations since 2014 means and how the relations changed. This study examines how relations have developed over the period 2013-2015, as reflected in both the phraseology used and topics discussed in the published communiqués. It gives a detailed account of the developments in relations, looking at separate topics and the general trend in relations. In order to analyse the separate issues and the general trend, each communiqué and its issues are analysed and are allocated a value. The values range from ‘-2’ (very negative) to ‘+2’ (very positive). The value assesses how both countries talk about each other. It is assessed as being ‘positive’ when it contributes to building a constructive partnership and ‘negative’ when it damages such a partnership. The study concludes that the different issues of the Russian-Dutch relations developed separately from each other, but the general trend was that the statements on each other deteriorated after Crimea’s incorporation and the downing of MH17. These two events resulted in more negative communications on each other, because the Netherlands increasingly saw Russia as a threat to the EU’s neighbourhood and its own security, and therefore the focus returned to the primary national interest to ensure the safety of the state and its citizens.","['Russia', 'Netherlands', 'Bilateral relations', 'Communiqués', 'Security', 'Trade', 'Human rights']"

The first chapter looks into the specific agency of montage that is being used in the work Let ́s be honest the weather helped. A transformative relationship between hiding and affirming is established here, which produces 'potentiality'. In a second step, I will analyse how the subjective nature of history writing is revealed by works in The Atlas Group. The theories of Hayden White will serve as a basis for this chapter. Jalal Toufic ́s concept of the withdrawal of tradition will provide a fundament the second section of this chapter as White and Toufic are going to be put in dialogue. Toufic argues that objects and documents happen to be 'withdrawn' after traumatic events - a unconventional notion that also is reverberating in some pieces by Walid Raad. Thirdly, authority and authorship will serve as two anchor points for further observations as these two are interdependent and integral to the questions, which The Atlas Group is raising. Fourthly, I will analyse how not only the incapability of the document to record 'the decisive' moment is revealed, but also how allusions to this imperceptible instance are being made - an interview Jean Francois Lyotard and Alain Pomarède will enable deeper understanding of these observations.","['Lebanon', 'Contemporary Art', 'Photography', 'Lebanese Civil War', 'The Atlas Group', 'Walid Raad', 'Archive']"

Reading has become a shared experience, and book marketing can be further advanced through an interactive bond publishers establish with readers. As experience goods and recreational products, books requires a tailored marketing approach that is ideally customized even further in regard of the different markets targeted by individual titles. Libraries stimulate book borrowing by connecting with readers and encouraging the act of reading, and publishers can do the same. Reading promotion adds to the appeal of buying books in general: by promoting reading besides individual titles, and through collaborating with other stakeholders and pooling resources, publishers are collectively able to cover a wide field of book promotion that eventually benefits individual sales as well.","['book marketing', 'trade publishing', 'reading promotion', 'consumer decision journey', 'reading culture', 'author branding', 'bestseller culture', 'social media', 'digital media', 'consumer behaviour', 'customer relationship management', 'community building', 'reading communities', 'loyalty marketing']"

Leugentjes om bestwil en verdraaide feiten. Een onderzoek naar de argumentatie in het vluchtelingendebat,"Koene, Cindy","['Jansen, Henrike']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Neerlandistiek (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het doel van dit onderzoek is het maken van een overzicht van de voor- en tegenargumenten in het vluchtelingendebat in de Nederlandse dag- en opiniebladen, De Volkskrant, De Telegraaf, Elsevier en De Groene Amsterdammer, in de periode 26 september 2015 tot en met 26 december 2015. De aanleiding hiervoor is de meta-discussie waarin kritisch gekeken wordt naar de argumentatie in het vluchtelingendebat. De discussiebijdragen zouden bestaan uit ‘leugentjes om bestwil’, ‘verdraaide feiten’ en ‘vergelijkingen van appels met peren’. Deze meta-discussie richt zich dus op de mate van redelijkheid van de discussiebijdragen, terwijl een duidelijk overzicht van de inhoudelijke argumenten ontbreekt. Dit overzicht geef ik in de vorm van een Argumentenkaart aan de hand waarvan ik voor de meest voorkomende argumentatietypen bepaal welke drogredenen daadwerkelijk voorkomen. Met behulp van de terminologie van de pragma-dialectiek wordt van probleemoplossend domein en het doel delibereren, via het actietype publiek debat in de massamedia ingezoomd op het concrete speech event vluchtelingendebat in de dag- en weekbladen van 26 september 2015 tot en met 26 december 2015. Ondanks dat het vluchtelingendebat als een polyloog, een discussie tussen meerdere deelnemers, kan worden bestempeld, wordt in dit onderzoek gebruik gemaakt van de pragma-dialectische analysemethode, omdat het doel van dit onderzoek verschilt van het doel van de polylogische aanpak en omdat voor deze laatste aanpak nog geen duidelijke methode bestaat. Een aspect uit de polylogische aanpak dat wel gebruikt wordt voor dit onderzoek is het nemen van de open kwestie als uitgangspunt, geïntroduceerd door een ‘w-vraag’: ‘Wat zijn de argumenten voor en tegen het binnenlaten van vluchtelingen in Nederland?’. De pragma-dialectische analyse wordt aangevuld met de werkwijze en inzichten van de Argumentenfabriek. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat vaagheid een alomtegenwoordig probleem is in de argumentatie in het vluchtelingendebat. Het is in veel gevallen onduidelijk wat de discussiant precies bedoelt, doordat terminologie en subargumenten niet worden gespecificeerd. De vage formuleringen brengen bovendien met zich mee dat bepaalde tegengestelde argumenten inhoudelijk gezien gerelateerd zijn. Uit de inventarisatie van de argumenten komt verder naar voren dat pragmatische en vergelijkingsargumenten het meeste voorkomen. De mogelijke ontsporingen van deze argumentatieschema’s, respectievelijk de drogreden van het hellend vlak en de valse vergelijking, ontstaan doordat de kritische vragen niet naar tevredenheid kunnen worden beantwoord door de vage formuleringen.","['pragma-dialectiek', 'polyloog', 'polylogical analysis', 'argumentenfabriek', 'argumentenkaart', 'publiek debat', 'strategisch manoeuvreren met vaagheid']"

The Haptic Photograph and the Embodied Viewer,"Blokhuizen, M.M.T.","['Westgeest, H.F.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Many scholars have developed theories in the field of affect studies regarding the moving and the still image. Laura Marks is one of the scholars who has defined haptic visuality as an embodied way of looking at the moving image. Her definition evolves around the equal relationship between the viewer and the image that is based on equality. The embodied viewer that uses her senses in making meaning of the photograph are a result of the visual characteristics of the image. In this thesis I have compared the moving and the still image with the result of finding out how some medium specific qualities create a similar haptic image. Moreover, I have included the materiality of the photograph and its spatial conditions as influential factors in stimulating the haptic experience of the photograph. The haptic experience of some images has been defined in accordance with Marks, but also regarding the affective response as a result of the personal relationship between the viewer and the family photograph. This thesis aims to examine how some qualities of photography create a haptic image, by incorporating the visual characteristics, materiality and spatial conditions of the selected art works.","['photography', 'haptic image', 'embodied viewer']"
Italy’s response to boat migrants from Albania in the 1990’s and Libya in the 2000’s compared,"Bonica, Matteo","['Glynn, Irial']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis compares the Italian reception of boat migrants from Albania in the 1900’s and Libya in the 2000’s.

The purpose is to understand how Italy reacted to the various cases and why the strategies implemented by the various governments at diverse moments of history were so different. The second, but definitely no less important objective of this thesis, is to test whether or not the gap hypothesis could be applied to Italy’s policies towards boat migrants. By doing so, this thesis could shed new light on whether there was a possible gap in the outcome of the policies implemented during the various years by Italy due to European influence. The hypothesis is that there could be a gap caused by the increasingly more powerful EU and European Court of Human Rights of Strasbourg in the field of migration policy implementation, a policy field historically strongly bonded with state sovereignty.","['Migrations', 'Italy', 'Libya', 'Albania', 'Boat migrations', 'Boat people', 'European Union', 'Ngo', 'Push backs', 'Gap hypotesis']"

Regional Security Structures: A Comparison of Counter- Terrorism Methods of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the African Union,"Bilsen, Bob van","['Wang, Z.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The theory on (security) regionalism has shown that both the SCO and AU are considered to be part of ‘weak state IO’s’, which was proven through the variables put forward by Kelly. Both the SCO and AU strengthen sovereignty by turning the security dilemma inwards, so as to handle the issue themselves, with varying degrees of success. However, the AU is susceptible to intervention from above or from one of its members, if the situation is deemed sufficiently worrying and ‘grave circumstances’ have been observed. The relationships between the individual states and their regional organisations are significantly different, due to their own power projection capabilities. China’s power projection capability is the second largest in the world and will continue to improve, as military spending will increase. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s socio-economic and governance issues have been obstacles in acquiring sufficient growth and thus projecting power. This was also shown in the case study and the government’s approach to handling the issue, eventually leading to the formation of the MNJTF together with its mandate to defeat Boko Haram. By imposing hard-hitting measures on the region, China is able to keep terrorist attacks inside the country to a minimum, while allowing law enforcement agencies to catch-up with the terrorists. This is exactly how the CT theory was explained in theory and thus proves its efficacy in action. The African Union’s military approach has emerged through the lack of control Nigeria’s government has over its territory and lack of effective law enforcement measures. As Boko Haram spread across borders, a multinational task force was established to combat the group. It shows that the framework to combat terrorism established by the SCO RATS has a more effective approach. However, due to the nature of these autocratic regimes and the tendency of elites in these regimes to use the regional security organisations for the purpose of promoting their “collective internal security”, the chance remains high for abuses of power, suppression of minorities and human rights abuses. This is what the thesis found for the situation in China; with the contested designation of ETIM as a terrorist organization, and ‘loose’ framework in SCO RATS to designate all unwanted ‘activities’ as terrorism. Although it has proven significantly effective, the provisions in the SCO RATS are at times vague such as ‘preventive measures’, which could be used to manipulate or even infringe upon basic human rights. Therefore, this paper would recommend to implement a regional oversight committee, including neutral UN observers which would provide checks and balances on the military (hard) and law enforcement (soft) measures. This seems highly unlikely, China’s capabilities have proven to be effective in getting international recognition but handling the issue discreetly by itself. Therefore, for China or other SCO members to ask for outsiders to join contradicts the essence of what the SCO is in the eyes of China, a way to gain international legitimacy and recognition, but also a way to keep external influence out of the region and letting them handle the problem by their own.","['Counter-Terrorism', 'Regionalism', 'P.R.

It presents a grammar of humor for comedians who wish to copy his style of comedy. It aims to find out whether written and spoken humorous language adheres to humor theories as proposed by Walter Nash and Salvatore Attardo. The questions whether Carlin was a typical American comedian and whether the figurative language he uses adds to the persuasiveness of his message are answered by a discussion of Nash and Attardo’s theories, a discussion of the iconic features of American humor, and a figurative language research adhering to the MIP and MIPVU methods of metaphor research and Nash and Attardo’s figurative language theories. Carlin deviates from the American humor standard and uses a considerable amount of figurative language in his writings and stand-up material. This thesis shows that this language adds to the persuasiveness of the underlying message. Ultimately, this thesis explains the importance of humor in everyday life.",

Biological individuality will be shown to be a speci c member of the category of individuality and a notion best interpreted as a relative concept which is hierarchically structured by interrelated nested entities. A speci c interpretation of entropy will be described as a statistical notion in which entropy is able to locally increase order as a stable dynamic kinetic state in a closed system. The rise of complex organization will be something that can be explained scienti cally but is interpreted as a predominant emergentist property. In this thesis, I argue that life emerges as a property rising from within the organization of a compartmentalized entity that is able to locally decrease its entropy due to a self-replicating autocatalytic web that jumped into existence. Biological individuality and entropy both relate to a base level of complexity and start to meet at the lowest level of organization. I argue that living biological individuals are not substrate neutral implying life in silico will always be fundamentally di erent from biological life.","['Biological Individuality', 'Entropy', 'Life', 'Emergent Property', 'Autocatalysis']"

Case studies of Hans Eijkelboom, Jimmy Nelson and Shadi Ghadirian.","Troost, Anne","['Westgeest, H.F.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"As we are living in a globalizing world, the local is defined by the global and the global by the local. There is a constant fluid connection between these paradoxes and artists from all over the world are responding to this interplay. A lot of contemporary photographers deal with issues that arise around the visualization of cultural identity. Photography appears in many different forms, for instance true to life or arranged on forehand or afterwards, though photography is by many still seen as pre-eminent a medium that shows the viewer a reproduction of reality. This research focuses on the visualization of cultural identity through arranged photography as photography is becoming more and more a construction, and these constructions provide other angles towards this visualization. This study aims to contribute to the recent debates, concerning contemporary photography, cultural identity and the portrayal of the contemporary human being by investigating the different ways in which cultural identity is being visualized in the works of Hans Eijkelboom, Jimmy Nelson and Shadi Ghadirian.","['cultural identity', 'contemporary photography', 'postmodern representation']"
What is wrong with institutional corruption. A philosophical investigation into the moral foundation of modern institutions,"Tycho, Prins","['Fossen, Thomas']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Institutional corruption is a prevalent issue in many societies. Institutional corruption can harm the solidarity that is vital to a society. However, institutional corruption is underdeveloped as a concept. The main reason is that it lacks a proper moral foundation. A clear moral foundation is necessary in order to identify and effectively address institutional corruption. In this research, I ask what the moral foundation of institutions is and how we can form a proper moral judgement about institutional functioning. To answer this question, I firstly review several concepts of corruption that are dominant in academic literature. Secondly, I discuss with institutional theory what is ‘institutional’ about institutional corruption. This includes a discussion about what is institutional legitimacy. Thirdly, I discuss what is ‘corruptive’ about institutional corruption. I formulate a proper moral foundation for institutional functioning in a Kantian and Habermassian tradition. Within these traditions, a proper way of judging institutional functioning from a moral perspective emerges. Finally, with the moral foundation and the method for judging institutional corruption, I present a clear concept of institutional corruption.","['Institution', 'Corruption', 'Moral foundation', 'Legitimacy', 'Modern institution', 'Public trust', 'Trustworthiness', 'Institutional', 'Integrity', 'Moral principles']"

"""We Should Rule"": Empowering Women in History's Vikings","Griffijn, Emma","['Porck, M.H.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In History’s Vikings (2013-), the writer Michael Hirst wants to show the female empowerment of women in Viking culture and how this empowerment differs from women in medieval Christian culture. This thesis first considers the medieval source material that Hirst adapted. This thesis analyses the characterisation of Lagertha (in the Saxo Grammaticus’ Gesta Danorum) and Aslaug (in Ragnars saga Loðbrókar) and compares their portrayals with the idea of the medieval woman described by Eileen Power and Carolyne Larrington. Following this analysis, this thesis provides a close-reading of the first three seasons of Vikings and looks at the Viking female characters, subdivided into three groups: the warrior woman who wishes to become equal to men (Lagertha), the wife who desires independence (Aslaug) and the woman who wants power and uses manipulation to obtain this (Siggy). Secondly, this thesis analyses the empowerment of the Christian women (Judith, Kwenthrith and Gisla) and demonstrates how religion and social customs pose obstacles to their empowerment. Consequently, this thesis demonstrates that the creators of Vikings try to focus on the strong Viking female characters and give them more agency, which is juxtaposed to the Christian women who cannot achieve the same level of empowerment.","['Vikings', 'Women empowerment', 'Middle Ages']"

De rol van social media-richtlijnen bij Nederlandse regionale omroepen,"Jonkers, Jeroen","['Jong, J.C. de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Social media worden steeds meer gebruikt om het nieuws te brengen, een ontwikkeling die in het verleden soms voor problemen heeft gezorgd. Onhandige uitingen op social media waren in het verleden aanleiding tot het opstellen van social media-richtlijnen bij verschillende internationale omroepen. Verschillende studies hebben zich in het verleden gebogen over de social media-richtlijnen van internationale organisaties, waaronder Opgenhaffen en d’Haenens (2015), Lee (2016) en Bloom, Cleary en North (2015). Deze studies deden onderzoek naar de social media-richtlijnen van internationale organisaties, maar onderzoek onder Nederlandse omroepen was vooralsnog niet uitgevoerd. Ook regionale omroepen werden nog altijd genegeerd, terwijl onderzoek aantoont dat deze omroepen een grote informatiebron zijn voor veel mensen (Lee, 2013). Deze thesis draagt bij aan de wetenschappelijke discussies over social mediarichtlijnen en richt zich daarbij specifiek op de Nederlandse regionale omroepen. Er is geprobeerd een antwoord te formuleren op drie hoofdvragen: Welke social media-richtlijnen hebben Nederlandse regionale omroepen concreet opgesteld? Wat vinden journalisten van de regionale omroepen van social media-richtlijnen? En lijken universele richtlijnen wenselijk op basis van de uitkomsten van de eerste twee onderzoeksvragen? Er is geprobeerd een antwoord te formuleren op deze drie vragen aan de hand van kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethoden, namelijk een inhoudsanalyse in combinatie met diepte-interviews. Voor de inhoudsanalyse zijn vijf documenten met social media-richtlijnen van Nederlandse regionale omroepen gecodeerd aan de hand van drie sensitizing concepts, namelijk objectief (persoonlijk) gebruik, transparantie en gatekeeping. Twee diepte-interviews boden achtergrondinformatie over hoe er op de werkvloer omgegaan wordt met social media en daarnaast werd inzicht geboden in de meningen van journalisten op het gebied van richtlijnen voor social media. De resultaten tonen aan dat Nederlandse regionale omroepen net als internationale organisaties meerdere richtlijnen hebben geformuleerd op het gebied van objectiviteit, transparantie en gatekeeping. Wel bleken de richtlijnen van Nederlandse regionale omroepen in tegenstelling tot de richtlijnen van internationale organisaties overwegend positief en uitnodigend geformuleerd. Op basis van de resultaten van dit onderzoek is het lastig om waterdichte conclusies te trekken over de mogelijkheid tot het opstellen van universele richtlijnen. Echter, overlap in inhoud en zelfs letterlijk gekopieerde richtlijnen tussen organisaties suggereren enig draagvlak voor een universeel basismodel. Een beknopt basismodel wordt in deze thesis gepresenteerd.","['Social media', 'Richtlijnen', 'Objectiviteit', 'Transparantie', 'Gatekeeping', 'Regionale omroepen']"
What are the pull factors of migration? Evidence from the Central Mediterranean Route (2011-2016),"Gerritsen, Irene","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Migration in the Central Mediterranean is not a new development, but in the period between 2011 and 2016, the number of migrant arrivals in Italy has significantly increased. The central question in this thesis is: What are the pull factors of migration? Why do migrants increasingly choose to migrate towards the EU? The basis is the theory of Ravenstein of push and pull factors to explain migration. In this thesis, I identified several developments in the Central Mediterranean during this period and analysed the different variables. These variables are: governmental missions in the Mediterranean, the movement of NGOs involved in search and rescue operations and the EU-Turkey agreement. After a method of process tracing and interviews, the conclusion was that pull factors are less important in the process of decision-making of migrants than is mostly considered. Most migrants are more influenced by push factors.The invasion towards the European Union is a myth and their rescue missions in the Mediterranean do not influence migrants or attract huge numbers of them.","['Migration', 'Migration Crisis', 'Pull Factors', 'European Union']"

Democracy promotion and stability in Egypt and Tunisia: Discursive configurations of the European Neighbourhood Policy after the Arab uprisings,"Mari, Antoine","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to interrogate the response of the European Union to the events known as the Arab uprisings, with a particular focus on the political transitions experienced by Egypt and Tunisia since early 2011. It conducts a thorough textual analysis of major European Neighbourhood Policy documents and ‘speech acts’ related to Egypt and Tunisia, using Norman Fairclough’s three- dimensional Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). In each instance of ENP discourse, this study sees a text, a discursive practice and a social practice. It identifies the particular discursive configurations of democracy promotion in these text samples, noting a significant change in tone since the launch of the ENP in 2003. More specifically, it points to the new neighbourhood agenda developed by the EU since the wave of protests in the Middle-East and North Africa, characterised by greater ownership of ENP policies by EU partners, considerable differentiation in their objectives and a heightened concern for the stabilisation of the region. Rooted in a critical, constructivist approach to discourse analysis, it eventually contends that the seemingly less voluntarist narrative developed in South Neighbourhood policy documents is the result of higher threat perception in the Union. A threat narrative is indeed highlighted, as a particular instance of a crisis rhetoric, resulting in a notable downscaling of EU normative ambitions in the region. Investigation of the Egyptian and Tunisian cases since 2011 provides important information regarding these developments in the ENP. This thesis eventually points to civil society assistance as a narrative of inclusiveness which could prove to be a significant addition to ENP democracy promotion agenda, while recognising the limits of this endeavour.","['European Union', 'Egypt', 'Tunisia', 'European Neighbourhood Policy', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Differentiation', 'Stabilisation', 'Crisis', 'Narrative', 'Discursive configurations']"

In the Netherlands and Suriname, the official language and the legal language is Dutch. However, there are differences in the Dutch used in these countries. The legal systems of the Netherlands and Suriname have gone their own way since 1975. This is expected to show in the Legal Dutch of both countries. This research investigates how the Legal Dutch of Suriname and the Netherlands, respectively, have developed. The aim of this study is to compare the legal language of these two legal systems and detect differences in the usage of Dutch legal language. As claimed by Marckwardt in 1958, (post)colonial varieties of a language change less than the variety spoken in the (former) mother country. This theory is referred to as the ‘colonial lag’. This research will be limited to criminal law. Within this area of law, legal texts will be compared. The expected outcome is that Surinamese Legal Dutch will be more conservative than the Legal Dutch in the Netherlands.","['Colonial Lag', 'Criminal law', 'Formality', 'Legal Language', 'Surinamese Dutch', 'Standard Dutch', 'Linguistic Conservatism', 'Archaism', 'Judgments']"
Kritisch prikken: een framinganalyse van Nederlandse nieuwsberichten en online forumdiscussies over de HPV-vaccinatie,"Voert, Iris te","['Burger, J.P.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te onderzoeken of de manier waarop meisjes en hun moeders online met elkaar communiceren over de HPV-vaccinatie verschilt met wat er in nieuwsmedia over het onderwerp wordt geschreven. Dit wordt gedaan aan de hand van een framinganalyse van zowel nieuwsberichten als forumberichten op het vernaculaire web. Het onderzoeksmateriaal bestaat uit twee discussieforums van zowel de site Girlscene als Viva en nieuwsberichten afkomstig van nationale Nederlandse bladen. De analyse heeft in totaal tot zeven frames geleid. Op de discussieforums van Viva werd het vooruitgangsframe, het proefkonijnenframe, het utilitaristische frame en het anti-risicoframe gevonden. Op de forums van Girlscene werd daarnaast ook nog twee andere frames aangetroffen: het anti medische frame en het individualistische frame. In de krantenberichten werd alleen het vooruitgangsframe, het anti-risicoframe, het utilitaristische frame en daarnaast nog een ander frame, namelijk het twee kwaden frame gevonden. Gesteld kan worden dat er sprake is van een afstand tussen het vernaculaire en institutionele discours. Forumgebruikers leggen de verantwoordelijkheid grotendeels bij het individu, terwijl journalisten in krantenberichten deze eerder bij instanties of groepen leggen. De invloed van de leek op het maken van de goede beslissing, wordt nauwelijks besproken in de nieuwsmedia. In plaats daarvan kiezen journalisten hoofdzakelijk voor officiële bronnen en hierdoor is sprake van eenzijdig brongebruik. Ook komen frames die wel in forumdiscussies naar voren komen niet naar voren in krantenberichten. Geconcludeerd kan dan ook worden dat de nieuwsmedia geen goede afspiegeling geven van hoe er over de HPV-vaccinatie wordt gedacht.","['HPV', 'vaccinatie', 'framinganalyse', 'framing', 'vernaculair', 'discussieforums', 'vernaculaire web', 'Viva', 'Girlscene', 'baarmoederhalskanker', 'HPV-vaccinatie']"

In de historiografie wordt veel aandacht besteed aan politieke ontwikkelingen en de geweldsmisdrijven die tijdens deze koloniale oorlog plaats vonden, maar nauwelijks aan de logistieke problemen waarvoor de Nederlandse regering stond om deze grote troepenmacht naar de andere kant van de aarde te transporteren. Met betrekking tot het troepentransport naar en Indonesië zijn er drie verschillende perioden te onderscheiden. Tot aan maart 1946 was de regering afhankelijk van de Engels/Amerikaanse Combined Chiefs of Staff, die de operationele inzetbaarheid van de tijdens de oorlog gevorderde troepentransportschepen bepaalden. Tussen maart 1946 en de soevereiniteitsoverdracht (27 december 1949) maakte de regering weliswaar een eind aan bezitsvordering, maar legden aan de reders de verplichting op hun schepen aan de regering te verhuren. Na de soevereiniteitsoverdracht moesten de Nederlandse troepen Indonesië binnen een half jaar verlaten hebben. Om dit mogelijk te maken moesten er vele buitenlandse schepen gehuurd worden. Deze transporten werden mogelijk doordat er tenminste tweemaal sprake was van een window of opportunity: in maart 1946 waren bijna alle Nederlandse passagiersschepen ingericht voor massavervoer en in 1950-1951 kon de regering door de op gang gekomen emigratiestroom naar Australië gemakkelijk extra scheepsruimte huren. De aankoop van Amerikaanse troepentransportschepen in 1946 zorgde daarnaast voor een verlichting van de druk op de scheepvaartmaatschappijen.",['Troepentransport – Indonesië – militair-civiele samenwerking - dekolonisatie']

De Groot koos voor een autonome koers, dit was een nieuwe wending in de geschiedenis van de Nederlandse communistische partij. Eén persoon uit het dagelijks bestuur ging hier niet in mee en bleef trouw aan de Sovjet-Unie: Friedel Baruch. Friedel Baruch stond niet achter deze interpretatie van ‘het principe van autonomie’ waar de CPN zich op beriep en beschuldigde de partij van antisovjetisme. Volgens Baruch is ‘het wezen van een communistische partij haar verbondenheid met de wereldbeweging van het communisme en de CPN-leiding heeft er mee gebroken. ‘Een afzonderlijk “Nederlands” Marxisme-Leninisme bestaat zomin als een afzonderlijk Russisch of Chinees Marxisme-Leninisme bestaat, - het is een contradictio in terminis.’ Een antwoord op de vraag waarom Baruch een oppositie vormde lijkt misschien zo gegeven; Baruch geloofde niet in een nationale vorm van communisme, de eigen weg bestond volgens hem niet omdat het communisme een internationalistische ideologie is. Dit onderzoek gaat verder en richt zich vooral op de politieke cultuur van de CPN. Want na wat meer onderzoek blijkt dat er veel meer aan de hand was dan een theoretisch meningsverschil en dat het meningsverschil al snel uitliep op een politieke karaktermoord. Om antwoord te geven op de vraag waarom het conflict de vorm aannam die het deed moet er worden gekeken naar de politieke cultuur van de CPN. Daarom is de hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek: wat kunnen we leren over de politieke cultuur van de CPN aan de hand van de kwestie Baruch?",

How Can Actor-Network Theory Assist in Rethinking Approaches to Banning or Restricting Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems?,"Gianni, Nicolas","['Gawthorpe, Andrew']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The development of A.I. systems and robotics in recent years has lead to increased concerns over how such technology will be utilized in war. Specifically, Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS), designed to survey, recognise, target and eliminate, are highly controversial in that they have the potential to operate completely independent of human control or interference. While currently not in use, it potentially contradicts International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and has stimulated discussions over implementing restrictions or banning its use entirely. However, there remains a number of challenges in addressing the conceptualisation of LAWS, as well as how they will be used in the future. This essay attempts to tackle the current predicaments facing the political debates on LAWS by examining how weapons technology contains an element of agency which influences its development and use. Through Actor-Network theory, its role as an assemblage of various human and non-human parts can shed light on how its status and representation in the political debate is fluid and more complex than what it initially seems.",
Politically biased language A Study of Politically bias in English and Dutch Daily Newspapers,"Oorthuis, Natasja","['Foster, A.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The term political correctness or being politically correct has been gaining more and more popularity the past twenty years and a lot of authors have written books about this subject (Conboy). Yet, there does not seem to be any research on politically biased language and how this manifests itself in newspapers. Although there are books such as Jane Jackson’s Introducing language and intercultural communication and Carter & Nash’s Seeing through Language that talk about biased language there is no specific data to be found concerning politically biased language. Most research found focuses on politically correctness and on its use in campus newspapers such as Julie Hill Caldwell’s Campus speech codes: what ever happened to the 'sticks and stones' doctrine?, John Leo’s ""political correctness"" on campus, or fiction novels as in Gerald Cross’s Editors on Editing: What Writers Need to Know about what Editors Do. My method for this bachelor thesis will be corpus research. I will compare politically biased language use in English and Dutch newspaper articles by making use of corpus study. Specifically, I will attempt to compare, both quantitatively and qualitatively (topics, lexical and grammatical features), the use of politically biased language as well as typography in right-wing versus left-wing national English and Dutch daily newspapers, and for qualities versus populars. I expect to find a big difference in the use of politically biased language and biased methods used in both these countries newspapers. I also predict that UK daily newspapers will make use of far more politically biased language than the Dutch ones, “as English newspapers tend to be more explicit in their expression of political affiliation” (Oakland 236).","['politically biased language', 'dutch newspapers', 'english newspapers', 'politically bias']"

Alone Together: a Tactful Reading of Virginia Woolf’s The Waves and Ali Smith’s How to be Both,"Muis, Roos","['Houwen, Janna']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Exploring the intimate links between text and skin, this thesis examines the ways in which Virginia Woolf and Ali Smith approach tactile experience within the touch-transforming contexts from which their novels The Waves (1931) and How to be Both (2014) emerge. Drawing on the first sustained study that investigates literature and tactility since the publication of seminal works on touch by thinkers of deconstruction such as Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy, it looks at the two texts from the perspective of a tactful reading. Engaging with the texts with close attention and from a distance, it argues that tactile experience not only resides in the contact of skin on skin, but also in the space between skin and skin. Looking primarily at how the writers give expression to a touch that transforms and a touch that reaches out both in and through their texts, it also draws attention to the way that memory, the shared thematic concern of the novels, too exhibits moments of change and nearness. Finally, this thesis seeks to open up a discussion on the limits and possibilities of a tactful approach and relates it to the potential it offers to the reading of recent innovative literary projects that respond to some of today’s most poignant issues regarding tactility, digital technology and human connection. Inspired by the astounding and intimate sensory surrounds of Ann Hamilton’s large-scale multi-media installation the event of a thread (2012), it demonstrates an attention to the presence of the tactile, and perhaps most importantly, an attention to the presence of each other.","['Literature', 'Touch', 'Tactility', 'Skin', 'Hapticity', 'Memory', 'Virginia Woolf', 'Ali Smith', 'Technology']"

Media- en maatschappijkritiek als infotainment: Zondag met Lubach als hulphond in het journalistieke landschap,"Veen, Ingeborg","['Hout, Tom van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Satirische nieuwsprogramma’s als The Daily Show en The Colbert Report ontwikkelen zich steeds meer tot belangrijke nieuwsbronnen. Kenmerkend voor dit genre is dat er zowel mediakritiek als politieke kritiek wordt geleverd. Volgens Waisanen (2009) gebruiken deze programma’s hiervoor doorgaans drie retorische strategieën: ‘parodic polyglossia’, ‘contextual clash’ en ‘satirical specificity’. In dit onderzoek is geanalyseerd hoe het Nederlandse satirische nieuwsprogramma Zondag met Lubach (ZML) deze strategieën inzet en welke gevolgen dit heeft voor de manier waarop er in het programma mediakritiek en politieke kritiek wordt geleverd. Hiertoe is het derde seizoen van ZML onderworpen aan een ‘Multimodal Discourse Analysis’. Dit betekent dat de verschillende semiotische elementen die samen betekenis creëren in het programma in kaart zijn gebracht in een ‘codesheet’. Het gaat om de elementen stemgebruik, taalgebruik, visuele betekenisdragers, geluid en intertekstualiteit. Het blijkt dat ZML vooral mediakritiek levert door middel van ‘satirical specificity’, waarbij interactie met mediafragmenten een sleutelrol speelt. Presentator Arjen Lubach voert een dialoog met deze fragmenten, waarbij hij ze ondervraagt en bekritiseert. Deze strategie wordt ondersteund door de ‘parodic polyglossia’-strategie: Lubach zet verschillende stemmetjes op om bijvoorbeeld verslaggevers te imiteren en te bekritiseren. Ook de ‘contextual clash’-strategie is hierbij van belang, doordat situaties worden bekritiseerd door ze te vergelijken met situaties die daar sterk van verschillen. Daarnaast worden kijkers door middel van de ‘instructive interaction’-strategie, die een aanvulling vormt op het werk van Waisanen, aangespoord om zelf verantwoordelijkheid te nemen om kwesties op te lossen. ZML vertoont hiermee neoliberale trekken, aangezien ook binnen het neoliberalisme het individu wordt aangemoedigd om op zijn eigen deskundigheid te vertrouwen en zichzelf autonoom te besturen. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat ZML fungeert als een waakhond van zowel de mediacratie als de democratie, omdat het medialandschap én het politieke veld in de gaten worden gehouden en spelers uit deze disciplines terug worden gefloten wanneer zij de fout ingaan. Ook vervult het programma een hulphond-functie: kijkers die in het overvolle medialandschap de weg kwijt dreigen te raken, worden door ZML geholpen om zich te richten op de belangrijkste ontwikkelingen en om de berichtgeving daarover kritisch te bekijken. Hiermee wordt bijgedragen aan de mediawijsheid van de kijkers.","['Zondag met Lubach', 'Satire', 'Infotainment', 'Late night show']"

An investigation into the extent to which weak or fragile states can incorporate hybrid governance with Non-State Actors as an alternative form of governance.,"Banerjee, Abhishek","['Foulon, Michiel']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The purpose of this thesis is to examine the extent to which hybrid governance structures can be formed between weak or fragile states and non-state actors and how it can result in a challenge to the Mexican and the Jamaican state. This study undertakes this using a literature review, looking at the approach of realism to the topic and two case studies on Mexico and Jamaica. The case studies put the theoretical approaches of the literature review into a real-world context in order to get a complete understanding of the issues at hand. With the ever increasing influence of NSAs in the political system, it is important to understand these actors and how they relate to states that are weak or fragile. By doing so we can see if alternative forms of governance can be made in particularly lawless areas and what, if any, is the realist response. The level of the erosion of state sovereignty is important in influencing the relationship between the state and any NSAs in a hybrid governance structure.",['Thesis']

The British Visiting the Netherlands: Cross-Cultural Communication in Museum Marketing,"Westhoek, Alyssa","['Foster, A.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aimed to determine whether and to what extent the quality of translations can be improved by taking into account differences in cross-cultural discourses and communication. In particular, this thesis researched the quality of translations of Dutch online museum marketing texts into British English and the possibility of improving this quality by using a dimensional model of culture. It was expected that Dutch respondents would favour the original translated text, as it paralleled the original text which was written for a Dutch audience and that British respondents would favour the new translated text, as it was adapted to fit the communicative needs of a British audience. The results of this thesis did not meet the expectations. The choice of translation only significantly differed between nationalities on the dimension long-term orientation. No significant differences were found on the dimensions Tough versus Tender Index and Uncertainty Avoidance Index. Furthermore, both the statistical results and the qualitative survey responses on all dimensions were not as expected. There were some indications that individuals remarked on certain changes in the text, but there was no evidence that supported the hypothesis that Dutch respondents would notice different cultural markers than the British respondents. Overall, the new translated text was preferred over the original translated text (67% said they preferred the new translated text) and the new translated text was, in general, commented on in a more positive way than the original translated text. This means that while the results did not prove that cultural dimensions were a determining factor in choice of translation, the texts that were translated by a professional bilingual translator using systematic translation assessment and a cultural dimensional model were preferred and valued more positively.","['translation', 'cross-cultural tourism', 'museum marketing', 'cultural dimensions']"

Een seksschandaal of de doofpot? De framekeuzes van journalisten bij gecompliceerde politieke schandalen zoals de affaire-Demmink,"Schippers, Ciska","['Jong, J.C. de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In Journalism Studies wordt als belangrijkste taak van een journalist vaak de waakhondfunctie genoemd. Als machthebbers op welke manier dan ook over de schreef gaan hebben journalisten als taak dit te onderzoeken en aan de kaak te stellen. Maar politieke schandalen zijn vaak ingewikkeld. Er kan sprake zijn van meerdere normovertredingen en verschillende transgressies. De media als waakhond moeten hierbij keuzes maken op welke manier ze een normovertreding willen onderzoeken. Op welke manier journalisten ervoor kiezen een bepaald schandaal aan het licht te brengen wordt in deze scriptie onderzocht aan de hand van de affaire-Demmink. Dit is een langslepend en gecompliceerd schandaal waarbij meerdere soorten transgressies door elkaar lopen. Joris Demmink is een oud-topambtenaar van Justitie die al decennialang achtervolgd wordt door beschuldigingen rond kindermisbruik. De hoofdvraag die centraal staat in deze scriptie is: Welke framekeuzes maken media bij gecompliceerde politieke schandalen zoals de affaire-Demmink? Deze affaire wordt door middel van de framinganalyse van Van Gorp onderzocht. Allereerst zijn twee artikelen waarbij eigen onderzoek centraal stond geanalyseerd. Daar zijn door middel van inductieve reconstructie twee frames uit gehaald, het seksschandaal en de doofpot. Daarnaast is er een alternatief frame vormgegeven, namelijk dat Demmink onschuldig is. Vervolgens zijn 92 verschenen artikelen over de beschuldigingen uit grote landelijke kranten aan de hand van een kwantitatieve inhoudsanalyse onderzocht. Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de media terughoudend zijn als het gaat om berichtgeven over complexe schandalen. In de sleutelteksten komt het onschuldframe helemaal niet voor, maar in de teksten die daarna worden behandeld juist verrassend vaak. Vaak wordt er gekozen voor een makkelijk frame, zoals een seksschandaal, en wordt het 'moeilijke' doofpotframe minder benadrukt. Een aanbeveling aan journalisten is om aandacht te blijven besteden aan mogelijke machtschandalen, terwijl het goed is om tegelijkertijd terughoudend over potentiële schandalen te schrijven.","['framing', 'framing analyse', 'waakhondjournalistiek', 'politieke schandalen', 'schandalen']"
Tellhistory - A Theoretical Introduction To The Poietical,"Barberis, Lorenzo","['Korsten, Frans Willem']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The first chapter, entitled “The Narrative”, will provide a short critique to the conventional relationship between word, fact and experience: here will firstly emerge the basilar dualistic frame that governed the problem of narrative by separating the official, general, scientific claim of historiography from the personal, variable and subjective narrative of the individual. This reflection will depart from accounting a double crisis of narrative: the one of experience, which forbids any personal narration to become paradigmatic for other individuals, and the one of scientific discourses, differently carried out by several postmodernist thinkers, that argues the inherently interpretative and therefore subjective status of sciences (among which historiography), which prevents them to reach the claim for universality they pursuit. By trying to find a new configuration that would integrate and to rehabilitate these two narratives, our argument will approach the foucaultian idea of an “history of the present”, the only model that would simultaneously unify the formalization of the past with the constant interpretation promoted by the individuals in the present. The second chapter, named “The Voice”, will examine all the possible reasons according to which the materiality of voice would embody the best tool to carry on the claim for an history of the present: we should say that whereas the first chapter engages the problem of the message, the second discusses the problem of the medium. Accordingly, we will attempt to disentangle the human voice from Derrida’s popular critique of logocentrism, by comparing it with several different models that picture the voice as a collective connecter as well as the only medium capable to give the full dimensions of the human: his feelings, his imaginary, his activity into the real world. The last chapter, which takes the name of “The Community”, departs from the possibility for an heterogeneous group of ‘vocalized individuals’ to constitute a community, namely a group definable according to common parameters. For the voice turns out to be the element which transcends all the particular claims for identity, the essential experience of language will become the fundamental experience of a globalized word. What we will be stressing is that, in this plateau, the language is no longer separable from action: by being configured as an action-in-progress, the respective community cannot be completely defined once for all","['oral history', 'historiography', 'poietical community']"

With the right motives, there will always be questions to raise about historical evidence, which is the exact reason why the history of the Armenian genocide can continue to be questioned. The Turkish state maintains that the deportations and mass-slaughter of Armenians in 1915-6 were not acts of genocide, but rather wartime countermeasures against an insurgent ethnic group. The intent of the Young Turk regime to homogenize Anatolia as part of their Turko-nationalist agenda by means of extermination of Christian minorities has been repeatedly proven in numerous works. These include titles written by Armenians as well as Western and dissident Turkish historians. Despite this overwhelming amount of evidence, the debate rages on and denialists continue to publish new work. This research has attempted to create a more thorough knowledge of their methods of argumentation, which can prove an essential tool in countering their narrative. This thesis is structured around the question to what extent the denial of the Armenian genocide can be labeled as a conspiracy theory or not.","['Denial', 'Armenian', 'genocide', 'conspiracy', 'theory']"

Bringing it all back home,"Linssen, Jolanda","['Schoenmaker, Ben']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"On December 27th 1949, the Netherlands transferred most of the sovereignty to Indonesia after a decolonization-conflict that lasted for more than four years. This meant the end of the Dutch East Indies. The soldiers of the Royal Dutch Army returned home after having lived under extreme conditions in a country that was completely unlike anything they were used to. Over the decades that followed a large number of publications appeared, many of them informal. In these publications the former Dutch soldiers told stories about their migration to the Dutch East Indies as soldiers, and their return to the Netherlands after their stay of three to four years. For my internship at the KITLV I took stock of some of the published stories as well as of the interviews with former soldiers collected by the KITLV. What struck me was that these stories formed a more or less coherent collective narrative. This narrative shows primarily similarities in descriptions of preparations and expectations of the Dutch East Indies, their experiences in the Dutch East Indies, and returning home after the war. In this thesis I researched several possible explanations why the content of these stories that recall these individual expectations, perceptions and experiences is of such a collective nature.","['Dutch East Indies', 'Dutch soldiers', 'Ego documents', 'Interviews', 'Collective narrative']"

This through a critical approach to Taiwan’s heritage. At the start of the period under review, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was in power for the first time since its founding in 1986 at the end of Taiwan’s Kuomintang (KMT) led marshal law period. In 2008 the KMT regained the government, providing for a unique insight in the practical implications of their ideological differences. Two interrelated issues dominate Taiwan’s politics, and with this Taiwan’s society. Externally this is the standoff between Taiwan and the PRC, internally it is the sharp divide within Taiwan’s society on many issues, explicit in the rivalry between the two main political parties. At the heart of these issues lies defining the Taiwanese identity. The PRC’s claim is based on Taiwan’s Chineseness, on Taiwan being an integrated part of China’s history and culture. Internally, the KMT and DPP carry the discussion on Chineseness or Taiwaneseness through to the extent that the public debate is immersed in the issue of identity. The ultimate question however is whether history and cultural heritage is the right approach to determine sameness or otherness. The author concludes this is not the case.","['Identity', 'Rivalry', 'Chosen heritage']"

A Collection of Stories on Listening and Desire” the relation between listening (to music), desire and the construction of the listening subject is discussed. It consists of three parts: 1) a theoretical introduction in which the traditional Lacanian psychoanalytical idea of desire is revisited through a positive understanding of desire in listening to music, combined with a critique on Adorno’s idea of structural listening, thought from Jean-Luc Nancy’s ideas on resonance and listening; 2) an essay on the relation between listening and desire in literary sources. The Siren episode from Homer’s Odyssey as well as Italo Calvino’s story A King Listens are deconstructed through ideas of Peter Sloterdijk, Maurice Blanchot and Roland Barthes; 3) a trisected essay on three (Blixa Bargeld, Jaap Blonk, Samuel Beckett) musical voices as conveyers of desire in listening. Primary sources are combined with Artaudian ideas on sound and Barthes’ understanding of the Grain of the Voice and jouissance.","['Listening', 'Desire', 'Music', 'Philosophy', 'Voice']"

The Noun-Verb Distinction in Pacific Northwest Languages,"Dam, Lotte van den","['Crevels, Mily']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to discuss the distinction between nouns and verbs (and other word classes) in Wakashan and Salish languages. I will be discussing this distinction with specific reference to the two main approaches in flexible languages – categorial and precategorial classification. For the categorial approach, I will be looking at how well Hengeveld’s (1992) PoS system, and its revisions (Hengeveld et al. 2004, Hengeveld & Van Lier 2010), can be applied to the six Wakashan and Salish languages. For the precategorial approach, I will be working with Don & Van Lier's (2013) precategorial approach and notion of syntactic flexibility to determine how well it can be applied to the Wakashan and Salish languages. The resulting data and analysis indicates that neither approach is particularly suitable. Categorial classification is shown to be slightly too restrictive, whereas precategorial classification can be viewed as not restrictive enough. Additionally, a recurring issue is that word classes aren’t always mutually flexible, a problem which neither approach seems to account for.","['Word classes', 'Precategorial', 'Categorial', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Wakashan', 'Salish', 'Typology']"

With the help of a database consisting of 179 original English terms and their respective counterparts in Dutch, Russian and Turkish, a quantitative and qualitative analysis has been carried out in order to identify the different translation processes and word formation patterns. As a result of this study I found that different factors can influence the behavior of a language with regard to the creation of terminology. First of all, the available word formation strategies of the language grammar and semantics are of importance; how many ways there are for a language to create new words. Second, the relation and similarities in grammar, semantics and pronunciation between the original language and the target language. Third, the sociolinguistic aspect regarding the attitude of language users on foreign (lexical) influence.","['Russian', 'Dutch', 'Turkish', 'Translation procedures', 'Word formation']"

Privatization in Education,"Nijs, Bart de","['Verbeek, Bruno']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis an answer will be given to the question what the effects are of privatization on the access to education and whether it is desirable that education is privatized – and if so, in what way. To determine an answer to this question this thesis will first present different arguments in favor and against privatization in general and then introduce four different forms of provision. Consequently, the earlier presented arguments will be applied to the four different ideal types of provision for the case of education. In the end this thesis will conclude that some form of privatization is desirable, as it generates a higher degree of efficiency and therefore reduces the cost of educational provision. However, since a purely privatized provision of education is subject to undesirable consequences - such as problems with equality of opportunity - this thesis states that a privatized supply side is the best form of educational provision, because it entails efficiency and equality of opportunity.","['Privatization', 'Education', 'Efficiency', 'Equality']"

The ‘troika’ policies to Greece in the Eurozone crisis - a qualitative study of hegemony,"Hartmann, Henrik Sydney","['Black, L.O.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the crisis policies of the ‘troika’ institutions to Greece in the context of the Eurozone crisis. The neoliberal policies of fiscal austerity and internal devaluation prescribed by the troika had a strong contractionary impact which resulted in a prolonged recession of the Greek economy. For this reason, the research question of this study is to what extent the IMF, the EC and the ECB have been questioning the appropriateness of the prescribed crisis policies to Greece. Building on neo-Gramscian theory, the causal mechanism claims that the hegemony of neoliberalism within the troika institutions conditions a specific diagnosis of the Eurozone crisis and hence a specific set of policy responses. Analysing the positions on central dimensions of neoliberalism with regard to financial crises, a striking persistence of neoliberal policies is observed. In light of neo-Gramscian theory, this observation suggests that the first grand systemic crisis of the 21st century has not seen the rise of a challenging counter-hegemonic ideology. It also suggests that the transmittance of ideological change from global to regional economic governance is not necessarily instant. It is thus fundamental to advocate strong alternatives to neoliberalism which could bring the long reign of neoliberalism and international finance to an end.","['Eurozone Crisis', 'Greece', 'Troika', 'Economic Governance', 'Neo-Gramscianism', 'Hegemony', 'Neoliberalism']"

Deze ongelijkheid had gevolgen in de diplomatieke praktijk, ambassadeurs eisten voorrang, genaamd ‘precedentie’, op ambassadeurs van staten die lager in de hiërarchie stonden. Wanneer een ambassadeur meende dat hij en daarmee zijn staat ten onrechte een rang werd ontzegd kwam hij in protest en werd de rang met argumenten verdedigd. Argumenten die in de praktijk gebruikt werden hadden drie brede criteria als grondslag: 1) titel en aard daarvan, bijvoorbeeld anciënniteit van de dynastie; 2) Gods zegen, bijvoorbeeld bezit van het ware geloof en goede werden voor de kerk; en 3) traditie: de geschiedenis van precedentie. Deze criteria en de bijbehorende argumenten waren afkomstig uit interne machtslegitimering van monarchieën en impliceerden katholiek koningschap. Zowel katholicisme als een monarchale staatsinrichting ontbraken bij de Republiek wier argumenten toch naar dezelfde criteria werd getoetst. Uit analyse van correspondentie tussen Nederlandse diplomaten in Frankrijk en de Staten-Generaal kunnen we concluderen dat ook de Republiek alle drie de soorten argumenten gebruikte in de verdediging van haar beoogde rang. Traditie was het belangrijkst en ook het makkelijkst te produceren sinds de erkenning van de soevereiniteit van de Republiek door Hendrik IV van Frankrijk in 1609. Gods zegen kwam ook terug in verschillende vormen maar argumenten naar het titel-criterium waren moeilijker te vormen en werden niet succesvol ingezet. De oorsprong van de Nederlandse argumenten was net als bij monarchieën interne legitimering van macht en staatsvorm. Echter door de 'vertaalslag' die de diplomaten van de Staten-Generaal moesten maken om hun argumenten gehoord te krijgen werd die oorsprong wat meer naar de achtergrond geduwd.","['Diplomatie', 'Republiek der Verenigde Nederlanden', 'Precedentie', 'Ceremonieel', 'Zeventiende eeuw', 'Diplomatieke geschiedenis']"

"From ""The Cincinnati Effect"" to ""The Ferguson Effect"": Media's Growing Involvement in Police Brutality Against Black Citizens","Steijns, Jeffrey","['Bilt, Eduard van de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"On August 9, 2014, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson shoots down a black teenager by the name of Michael Brown in downtown Ferguson, Missouri. Brown, having been shot six times, was killed on the spot. The shooting sparked two weeks of violence and looting, a civil unrest that became known as 'the Ferguson riots'. In its aftermath, theorists have argued that the riots have ultimately resulted in ""The Ferguson Effect"": the belief that crime numbers have risen due to police's incompetence to retain authority. However, this belief appears to be false, as crime statistics show that crime had already started to rise in the months prior to the police shooting. Nevertheless, the term still circulates in the media on a regular basis. This thesis will take a more rational approach towards the supposed “Ferguson Effect”. First, I will focus on historical crime data, provided by the Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics (UCR). Furthermore, this thesis will focus on comparable statistics of a similar civil unrest, the 2001 riots of Cincinnati, in order to spot potential similarities and/or disparities. The findings will invalidate the hypothesis of a “Ferguson Effect”, while at the same time prove the existence of a rise in crime in the years following the 2001 riots in Cincinnati -- “the Cincinnati Effect”, if you will. But as opposed to ""The Ferguson Effect"", the term has never been introduced by the media. In terms of civil unrests, this thesis will focus on the changes in media coverage by comparing the reports of four newspapers (Cincinnati Enquirer, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, New York Times and the Los Angeles Times) on both the Cincinnati riots in 2001 and the Ferguson riots in 2014. Furthermore, a cross-sectional analysis will be conducted to find out the extent to which coverage has transformed, both in the case of regional and national coverage specifically as well as comprehensive coverage. Ultimately, these analyses will confirm the following thesis statement: the term “Ferguson Effect”, introduced by the media in its coverage on the 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri, is a result of the media’s growing involvement in police brutality against black citizens, as compared to the coverage on the 2001 riots in Cincinnati, Ohio.","['ferguson effect', 'cincinnati effect', 'police', 'racial profiling', 'riots', 'civil unrest', 'michael brown', 'timothy thomas']"

“And Never The Twain Shall Meet”? Literary Language in Dutch and English Supreme Court Judgments,"Wijnands, Lineke","['Foster, Tony']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Though the relevance of literature for law has been acknowledged for a long time, this does not apply to literary language: lawyers often view the legal and the literary language as worlds apart. Yet, I want to argue that legal texts are indeed more “literary” than is often thought. This thesis investigates if English Supreme Court judgments are more “literary” than Dutch ones, and whether this applies more to older judgments than to more recent ones. Legal language, literary language and “literariness” are discussed. I selected ten Dutch and nine English Supreme Court judgments, each dealing with an aspect of tort law and dating from the last fifty years, to make up a corpus for analysis. The analysis focuses on stylistic and rhetorical features and makes use of the criteria for the establishment of a “cline of literariness” as proposed by Carter and Nash, with short excursions to their theory on the language of fiction and to speech act theory. The results are discussed and, if possible, scored in tables. I found that not only are English Supreme Court judgments indeed more “literary” than their Dutch counterparts, there is also a clear difference between the judgments from the twentieth century and the more recent ones, with opposite results.

Geminate Stops in Anatolian: Evidence and Typological Implications,"Jäntti, Selim Axel Oscar","['Kloekhorst, Alwin']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the synchronic and diachronic identity of the Anatolian stops, and their implications for Proto-Indo-European phonology and subgrouping. Ever since Sturtevant (1932), it has been known that etymologically Hittite cuneiform VC-CV (fortis) spellings go back to PIE *t, and V-CV (lenis) spellings to *d/dh. This has been taken to stand either for a synchronic voicing or length contrast. Through an examination of the origins and use of Hittite cuneiform, combined with phonological evidence, it is concluded that the underlying contrast must be length. A typological survey of geminate evolution and Proto-Anatolian phonology further concludes that this contrast must be original, and cannot emerge from a voicing contrast. Therefore the Nuclear-Proto-Indo-European *t~*d~*dh contrast is an innovation, and a *t:~*t~*? system must be reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European. This is evidence of a significant innovation that Proto-Anatolian did not take part in, and thus strong evidence for the Indo-Hittite Hypothesis.","['Historical Linguistics', 'Indo-European', 'Proto-Indo-European', 'Anatolian', 'Hittite', 'Geminates', 'Geminate typology', 'Indo-Hittite', 'Indo-European Phonology']"
"Prussia’s Franconian Undertaking. Dynasty, Law and Politics in the Holy Roman Empire (1703-1726)","Somsen, Quinten Olivier","['Duindam, Jeroen']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The ruling dynasties of the Holy Roman Empire were subjected to imperial jurisdiction. Until the Empire’s demise in 1806, its two supreme courts adjudicated disputes that stemmed from all levels of the imperial hierarchy. Despite considerable autonomy, a sizable army and international ambitions, the rulers of Brandenburg-Prussia remained accountable to imperial justice. The Kings ‘in’ Prussia needed the emperor’s confirmation to realize their expansionist ambitions in the Southern German region of Franconia. The Reichshofrat, as the emperor’s supreme court, reviewed the lawfulness of Prussia’s claims, while a political opposition of small Franconian princes organized itself around the influential imperial arch-chancellor and elector of Mainz. The opposition feared Prussian interference in their regional assembly and did everything to prevent Prussian expansion into Franconia. Several of the king’s relatives were persuaded to join the opposition and appeal to the Reichshofrat to challenge Prussia’s ambitions. This ignited an intra-dynastic conflict which could alter the balance of power in the Empire on the outset of the 18th century. This thesis enquires how the Reichshofrat arbitrated the conflict, demonstrates how political and legal issues merged in a struggle for power and seeks to understand how the protagonists operated within the confines of the Empire’s legal framework. As they tried to achieve their political objectives within the imperial system they were forced to deal with its constraints. The conflict’s dynamic, course of events and outcome were determined by the imperial system.","['Holy Roman Empire', 'Reichshofrat', 'Imperial Aulic Council', 'Prussia', 'Bayreuth', 'Franconia', 'Hohenzollern', 'Schönborn', 'Habsburg', 'Early Modern history', 'political history', 'legal history.']"

Subordination in Megrelian under influence of Georgian,"Wichers Schreur, Jesse","['Lubotsky, A.M.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The thesis focuses on Megrelian, a language spoken by approximately 500.000 people in the west of the country of Georgia. It is genealogically related to Georgian, the official language of the country. Every speaker of Megrelian is bilingual and speaks Georgian from an early age onwards. Georgian is the language of bureaucracy, education and virtually all written communication. Hence, a lot of influence of this standard language on Megrelian is to be expected. However, this influence has not been studied yet (at least not outside Georgia). In addition, Megrelian features several strategies for the grammatical concept of subordination. It shows a conjunction /namda/, which is functionally parallel to English 'that', in 'I saw that John arrived', and finds its parallel in Georgian /rom/. Furthermore, an enclitic element /=ni/ can be added to the end of the embedded clause (in adverbial, complement, and relative clauses alike). /namda/ and /=ni/ can also be combined. Also, Megrelian has several ways to nominalise verbs, which can then be used to form subordinated clauses. This thesis will explore the different strategies of subordination in Megrelian and will try to distinguish which strategy is used for which function. Furthermore, while the Georgian language is bound to have influence on the minority language, it interesting to see if it will also have its impact on a syntactic operation like subordination. In terms of data, it is of interest that numerous folk tales and poems in Megrelian have been gathered around the turn of the century by Georgian scholars, although in more recent years, the amount of fieldwork is very sparse. This thesis seeks to combine these two sources and add contemporary data of spoken Megrelian, as well as make public some of the older narratives.","['Megrelian', 'Mingrelian', 'Georgian', 'Kartvelian', 'Language contact', 'Subordination', 'Adverbial clause', 'Complement clause', 'Relative Clause', 'Caucasian']"
Uncertainty and Doubt: How a Network of Skeptics is Stalling Climate Change Mitigation Policies in the United States,"Andrei, Theodor","['Vries, Mark Leon de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The science behind climate change is more certain than most of the American public has been led to believe. An overwhelming consensus has already formed in the scientific community. The consensus suggests that climate change is occurring at a faster rate than previously believed due to anthropogenic causes, such as large amounts of CO2 emissions being released into the atmosphere. This means that human action will also be required to amend this issue. The leading body of climate research, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change arrived at these conclusions as early as 1995. While some developed countries have made impressive steps towards shifting to renewable sources with the help of national energy policies and other incentives, other developed countries are severely lagging behind due to their economy's heavy reliance on fossil fuel and an unfavorable political environment. This thesis will explore the climate-change skeptic network in the United States and the impact it has had in the discussion on national mitigation policies.","['Climate Change', 'Organized Support', 'United States Politics', 'Fossil Fuel Industry', 'Climate Change Mitigation', 'Conservative Think Tanks', 'Climate Change Skepticism']"

Investments in Solar Power: a Practical Approach to Transaction Cost Theory: case study of Italy and Germany,"Bekker-Piliu, Sonia","['Correljé, A.F.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"It has become conventional wisdom under many scientists, official organisations and politicians that the diffusion of solar (and wind) power is becoming an essential and integral part in the mitigation of climate change and the resolution to the extremely elevated levels of GHG-emissions. As with any (relatively) new technology, the penetration of solar power heavily depends on the level of new investments in solar capacity and storage. This paper considers four main factors of influence on the level of investment in solar power in a specific country: technology and innovation, country-specific characteristics, economic developments and political (and cultural) institutions. This research paper focusses on the manner in which political institutions affect the level of investment in the deployment and infrastructure of solar power. The transaction cost approach on the study of potential investments analyses the possible costs involved in the transaction or investment. Two elements have been demonstrated to increase the costs that incur when engaging in a certain transaction: uncertainty and opportunistic behaviour, either from one of the contracting parties or from a third party, whose interests oppose that of the transaction. Institutions, particularly political and cultural institutions, have a significant effect on the success of a certain transaction. This effect is magnified when it concerns highly specific assets and when the products that result from the transaction (investment) are consumed widely. Investments in solar power are prone to both types of transaction costs. Stable regulatory frameworks, regulatory contracting, relational contracting and a moderate degree of political fragmentation and third-party influence increase the feasibility and credibility of policy regimes. In the early stage of solar power deployment a number of countries, including Italy and Germany, the protagonists of this research paper, have successfully introduced feed-in-tariff support schemes to ease uncertainty for investors and stimulate further investments in solar technology and capacity. However, unilateral opportunistic behaviour from the Italian government that introduced retrospective changes to existing regulation and contracts has demonstrated to significantly damage investors’ trust and the dynamics of solar power investments. In addition, entrenched practices of clientelism and corruption in Italy considerably abate the possibility of foreign investments, necessary to increase the penetration of solar power in Italy. The ‘Italian style’ of relational contracting between private investors and the public agent, appears to be a functional solution in avoiding transaction costs for tenders, concession contracts or public private partnerships. Illustrative for the German market, in order to mitigate the hazard of third-party opportunism, characteristic to parliamentary democracy (with elevated levels of scrutiny and room for opposition), a rapprochement to market mechanism appears to be a suitable option. In addition, enhanced transparency and a penetrative governmental communication strategy could provide for broader public support and incentivise future investments in solar power.","['renewable energy', 'solar power', 'investments', 'transaction cost', 'public contracting', 'relational contracting', 'energy policy', 'italy', 'germany']"

"Coordination, conditionals and questions: a cross-linguistic investigation","Jordanoska, Izabela","['Ameka, Felix', 'Cremers, Crit']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis concerns the semantic relations between coordination, conditionality and interrogativity. Some aspects of these relations have been noted in work concerning grammaticalization, typology and formal semantics. A notable example is the Russian question marker li, which is also found in the form for the disjunctive marker ili 'or' and the form for the conditional marker esli 'if'. While aspects of these relations have been examined in the past, this thesis fills out the gap in the study of the relations between coordination, conditionals and questions by putting them together in a semantic map. To examine the possible universality of these relations, the use of these concepts is investigated in three unrelated languages: Dutch, Macedonian and Wolof. The relations are indicated per language in separate semantic maps and finally plotted together in a single one to examine the overlap and differences between them. The most similarities are expected between Macedonian and Dutch, as they are both from the same family, namely Indo-European, while Wolof is an Atlantic language from the Niger-Congo family. This turns out to indeed be the case. Some of the relations are language specific, but there are universal cross-linguistic patterns, such as the relation between propositional questions and disjunction, which is found in all three of these languages. Thus, this contributes to the insight of the cross-linguistic universality of these concepts.","['coordination', 'questions', 'conditionals', 'Wolof', 'Macedonian', 'Dutch', 'semantic variation']"
Swimming Against the Tide: History of Dutch Propaganda Films about Indonesia and the Revolutionary Role of Joris Ivens,"Rezwana, Jafrin","['Schrover, M.L.J.C.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Dutch colonial government used film as propaganda to establish and showcase their colonial agenda while recording footage in the Dutch East Indies (current Indonesia) for almost half a century, especially during the Era of Revolution (1945-49). These propaganda films served two major purposes. Firstly, targeting domestic audiences (in the earlier period) they were a source of information about Dutch East Indies for Dutch citizens and researchers. They created a positive impression about the colony, to inspire missionaries, and to attract entrepreneurs to invest money in Dutch East Indies. Secondly, aiming both at national and international audiences (during the Era of Revolution and the decolonisation period) they helped justify Dutch presence in Indonesia presenting the Dutch as sympathetic and useful friends in war-torn conditions. Interestingly, not everyone agreed with the ideology of the Dutch colonial government. Joris Ivens (1898-1989) was one of the most famous and controversial Dutch film-makers in the Netherlands, who dared to swim against the tide. Ivens challenged the trends in Dutch propaganda films with his most renowned work Indonesia Calling! (released in 1946). This study throws light into the life and career of Joris Ivens. It also describes the difficulties faced by him because of his revolutionary activities. Mapping the role and motivation of Joris Ivens, who was a well-known communist and anti-colonial propagandist, is the major contribution of this thesis.","['Joris Ivens', 'Audio visual history', 'Documentary films about Indonesia', 'Colonial Propaganda Films', 'Decolonisation of Indonesia', 'Indonesia Calling', 'Anti-colonial propaganda', 'Dutch East Indies', 'Motivation of a Propagandist', 'Dutch Film History']"

"Interaction between the state, local governance and NGOs in Peru","Jeen, Anne","['Solheim, H.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will be divided into three chapters. Chapter one will describe the main concepts concerned with the relationships between the state and NGOs and between local governance and NGOs, as well as the roles NGOs play in these relationships. Furthermore, it will also explain how these relationships differ between the developed and developing regions of the world, which will be referred to as – ‘the North’ – and – ‘the South’ – respectively. Chapter two historically analyse the state-NGO in the context of Peru from 1985 to 2000. Emphasis will be placed on the different impacts NGOs had as well as the roles and regulations they took on with the state. This chapter will make use of a comparative analysis of Peru’s leadership under first the democratic leader, García (1985-1990), and second the authoritarian leader, Fujimori (1990-2000). Chapter three will be centred on a case study of the NGO Tierra de niños. This chapter will aim to discover this NGO’s 4 function in practice, by analysing its relationships with the state and the municipality in Nuevo Pachacutec. The goal here is to consider how a NGO contributes to the provision of social services to the poor, and what the result of this is on their livelihoods.","['NGO', 'State', 'Local governance', 'Peru', 'leadership under García and Fujimori', 'specific case study NGO']"

Korean and Japanese Ceramic Heritage,"Tonk, Anna","['Paskaleva, Elena']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the dawn of humankind pottery has played a role in civilization. Pottery can be used to pinpoint geographical expansion or migration of a people. It can be a way to determine events surrounding civilisations. This historical consciousness of pottery is also what illustrates some iconic events in the history between Japan and Korea, but it may also link the contemporary relationship of each respective ceramic tradition since there are many people interested in the Korean and Japanese pottery of the past. The content of this thesis argues that they are never completely separate from each other. Through the nineteenth and twentieth century Japan and Korea each developed their cultural heritage policies and respective nationalist discourses. In Japan anxiety of westernization crept in. In Korea anxiety of westernization came simultaneously with a struggle for their cultural identity because of the Japanese colonial rule. Both countries took countermeasures in the form of folklore programs and revitalization and other searches for nostalgia and identity. Due to such dynamics, the effect of state policies and national narratives affected how craftsmanship was perceived. It was often labelled as symbol of the state, and something to find your ethnic and national identity in. These post-war policies created a sense of cultural essentialism that was hard to alter, even in the social context. Institutionalisation, as part of ‘heritagisation’ created a web of museums, government advertising, government organized or endorsed festivals and the ‘National Living Treasure’ program. Especially in Korea was this a scholarly source of critique. Through analysis from which context each heritage discourse came from and how it is maintained today it seems as if it obstructs the possibility of creating an image of cultural connectedness. Nevertheless a certain different dynamic is rising. The contemporary communities of potters and ceramic artists may pose as an alternative level to portray pottery heritage juxtaposed to the grand narrative of the heritage industry and government. Will or can redirecting our view to the level of the people as artists involved with Korea’s and Japan’s ceramics heritage change an obstinate cultural essentialism and disconnectedness?","['heritage discourse', 'heritage policy', 'nationalist narrative', 'material culture', 'craft industry', 'cultural fluidity']"

Migration patterns have shifted; young, highly skilled professionals are most likely to migrate and they are increasingly leaving the country with no intention to return. This leads to severe shortages in the Hungarian labour market in several sectors, such as academia, IT, tourism, and in particular healthcare. Studies on the ‘brain drain’ have been mainly concerned with the effects of the phenomenon on receiving and sending countries, whereas research focused little on the determinants of migration and solutions to controlling the human capital flow. Opposition parties, the media and several sectors are putting pressure on the government to act and scholars have highlighted the role states can play in influencing the ‘brain drain’ (Vas-Zoltán, 1976; De Haas, 2011). The government approach is contradictory and at times controversial. This thesis studies the approach of the Hungarian government to the ‘brain drain’ based on attitude demonstrated as well as policies pursued and whether it addresses the causes of migration.","['brain drain', 'emigration', 'government', 'labour market', 'migration patterns', 'migration determinants']"

Opinion 2/13: Balancing Constitutionalism and a Human Rights Perspective,"Brouwer, Tom","['Oster, J.S.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Through qualitative legal research, this paper will answer the question: ‘How can constitutionalism be balanced with a human rights perspective, in EU accession to the ECHR?’ We hypothesize that this balance is possible. From the current academic debate, three theories applicable to this research are distilled: constitutionalism; a human rights perspective; and institutionalism. Through application of the first two theories, a concrete proposal for the way forward in EU accession to the Convention is constructed. The legal options for this proposal consist of Treaty revisions (including the adoption of a ‘notwithstanding’ protocol), unilateral measures (reservations, declarations, and agreements), and renegotiation of the Draft Accession Agreement. Thirteen amendments are proposed: eleven to the Draft Accession Agreement; one to the Draft Explanatory Report; and one to the TEU. Furthermore, it is argued throughout this research that institutionalist tendencies matter, but cannot serve as sole explanations for the Court’s reasoning. As the key conclusion, we find that a way forward in accession, that considers both constitutional demands and a human rights perspective, exists. Appended to this paper, a comprehensive proposal for this way forward is introduced.","['Opinion 2/13', 'CJEU', 'ECtHR', 'Constitutionalism', 'Human Rights', 'Institutionalism', 'Draft Accession Agreement', 'Charter', 'Convention']"

God or Man? The Dual Nature of Christ in Old English Christian Poetry,"Rijn, Mariëlle van","['Porck, Thijs']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The portrayal of Christ in Old English verse has hardly been analysed in relation to medieval doctrine, Christology (i.e. the person and nature of Christ) in particular. This thesis attempts to fill this gap in the literature on Old English Christian verse by offering an analysis of the dual nature of Christ in the Old English poems Christ I (or Advent), Christ II (or The Ascension), Christ III (or Christ in Judgment), The Dream of the Rood (or The Vision of the Cross), and The Descent into Hell. This thesis shows that the Anglo-Saxon poets responsible for these poems heavily rely on biblical and liturgical images, light imagery, and heroic imagery in their depiction of Christ’s divine nature. Christ’s humanity proves a more delicate topic as each poet approaches it in his own way and does so with caution, probably because of the fierce debates about Christ’s human nature in the Anglo-Saxon Church. Moreover, even though in different ways, these poems portray a fully united human-divine Christ, thus conforming to the orthodox principle of Christology that Christ is both fully God and perfectly human. In presenting Christ in such a fashion, the Anglo-Saxon poets refute the active Christological heresies of their time, such as Arianism and Adoptionism.","['Old English Christian Poetry', 'Old English verse', 'Christology', 'Anglo-Saxon Church', 'Christ', ""Christ's dual nature"", 'divinity', 'humanity']"

Alles wat Onze Lieve Heer en de majesteit verboden heeft,"Bakker, Shannon","['Koetsenruijter, A.W.M.', 'Burger, J.P.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"OMG’s zijn motorclubs waarvan de leden zichzelf buiten de wet plaatsen en al sinds de jaren zeventig kent Nederland OMG’s. Aanleiding voor dit onderzoek zijn de opvallend verschillende beelden die recent van motorclubs in de media te vinden zijn. Het onderzoeken van deze verschillende beelden van OMG’s in de media was het doel van deze studie. Deze beelden kennen en begrijpen is van belang omdat wij heel vaak geconfronteerd worden met berichtgeving over OMG’s. Bovendien bepalen de media of wij OMG’s als een probleem zien of niet, we komen zelf immers niet iedere dag een Hells Angel tegen. Bij criminaliteit is het in het algemeen zo dat we via de media te weten komen wat een probleem is. Wat bij OMG’s bijzonder is ten opzichte van andere vormen van criminaliteit is dat OMG’s zelf actief de media opzoeken. Hierdoor is het mogelijk om te onderzoeken hoe ‘criminelen’ omgaan met beschuldigingen van justitie en welk beeld zij van zichzelf willen uitdragen. In dit onderzoek is onderzocht hoe er in de Nederlandse kranten wordt geschreven over OMG’s. Hierbij is er speciaal aandacht besteed aan de rol van de bron en de nieuwsaanleiding. Het onderzoek werd uitgevoerd aan de hand van het concept framing. Framing is volgens de definitie van Van Gorp & van der Goot: ‘de manier waarop de burger en de media een bepaald onderwerp of kwestie representeren’ (2009, p. 304). Een framingonderzoek naar motorbendes is voor zover ik kan overzien nog niet in Nederland uitgevoerd. Wel is er eerder onderzoek gedaan naar de beeldvorming rond OMG’s buiten Nederland. Uit deze onderzoeken blijkt dat OMG’s al vanaf de oprichting in verband worden gebracht met criminaliteit en er in Canada sprake was van een moral panic rond OMG’s (Fuglsang, 2003; Katz, 2011). Een moral panic is een disproportionele reactie op een sociaal probleem door de media, politici en het publiek. De veroorzakers van het probleem zijn binnen een moral panic folk devils. Zij vormen een bedreiging voor de normen en waarden en de levens van nette burgers. Om te onderzoeken welke bronnen er worden genoemd in artikelen over OMG’s en welke beelden deze bronnen uitdragen is eerst een framinganalyse van de evaluatieve beweringen van bronnen in krantenartikelen uitgevoerd. Hieruit bleek dat de belangrijkste bronnen politie, justitie, gemeenten en leden van OMG’s zijn. Deze vijf bronnen brengen vier verschillende frames naar voren: het ‘georganiseerde misdaad’-frame, het ‘folk devils’-frame, het hobbyistenframe en het ‘moderne schutterij’-frame. In de tweede ronde werden er volledige artikelen geanalyseerd. In deze ronde werden geen andere frames gevonden, maar zijn de eerder gevonden frames wel aangevuld. Het ‘georganiseerde misdaad’-frame en ‘folk devils’-frame zijn negatief over motorbendes. In het eerste frame is het probleem dat OMG’s betrokken zijn bij georganiseerde misdaad, bij het tweede frame zijn OMG’s een bedreiging voor de openbare orde en de levens van gewone mensen. Het ‘georganiseerde misdaad’-frame en ‘folk devils’-frame zijn de dominante frames in het debat over OMG’s. Zij worden ondersteunt door de meest machtige bronnen: politie en politiek. Het hobbyistenframe en het ‘moderne schutterij’-frame reageren op de dominante frames en zijn daarmee counterframes, waarin niet de OMG’s het probleem zijn, maar de pers en politiek die OMG’s negatief afschilderen. De bronnen in alle vier de frames hebben een duidelijk belang bij het frame dat zij ondersteunen en bij een nieuwsaanleidingen hoort regelmatig een vast frame. Zowel bron als nieuwsaanleiding zijn dus vaak onlosmakelijk verbonden met een frame.","['Motorbendes', 'OMG', 'framing']"
Do longer lines take longer? Reconsidering the cognitive reflections of spatial duration metaphors: Evidence from Dutch,"Baksteen, Marion","['Crevels, Mily', 'Gryllia, Stella']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The conceptual link between space and time is accounted for by two different theories: Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT, Lakoff and Johnson 1980) and A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM, Walsh 2003). Within a linguistic framework, CMT provides evidence for an asymmetric conceptual link between space and time, opposed to the symmetric link predicted by ATOM. Casasanto and Boroditsky (2008) and Casasanto (2010) presented evidence in favour of CMT from non-linguistic psychophysical tasks. Longer lines appeared to positively affect participants’ estimation of duration, analogous to metaphors for duration using spatial words such as long and short, but duration did not influence the perception of space (Casasanto and Boroditsky 2008). A subsequent study revealed language specific differences in effects of different stimulus types, parallel to the typical duration metaphors found in these languages (Casasanto 2010). The present investigation of Dutch shows that the relation between duration metaphors and the perception of space and duration is less straightforward than what might be expected on the basis of the accounts of Casasanto and Boroditsky (2008) and Casasanto (2010). The results of an experiment with speakers of Dutch reveal a symmetric link between space and duration in the case of space presented in the form of one-dimensional length, but an asymmetric link is reported in case of more-dimensional size. Overall, this provides evidence for ATOM rather than CMT.","['ATOM', 'CMT', 'duration', 'Dutch', 'metaphor', 'space', 'time']"

De Clutch Kwijt? The Role of the Translator in Online Social Media,"Helms, Jeannette","['Dorst, A.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis reports on an empirical investigation of the language in both company posts and customer comments on the Dutch H&M Facebook page and on the results of a small-scale online self-completion questionnaire on the appreciation and understanding of English words by Dutch Facebook users in order to investigate the role of the translator in online social media. After carrying out the case-study it became obvious that influences of the English language are evidently present on the H&M Facebook page as 89 per cent of the company posts and 37 per cent of the accompanying customer comments contained English and/or (standardised) loanwords. The results from the questionnaire remained open to different interpretations as comprehension of fashion related terminology was high but preferences and attitudes towards code-switching and the use of English, Dutch or hybrid one-liners that often appear in the H&M company posts varied depending on the phrasing of the specific questions in the questionnaire. However, the results do suggest that language mixing through hybrid posts is generally not recommendable as exclusively Dutch and exclusively English one-liners were often preferred by the participants of this study. Yet, the data did not provide a conclusive answer to whether English posts on social media should be translated or creatively re-written into Dutch but underlined that this depends on factors which are relevant when translating for online social media such as the specific target audience and the purpose of the translation.","['translation', 'online social media', 'code-switching']"

Lobbying and Democracy: The Effect of Organized External Influences on Democratic Legitimacy,"Beijk, Justus","['Boot, Eric']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"An elected representative has the obligation to make decisions based on how this affects the population. There are various organized groups which seek to actively influence politicians in the decision-making process. This raises the question how a representative should deal with these organized groups, which we normally call lobbyists. In this thesis I will look at lobbying from a philosophical perspective. I will answer the question how lobbying influences democracy and how it affects democratic legitimacy. This will be done based on three accusations, that lobbying can create imbalances in decision-making, that lobbying can lead to a lack of transparency, and the accusation that lobbyists use immoral practices. I will first discuss different types of democracy and what the important features and requirements of a democracy are, and what exactly we mean by lobbying. Following this I will discuss the second accusation as well as the positive aspects lobbying can have on democracy. Positive aspects include the fact that lobbying allows for an exchange of information between politicians and external parties, that lobbying can lead to better representation by politicians because citizens can contact government officials directly, and the fact that lobbying can lead to increased publicity. Following this I will discuss possible solutions to the problems of lobbying. The first solution we will discuss states that publicity in the government is a strong way to counter many of the problems of lobbying. The second way to solve the problems of lobbying is by turning towards a more deliberative mode of democracy.","['Deep secrecy', 'Shallow secrecy', 'Lobbying', 'Democracy', 'Legitimacy', 'Secrecy', 'Deliberative Democracy', 'Democratic Imbalance', 'Participation']"
Alternative Governance in Guatemala: Responses to Land Conflict and Criminal Violence in the Ixil,"Garcia Garzon, Celia","['Solheim, H.A.S.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis analyses alternative forms of governance to manage land conflict and criminal violence in the Ixil region in Guatemala. Under conditions of weak state presence, European-centric governance approaches have been sceptical about governance in countries with a weak institutional culture and precarious democracy. However, on pointing out the democratic stance governance should achieve, they have overlooked alternative forms of order and the contribution of (non)state actors on the provision of services. In an attempt to solve this dilemma, this thesis proposes to broad the notion of governance to understand “who governs for whom, and how are governance services provided under the conditions of weak statehood?” (Risse 4). The study suggests looking at how are (non)state actors related to each other in the sense that they provide services otherwise not provided by the state. Based on a study of the Ixil region, this thesis describes operations and practices amongst an array of (non)state actors that work and cooperate, separately and together, for the provision of services through arrangements we characterise as ‘alternative governance’.","['Governance', 'Guatemala', 'State', 'Ixil']"

The first part consists of a grammar sketch. The second part is the core component, describing and analyzing lexical time in Kavalan based on fieldwork data. The lexical temporal concepts are taken from Haspelmath’s (1997) typological semantic classification of temporal NP-based adverbials. The conceptualization of these concepts is examined using the Conceptual Metaphor Theory as advanced by Lakoff & Johnson (e.g. 1980, 1999b) and adjusted and expanded by Moore (2000, 2006, 2014). Expressions motivated by various TIME IS SPACE metaphors are found to be fairly frequent in Kavalan. The third and final part contains a small typological study, in which Kavalan’s linguistic behavior in terms of temporal expression and conceptualization is compared to that of four other Formosan languages: Tsou, Saisiyat, Isbukun Bunun, and Paiwan. A general pattern is the different encoding of temporal clauses in past situations as opposed to those in future and generic/habitual situations (Zeitoun 1997). Both Kavalan and Saisiyat are curiously found to deviate from this two-way distinction by being more implicit. Tsou is an obvious outlier in various respects, as expected from its likewise diverging general linguistic properties.","['Austronesian', 'Formosan', 'Conceptual Metaphor Theory', 'space-time metaphor', 'lexical time', 'temporal adverbial']"
TECHNICAL TRANSLATION IN SUBTITLING: AN ANALYSIS OF CSI:NY AND THE REAL CSI SUBTITLES,"Voogt, Joelle","['Dorst, A.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"When it comes to scientific TV shows, there is bit of an information gap. There are some texts, but in pales in comparison to the amount of works concerning the subtitling of humor. With the many crime shows out there, this is quite surprising. Even though there are not a lot of sources concerning scientific translation, there are plenty concerning technical translation, such as Montgomery and Desblache. I will be using these to create an overview of how experts advise translators to translate technical terms. In order to hopefully discover a pattern in how this genre is translated, I will do a case study on two different TV shows, both of which are scientific. The shows I will be using are CSI:NY, a fictional scientific crime drama, and The Real CSI, a non-fictional crime documentary. I will analyse the translation processes used in the official subtitles of both TV shows individually, to find out what procedures are used, using Chesterman’s model of translation, and analyse why these choices were made. Then, I will compare my analyses of the two shows and compare the procedures used in order to hopefully find a pattern in how these shows are subtitled.","['technical translation', 'subtitling', 'csi']"

RETURN FROM EXILE: A CRITICAL LOOK AT THE EFFICACY OF INCORPORATING L1 IN THE ESL/EFL CLASSROOM,"Singaravelu, Thenmolee","['Levelt, Claartje']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the field of second language acquisition, the role of the mother tongue in acquiring a brand new linguistic system has been widely debated by many researchers. For a long time, experts in the field held on to conservative notions about the relationship between the L1 and L2, and research and language acquisition paradigm in the past leaned towards an L1 interference model, which had blamed the mother tongue for most, if not all, challenges experienced by learners in acquiring an L2. Modern literature surrounding language acquisition, however, point to a change in trend and attitudes involving the use of L1 in acquiring an L2. Extensive studies involving primary research data have been undertaken to dispel the notion of L1 interference and, instead, encourage incorporating L1 in L2 instruction. The research questions that this thesis hopes to address and answer are: Does using L1 in the L2 classroom benefit English as a second and foreign language learners? What factors might hinder the effectiveness of using L1 in acquiring an ESL/EFL in the classroom? In the end, this paper will endeavour to suggest ways L1 should be integrated into classroom language teaching situations. This research study will undertake to review and consolidate all previous work done on the hindrance of using the L1, on one hand, and the effectiveness of L1 use in the L2 classroom on the other. Practical ways of using the L1 will be provided, using examples from research done involving primary data from the literature. To substantiate this section, teacher attitudes and classroom practices in using L1 in ESL situations in an international school in Amsterdam will also be presented.","['L2 acquisition', 'SLA', 'ESL']"

De verbeelding van het lichaam werd sterk beïnvloed door de waarden en normen die voortvloeiden uit het confucianisme, taoïsme en boeddhisme.Het waren deze opvattingen die bepalend waren voor de vraag: wat kan gedacht, gevoeld en gezegd worden in onze Chinese maatschappij. Als na de Culturele Revolutie in 1978 een nieuwe tijd aanbreekt wordt deze vraag door de avant garde anders beantwoord. Kunstenaars nemen de vrijheid om oude taboes te doorbreken, zoals het verbeelden van het naakte lichaam.Met de economische opening naar het westen die in de jaren 80 begon, werd ook de invloed van westerse kunstenaars groter.Het lichaam werd zowel als object en als subject ingezet om een nieuwe identiteit vorm te geven waarin oude tradities omvergeworpen werden, inclusief de moraal en het fatsoen.Tegelijkertijd zien we nog sporen van het verleden terug in de avant garde die bijvoorbeeld herinneren aan de opvattingen binnen het boeddhisme.","['lichaam', 'naaktheid', 'confucius', 'boeddha', 'laozi', 'avantgarde', 'performance', 'discours']"

However very few critics have shown interest in this fundamental aspect of these texts, concentrating either on their serious or erotic content. This thesis aims to buck this trend and show the importance and value of humor in XVIIIth century libertine literature and how to better represent it in literary criticism. To this aim, the libertine texts are read against the backdrop of the main critical currents between the XVIIIth and the XXIst century, attempting to show which aspect of humor have been favored or ignored. A postmodern “ironic reading” of libertine literature is proposed as a way to offer a newer perspective on these works and show nuanced and more complex degrees of humor in the XVIIIth century texts. As a result, it is made clear that though seriousness has been a guiding principle for literary criticism so far, humor deserves a place in the study of libertine literature, especially today as postmodern tools allow a refinement in the understanding of the humor in these texts.","['humor', 'libertine literature', 'history of criticism', 'irony', 'context.']"
From Intentions to Actions: The Role of the Business Sector in Sustainable Development,"Ali, Abir","['Touwen, L. Jeroen']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this Master thesis, I examine the role of the business sector in sustainable development. I study the extent to which we can rely on companies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established by the 2030 agenda, by examining the efficiency of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). I will examine an alternative way for companies to conduct business responsibly by joining voluntary initiatives such as the Global Compact (GC). My analysis conforms with the belief that sustainable development cannot happen without the business sector, and that for optimal results the business sector must make beyond CSR and enter in partnerships with other actors in society such as governments, UN agencies, and civil society. However, as this thesis will show, from the data that we have so far, the role of the business sector in sustainable development has been limited and not sufficient to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Therefore, I argue that more government regulation of the business sector is necessary if sustainable development is to be achieved; the regulation should promote business activity that is conducive to economic growth while at the same time it should ensure that this business activity will not have negative spill-over effects on society. The achievement of sustainable development necessitates the appropriate mix between government regulations, CSR and partnerships.","['Sustainable Development', 'Business Sector', 'Global Compact', 'Government', 'Corporate Social Responsibility']"

This paper attempts to provide the answer to the following issues, employing critical discourse analysis as the methodology: it examines which form of nationalism, ethnic or civic, is more prevalent in the speeches. Moreover, it identifies the main themes and evaluates Poroshenko´s nation building mission while providing a chapter on the history of these contested forms of nationalism in Ukraine to offer a wider background of the examined issues. This study concluded that the prevalent form of nationalism is civic nationalism and identified anti-Russian rhetoric, the European path and using the war in Donbass as a means of uniting the people as the main topics. However, Poroshenko´s nation-building is defensive rather than proactive. It is largely based on anti-Russian narrative and the current war, but does not offer a viable and sustainable vision of nation-building in a long run, indicating that president Poroshenko is, like his predecessors, unable to resolve the internal division of Ukraine and create a strong national identity which would likely allow Ukraine to improve its economic and political situation.","['ukraine', 'nationalism', 'poroshenko', 'civic nationalism', 'ethnic nationalism', 'critical discourse analysis', 'speech analysis']"

By legalising marijuana and making drug laws more lenient, some countries have blatantly disregarded the UN drug treaty system. Others have instead chosen to strictly enforce prohibition, using methods not approved by all2. As the UN pursues a unified approach, polarisation between those in favour and those against the current UN drug treaty system increases. Important benchmarks in the drug policy debate are the United Nations Special Sessions (UNGASS) on drugs, when the General Assembly (GA) reviews the performance of the UN drug control system. Two of the special sessions took place in 1990 and 1998. The next UNGASS took place almost eighteen years later in 2016 and the GA will continue the discussion in 2019. This renewed attention, after almost two decades of oblivion, highlights the need of the international community to revisit the debate on global drug policy in a time of mounting polarisation. This thesis will discuss to what extent the global drug policy debate has become more wide-ranging and open throughout the United Nations special sessions of 1990, 1998 and 2016?",

Through qualitative research in both Chókwè and Chiaquelane, over a three month fieldwork period, this study was aimed at uncovering the implications of permanent migration as an adaptation strategy, using theories of livelihood sustainability and natural disaster risk resilience. Semi-structured interviews, group interviews, and field observation are the main research methods that were deployed. Main findings include, among others, that permanent migration to Chiaquelane brings about absolute safety from the Limpopo River floods, but it also entails a decrease in livelihood opportunities; the soils are less fertile, there are little to no employment opportunities and it is hard to start a (lost) business from scratch. The decision to stay in (or return to) Chókwè entails that people better preserve their social networks, can rely on pre-existing employment opportunities, are surrounded by more and better facilities, and most importantly, can continue to work on their machambas and sell the surplus on the market. The results of this study furthermore suggest that, in its current state, the resettlement programme tends to reinforce existing inequalities within the Gaza Province. Secondly, the results suggest that permanent migration is not a fully voluntary decision; it heavily depends on (1) the amount of received government assistance and (2) the assets – social as well as material – that are available to someone.","['Environmental Migration', 'Climate Change Adaptation', 'Disaster Risk Reduction', 'Livelihood Sustainability', 'Risk Perception', 'Internal Displacement', 'Mozambique']"

"Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose? Understanding how and why new ICTs played a role in Burkina Faso’s recent journey to socio-political change","Dragstra, F.","['Bruijn, M.E. de', 'Goede, M.J. de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"New ICTs, such as mobile phones and social media, are increasingly being seen as catalysers for political engagement, the spark of revolutions, or breaking power relations between political elites and the ‘information poor’. They have been centralised in the explanation of the Arab Spring and the wave of popular uprisings that occurred from 2010 onwards. It is safe to say that new ICTs indeed play a role in how information is spread and how people are mobilised for protest. However, the need for a reflection on why these new ICTs have a part in the outcome of uprisings within its respective context was often lacking. Moreover, it has often been left undiscussed what happens after a revolution or popular uprising. Is there actual social or political change, or does it often lead to an illusion or deception? New ICTs can prove to be extremely useful in mobilisation, the creation and spread of information and awakening a sense of political agency. Nevertheless, a country’s history, and its social, political and economic context might prove to be just as important when understanding the complexities of popular uprisings and their aftermath. This thesis discusses the case of Burkina Faso, where in the period of one year, the population rose up twice to demand change, justice and accountability. In October 2014, the Burkinabè massively hit the streets and within a ‘ten day revolution’ they ousted Blaise Compaoré who had been in power for 27 years. In September 2015, the Burkinabè again hit the streets to condemn a coup d’état that was executed by the former right-hand of Blaise Compaoré. Both uprisings were successful, meaning that those protesting achieved their short-term goals of ousting Blaise Compaoré and stopping a coup d’état. However, the question remains if they ensured change on the long-term and why new ICTs played a role in these successes. This thesis draws upon six months of extensive fieldwork in Burkina Faso and months of employing digital ethnographies, to understand if, why and how new ICTs played a role in the growth, outcome and aftermath of the Burkinabè uprisings. It argues that new ICTs played a major role in both uprisings because it brought together a collective of like-minded people and it ensured rapid mobilisation. However, we should be careful in putting them at the forefront of the explanation of political unrest and uprisings, because the socio-political context, historical background, existing political tensions and social structures may affect its effects.","['Burkina Faso', 'new ICTs', 'information', 'uprising', 'political agency', 'hybrid social movements', 'political memory', 'connective action', 'revolution', 'mobilisation']"

The phenomenon of fossilization in Second Language Acquisition: an analysis of the oral production of Dutch students in Italian.,"Introini, Sofia","['Odelli, Enrico']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Topic: In this thesis we will examine the oral production in Italian of Dutch students, in their second year of bachelor in Italian Language and Culture at Leiden University. According to the Common European Framework for Languages, the language proficiency of these students ranges between the B1 and B2 level and what will be analyzed is their linguistic accuracy, by spotting the presence of grammatical errors, in order to demonstrate that the peer review method can be efficiently used to contrast the risk of fossilization. Hypothesis: we would like to demonstrate that with the use of the peer review method in a second language learning environment, students will show improvements at a morph- syntactic level after having received feedback from their classmates and teacher. Therefore, it will also be possible to refute the theory according to which fossilization is an irreversible process. Methodology: The investigation will be done by listening to all the oral presentations of the students but also by reading the transcriptions, to make sure all the elements of interest will be included. The analysis will be realized into two discerned parts: first of all, because the field of morph-syntax is too wide to be analyzed in this context, a selected number of markers will be chosen according to their problematic nature for learners of Italian: prepositions and syntactic agreement. The second part of the analysis will focus on the comparison of the students’ performances before and after they received their feedback. This will be done with the help of a software, Wordsmith Tools, which will define the frequency of each marker before and after the feedback to determine if there has been an improvement or not.","['Linguistics', 'Second Language Acquisition', 'Italian']"

Listening to the Visual Arts,"Heylen, Lesley","['Bruyn, Eric de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the relation between image and sound in contemporary art, with particular reference to the role of sound in film and video art installations. The starting point of this research theme is the observation that the present-day museum and gallery spaces are no longer the silent institutions they once were with the presence of loudspeakers in many installations. This trend opens up the discussion of sound as an instrument in artistic film practices to specifically direct the attention of the viewer within the moving image. Therefore, the primary focus of this study is the investigation into the added value of listening to sound in the visual arts. An in-depth analysis of film and video art installations by artists Steve McQueen (Drum Roll, Western Deep), Anri Sala (Answer Me, Long Sorrow), Tacita Dean (Foley Artist, Sound Mirrors) and Luke Fowler (A Grammar for Listening) is aimed at uncovering the audiovisual strategies that the artists employ to elicit a specific mode of spectatorship: to activate the spectator in the exhibition space by means of a physical address as well as to affect the spectator on an affective or emotional level. This active model of spectatorship is eventually presented as audio-spectatorship, in which the viewer-listener is heavily affected by the physical address and the outcome of the sensory experience of the filmic artwork so that disinterested contemplation at a critical distance is ultimately no longer an option. Listening to the Visual Arts: The Added Value of Sound in Contemporary Film and Video Art is part of more general critical appraisal of the visual supremacy in the humanities.",['art sound film video audio-spectatorship']

Een leger in de woestijn,"Schut, Maarten","['Zangenberg, Jürgen']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De bevoorrading van het Legio X Fretensis tijdens hun belegering van Masada. “Masada zal niet nogmaals vallen.” - De conclusie van de eed van trouw van het Israëlische gepantserde korps. De heroïsche laatste verzetsdaad van de Joodse rebellen tegen de Romeinse overheersing is een belangrijke mythe in het Israëlische nationale bewustzijn. Hoewel historici het laatste verzet in de eerste eeuw na Chr. tegenwoordig in een ander licht zien spreekt deze laatste verzetsdaad tot de verbeelding. Het fort Masada vormde het laatste bolwerk van de rebellen en de (al dan niet historische) massazelfmoord door de inzittenden aan de vooravond van de bestorming vormt de climax van de opstand. Het verhaal van de Romeinse kant is echter minstens net zo interessant, gezien de zware beproevingen die de belegeraars te wachten stonden. Want waar de belegerden volop voedsel en water hadden in het indrukwekkende complex, was erbuiten niets te vinden dan zand en steen. Deze omgeving kon onmogelijk een Romeins leger gevoed hebben en het feit dat de Romeinen deze taak op zich namen is een bewijs van hun volharding tegen de rebellen en hun logistieke vaardigheden. De belegering vond waarschijnlijk plaats in het jaar 73 en de focus van dit onderzoek ligt op de duur van deze belegering. Voorgaande gebeurtenissen rond Masada zijn echter relevant en zullen hier ook betrokken worden. Masada, het omliggende land, nabijgelegen dorpen, en de water- en landwegen waarover de aanvoer van levensmiddelen plaats moet hebben gevonden vallen allemaal binnen de afbakening van dit onderzoek. Andere militaire operaties tijdens de opstand kunnen ten hoogste dienen als een bron over de Romeinse technieken en organisatie en zullen daarom geen grote rol spelen. De breedste afbakening van dit onderwerp omvat de Romeinse provincie Judaea over de gehele duur van de Joodse opstand. De hoofdzaak van dit onderzoek is de Romeinse bevoorrading van de troepen. Hoe was de bevoorrading van de Romeinse troepen en personeel georganiseerd tijdens het beleg van Masada? Dit onderzoek moet worden gezien in het grotere kader van de ontwikkelingen in het Romeinse systeem voor logistieke operaties. Het zal hierom een overwegend Romeins perspectief bieden op de gebeurtenissen. Onderzoek naar de belegering van- en logistiek rond Massada vanuit een Romeins militair perspectief is niet nieuw. Jodi Magness en Jonathan Roth hebben zulk onderzoek al gepleegd aan de hand van de archeologie, omdat Flavius Josephus, onze primaire bron, stil is over de logistiek van de operatie. Het doel hier is om een link te leggen tussen de literaire en archeologische bronnen met bestaande debatten over antieke logistiek zoals de rol van voedselimporten, waterwegen en landwegen. Dit vindt plaats via de analyse van deze logistieke operatie en de daaruit volgende implicaties voor de bredere context. Hierbij hanteer ik een kwantitatieve methode gebaseerd op de Romeinse logistieke tendensen en de situatie die zich te Masada voort deed. Dit onderzoek naar het beleg van Masada kan als een casestudie dienen naar de limieten van de Romeinse logistiek. Als eerste behandelt dit onderzoek de context: Het Romeinse logistieke systeem en de unieke omstandigheden rond het beleg van Masada. Twee belangrijke vragen die centraal staan voor de beantwoording van de hoofdvraag luiden als volgt: Hoeveel voorraden hadden de belegeraars nodig? En: is het realistisch dat de regio de belegering op zichzelf kon voorzien? Om de eerste vraag te kunnen beantwoorden is het nodig om de schaal van de belegering en de tijdsduur ervan vast te stellen. Aan de hand van het antwoord op de tweede 4 vraag is het al dan niet nodig delen van de rest van het rijk in de discussie te betrekken. Hier komt een logische volgorde van deelonderwerpen uit voort, namelijk: De schaal en duur van de operatie, de totale consumptie, de bronnen van deze goederen en ten slotte het transport. Een belangrijke consequentie van deze factoren is in hoeverre de overschotten uit Sardinië, Sicilië, Egypte en andere delen van het rijk aangewend moesten worden voor deze belegering. De deelvragen hebben ieder een aantal onderwerpen dat behandeld moet worden. De schaal en duur van de belegering behandelt de hoeveelheden troepen, ondersteunend personeel, intensiteit van het beleg en de lengte van de belegering. Onder de totale consumptie vallen vragen over het dieet van de belegeraars, de lichamelijke activiteit tijdens het beleg en de daaruit volgende benodigdheden in tonnen voedsel, hout en water. Om te bepalen uit welke gebieden deze voorraden aangevoerd werden gaan we kort in op de ecologie van de regio aan de hand van archeologie. De lokale voorraden alleen volstonden absoluut niet en het onderzoek zal daarom ook de omliggende regio's hierin betrekken. De verwoestingen door de rebellen en de Romeinen spelen een grote rol in de schattingen aangezien ze een grote impact hadden op het draagvermogen van de regio. Betreffende het transport moeten we de gevolgde routes achterhalen, de rol van de draagdieren analyseren, de consumptie van deze dieren onderzoeken en als laatste moet het transport over rivieren moet behandeld worden. Sommige van deze onderwerpen sluiten van nature aan bij onderwerpen van deelvragen ervoor of erna. Zo sluit het onderwerp over de intensiteit van de belegering aan op de lichamelijke activiteit van de soldaten en een bespreking van de aanvoer uit andere provincies leidt tot vragen over de gebruikte routes die door de aanvoerlinies gevolgd werden. Hieruit volgt de structuur van dit onderzoek. Moderne onderzoeken naar de eerste Joodse opstand tegen het Romeinse gezag zijn noodzakelijkerwijs afhankelijk van de werken van Josephus als literaire bronnen. Andere literaire bronnen spelen vooral een aanvullende rol. Hoewel archeologische bronnen ons veel vertellen over de belegering van Masada zal dit onderzoek ze plaatsen in een context die gebaseerd is op het schrijven van Josephus. Omdat dit onderzoek zich richt op de militaire logistiek en een specifieke belegering waar veel archeologisch onderzoek naar is verricht, zullen deze bronnen wel een grote rol spelen bij het beantwoorden van de hoofdvraag. Naast deze primaire bronnen zullen secundaire bronnen een grote rol spelen bij de interpretatie van de primaire bronnen. Josephus schreef in de eerste eeuw na Chr. maar was zelf niet aanwezig te Masada. Josephus wilde de schuld van de opstand in de schoenen schuiven van een vierde stroming binnen het Jodendom. In deze context beschrijft hij ook de drie gangbare stromingen, namelijk de Farizeeën, de Sadduceeën en de Essenen.1 Josephus verdoezelt soms fouten die door belangrijke Romeinen werden gemaakt maar hij zal niets hebben geschreven dat tegengesproken zou kunnen worden door leden van de Romeinse hoge elite, waarvan enkelen zich in de militaire staf van Vespasianus bevonden.2 Hij wilde zijn eigen handelen goedpraten, Titus en Vespasianus een goede naam geven en de Romeinen informeren over de redenen voor de opstand onder de Joden. 1 J.

Firstly, it will explore British, American, Chinese and Japanese NS’ social acceptance of L2L and whether L2L may be accepted as new NS. Secondly, it will relate which linguistic requirements NS find of more salience in L2L’ speech. The conducted experiment partly supported the proposed hypothesis. Regarding social acceptance, the results indicated that the ‘Western’ participants were more socially accepting of foreigners and would be more likely to welcome L2L as new NS than the ‘Eastern’ NS. However, in case of the language requirements the results did not support the hypothesis as the ‘Western’ participants also rated being capable of general communication as the most salient language requirement for L2L. For both the ‘Eastern’ and ‘Western’ participants acquiring a perfect accent was the least important linguistic goal for L2L. Ultimately, the outcomes of this research may not be regarded as truly reflecting ‘Eastern’ and ‘Western’ views on social acceptance and language requirements of L2L as the sample of this research was unfortunately not considerable. Also, attitudes regarding social acceptance may undergo rapid change due to personal experiences and moods. Therefore, this study may be regarded as a guideline for further research since a study on a much larger scale may truly reflect upon social acceptance of L2L and language requirements NS set for L2L.","['Native-speakers', 'L2L', 'identity', 'attitudes', 'language', 'socio-linguistics']"

This thesis investigates the subversive nature of these myths in a literary analysis of three dystopian novels by women authors published in this period. It also draws on the key ideas of major women theorists central to feminism’s ‘second wave’. Examining the dystopias of Angela Carter’s Heroes and Villains (1969), Pamela Kettle’s The Day of the Women (1969) and Emma Tennant’s The Time of the Crack (1973), I argue that that the possibilities open to the female characters to (re)claim their womanhood are not only undermined by their inability to recognize the deceptive facets of the myths of femininity fabricated in patriarchal societies, but also by their own unwillingness to renounce the dubious privileges that these myths bestow on the stereotypical female.","['Dystopia', 'Feminism', 'Myth']"

The literary sources (the Vita Severi, Libanius' letters and the correspondence between Libanius and Basil of Caesarea) show us that the law school of Berytus is a centre of social mobility and religious freedom. In the Roman society of the fourth and fifth century jurists gain power while sophists have less to say. Meanwhile, Christianity rises and Christian intellectuals have to defend their traditional education. Why would a true Christian still study Homer? In the end, education is presented as the first step towards the higher truth of Christian doctrine.

MIPVU was developed to provide a reliable tool to detect linguistic metaphors and therefore to contribute to the comparability of results within the research field (Steen et al., 2010). It was initially designed for English and is currently in the process of being adjusted to several languages other than English. After outlining the core of Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), which is the dominant theory in this field, the guidelines of MIPVU as well as its predecessor Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP) (Pragglejaz Group, 2007) will be introduced. The thesis then discusses operationalization issues and how to handle them, such as the implications of the reference tool, the German dictionary Duden, which poses challenges mainly because of different forms of cross-referencing. Afterwards, language-specific issues in respect to demarcate lexical units are demonstrated and accompanied by guidelines how to treat them for analysis, e.g. for compositional verbs in distanced position, infinitival constructions with a verb component, reflexive verbs, and novel compositions. Overall, MIPVU is applicable to German by taking into account additional guidelines caused by the dictionary used and the nature of the more inflected language German.","['metaphor identification', 'linguistic metaphor', 'MIPVU', 'methodology', 'German']"
