The Representation of the Hokusai Style in Ehon Saishiki Tsū,"Schilling, Christiaan","['Smits, I.B.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Katsushika Hokusai (1760–1849) or 'Hokusai' for short, ukiyo-e or Japanese woodblock artist renowned for the print 'The Great Wave' (1830-32), published a year before his death the painting manual 'Ehon Saishiki Tsū' or 'On the Use of Colouring' (1848). In this study I will pose the question of how Hokusai represented his drawing style in Ehon Saishiki Tsū, focussing on how Hokusai explained his use of lines. Ehon Saishiki Tsū has not yet been studied from this perspective. Most studies have focused on the usage of color or pigments in his paintings, which Hokusai gives instructions about in this manual. This study is relevant to art historians and connoisseurs of Japanese art as it puts emphasis on Hokusai's style and how he has represented it through Ehon Saishiki Tsū. In it I have found that Hokusai's explanation on how to draw waterfalls is an example of his realistic style of drawing we see in his middle and late period. Hokusai's way of presenting his explanations exemplify how he has positioned himself as an experienced artist who uses the medium of painting manuals to transmit his experience to his audience: the inexperienced student of art.","['Hokusai', 'Ukiyo-e', 'Style', 'Painting Manuals', 'Ehon Saishiki Tsū', 'Painting', 'Drawing', 'Use of Line']"

A representação indígena através da lente de Corumbiara (2009),"leersum, Sara van","['Brandellero, Sara']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,pt,"O presente trabalho se propõe analisar a função da câmera do vídeo documentário Corumbiara (2009) de Vincent Carelli, e o relacionamento com a formação da imagem indígena, dentro do contexto do projeto audiovisual Vídeo nas Aldeias (VNA). No projeto Vídeo nas Aldeias o artefato expõe um papel fundamental enquanto à representação do índio, pois além de entender a câmera como um espelho que reflete o ponto de vista dos nativos, de mesmo modo serve como uma arma política que pretende desconstruir a visão negativa e estereotipada dos indígenas no Brasil. Contudo, em Corumbiara a câmera expõe outros papeis: primeiramente observa-se o artefato como uma arma de documentação e de denúncia, sem embargo a câmera se entende também como uma arma de invasão e de exploração. Enquanto a metodologia desta tese, para analisar a utilidade da câmera se estudaram dois trechos do longa-metragem. Em primeiro lugar se analisará a cena onde o narrador Vincent Carelli e sua equipe depara com os índios Kanoê, e finalmente a cena onde o grupo estabelece contato com a enigmática figura do “índio do buraco”. Enquanto a aproximação deste trabalho do ponto de vista teórico, o cerne da dissertação aponta para o tema da representação do “Outro”, como o sujeito é “tipificado” antes de ser “estereotipado” por outro sujeito (Hall, The Spectacle of the Other, 257). A teoria da representação que alude Stuart Hall em seu livro Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices (1997) considera-se uns dos fundamentos desta dissertação, visto que sua abordagem multifacetada sobre o tema da identidade e representação facilita o aprofundamento de outras teorias cujo foco é expor a identidade –ou a representação– dos índios. Por outro lado, Robert Stam, revela em seu livro Tropical Multiculturalism (1997) o surgimento da mídia indígena no Brasil, fenômeno que nas últimas décadas tem-se popularizado dentro do âmbito antropológico, mas também cinematográfico.","['Função da câmera', 'identidade', 'indígenas', 'Vídeo nas Aldeias', 'Corumbiara']"

Framed Beyond History: the curatorial practices of the exhibition Crisis of History #3 as alternative approach to framing contemporary visual art from Iran and beyond,"Wegman, Simone","['Zijlmans, C.J.M.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the exhibition-tryptic Crisis of History held at the gallery space Framer Framed in Amsterdam in 2014-2015. It investigates how its practices can be regarded as innovative in shaping discourses on contemporary art. The exhibition looks critically at how ‘non-Western’ art has been dealt with in exhibition practices as well as in academic discourses and aims to present alternative visions. I have used the notions minor curating by Cotter and histoire croisée by Werner and Zimmermann, as well as Keshmirshekan’s critical history of contemporary art of Iran to conceptualise the exhibition practices of Crisis of History’s curators Robert Kluijver and Elham Puriyamehr. I have particularly zoomed-in on part #3 of the triptych as the layering of perspectives is most clearly visible here. The exhibition practices include strategies of self-representation, intellectual artistic positioning and open-endedness due to the equal importance of exhibition display and public programming. The use of the artworks, the offering of multiple and layered voices deployed in the exhibition practice shows how the interaction between theory, curatorial visions and artistic imagining of alternative pasts and futures brings the field of contemporary art forward in articulating visions towards the development of an inclusive art history.","['Global art', 'Contemporary art', 'Exhibition practices', 'Institutional critique', 'World Art Studies', 'Iran', 'Framer Framed']"

Sommige auteurs wensen alleen een modale gebruiksmogelijkheid toe te kennen aan het werkwoord, terwijl anderen juist stellen dat zullen ook een zuiver temporeel gebruik kent. De vraag die aan het onderzoek ten grondslag ligt, is of zullen een modaal of (ook) een temporeel hulpwerkwoord is. Om antwoord te geven op deze vraag is eerst de status quo van de Nederlandse traditie beschreven, waarna er een analyse is gemaakt in termen van Langackers cognitieve grammatica. Deze analyse, en de analyses uit de Nederlandstalige traditie, zijn vervolgens gebruikt om de gebruiksmogelijkheden die naar voren kwamen uit het corpusonderzoek te verklaren. Hieruit bleek dat de meeste bestaande analyses onvoldoende geëquipeerd waren om rekenschap af te dragen voor alle gebruiksmogelijkheden. Het beschrijven van (de gebruiksmogelijkheden van) zullen in termen van Langacker bleek een vruchtbare aanpak, die alle gebruiksmogelijkheden uit het corpus kon verklaren.

Memory Matters: An Analysis of the Relation between Memory and Materiality in Contemporary Art,"Kan, Amy","['Alphen, E.J. van']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis intends to explore the relation between memory and matter, through an analysis of contemporary art. The research begins with an investigation of the meaning of memory and explores alternatives to this understanding, as proposed by major theorists in the field of cultural memory studies. These alternatives are then further researched through an analysis of the work by Gabriel Orozco, Anish Kapoor and Navid Nuur. Their work will function as case studies in which certain artworks are related to the comprehension of memory as proposed in the first chapter. Through the study of the performative, transformative and evocative qualities of the artworks, the affect and agency of art will be revealed. These analyses will include an exploration of the connection between memory and matter, as it uses new materialist's notions to reconsider the idea of memory. Through applying a new methodology into an existing field of research, this thesis intends to spark thought for the reconsideration of notions that we take for granted. Ultimately this thesis aims to reevaluate what we know about memory, objects of memory and art.","['Contemporary Art', 'Cultural Memory', 'Affect', 'New Materialism']"

Spoiler Alert: Processing of Sentence Final Particles in Dutch,"Tulling, Maxime","['Pablos Robles, Leticia', 'Gryllia, Stella']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Sentence final particles (SFPs) play an important role in the every-day spoken communication of various languages. For example, the addition of a Dutch intentional particle hè or hoor to a bare declarative utterance such as het is lekker weer ‘the weather is great’ can make the difference between the sentence being interpreted as an agreement-seeking question, or a correction. Still, we know very little about the psycho- and neurolinguistic properties of the processing and production of final particles. The purpose of this thesis is to generate more research on the psycholinguistics side and to deepen the theoretical knowledge we have by gathering experimental data. There are theoretical reasons to assume that intentional SFPs play an important role from the beginning of sentence formulation. The SFP-head selects for the entire proposition as its complement, so it is possible that speakers plan the particle ahead before they start producing the rest of the sentence. This hypothesis also makes sense from a psycholinguistic perspective, as it is presumed that the intention of the speaker is already determined before he/she starts uttering a sentence. In this thesis, I focus on sentences in isolation, and investigate the production, planning and perception of Dutch pragmatic particles (i.e. SFPs) that convey the speaker’s intention. The question I pursued to answer is whether Dutch sentence final particles are planned in advance, or whether they are inserted at the final moment. To investigate the potential planning of intentional SFPs I conducted three experiments. In a production experiment (Experiment 1) I investigated whether the speaker already starts encoding the intention of the message with prosodic cues preceding the intentional particle. Such cues would indicate that the speaker is already building up the illocutionary force of the sentence before the particle. Results indicate that there are such cues, and that even though they are sometimes quite small, they are used quite consistently across participants. In Experiment 2, the gating-technique is used in a perception experiment to investigate whether these prosodic cues preceding the particle could possibly help the listener anticipate for the intention or attitude expressed by an utterance. The results of this experiment indicate that participants were not that good at anticipating the end of sentences containing the final particles hè and hoor in the given task. Experiment 3 directly addresses the question whether the speaker plans a final particle ahead or whether they integrate the particle at a later stage of production. This question is about how incremental and how far ahead a sentence is planned in production. In this experiment, I examined the production process of the intentional SFPs hè and hoor in Dutch with a variant on the picture-word-interference task to investigate whether the particles are planned in advance, or not. I created an experiment that manipulates the prime preceding colored pictures, which are associated in a training task with a particular final element. The target condition of the experiment contains sentences with the final elements hè and hoor, which are intentional final particles. The effect of the distractor prime on the target condition was compared to a control condition. A congruent prime was assumed to facilitate sentence production at speech onset, only if the speaker is already planning the particle congruent with the prime. In the control conditions, in which it is assumed that speakers are not yet planning ahead for the final element of the sentence at speech onset, facilitation was assumed not to take place at speech onset. The results obtained for this experiment were not significant, due to high standard deviations. In future research it would be interesting to see whether the paradigm of this experiment could be adjusted, to gain more reliable results that can answer the main question we pursued.","['discourse particles', 'prosody', 'sentence planning', 'intentionality', 'linearization']"
China: The Rogue Donor. An analysis of aid allocation policies of an emerging donor.,"Wagenvoord, Jessica","[""O'Malley, Alanna""]",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The group of non-traditional bilateral aid donors is growing. Among these non-traditional donors are emerging donors, which can be characterized as countries which are both donor and recipient of aid. Emerging donor’s motives for aid provision are largely disputed. China, among others, is accused of acting out of self-interest, harming sustainable development and supporting rogue states. According to some estimates, China has become the second largest bilateral donor, and it is therefore an important player in the aid landscape. This study is aimed to clarify what China’s aid motives are and how they change over time. An analysis of policy documents and announcements present the official aid motives. An Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis of data provided by AidData (2016) allows for an examination of actual aid allocation. The results indicate that there is a discrepancy between the official and actual aid motives. The results also show that, between 2000 and 2014, China decided which countries would receive aid based on economic and strategic (self) interests. Among those countries which receive aid, the commitment was larger when the population was more in need. Strategic interests became more important over time whereas humanitarian needs became less important. Future research is needed before these results can be generalized and a consensus for all emerging donors can be established.","['China', 'Development aid', 'aid motives', 'donor', 'recipient']"

Immoral art: the interdependency between the moral and the Aesthetic,"Ekkelenkamp, Mariëlle","['Chouraqui, Frank']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The controversy surrounding the emergence of what some might call ‘immoral’ art ignites new discussions about the separation between art and life. Art seen as isolated from our normal moral lives does not seem to be the proper subject of moral evaluation. The autonomy we ascribe to art creates a gap between art and morality (or reality) that hinges respectively on purely aesthetic values and purely moral values. In return, this gap submits art to a distance from moral life where the production and enjoyment of art are radically a-moral or un-real. Moral considerations, then, cannot be properly invoked in aesthetic criticism. But how can we explain the phenomenon of immoral art without referring to moral values or disvalues? Moreover, the claim that a connection or continuity between art and life can result in immoral art corrupting our minds is highly debatable. The character of most healthy adults is resistant to moral debasement because of the level of absorption that plastic art can achieve. Consequently, it would seem that the formula “good art implies good morals, bad morals means bad art,” is outdated. For this thesis it will be taken for granted that morality can constitute the subject matter of art about which we can then make moral judgements. This paves the way for a potential intimate relation between moral and aesthetic values. It will be argued that the interdependency between the moral and the Aesthetic is one where a negative moral evaluation can translate into a positive Aesthetic evaluation; immorality can positively influence Aesthetic merit. Joel-Peter Witkin's photograph A Day in the Country (1993) will be used to make this claim credible.",['immorality art Witkin aesthetics']

The Changing Cultural Perceptions of Love and Romance.

However, society and the social-cultural norms governing it have changed immensely since the nineteenth-century world of Pride and Prejudice, it is therefore more than likely that a modern contemporary audience, without any social-historical or cultural background, would not fully understand the social and cultural setting of the novel. Furthermore, the practice of and ideas surrounding translation also underwent great change. This thesis researches whether the changes in socio-cultural norms and perceptions are noticeable in diachronic research of romantic literature in translation, on either a linguistic (stylistic) or cultural level, by conducting a comparative study of Dutch translations of Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.","['Austen', 'Pride and Prejudice', 'translation', 'culture', 'style', 'Holmes', 'retranslation theory', 'linguistic context', 'stylistic analysis', 'comparative']"

From Machiya to Akiya: Place and Identity in Contemporary Art,"Kleinjan, Lisanne Sophie","['Machotka, Ewa']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Recently in Japan, regional art projects have been organized in ancient townhouses called machiya. This is part of a larger tendency in Japan since the 2000s whereby local governments and organizations work together in setting up art projects with historical preservation as a goal. In this thesis, I will investigate two of these art projects named 'Nara Machiya Art Festival Hanarart' in Nara prefecture and the 'Tatsuno Art Project' in Tatsuno city, Hyogo prefecture. Both of these projects seem to emphasize a certain nostalgia towards machiya by carrying out the theme of 'memories', suggesting that inviting people to machiya through art may give them a consciousness towards the history of these buildings. In this thesis I will analyze the artworks by two participating artists named Imamura Ryosuke (1982-) and Takeda Riki (1983-) and question in what way their works respond to machiya and its memories. Then I will suggest that these participating artists employ the theme of ' memories' in ways that offer a different approach of the machiya exhibition spaces than being suggested by the organizing commissions. They are able to trigger individual responses among viewers that are not so much nostalgic, but rather firmly located in the present, which will eventually lead to the creation of many new ' identities' of the ancient Japanese houses.",['akiya machiya place identity displacement memory contemporary art']

In studying the nature of this sign, the scholar of Luwian will be better able to understand the phonetic and phonological system of Hieroglyphic Luwian, and to connect it to that of Proto-Anatolian and Proto-Indo-European. The paper will begin with an extended introduction detailing the historical position and linguistic features of the Luwian languages, as well as a brief discussion of the Anatolian Hieroglyphic script. Following this, data reflecting the distribution of the  sign in the corpus will be presented alongside a discussion of the sign's linguistic environments.

The Giant Wakes Up – The Front National’s Politicisation Strategy and the French Eurosceptic Punch in the 2014 European Parliament Elections,"Gachet, Emma","['Oster, Jan']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The European Parliament elections in the spring of 2014 witnessed the victory of eurosceptic far right parties, especially in France, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Consequently, the incredible ascent of eurosceptic attitudes in the public debate has put the question of the causes of such a development at the forefront of European Union studies. Academia has identified a multiplicity of factors for the formation of eurosceptic attitudes in EU member-states. Indeed, causes for popular anti-EU feelings range from identity attachment, rational economic calculus, level of education, social transnationalism, and reception of political cues. Party-based euroscepticism is conceived to be the result of ideological positioning and politicisation strategies by extreme parties on the political spectrum to reap electoral mandates and gain visibility. The present study offers a general model for political thought formation by approaching euroscepticism as a narrative exercised in the public sphere. Anti-EU discourse is mutually constructed by party competition in the national political arena, the media filter and public civil society. The case study of the Front National’s campaign in 2014, reveals that the party used populist tactics, such as an anti-elite stance, to capture the popular vote. The incorporation of EU issues into its ideological rationale, embodying the defence of national sovereignty, cultural homogeneity and economic self-determination, has amplified the anti-EU discourse in public debate. Yet, populist strategies of the Front National are insufficient in explaining French eurosceptic attitudes. They evolve in a particular climate whereby a narrative of decline is sustained by the media, which taps into individual feelings of insecurity in social, cultural and economic terms.","['Euroscepticism', 'Front National', 'Far Right', '2014 European Parliament Elections', 'Party Strategy', 'Populism', 'Cueing Effect', 'Politicisation']"

Dutch Particle Exclamatives,"Martens, Gouming","['Cheng, L.L.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Ever since Elliott’s (1974) seminal work on exclamatives in English, formal linguists have dealt with questions such as how to formally characterize exclamatives, which components contribute to exclamativity and how many components are involved. In the literature there are several different approaches to exclamative constructions. Some have argued that exclamatives are semantically derived from questions (Guti´errez-Rexach, 1996; Zanuttini and Portner, 2003), others, however, derive exclamatives from degree constructions (Rett, 2008). Then there are some accounts claiming that exclamatives are derived from neither one of the two. Chernilovskaya and Nouwen (2012) for instance, claim that noteworthy evaluation is most crucial to exclamatives. The current thesis will follow Chernilovskaya and Nouwen (2012) by claiming that noteworthiness is a crucial component of exclamatives. This thesis aims at getting a better understanding of exclamative constructions. It makes an attempt to identify the components that are crucial to exclamative constructions and explain how each component semantically contributes to exclamativity. To do so, I examine Dutch particle exclamatives and define its characteristic components. These constructions consist of a first person singular pronoun me and a modal particle toch, as in, for example, the sentence Hij heeft me toch een boel auto’s! ‘Boy, does he have a lot of cars!’. Interestingly, unlike any other pronoun, the me pronoun in exclamative constructions occurs invariably in first person singular form and therefore has no other paradigmatic forms. I argue that this me pronoun is semantically distinct from all other pronouns in that it marks ego-evidentiality. Such being the case, the me particle indicates that the source of the content is the actual speaker him/herself or in other words the EGO. As a direct consequence of ego-evidentiality, the exclamative proposition becomes veridical, that is to say that whatever the speaker’s opinion is, it should be assumed to be true according to his/her perceptive world. To simplify matters, I have taken veridicality to be equal to factivity. The modal particle toch in isolation indicates an inconsistency with the common ground (Hogeweg et al., 2011), a notion we see back in the semantics of toch in exclamative constructions. I take the exclamative toch to be the overt realization of widening, a concept introduced by Zanuttini and Portner (2003). According to Zanuttini and Portner (2003) widening can be characterized as an operation extending the domain of a certain proposition to a wider domain which lies beyond what is expected. My concept of widening, however, slightly differs from Zanuttini and Portner’s concept of widening as I will incorporate the notion of noteworthiness, as defined by Chernilovskaya and Nouwen (2012), as well as a non-specificity requirement (a notion to some extent comparable to Rett’s (2008) degree restriction). By doing so, I am able to account for a wider range of exclamative constructions. The interaction of these two particles gives rise to exclamativity. It can be concluded that lexically the particle exclamatives consist of two components: an ego-evidentiality marker me and a widening marker toch. Semantically, it consists of factivity and widening. At the end of this thesis I examine to what extent this analysis is applicable to another Dutch exclamative construction, namely wh-exclamatives and how such analysis relates to the more general literature on exclamative constructions.","['Exclamatives', 'Particle Exclamatives', 'Widening', 'Ego-evidentiality', 'Dutch Exclamatives', 'Modal Particles', 'Personal Pronouns']"

Extremely Similar & Incredibly Different: Measuring the retention of style in the Dutch translation of Foer's Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"Bok, Mirjam Corinda","['Dorst, Lettie']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The main aim of this thesis was to establish whether strong reactions such as ‘Oskar would never say that!’ and ‘That’s just plain wrong!’ to the official Dutch translation of the novel Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (Foer, 2005) could be caused by a loss of style in the translation. In order to measure the retention of style in the translation, a translation quality assessment tool that focusses solely on style was needed. However, such a tool did not exist. Instead it was opted to adapt a translation method that prioritises style. Such a method was found in Bovelander’s 2015 style-centred translation approach. The Bovelander method includes a thorough stylistic analysis followed by the selection of translation procedures that should be used to retain style (a greenlist) as well as a listing of procedures that should be avoided because they would cause a loss of style (a blacklist). These procedures are pivotal in the adapted Bovelander method: a comparative reading of the source text and target text that reveals which procedures were used during the translation process. If blacklisted procedures occur considerably more often than greenlisted procedures, then there is a loss of style. The adapted Bovelander method suggested a severe loss of style in the Dutch translation of Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (Foer, 2005), which might indeed explain the strong reactions to the translation voiced by a number of translation students.","['translation', 'style', 'stylistics', 'Bovelander', 'translation quality assessment']"

“Men Should Know How To Maintain and the Women Should Know How to Settle” The Role and Position of Women by Women Artists in Turkey from the Tanzimat Period until Contemporary Turkey: with Two Case Studies of Major Exhibitions in 1993 and 2011,"Selin Zeynep, Esen","['Zijlmans, C.J.M.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis will consist of two parts and three chapters. The first part will start with an overview of women artist in Turkey between the 1830’s and the 1990’s. The 1830’s are The Tanzimat Period15 of the Ottoman Empire, which is the starting point of modernization in social and political life. This modernization has resulted in women becoming more visible in the social life and started to be educated in arts. The second chapter will focus on the Dream and Reality exhibition organized by Istanbul Modern Museum. I will also evaluate these exhibitions in terms of two types of museums that Eilean Hooper-Greenhill describes in her book Museums and the Interpretation of Visual Culture. Hooper- Greenhill categorizes museums in two; fist being the modernist museum and the second is the post museum. The main distinction between them is, the modern museum focuses more on crating grand narrative sand educating the society. The post museum is more about the experience of the visitor and museum aims to create a space for different perspectives and values to be discussed. One of the aims of my thesis is to contribute to the museum studies in Turkey by bringing the concept of post museum into the discourse. I will try to prove that Istanbul Modern is a post museum through its permanent collection, its temporary exhibitions and also with its educational programs. The exhibition will be analyzed in detail and compared with the 1993 Female Artists exhibition. The second part of this thesis will focus on the three major issues these women artists are focusing on: women as the symbol of modernity in Turkey; gender and body; and also identity derived from and tested against artworks from the Dream and Reality exhibition under discussion.","['Turkish Women Artist', 'Contemporaray Art', 'Modernity', 'Post-Museum', 'Modern Museum']"
Between Nation and Gender: The representation of former military comfort women in the Netherlands and South Korea,"Boetzelaer, Tibo van","['Mark, Ethan']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"By comparing historical narratives that coincided in WW II, I intend to examine how the national identities of the Netherlands and South Korea contrasted with one another and illustrate how the former Comfort Women have been represented within their own social constructs thereafter. A crucial reason for partaking in a historical comparison, between the Netherlands and South Korea, is to combine a lesser documented case with a case which has received substantially more coverage in academia and the media. By examining historical events, I propose to shift the perspective from gaining formal recognition and compensation from the Japanese government, which is often the point of view in the media and an often discussed topic by academics, to instead: How were the former Comfort Women treated and represented by their own society after WW II? It is important to examine the Comfort Women Issue from a different perspective because the perspective of the society of which the former Comfort Women are a part of, holds as much significance in historical terms of accountability as the issue of the Japanese government’s reticence to offer satisfactory recompense.","['Comfort Women', 'World War II', 'Nation', 'Gender', 'Representation', 'Memory', 'Identity', 'Netherlands', 'South Korea', 'Japanese Imperialism']"

The non-Latin lexis in the cooking terminology of Anthimus' De Observatione Ciborum.,"Verhagen, Veerle Pauline","['Kerkhof, Peter Alexander']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The 'Epistula de observatione ciborum ad theudericum regem francorum', or in short ‘De observatione ciborum’, written by the Byzantine physician Anthimus, is a treatise from the early sixth century, addressed to the Frankish king Theuderic. It concerns which foodstuffs do and do not fit a healthy lifestyle, and includes preparation methods for all food items that are discussed in the work. The tractate has long drawn scholars’ attention for its peculiar style and language. Written in a much more colloquial style than was usual, de observatione ciborum also contains a fairly large amount of non-Latin lexis. The aim of this thesis is to examine some of that lexis. Whilst Anthimus’ language has been researched and analysed in the past, this research focuses on the cooking terminology only. Moreover, it includes only words that appear to have been introduced into Latin relatively recently, possibly under the influence of the new peoples that had moved into the traditional Latin speaking area. Thus, it aims to sketch an image of the linguistic situation of the time and place in which Anthimus composed his epistula de observatione ciborum. The focus of the linguistic research is on the etymology and provenance of the included lemmata.","['etymology', 'language contact', 'de observatione ciborum', 'linguistics', 'loanwords', 'Latin', 'Vulgar Latin', 'late Latin', 'Anthimus']"

Adjectival Ordering in English and Dutch in the Light of Recent Theories of Noun Phrases,"Jansen, Charissa","['Lipták, A.K.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis reports about two studies on what the preferred order of stacked adjectives is in noun phrases, according to native speakers of English and Dutch. Recent theoretical research on this topic (Scott 2002, Truswell 2004, 2009, Szendrői 2010, 2013) use this domain of investigation as a basis for theoretical claims concerning the nature of adjectives (being specifiers vs. adjuncts) and NP-internal displacement, but they seriously lack when it comes to reporting about native speaker consultation about the data. This thesis aims to fill this gap by presenting the results of two online questionnaire studies of adjectival ordering, specifically testing the proposals above against native speaker judgements in two contexts: noun phrases with neutral orders and those with contrastive contexts. The results predominantly validate the findings of Truswell (2004, 2009) as opposed to those of Scott (2002) when it comes to neutral orders, and the claims of Szendrői (2010, 2013) as opposed to Truswell (2005) when it comes to contrastive orders. This in turn suggests that (i) adjectives should not be thought of as specifiers but rather as adjuncts, and (ii) some types of A-bar displacement in noun phrases are optional.","['adjectival ordering', 'adjectives', 'intersective adjectives', 'subsective adjective']"

Dora Bohn, was a member of the Bohn family of booksellers and publishers active in nineteenth-century Haarlem. The album is a poetry book, known in the Netherlands as ‘poesiealbum’, at the time traditionally offered to young girls to keep memories of their youth. The remarkable longevity of this album with a span of 23 years, from 1861 to 1884, expands its significance beyond the recording of friendships. It contains handwritten inscriptions by members of her family and by a network of friends, including the family’s professional contacts. The album reveals certain aspects of the multiple relations that linked the professional society of Haarlem, at that time known as the centre of the publishing industry in the Netherlands, with the family firms working within a network of professional and personal bonds. The edition aims mainly to map Dora Bohn’s network of family, friends and acquaintances, the literature popular in this network and the related authors, and the story of her life as it is recorded in the album.","['album amicorum', 'Dorothea Bohn', 'poesiealbum', 'publishers', 'edition', 'pastor-poets', 'romanticism', 'Bohn family', 'literature']"

When CRISPR Meets Art. The Experience of Relationality Through the Affective Agency of Matter,"Pet, Lotte","['Zwijnenberg, Robert']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis I discuss the way art can be fruitful to the conversation about human enhancement that is sparked by the development of the genetic engineering technique called CRISPR. Drawing on theories by Brian Massumi, Georges Bataille, Michel Serres, Rosi Braidotti, Andrew Lapworth and Karen Barad, I argue that bioart has the ability to show that our existence is in its core relational and that this awareness is of importance to an alternate scientific and ethical attitude. I relate this to artworks made by Stelarc, Adam Zaretsky, Revital Cohen, Critical Art Ensemble, Paul Vanouse, Faith Wilding, Kathy High and Eduardo Kac, and show how the agency of their material works provide different epistemological frameworks. Whereas in daily life things and phenomena are often treated as separated but clearly defined and therefore understandable entities, in the projects of these artists the complex and muddy notion of intersubjectivity as a process of becoming is centralized. The incorporation of art in discussions about technological innovations like CRISPR is therefore significant due to its focus on inclusion in contrast to methods of exclusion. The diverse viewpoints that are present in the human enhancement debate exemplify that finding the right definition of what is at stake sometimes cannot be achieved through language and representations. Instead, it has to be known through art’s affective happening in which different desires, implications and heuristic models all find their affirmation.","['Bioart', 'CRISPR', 'Human enhancement', 'Genetic engineering', 'Relationality', 'Affect', 'Agency of matter']"

At present research that engages with the social and cultural impact of albinism in Africa in general and Malawi in specific appears to be limited and this study contributes to a very limited body of knowledge in the field of albinism in Africa. The aims of this research are threefold: to learn about the views and knowledge of people with albinism and other actors in their social environment (family members, medical personnel, teachers, students and randomly chosen citizens); to explore the relationships persons affected by the condition have with other people; and to create a better understanding of how albinism is perceived in a Malawian context. Based on semi-structured interviews, observations, a newspaper analysis and a survey, this study found out that the social position of persons with albinism in Malawi can be characterised as challenging. Besides physical implications, such as high skin sensitivity and low vision, the condition also has social implications since persons with albinism often face stigma and discrimination from others in society. In addition to these implications that have already been identified in previous studies about albinism in Africa, including Braathen (2005), this research reveals that persons with albinism in Malawi are currently subjected to violence because of the belief that their body parts bring luck and prosperity when used in witchcraft practices. The current study concludes that the social position of persons with albinism has changed significantly during the last decade and that the quality of life of people with the condition is nowadays worse than that of the average Malawian.","['albinism', 'stigma and discrimination', 'violence', 'Malawi', 'Sub-Saharan Africa']"

The Literature Review section will define rhetoric, persuasion, style and stylistics. It will review Churchill’s style according to scholars, and will analyse and define the five principles of “The Scaffolding of Rhetoric” (Correctness of Diction, Rhythm, Accumulation of Argument, Analogy and Wild Extravagance) and review how Churchill employed these principles according to scholars. The Methodology section will explain the reason for the selection of four speeches (“Blood, Toils, Tears and Sweat”, “Fight on the Beaches”, “Finest Hour”, and “The Few”) for analysis, and the approach on how these five principles are analysed in this paper. The Results Chapter will show all the results from the different analyses from the individual speeches. The most important results is the increase in mono-, and disyllabic words, the increase in sentence length, and the increase in use and complexity of both imagery and analogy in the climax and closing paragraphs. The Discussion Chapter will discuss the results, show the limitations of the paper, and will conclude that the results from the analyses show that Churchill used his principles from “The Scaffolding of Rhetoric” in the selected speeches.","['Churchill', 'Rhetoric', 'Scaffolding', 'Analysis', 'Template']"

Building the Ideal Citizen through Children: The New Order’s Doctrines in Indonesian Children Story Books,"Dewi, Ratih",['Suryadi'],2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The government of Indonesia in the New Order era in the 1970s and 1980s launched one of the largest elementary school construction project in history to eradicate illiteracy known as SD Inpres. The project included the procurement of children story books as a complimentary of children textbook. The regime much influenced the story and child’s character in these books for the purpose of nation-building. Children stories were embedded with patriotic doctrines and moral values, and the characters were constructed in accordance with the state’s national ideology, Pancasila (Five Moral Principles) and interests to create the ideal Indonesian citizen. The implementation of Pancasila indoctrination through children story books aimed to shape and guide children’s behavior as the new generation who will build the country in the future. It was one of the state’s political strategies to maintain its power and hegemony in making a generation that obedient and pro-state. The study discusses the Indonesia’s New Order political agenda translated in children stories that were published under the SD Inpres project, particularly by Balai Pustaka. The paper suggests that there had been a form of resistance against the regime through the writing of children stories and also looks at differences in children characters and moral values between the state-sponsored Balai Pustaka children stories and private independent publisher Gramedia in the period of 1973-1985. The paper explains the concept of an ideal citizen based on the perspective of the New Order regime and questions the “message” it had transferred and how did the resistance occur in the children stories.","['Politics of culture', ""State's indoctrination"", 'Nation-building', ""Indonesia's New Order"", 'Children story books', 'SD Inpres', 'Pancasila']"
Online news galleries als belichaming van persoonlijker nieuws. Een kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse van de dominerende nieuwstypes en –thema’s in online news galleries aan de hand van het model van Caple en Knox,"Zeeuw, Marjon de","['Koetsenruijter, A. Willem M.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Online news galleries zijn een relatief nieuwe manier om online visuele nieuwsverhalen te vertellen. Doordat een online news gallery bestaat uit een sequentie van foto’s, heeft de online news gallery andere mogelijkheden tot visuele storytelling dan losstaande nieuwsfoto’s. Om de storytelling- mogelijkheden van online news galleries te analyseren, bedachten Caple en Knox een model bestaande uit verschillende systemen. Eén van deze keuzesystemen is het element ‘nieuwstype’, bestaande uit de subtypes ‘hard’, ‘zacht’ en ‘sport’. Met hard nieuws doelen Caple en Knox (2015) op nieuwsverhalen die verslag doen van recente gebeurtenissen die als nieuwswaardig worden beschouwd (Bednarek en Caple, 2012, p. 96). Dit in tegenstelling tot zacht nieuws, dat zich focust op de verslaggeving van gebeurtenissen die niet recent of nieuwswaardig zijn (ibid.) Het onderscheid tussen hard en zacht nieuws staat echter al jaren ter discussie. Zo stellen verschillende studies dat het onderscheid tussen hard en zacht nieuws niet zo eenduidig is (Baum, 2002; Baum, 2003; Boczkowski & Peer, 2011; Lehman-Wilzig & Seletzky, 2010). Het subsysteem ‘nieuwstype’ is als uitgangspunt genomen in deze masterthesis waarin getoetst is in hoeverre het onderscheid tussen hard en zacht nieuws bij online news galleries betrouwbaar te meten is, zoals het model van Caple en Knox doet vermoeden. Het nieuwstype is aangevuld met een categorisering in nieuwsthema’s om zodoende inzicht te krijgen in de inhoud van online news galleries. Uit het kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve onderzoek naar 469 online news galleries blijkt dat het onderscheid tussen hard en zacht nieuws niet zo betrouwbaar te analyseren en meten is als het model doet vermoeden. De introductie van een nieuw nieuwstype is noodzakelijk, genaamd ‘medium nieuws’. Medium nieuws focust zich op online news galleries waarbij de aanleiding gevonden kan worden in hard nieuws, maar waarbij het onderwerp vanuit een zachte invalshoek gevisualiseerd wordt. Dit nieuwstype staat symbool voor de storytelling-mogelijkheden van online news galleries, wegens de beschikking over een fotosequentie en de visuele kracht van foto’s. Waar de (foto)journalist zich volgens Caple en Knox (2012) voornamelijk laat leiden door hard nieuws (p. 231), komt uit dit onderzoek naar voren dat online news galleries zich voornamelijk lenen voor de visualistatie van zacht nieuws. Daarbij onderscheiden deze zich thematisch door de dominerende focus op human interest verhalen, in plaats van de focus op gewelddadig nieuws, zoals veelal gebeurt in zelfstandige nieuwsfoto’s (Kim en Smith, 2005; Greenwood en Smith, 2007; Dahmen, 2015). De online news gallery kan hierdoor gezien worden als de belichaming van de verschuiving naar persoonlijker nieuws, die de laatste jaren steeds krachtiger vormen heeft aangenomen (Boukes en Boomgaarden, 2007; Deuze 2005; Lehman-Wilzig en Seletzky, 2010; Patterson, 2000; Scott & Gobetz, 1992).",
A Criticism on Data Visualisation as an Epistemological System,"Peret Pujol, Marta","['Zwijnenberg, R.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"We have created so many data in the last decades we are not able to process them all anymore, this is what is known as “Big Data.” And with this data boom it has also come the conviction that the more data we gather, the better insights we have. But, do wet? Can knowledge survive without philosophy's buttress? To facilitate making sense out of data we have invented techniques to understand them: to see patterns or correlations to gain new insights. And here is where data visualisation has come into play. Data visualisations are maps that help us navigate the data surge we live in. But should we take data visualisation as a proof of truth? If everything is data now, and these data are translated into a visualisation, we are distanced from “reality” by many levels of abstraction: from the given world to the database through the technological tool, from the database to the image through the software we need to create it. This poses two problems: we can just apprehend the world through technology and all we see is that which is quantifiable, translatable into a technological language. Do we as subjects have any agency in a world we cannot apprehend as it is? This thesis then departs from three hypothesis: Big Data has led to a deep epistemological problem precisely because of the unfettered data accumulation; a problem further intensified as a result of its frenzied visualisation; and this epistemological problem renders the subject powerless. Therefore, the question is: how can we call into question the all-pervasive data visualisation in order to re-empower the subject in the Information Age? To this end, I will first give a description of the main concepts this thesis is dealing with, I will then contend the hypothesis and, finally, I will propose an answer to the questions they lay and an example of action.","['jevbratt', 'john simon']"
"Echoes in Eurasia: the name ‘Tangut’ and the Xixia Tanguts in European medieval and early modern sources, ca. 1250-1750","Jong, R.J. de","['Weerdt, H.G.D.G. de']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In contemporary Western academic publications, the name ‘Tangut’ refers almost exclusively to the dominant ethnic group of a so-called ‘conquest dynasty’, best known by its Chinese name, the Xixia 西夏 (‘Western Xia’; 1038-1227). However, the name has had different connotations for our medieval and early modern forebears, which might prompt the question: What did medieval and early modern Europeans mean when they used the name ‘Tangut’? Given its present-day use, a corollary question ought to be: Did medieval and early modern Europeans have a similar understanding, or concept, of the Xixia Tanguts as we do today? It is this thesis’s main contention that the name ‘Tangut’ and the early understanding of this name in Europe stems from the same source as our current conception, that is, a Mongolian ethnonym cum toponym. Yet, in Europe it was long understood as mostly a toponym and it was not clearly connected to the concept of the Xixia Tanguts. Indeed, it will be argued that the Tanguts of the Xia are, albeit surprisingly, largely absent in early European descriptions of Chinese and Mongol history, compared to other ethno-historical references in European sources.","['Tangut', 'Orientalism', 'septentrionalism', 'Polo', 'toponymy', 'Xixia', 'Xia', 'Kircher', 'Grueber', 'Jesuit']"

The Dutch Revolt and Dutch Golden Age were crucial times for the formation of Dutch national identity. Museums play an important role in negotiating historical fact and myth. The first chapter of the thesis explores the themes of ""Geography"", or how museums define ""The Netherlands"", ""Location and Experience"", or how museums create a sense of place, ""Chronology"" or how museums present the passage of time and ""Interactivity"" or how museums involve visitor interaction with the exhibits. The second chapter explores the subject of William of Orange as a national hero in the Rijksmusem and compares this with how the Princenhof museum in Delft uses biographical information to humanize William. The third chapter compares how two museums, the Lakenhal in Leiden and Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar, present the subject of the Dutch Revolt. In Alkmaar the museum explores sites of cultural memory of the revolt in several places in the city. In the Lakenhal, memories of the revolt and local hero Pieter Adriansz. van der Werf are renegotiated in light of historical fact. In all these examples, the role that national and local myths play is explored.","['museum', 'national identity', 'Dutch Revolt', 'Dutch Golden Age', 'William of Orange', 'Rijksmuseum', 'Princenhof Delft', 'Lakenhal', 'Stedelijk Museum Alkmaar']"

China's Dream: Connecting Eurasia's Supply Chain,"Laanen, Bo-Peter","['Ennis, Crystal']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"As the largest developing nation of the world, it is the self-professed Chinese Dream to build a “democratic, culturally-advanced and harmonious modern socialist country” that projects a “new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation,” (Arab Policy, FMPRC 2016). China’s economic rise in the 21st century has received immense speculation of both mainstream and Critical International Political Economy (IPE) scholars as to whether the country and its political establishment presents an ideological or economic challenge to neoliberal hegemony and the ideology of the Washington Consensus institutions. In the context of neo-Gramscian theory, this paper will focus on China’s One Belt One Road (OBOR) as a case study to determine how China may be building a counter-hegemonic challenge through the promotion of this “new type of international relations”. What began as a far-flung dream of recreating the ancient Silk Road through the Eurasian continent has now evolved into a serious endeavor including more than 60 countries. Besides offering these countries richer ties to the global economy, the OBOR allows for wide-ranging projects to build super highways and bullet trains, to pipelines and deep sea ports linking a global supply chain for the swift transportation of goods and services. Accelerated development of the OBOR initiative spawn from two recent experiences which have fundamentally changed China’s position in the international political economy.","['China', 'Supply Chain', 'Neo-Gramscian', 'One Belt One Road', 'Silk Road', 'International Political Economics']"

As such, Gothic Literature forms a representation of the society that formed its’ base, and a study of the gender roles as portrayed within the novels allows for an understanding of the gender roles within Gothic society- even more importantly, the novels of the time contain the bases of the changes that marked the period. The writers of the Gothic commented on the old patriarchy through their prevalently male adversaries warring against young heroines, and called for a new form of patriarchy that would rid women of the sometimes violent oppressions they suffered under outdated notions of gender roles. The heroines of the Gothic as such become the embodiment of a new generation of women that treaded outside their traditional sphere, demanding education and rights, even if remaining under the protection of their fathers and husbands. This commentary on patriarchy, and the representation of proto-feminism in Gothic Literature will form the core of my research, and this thesis.","['Gothic Literature', 'Gothic', 'gender', 'gender roles', 'feminism', 'patriarchy', 'Frankenstein', 'A Sicilian Romance', 'Sicilian Romance', 'separate-spheres doctrine', 'Mary Wollstonecraft', 'Mary Shelley', 'Ann Radcliffe', 'patriarchal relations']"

It goes in a phrase by Tsun Zu as, “to know your enemy, you must become your enemy.” During the periods of colonization, the Dutch authority in Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) had reflected such ideas through its language policy. This policy established in 1818 and was intended to exercise the colonial authority by utilizing the language. The departement voor Inlandsche Zaken was established in order to connect the domains of the indigenous and colonial government in Dutch East Indies. By this, the agency was obliged to study the language and culture in the archipelago. During the first five years of the Inlandsche Zaken, it had showed remarkable achievements in the unification of local vernaculars and the standardization of Malay. In this paper, I will provide several analyses on translation of documents from the archives of the Inlandsche Zaken kept at the National Archives of the Republic of Indonesia. By this, I will examine the differences between two similar documents-each documents contains Dutch texts and they are translated into Malay (Dutch texts in these two documents are similar but the Malay translations are different) produced by the Dutch colonial government. My central research question is, to what extent language was utilized as a tool of subordination towards the indigenous society in Dutch East Indies? In addition, I try to demonstrate that the Inlandsche Zaken had played a determinant role in bridging the two worlds in Dutch East Indies-namely the colonial government and the indigenous societies, and also had used such knowledge to exercise the colonial authority.","['Language', 'colonial', 'authority', 'culture', 'translation']"

Dit in elkaar overlopen van het einde van de eerste aanvang en begin van de andere aanvang, deze overgang waar zowel Heidegger als Nietzsche deel aan hebben blijkt uit hun ervaring van dát ogenblik, waarin de mens in een verhouding staat met de onverborgenheid van het zijnde, waarbij het zijnde zich kan tonen zoals het op zichzelf is en als zodanig door de mens ervaren kan worden zodat er sprake is van waarheid. Heidegger heeft toegang tot deze waarheid vanuit zijn begrip van waarheid als onverborgenheid, maar ook voor hem is het onmogelijk om te weten of het zijnde zich daadwerkelijk toont zoals het op zichzelf is, of slechts als schijn. Nietzsche kan deze waarheid vanuit zijn eigen denken over waarheid, dat alle waarheid slechts illusie is, niet begrijpen, maar heeft geeft wel blijk van een vermoeden van de mogelijkheid van deze waarheid, zo blijkt uit zijn ervaring van het oneindig kleine ogenblik.","['Heidegger', 'Nietzsche', 'waarheid', 'metafysica']"

to be herman all ways to be herman,"Velzen, Lotte van","['Westgeest, H.F.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De titel van deze scriptie to be herman all ways to be herman slaat op het feit dat herman de vries bij zichzelf is gebleven tijdens zijn gehele carrière.1 Tevens is het een kleine knipoog naar de titel van zijn expositie tijdens de Biennale 2015 in Venetië: to be all ways to be. Het werk van de vries is in de loop der jaren niet sterk veranderd. De minder positieve waardering aan het begin van zijn carrière staat in schril contrast met de waardering voor zijn werk anno 2016. Dit opmerkelijke gegeven nodigde uit tot verder onderzoek. In hoofdstuk één wordt de vries vanuit een biografische invalshoek besproken met zijn achtergrond als onderzoeker en de invloed daarvan op zijn werk als kunstenaar. Hieruit blijkt dat de vries in zijn werk toeval en objectiviteit centraal zet. Toeval is een begrip dat volgens de vries aanduidt dat we niet meer weten waar iets vandaan komt. De oorsprong en oorzaak van een gegeven is te complex om te overzien. Omdat we dat niet kunnen, noemen we het toeval. Deze definitie is een meer filosofische benadering dan het toeval uit de toevalstabellen die hij als biologisch onderzoeker gebruikte om zijn werk de vereiste objectiviteit te geven. Deze constatering toont, naar mijn mening, de ontwikkeling die de vries in zijn carrière heeft doorgemaakt. Hij is zich steeds meer als natuurfilosoof gaan profileren. Een ontwikkeling die aansluit bij de groeiende maatschappelijke-filosofische aandacht voor de natuur en ecologische kwesties. Het receptieonderzoek in hoofdstuk twee plaatst de toegenomen waardering voor de vries’ werk in een cultuurhistorisch perspectief. Frans Haks suggereert dat de vries modieuze vernieuwingen zou volgen. de vries zou niet onderscheidend genoeg zijn geweest waardoor hij wellicht minder waardering ontving voor zijn werk. Het samenvallen van de vries’ ontwikkeling en de groeiende maatschappelijke aandacht voor de natuur en ecologie is mijn inziens essentieel voor de toegenomen waardering voor de vries. Een gegeven dat tegen het volgen van modieuze vernieuwingen pleit is het feit dat het werk van de vries gedurende zijn carrière geen spectaculaire veranderingen heeft ondergaan. Maar wel de uiteindelijke erkenning heeft gekregen als kunstenaar waar hij op hoopte. Natuur en toeval hebben altijd een centrale rol gespeeld in het werk van de vries. Hij stelt dat de natuur beelden creëert en ons ervaringen schenkt die een kunstenaar nauwelijks kan overtreffen. de vries wil de natuur in al haar bijzonderheid tonen door zo min mogelijk in te grijpen. ￼ Een gedachte die teruggrijpt op zijn tijd bij de Nul-groep. De vries wil zoveel mogelijk direct de werkelijkheid zijn en zelf een standpunt van nul innemen. Het is deze positie die de vries onderscheidt van Fiona Hall en Joan Jonas, de kunstenaars waarmee hij in hoofdstuk drie wordt vergeleken. De ecologische kwesties die de vries aanhaalt zijn veel subtieler doordat hij de natuur toont zoals zij is. De complexiteit in de vries’ werk bevindt zich eerder in de gedachtegang achter zijn werk en niet zozeer in de uitwerking daarvan. De toegenomen waardering voor de kunstenaar herman de vries kan uitgelegd worden met zijn woorden “toeval is wat je toe valt”. Een gegeven dat zeer van toepassing blijkt te zijn op de aandacht die de vries in de loop van zijn carrière heeft gekregen oftewel is toegevallen. Hij heeft zijn werk vanaf de zeventiger jaren niet wezenlijk veranderd. Wel voorzag hij het van een boodschap waarin hij pleit voor de afhankelijkheid die de mens altijd gehad heeft van de natuur en hoe het van invloed is geweest op onze gedachtegang, gezondheid en cultuur. Een boodschap die past binnen de toegenomen maatschappelijke aandacht voor natuur en ecologie.",['art herman de vries moderne beeldende kunst nederlands']

It challenges some of the dominant assumptions in current historical scholarship: that the Chechens and Ingush constantly resisted Sovietization and launched a major revolt against Soviet power in response to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Using a wide variety of sources from the Soviet secret police and the German military intelligence, this study finds that much of the popular resistance in Chechnya and Ingushetia was related to collectivization campaigns; that the core of the Chechen and Ingush armed underground consisted of bandits and refugees who were primarily concerned with personal survival; and that politically motivated rebels among them never managed to trigger a nationwide rebellion during the German–Soviet War. Instead, it is found that the number of Chechens and Ingush who served the Red Army far outnumbered those who sided with the Nazis. The accusations against the Chechens and Ingush were largely fabricated and exaggerated by the Soviet leadership in order to justify wholesale deportation.","['Chechnya', 'Ingushetia', 'banditry', 'Stalinism', 'deportation']"

Translator Redactor: Literary Translation and the Limits of Interpretation,"Deitch, Judith A.","['Foster, A.A.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Literary translation is a separate field within translation studies demanding its own approaches. This argument is supported in Part I by an assessment of the ""Hermeneutical approach"" to Translation Studies, as represented in the thought of Jakobson, Benjamin, Derrida, Ricoeur, Jiri Levy, and George Steiner, which offers a strong foundation. Their thinking falls together in considering translation and interpretation to be full equivalents, entailing never-ending processes; in appreciating the holistic quality of the literary work of art and translation's relationship to it, as well as translation's role in the Nachleben of the work of literature; and in demanding creative language use and linguistic hospitality as part of the translator's labor. Part II of the thesis places the tasks of the literary translator as editor/redactor, particularly in consideration of the use of paratexts, on this foundation as one way of limiting hermeneutical activity. The translator redactor must act as a book compiler, a scholar-annotator, and an analyst commentator, or at least consider these roles. In this way, the thesis unites theory and practice while promoting the positive utility of hermeneutics for translation and yet setting limits for the translator's interventions, particularly in helping the reader's own process of interpretation by providing paratextual guides and aids.","['Translation', 'Hermeneutical approach', 'Interpretation', 'Editing', 'Paratexts', 'Walter Benjamin', 'Paul Ricoeur', 'Translator', 'Roman Jakobson', 'Literature']"

This study was conducted to investigate the use of spoken Dutch within two postgraduate courses with English as primary medium of instruction (EMI classrooms). It’s aim was provide an insight into the situation and aid in understanding the co-existence of Dutch and English. This research investigated three questions: 1) Is Dutch used in the EMI classroom? 2)What is the function of the use of Dutch and 3) How is the use of language perceived by the students? For this project, data were collected through the observation of lectures and interviews with students. The findings showed that Dutch was used by both lecturers and students, in many different situations (for example, mostly outside of the lecturers and in breaks) and served many different functions (for example as an unofficial medium of instruction, or to appeal for assistance when knowledge was lacked in English) This means that even though English is the primary medium of instruction, this does not mean that is not the only language that is being used. The language situation has become similar to a diglossic situation, in which Dutch and English rather comfortably co-exist.","['code-switching', 'language alternation', 'bilingualism', 'sociolinguistics', 'language choice', 'linguistic anthropology']"
Here Be dragons,"Zelfde, Gonda van 't","['Gerrits, Andre']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The trilateral dialogue, which started in 2008, has exposed the differences in the foreign policy approaches of the EU and China. Where the EU emphasizes its role as a norms promotor (Gerrits ed. 2009:3), stresses China its focus on economic win-win situations (Hackenesch, 2011). Yet, as the EU and China have increasing shared interests, a more pragmatic approach to their foreign policies is emerging. China is slowly engaging with normative principles, for instance it has accepted the universality of human rights and has joined several international human rights conventions. The state is more open to normative principles, even though China promotes sovereignty and collective rights over international intervention and individual rights (Pu, 2013). A more pragmatic approach to foreign policy can enable and support trilateral cooperation in explicit areas such as security. Examples of currently existing trilateral cooperation are the joint fight against piracy in the Gulf of Aden, measures against the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons (SALW) and the peacekeeping mission in Mali. Also, the EU currently discusses China’s novel initiative for a modern-day silk road, known as the ‘One Belt, One Road’ (OBOR) initiative and which has been called “the most ambitious infrastructure-based security initiative in the world today”. The title of this work ‘Here Be Dragons’ refers to unexplored and ‘dangerous’ gaps between the EU’s capabilities and its expectations. The purpose of the thesis is to examine the EU’s foreign policy performance, in particular its response to China’s growing presence in Africa, through the lens of the capability-expectations gap theory. According to Hill, a gap exists between what the EU ‘talks about’ and what the EU actually is able to accomplish. This study investigates how the EU’s agenda on trilateral cooperation with China and Africa changed since the entering in to force of the Lisbon Treaty, whether a capability-expectations gap exist regarding the EU’s security relations with China in Africa, and if so, how the EU could establish more effective cooperation the field of security and thus close this gap.","['European Union', 'China', 'Africa', 'trilateral relations', 'cooperation']"

EU – Russia Visa-Free Travel Regime,"Pel, Merit","['Frear, M.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"At the EU-Russia St. Petersburg Summit in 2003 both parties agreed to start negotiations on agreements to simplify the procedure for issuing short-stay visas between the EU and Russia with visa-free travel as the ultimate goal. In December 2013, Russia declared all requirements and conditions outlined in the Common Steps to be fulfilled and that it is ready to move to the next phase, which is the preparing of a draft Visa Waiver Agreement. The EU, on the other hand, doesn’t consider all conditions to be fulfilled and insists on fulfilling all technical requirements before moving to the next phase. Therefore the main question that was posed: are the respective benefits and constraints of the EU and Russia related to visa liberalization mutually exclusive? From this research it became evident that Russia is only willing to fulfil technical requirements set out in the Common Steps document. Russia is less eager to carry out organizational reforms, including reforms in home affairs and law enforcement agencies. For Russia it is important not to converge to EU’s level of liberal and democratic standards, as Russia does not want to give up its sovereignty and secure its status as a great power.","['Russia', 'EU', 'Visa-free travel']"

Er zijn observaties, vier focusgroepen en zestien semigestructureerde diepte-interviews uitgevoerd. Er kan geconcludeerd worden dat complottheorieën, oftewel theorieën die de officiële verklaringen van gebeurtenissen uitdagen, reconstrueren en betwisten, constructies zijn die leven binnen de onderzochte Turks-Nederlandse gemeenschap. Voornamelijk met betrekking tot geopolitieke conflicten waar moslims bij betrokken zijn, bestaat de perceptie dat er een werkelijkheid achter de bekende, gemediatiseerde werkelijkheid is. Complottheorieën helpen deze verborgen werkelijkheid te construeren. De gemediatiseerde werkelijkheid die wordt gewantrouwd, is veelal de versie van de Nederlandse mainstream nieuwsmedia. De legitimiteit van de Nederlandse media is niet groot, vanwege het wantrouwen in deze media dat wordt veroorzaakt door de berichtgeving over Turkije, moslims en de islam. Deze berichtgeving wordt als negatief ervaren en brengt gevoelens van uitsluiting teweeg. Daarnaast heerst het gevoel dat het westers perspectief op internationale kwesties eenzijdig en partijdig is. De Turkse media hebben vaak een ander perspectief op gebeurtenissen. Dit zorgt voor verwarring: wat is waarheid? Door beide generaties wordt buiten de mainstream nieuwsmedia om, voornamelijk op het vernaculaire web, naar de 'echte waarheid', oftewel de waarheid achter het nieuws gezocht.","['Complottheorieën', 'mediawantrouwen']"

Transitional justice refers to a period where judicial and non-judicial reformation steps are taken after massive human rights abuses. Social reform is the country’s top priority in order to balance unequal power relations. South African museums are non-judicial spaces where the unequal power dynamics of the past and the present are being renegotiated. Within this context, established museums have to reform and new museums are being built to include previously marginalised groups. The museums of South Africa are adapting to meet the needs and fantasies of both South Africans and foreign tourists. The needs of the population are met by the museum’s ability to contribute to shaping identity, but also the museum’s peripheral function as an economic mechanism. Museums of South Africa function in a loaded context that needs to address inequalities that span across the board.

In the past years new approaches have been put forward. The purpose of this thesis is to find out what the best way is to teach students when teaching English as a second language. For the purpose of this study two groups of students have been approached in their beginning phase of learning English in high school. A single topic was chosen (passives) and the two groups were taught in two different ways. The first group group was taught an instruction based lesson which was defined by the Skill Acquisition Theory as the best teaching method. The second group was taught in a more communicative manner, propagated by the Sociocultural Theory. Both groups made the same test to find out which method led to fewer mistakes. Surprisingly, it was the second group who scored better. Even without explicit rule teaching the students were more capable of doing the exercises they were presented with and they were more capable of doing a writing assignment. It may thus be concluded that for similar groups of students and this particular topic the communicative approach works best.","['Language Teaching', 'ESL', 'Sociocultural Theory', 'Skill Acquisition Method']"

Elizabeth Gaskell's Representation of Women in the Industrial Revolution,"Galloway, Emma","['Newton, M.S.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will examine the way women are presented in Elizabeth Gaskell’s works Mary Barton (1848), North and South (1854). The thesis will argue that the portrayal of women in these novels reveals the role of women in different layers of society within the context of the Industrial Revolution and rejects the traditional expectations of women as simple, emotional creatures only suitable for being wives and mothers. Gaskell portrays her women as strong female characters and uses them as agents at all levels of society. The novels present their leading ladies as smart, independent women who are allowed to be both strong and emotional, and who are permitted to have their own mind free from the expectations of society. Firstly, I will look at the cultural and social-historical context in which the novels are placed and what the traditional role was for women in different levels of society. My research will also explore what the Industrial Revolution meant for women in British society, and the impact of new ideas regarding the possibility that one could rise in their station. Secondly, I will look at how each woman protagonist within the novels deal with these expectations. I shall also examine the novels in comparison to each other, and look at the differences and similarities between the female characters in each novel. For this part of my research, I shall make use of articles by Brown, Davis, Elliot’s ‘The Female Visitor’ and ‘Servants and Hands’, Pike, and Surridge, as these recent critical interpretations are central to current discussion of the novels and the ways in which they represent mid-nineteenth-century society.","['Gaskell', 'Industrial Revolution', 'Women', 'Gender', 'Class']"

Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands as a Learner of English as a Second Language,"Daalhof, Elisabeth","['Tieken-Boon van Ostade, Ingrid']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands had an English governess, Miss Winter, from when she was six years old. Because of this, Wilhelmina quickly acquired the English language at a young age. Her progress in learning English, is clearly visible in the many letters that she wrote to Miss Winter from 1886 to 1936. Most of these letters were transcribed by me, and were studied in order to determine to what degree Wilhelmina learned to master the English language, and how her acquisition of English progressed over time, which is the leading intention of this study. The letters were studied on several points: spelling, lexis and grammar, in which a distinction was made between various phases of the language learning process. The letters that Wilhelmina wrote were divided into three periods: 18881892, 18931896 and 18971898. In this situation, the communicative approach that was used to teach Wilhelmina English was very effective when it comes to learning grammar and vocabulary. It appears that only by regular contact with native speakers a person can improve his proficiency in a second language the way Wilhelmina did in such a short time. Even though spelling is only fully acquired somewhat later, proper instruction can quickly cause this to catch up. Thus, in this thesis I demonstrated the positive effect of teaching methods focused on communication rather than on grammar and writing, such as the Communicative method and the Task-based approach.","['SLA', 'Queen Wilhelmina', 'Dutch', 'English as a second language']"
"The Historical, Romantic and Fantastic Witch. How Genre Conventions Determine the Representation of Witches in English Literature","Hazenoot, Nienke","['Leeuwen, E.J. van']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The portrayal of witches and wizards in older fairy tales such as the Grimm brothers’ “Hansel and Gretel” and “Snow White” (1812) and L. Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz (1900) differ significantly from the witches that appear in more recent works of fantasy, like Garcia and Stohl’s Caster Chronicles (2009-2012) and J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series (1997-2007). Of course some of these differences can be attributed simply by the different attitudes towards witchcraft that circulated in the different eras in which these works were written. This thesis will show that, at least in part, the different literary representations of witches is due to the genre conventions that govern the text in which the witch-character appears. The close-textual analyses of William Harrison Ainsworth’s historical novel The Lancashire Witches(1848), Percy Bysshe Shelley’s Romantic verse narrative “The Witch of Atlas” (1820) and several witches in J.K. Rowling’s fantasy series will reveal that the genre conventions that are imposed on these literary works play a role in determining the appearance, the skills, and the role of the witch(es) in the story.","['witches', 'Lancashire Witches', 'The Witch of Atlas', 'Harry Potter', 'Genre Cinventions', 'Historical Witch', 'Fantastical Witches', 'Romantic Witches']"
"Norms, Resistance and Counter-Securitization: Pacifism and Democracy in Japanese Security Debate","Raaijmakers, Christiaan","['Wakefield, Bryce']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This essay builds on recent work on securitization theory by scholars such as Balzacq and Floyd, and explores the still underdeveloped field of resistance and counter-securitization. A successful securitization allows for a securitizing actor to deal with an existential threat with extraordinary measures outside the boundaries of normal politics. Resistance refers to the creation of a separate securitization move with its own existential threat and extraordinary measure in relation to the original securitization move. Counter-securitization is defined as an act to halt a securitization move, or to bring the issue back to the realm of ordinary politics. This essay further develops the concept of counter-securitization in comparison to resistance. It also strengthens Floyd’s argument on a just securitization theory by examining the role of pacifism, democracy and constitutionalism using the Japanese security debate as a case study. Finally, it illustrates how norms such as democracy and rule of law have slowly become more significant within the Japanese security debate than the pacifist ideology. It first examines the case of Prime Minister Abe’s ideology on Japanese security policy before taking a look at the political opposition in regards to Abe’s security policies. The section argues that even though the political opposition has all fought against Abe’s policies, there is a clear divide between an Old Left and a New Left. This essay then examines two grass-roots movements, the Article 9 Association and a student activist organization by the name of SEALDs. It shows how the political Old Left and the Article 9 Association have created their own securitization move to protect the pacifist constitution, while the political New Left and SEALDs have generated a counteract to bring the topic of security back to the realm of ordinary politics.","['Securitization', 'counter-securitization', 'japan', 'resistance', 'democracy', 'pacifism', 'article 9 association', 'SEALDs']"

The population is declining drastically; the amount of elderly is increasing heavily and with the costs to take care of them will be heavy. Their increasingly chasing population structure is a major concern for politicians and companies alike. Too often Japanese politicians keep this status quo alive, on one hand they agree that Japan needs to introduce pro-immigration policies but on the other hand, when it comes to implement real and viable policies they ignore it. Japanese politicians are hesitant to call for increased immigration, due to fear from the public. These fears often stem from some underbelly feeling, which also fueled by the Media. The introduction of the Foreign nurses and caretakers was a first step into the right direction. Sadly, the outcome was insignificant and had practically no influence. This program shows the weakness of the Japanese immigration policies.

In order to provide insights into this subject area, this thesis studies existing practices in China and examines the artistic approaches and the museum collaboration in the practice. In the thesis a literature review discusses the current situation of socially engaged participatory art practice in China, and forms a theoretical framework for evaluating this practice. Furthermore, case studies of two art projects are conducted to evaluate the artistic approaches that have been taken up by the artists in their practice and the museum collaboration involved in it. The two projects are the Family Museum Project (2008) by the Utopia Group and the Qiuzhuang Project (2013-2014) by Li Mu. The findings from this research show that the artists’ practice of socially engaged participatory art has social significances in contemporary China, and the artists have experimented with creative ways to strive for public expression in the Chinese society; the museum collaboration with the artists’ practice could contribute to the social effect of this practice in China.","['socially engaged art', 'participation', 'contemporary Chinese art', 'museum practice']"

Opening Formulas and Requests in the Chelmsford Pauper Letters (1820–1829),"Stevens, Emmy","['Tieken-Boon van Ostade, I.M.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Chelmsford pauper letters (1820–1829), a subcorpus of the Essex pauper letters (1731–1837) (Sokoll 2006), were addressed to the overseer in Chelmsford, the county town of Essex, in which the pauper writers, who were generally very poor, asked for poor relief or other forms of assistance. In this thesis, the various ways in which the writers of the Chelmsford pauper letters applied politeness strategies (Brown and Levinson 1987) to protect the negative face of the addressee have been examined. A corpus analysis revealed which opening formulas and phrases to express the request were used by the pauper writers. The analysis shows that the Chelmsford pauper letters display a much greater variation in the usage of opening formulas than for instance the letters by the Clift Family (Austin 1991). The pauper writers, who received little to no education, used a different register which allowed for more variation. This register, as well as the general outline of a letter, was probably spread in an oral way, since the pauper writers did not consult letter writing manuals, which were extremely popular in their age (Fens-de Zeeuw 2008). Similar for the opening formulas, the letters display a great amount of variation in the usage of phrases to express the request for relief. Interestingly, a development towards the use of parenthetical please is visible in the letters. There is a significant preference for please to, an intermediate step in the development from the phrase be pleased to to please (Tieken-Boon van Ostade and Faya Cerqueiro 2007). Moreover, three instances of please are found in the letters. These early instances are remarkable, because please was thought not to occur without to in the beginning of the nineteenth century. The use of please therefore indicates that this development is very likely a change from below.","['Late Modern English', 'Pauper letters', 'Letter writing formulas', 'Politeness strategies']"

This thesis first addresses the historiographical debates about the agency and resistance of enslaved people within a system of systematic oppression and dispossession and then demonstrates how the three novels negotiate this issue. Both ""Kindred"" and ""Beloved"" probe into the limitations and possibilities of the community as a site of black male and female empowerment. Instead of romanticizing life in the free and enslaved black communities, both Butler and Morrison challenge these sites and call attention to the costs of resistance to the slavery regime. On the other hand, in his effort to liberate his fiction from black identity politics that foreground the works of Butler and Morrison, Johnson explores the cultural hybridity of his protagonist, but he ultimately only reproduces patriarchal values he overtlty parodies.","['Slave Community', 'Family', 'Gender', 'Resistance', 'Agency', 'Hybrid Identity', 'Transculturality']"

The novel, seen as a satirical Bildungsroman, shows that Robert Wringhim’s failure both to reach maturity and assimilate into society is the result of his inability to change. One needs to constantly (re)negotiate between self and other to safely integrate into society – this is a form of Bildung, as understood in Herder’s conceptualisation of the term. However, Robert fails to integrate, because he refuses to change his early identity, which, in turn, leads to the creation of a doppelgänger. Also, his parents teach Robert that he is preordained to live in heaven which causes him to feel that above all he belongs to this future state. Ultimately, with no self-realisation and a strong desire to go to where he feels he belongs, Robert’s short life can only end in his premature death. Finally, The Private Memoirs is not merely a critique of bad parenting or religious excess. Rather, Robert and his family become a metonymy for something larger and more prevalent: liberalism and civil society, where freedom becomes freedom to have property, rather than freedom of thought. In the end, liberalism is portrayed as a system of exclusion rather than inclusion of differences.","['Hogg', 'Bildung', 'Bildungsroman', 'Doppelgänger', 'Liberalism', 'Scotland']"

The Representation of Suriname and Surinamese people in Dutch ethnological museums: An analysis of the exhibitions from the Museum Volkenkunde in Leiden and the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam.,"Christidou Stylianou, Eleni","['Damme, Wilfried van']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"The aim of the present work is to present how have Dutch curators dealt with the representation of Suriname’s multiplicity in the ethnological museums of the Netherlands.Through museums’ modes of representation, particular constructions are created of image making and concepts developing. Ethnological museums are imagined as spaces that represent the life of groups of people inhabiting specific areas. The history of Suriname and the cultures of its people are a fixture in Dutch museums of ethnology, due to the historical colonial link between the two countries of Suriname and the Netherlands. How do Dutch museums of ethnology represent the ‘otherness‘ of Suriname and Surinamese people? In order to answer this question, two major museums of ethnology in the Netherlands, the Volkenkunde and Tropen museums, are investigated as case studies of how Suriname’s history, culture and various ethnic groups are today represented in the museological institutions of Suriname’s former colonizer. In the analysis of these exhibitions I will concentrate on matters regarding the authority of the museum, the presentation of decolonization, the vocalization of the narratives, the concept of exclusion, and the involvement of source communities in curatorial processes. Through this analysis, this paper seeks to determine what types of narratives dominate the representation of Suriname in Dutch museums and the vision of Suriname and Surinamers offered to the public in these exhibitions. In addition, the case studies presented will investigate which histories are unspeakable and which are not, how museums suggest their authority on the subjects they present, and the extent to which the intellectual framework to which a museum is bonded influences its displays, and which is the period we are going through nowadays and how have the museums been adjusted accordingly. In discussing these aspects of museological representation, this research hopes to add to the discussion of how museums can best produce ethical representations.","['museum', 'Suriname', 'identity', 'volkenkunde', 'tropenmuseum']"

The Experimental House and the Manor House Bökars: Architecture and Interior Design as a Reflection of the Marimekko Lifestyle in the 1960s,"Järvenpää, Emma","['Rijk, Timo de']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 1951, the clothes sewn from bold and colourful printed fabrics of the textile and fashion company Marimekko were presented for the first time at the Kalastajantorppa Hotel in Helsinki, Finland. During the next decade it appeared that Marimekko did not plan to remain as a manufacturer of fabrics and clothes, but aspired to create a whole lifestyle around the brand. In 1963 the company took its first step towards the world of architecture by launching the utopian project of Marikylä (Mari Village), which initially aimed to create a residential community for the company’s employees. In 1966 the first building of the village, the Experimental House, was created in collaboration with the Finnish architect Aarno Ruusuvuori (1925-1992). This modern, pre-fabricated building contrasted greatly with another house that is closely associated with the company, the Manor House Bökars. Since 1964 this rural and somewhat romantic house had a strong influence on the company’s image as the official residence of Marimekko which was visited by guests from home and abroad. This thesis attempts to shed more light on Marimekko’s venture on the interior design and architecture during the 1960s by analysing these two contrasting houses – the Experimental House and the Manor House Bökars – as realisations of Marimekko’s vision of an ideal lifestyle, while originating from two seemingly different worlds.","['Marimekko', 'interior design', 'modern architecture', 'lifestyle', 'Finland']"

Open Caption Telop and the Netherlands: Success or Disaster?,"Boer, Victoria Ashley de","['Dorst, Lettie']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis compares the standard use of intralingual subtitling in the Netherlands with the dominant form of intralingual subtitling, or impact captioning, in Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, and China: so called open caption telop (OCT). These open captions differ greatly from the subtitles we are used to seeing in the Netherlands, and are more so used to emphasize and create impact, rather than the subtitles in the Netherlands for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, strong accents or dialects, or as a learning tool for foreign language speakers. Research into the effects of OCT on a non-Asian, western audience has rarely been done, which makes it all the more important to gather some insight into this phenomenon. This thesis attempts to do so by conducting a small research into the thoughts of Dutch viewers on Asian-style open caption telop. Three short clips of popular Dutch entertainment programs had OCT added edited into them and were shown to a group of 40 respondents, both male and female and of various ages. They were then asked to fill in a short questionnaire, and some were asked to elaborate on their answers. The results of this research were used to determine whether the Dutch viewer public appreciates the forms and functions of OCT and whether this type of subtitling could, in theory, be implemented in Dutch television programs.","['translation', 'intralingual translation', 'open caption telop', 'subtitles']"
The Embattled Chancellor: Konrad Adenauer's fight for political survival from 1949 to 1951,"Wanninger, Tabea Hildegard","['Dassen, Patrick', 'Gehrig, Sebastian']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The rise to power of Konrad Adenauer was an unexpected one. At the ‘young’ age of seventy-two, the long-time mayor of Cologne won the first free democratic election in Germany since 1933, becoming the chancellor of the newly-founded Federal Republic. At that time little known outside the British sector, Adenauer was able to overcome considerable initial internal opposition and successfully built a Kanzlerdemokratie (Chancellor Democracy) that would last fourteen years. He is nowadays almost unanimously considered the founding father of ‘post-war Germany.’ His present-day popularity, however, tends to obscure his problematic first years in office. If known at all, Adenauer’s problems are regularly described as mere bumps in his farsighted path towards regaining sovereignty for the country. This thesis challenges this common view by highlighting domestic and international issues, arguing that his early position was much direr than is often anticipated. Adenauer’s national challenges centered on his dealings with the Allied High Commissioners representing the victorious Western nations. The country’s lack of sovereignty was blatantly obvious as the Western powers not only maintained a veto right over any law passed by parliament, but excluded pivotal policy areas such as foreign and defense policy from the government’s remit. Criticized by the opposition as Erfüllungspolitik (compliance politics), Adenauer tenaciously worked on gradually shifting the relationship from the humble representative of a defeated country towards an ‘inferior partnership’ based on respect and cooperation. The Petersberg Accord in November 1949 brought some improvements in the occupation status, but all-in progress was frustratingly slow and indecisive. At the same time, the chancellor was under immense pressure from a restless population to quickly improve an abysmal and further deteriorating economic situation. An increasingly vocal opposition led by Kurt Schumacher exploited Adenauer’s precarious position, sensing a chance to topple the government. The heightened tensions of the Cold War culminating in the outbreak of hostilities on the Korean peninsula ‘rescued’ Adenauer’s chancellorship. Under the forceful leadership of the U.S. State Department the Allies fundamentally changed their approach towards Germany. Within a very short timeframe the country ‘mutated’ from defeated foe to indispensable ally against any Soviet aggression in Europe, also triggering a change in attitude by the High Commissioners. Even more important for the survival of the chancellor, the worldwide economic boom caused by the Korean War greatly benefitted the German export industry, being widely considered as the starting point of the following Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle). Now Adenauer’s policy of West integration bore tangible results, and with soaring approval ratings he could cement an almost unassailable position for years to come. Adenauer’s international challenges were dominated by the contentious relationship with France. His overarching policy of West integration would only succeed if at its core a French/German rapprochement could be achieved. However, France’s thinking was ‘obsessed’ with security concerns against its old arch enemy, leading her to advocate an economically weak and virtually defenseless ‘parcelized’ Germany. Paris was perpetually concerned that a sustainable recovery of the German economy would again overpower the rest of Europe, building the fundament for yet another potentially aggressive policy. One way of taming such dangers was to ‘detach’ the Saar region with its highly valuable coal and steel resources. In the same vein, defining the Rhine line as the primary defense parameter against a Soviet expansionist policy was preferable to any rearmament of the long-term foe. The public outcry in Germany was livid and across the political spectrum. Adenauer faced immense pressure not to accede to any unilateral change of the 1937 borders prior to a formal peace treaty, and to refute any policy that would not grant the country the undeniable right of defending its territory. The grass roots Ohne Mich (Without Me) movement formed a viable threat to the sustainability of the government. Again, Adenauer was ‘rescued’ by external initiatives. France was acutely aware that its vastly diminished power relative to the United States made its position untenable. It devised two plans along identical lines to ‘Europeanize’ the issues, in order to preserve some influence over developments in Germany. The Schuman Plan called for joint oversight over the vital coal, iron and steel industry, thus alleviating concerns that Germany may divert resources for war preparations. But it also allowed Adenauer to subsume the Saar conflict under the overarching aim of French/German rapprochement and European integration. Similarly, the Pleven Plan proposed the creation of a joint West European army, securing a fair share contribution of Germany in defending its own soil whilst simultaneously preventing a nationalistically driven rearmament of the country that may potentially threaten France’s security. Adenauer endorsed the plan as it would secure the Western Allies’ defense support for the entire country, with the discriminatory elements of the plan being of secondary importance. Despite being undoubtedly one of the ablest politicians Germany ever had, Adenauer’s chancellorship may not have survived its initial phase without the ‘help’ it received through the changing international environment. External events and initiatives provided the escape route for some of the most inextricable domestic issues. The Korean War was arguably the most important event as it fundamentally altered the United States’ approach towards Germany. Acknowledging the relative power structure after the Second World War, this then ‘induced’ France to launch its ‘Europeanization’ initiatives to ameliorate the French/German relationship. These developments were instrumental in securing Adenauer’s position, paving the way to make his name nowadays synonymous with Germany’s ascendency after 1945.","['Konrad Adenauer', 'Federal Republic of Germany']"

"Patents, cooperation and free circulation of knowledge: innovation in the British textile industry 1760 - 1820","Jong, Jona de","['Touwen, Jeroen']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis answers the question why there was a cluster of innovation in the English textile industry between 1760 and 1820. In order to answer this question, this thesis uses records concerning eight important textile inventors: Samuel Crompton, Richard Arkwright, James Hargreaves, Matthew Murray, Edmund Cartwright, William Radcliffe, Jedediah Strutt and John Kennedy. Crucial for clusters of innovative activity in general is that the existing stock of knowledge and techniques is constantly recombined into new technical knowledge, leading to innovation. It is pivotal for constant recombination that individual access costs to new technical knowledge are low. This, in turn, is achieved when new knowledge rapidly circulates, allowing inventors to constantly build on innovations done before them. A thorough study of eight important textile inventors will show that the cluster of innovative activity in the British textile industry existed because groups of inventors, manufacturers, financiers and workmen in the North West of England closely cooperated in a number of ways and because new technical knowledge rapidly circulated within and between these groups. These processes took place within a cultural context favourable to innovation, a political context in which elites supported innovation and an economic context in which large amounts of human capital were available. The cooperation took place both inside and outside of the inventive process. Within the inventive process, workmen and financiers provided the inventor with the technical and financial aid necessary to continue inventing. Outside of the inventive process, they helped some inventors to be properly rewarded for their efforts and collectively opposed inventors with overtly monopolistic tendencies. Rapid circulation of knowledge within and between these groups was realised in several ways. First, the successful collective action taken against monopolistic inventors insured the quick diffusion of their inventions. Second, most inventors at times freely shared their inventions with fellow inventors, manufacturers, and the public at large. Third, inventions were massively stolen. One of the ways in which new technical knowledge was stolen, was through the patent system. Contrary to popular belief, the English patent system, in most cases, did not allow individuals a sufficient return on the money, time and effort they had put into their innovative process. The specification of their invention, included in the patent application, was widely copied. Most inventors were unable to successfully fight these infringements. However, many inventors kept taking out patents, hoping to be successfully remunerated. In this way, the system contributed to the free circulation of new technical knowledge. These findings contribute to several debates within the field of social and economic history, economics and organisational science.","['Innovation', 'England', 'Textile industry', 'Industrial Revolution']"

"Trust me, I'm lying. Playing with illusion in Plautus' Pseudolus","Schaik, Anne van","['Wessels, A.B.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"One of the most intriguing plays of the Roman playwright Plautus (c. 254 – 184 BC) is his Pseudolus. In this play, the clever slave Pseudolus wants to help his young master Calidorus who is in love with one of the prostitutes of the greedy pimp Ballio. Unfortunately, the girl has already been sold to another. Pseudolus therefore is left with only two options: 1) get enough money to buy the girl before the other buyer shows up; or 2) trick the pimp Ballio into giving him the girl. The lover’s problem instigates a performance full of deception, trickery and virtual cash flows. Pseudolus’ main occupation throughout the play is getting his fellow characters to trust him with money and belief (credere). Interestingly, this clever slave warns both his fellow characters and the audience that he is not to be trusted (caveant, ne credant mihi). The tension between this warning and Pseudolus’ actions which are the complete opposite of this warning, has serious consequences for the way the audience reacts to this play. For to enjoy a theatrical performance, it is necessary for the spectators to suspend their disbelief and temporarily take the theatrical world as a separate reality. This process can be stimulated by specific external stimuli created by the actors on stage. This concept is better known as dramatic illusion. Pseudolus’ warning does not only challenge the dramatic illusion, but also thematises it by naming three important factors within the play Pseudolus that are all connected to illusion: the audience; the producer of illusion (Pseudolus); belief and challenges to this belief (credere and cavēre). In all Plautine comedies, metatheatrical devices that challenge the dramatic illusion that was being portrayed can be found. Even more, as Plautine plays consist of quick shifts between the intradiegetical action and extradiegetical communication with the spectators, this dramatic illusion seems to be constantly under attack. The question then arises as to how a play that consciously challenges the illusion it is producing succeeds in keeping its audience involved in the play. Of all Plautine plays, Pseudolus is the most apt to answer this question, as the production and experience of illusion are thematised in the play. Pseudolus, as a producer of illusion, is asking for credit, while his audiences on and off stage are doubting whether to give him this credit or give heed to the warnings they receive. Moreover, the presence of metatheatrical comments justifies abstracting conclusions about audience experience from behaviour of characters that take on the role of audience-on-stage. On top of that, there is a doppelganger motif in the figure of Simia taking on the role of Harpax. This duplication of a performance within the play opens the possibility of looking for other doubles within and outside of the text. By exploring the way in which the three aforementioned factors (audience, producer, credere and cavēre) are connected in Pseudolus and establishing their relation to the parameters of the concept of dramatic illusion, this thesis contributes to a better understanding of the intricate ways in which dramatic illusion is undermined, stimulated, or played with in Plautus’ Pseudolus.","['Plautus', 'Pseudolus', 'Credit', 'Metatheatre', 'Audiences', 'Warnings', 'Trust', 'Dramatic illusion']"

Reorienting Tradition: The Modern Revival of Makkŏlli Tradition in South Korea,"Mahon, Caroline","['Ceuster, Koen de']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the course of my thesis I will explore ideas surrounding the ownership and meaning of tradition and national identity from the perspective of the nation and the community, in the specific context of makkŏlli culture in South Korea. Paying particular attention to the works of Eric Hobsbawm, Stephen Vslatos, Dean MacCannel, and Richard Sennet, I seek to illuminate the ways in which the nation and community speak to one another and to a larger, global audience through cultural expression and a renegotiation of national tradition. The recent revival of interest in makkŏlli began with small communities of brewers and has expanded through craft movements leading to a modern re-invention of the practice. However, the beverage only gained attention domestically after it gained popularity abroad in 2009. As governing elites have become aware of the economic power embedded in associating national identity with a particular ‘brand’, certain aspects of popular or traditional culture have been mobilized to serve this end. In the process we encounter a double dynamic between small community actors and larger political entities both interested in the same objects, in this case makkŏlli — yet their motivations and interests speak to entirely different, and often contradictory concerns.","['makkoli', 'south korea', 'globalization', 'agriculture']"

The 'New Iron Triangle': China's attack on criminal defence lawyers on the case of Li Zhuang,"Niemann, Judith","['Landsberger, S.R.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Though Western thought gained popularity and legitimacy in legal education after economic reforms were initiated, the role of defence lawyers remains ambiguous. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China does grant the accused the right of defence (see Appendix 4.1 Article 125). However, with a formal legal tradition, in which criminal prosecution, investigation, and trial are handled respectively through the three segments of the so called 'Iron Triangle' (police, procuracy, and judges), defence lawyers are admitted little room to operate as representatives of their client, but rather pose a minor obstacle to the prosecution. The legal mind-set is crime oppressive with higher value on crime control efficiency than accuracy of legal conduct within the court, as well as in the pre-trial investigatory phase. Therewith, traditionally the 'Iron Triangle' was firmly aimed against crime, or rather the accused himself. However, the case of the defence lawyer Li Zhuang in 2009/10 raises the question of an alternative aim of the 'Iron Triangle'. Instead of focusing on the prosecution of the accused (Gong Gangmo), the case took a turn against the defence lawyer, incriminating Li Zhuang by actually applying testimony of Gong, the accused. The paper argues that, as shown on the case of Li Zhuang, the 'Iron Triangle' of China's legal conduct is not simply aimed at the prosecution and conviction of the accused and therewith the impediment of crime, but against the criminal defence as a concept of law. This will be shown on examining the trial of Li Zhuang on the following four factors: formal legal rule that directly counters criminal defence, and therewith shows criminal defence oppression through the legislature itself; intrinsic institutional deterrents on criminal defence in the judiciary; ideological factors in China's legal tradition, which impede criminal defence indirectly and simultaneously renders legitimacy to the actions against criminal defence by legislature and judiciary; and finally political motifs.","['China', 'legal system', 'Iron Triangle']"

"Anglophobia in the Dutch Republic, 1756-1784","Debets, Jan","['Oddens, Joris']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the nature, longevity and intensity of Anglophobia in Dutch public debate, between 1756 and 1784. Although the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War triggered the Patriot Era, this subject has not seen any study. At most, Anglophobia has been represented as marginal to the domestic critique on the Stadholder William V and the oligarchic regents, a consequence of the focus in the historiography on domestic political developments, most notably, the republican Patriot ideology. This thesis aims to show that Anglophobia was a dominant undercurrent in the Dutch Republic, also within that republican Patriotic discourse that has up till now been considered Francophobic. Anglophobia was contingent on contextual events as well as deeper laying developments. The Seven Year War brought about a conflict between Britain and the Dutch Republic over maritime treaties after the Dutch decided to stay neutral. The declining Dutch economy made trade with Britain’s enemies during war a very profitable prospect. Therefore, Britain captured Dutch ships. The resulting conflict was sharpened by the dynastic links of the House of Orange with Britain. This context is crucial to understand the outrage against Britain in this period. During the Seven Year War, Anglophobic imagery was used in debates surrounding piracy, neutrality and dynasty. National particularistic stereotyping was used to depict the English negatively, further shaped by a historical consciousness of the seventeenth century, when the roles were reversed and the Dutch Republic was deemed more powerful. Sources point to Britain as playing a part in both the deeper lying sense of cultural insecurity in Dutch society, and the ‘moral corruption’ narrative that was a product of it. But during the 1770s, influenced in part by the American Revolutionary War, Anglophobia was used to reflect positively upon the situation, identity and history of the Dutch. Indeed, the same problems occurred with English privateers like in the Seven Year War. But the Anglophobia around this time received more intellectual argumentation. Britain was increasingly depicted as ‘despotic’, antithetical to republican ‘freedom-loving’ values. This narrative was strengthened by international Anglophobia, and more specifically, by English patriots themselves. However, Dutch writers misunderstood the signs of British power as they predicted its imminent downfall. Even when war broke out that optimism lingered. The cumulative Anglophobic frustration exploded in a feast of songs, poems and celebrations. Ultimately, when the humiliation of the war was irrefutable, Anglophobic turned against domestic ‘traitors’.","['Patriotism', 'Nationalism', 'Republicanism', 'Anglo-Dutch relations', 'American Revolutionary War', 'Fourth Anglo-Dutch War', 'Moral corruption']"
Political Art Practices in Artistic Research: An Interface between Society and Academia. The case of Jonas Staal.,"Konstantinidou, Vicky","['Zijlmans, Kitty']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Research in the arts is a controversial form of research even in scholar’s circles. Many artists nowadays are following doctoral programmes focusing on arts (a PhD in the Arts), in order to enhance their artistry through “academisation” but also in order to be capable of finding a job in the highereducation field. There is an ongoing debate about these programmes whether they actually enhance the artists or not and if those programmes are equal to other research programmes that include for example scientific research. Through this thesis many definitions will be given in order to clarify the meanings of artistic research, of artistic practice, and the distinction between art practice-as-research and art practice-as-itself as well, just to name a few. But the central question to be answered through this thesis is going to be, what the relationship between society and academia is, and whether political artistic practices can play the role of intermediary. In order to answer that question besides the analysis of the anatomy of research in the arts, this thesis will focus on the case of how political artistic practices can achieve a symbiosis between academia and society. For that reason, the artistic research of the political artist Jonas Staal, who is currently following a PhD in the Arts, will be the case study of the thesis.","['artistic research', 'PhD in the Arts', 'political art', 'Jonas Staal', 'the Rojava Revolution', 'agonism', 'stateless democracy']"

'Nacht! Tauentzien! Kokain! Das ist Berlin!' De Kokainwelle in Berlijn ten tijde van de Weimarrepubliek in context,"Clercq, Arnout le","['Dassen, P.G.C.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,nl,"‘Nacht! Tauentzien! Kokain! Das ist Berlin!’, schreef de Russische schrijver Andrej Bely in 1924 na een verblijf in Berlijn. De Duitse hoofdstad werd in de jaren twintig geassocieerd met een wild en florissant nachtleven, seksuele uitspattingen, drugsgebruik en een decadente kijk op de wereld. Deze excessen werden doorgaans in verband gebracht met het onzekere bestaan in de Weimarrepubliek, die geplaagd werd door politieke crises en hyperinflatie: het zogenoemde ‘tanzen auf dem Vulkan’. Cocaïne was het roesmiddel bij voorkeur van deze vulkaandansers, men sprak destijds zelfs van een Kokainwelle, een cocaïnegolf. Massaal drugsgebruik als deel van een zogenoemde Rauschkultur maakt sindsdien onderdeel uit van het beeld dat van de 'Großstadt' tijdens de Weimarrepubliek bestaat. Maar klopt dat wel? Er is beperkt onderzoek gedaan naar de Kokainwelle. In de bestaande literatuur over het onderwerp is er weinig aandacht voor de gestalte die het cocaïnegebruik in deze periode aannam, de beeldvorming van het gebruik, structurele of incidentele oorzaken en de rol van de overheid. Het is, kortom, een onderwerp dat zelden in al haar facetten wordt beschouwd. In deze masterscriptie wordt het beeld van de Kokainwelle nader onderzocht en binnen haar historische context geplaatst. Hierbij komt de ontwikkeling van de Duitse cocaïne-industrie aan bod, de opkomst van cocaïne als medicijn en het gebruik van de drug tijdens de Eerste Wereldoorlog. De beeldvorming van het cocaïnegebruik in Berlijn tijdens de Weimarrepubliek wordt geanalyseerd aan de hand van een rijk exposé aan literatuur en kunst, met speciale aandacht voor de expressionistische dichter Walter Rheiner (1895-1925) en de danseres Anita Berber (1899-1928). Tot slot wordt de wetgeving aangaande cocaïne onder de loep genomen en dieper ingegaan op de handhaving daarvan in de Weimarrepubliek.","['Weimarrepubliek', 'Cocaïne', 'Expressionisme', 'Walter Rheiner', 'Anita Berber', 'Berlijn', 'Kokainwelle', 'Duitsland', 'Goldene Zwanziger']"
"Social Networks in Old Babylonian Nippur during the Reign of King Samsuiluna (Si 1–30, 1749–1720 BCE)","Seire, Maarja","['Waerzeggers, Caroline']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the social networks of the inhabitants of Old Babylonian Nippur (modern Nuffar) in central Mesopotamia. The period chosen for this study is the period when Nippur belonged under the jurisdiction of king Samsuiluna of Babylon (r. 1749–1712 BCE), the son and successor of the king Hammurabi (r. 1792–1750 BCE). The selection of Si 1–30 is made out of interest in king Samsuiluna’s reign, especially concerning his political and economic struggles, and therefore its impact on socio-economic changes, which might possibly have an impact on the social networks. The core of this thesis consists of 191 cuneiform documents that the residents of Old Babylonian Nippur left behind, and the amount of individuals identified in these documents is 1165. The method for this research is Social Network Analysis (SNA). With SNA, one can visualize the interconnections between individuals. This is done by creating a database (FileMaker Pro 14) and using a computer program (UCINET) which uses various algorithms to measure the data.","['Samsuiluna', 'Social Networks', 'Nippur', 'Old-Babylonian']"

Bound within a Box: Examination of execration figures of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo,"Finlayson, Tori L.","['Kaper, Olaf']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"For the ancient Egyptians magic was a means of controlling an otherwise uncontrollable world. The execration ritual was one such means of control. The execration ritual was a magical means of protection and defense against the traditional enemies of the pharaoh as well as against personal enemies. The ritual, which has been compared to modern voodoo, often involved writing the name of an enemy on a figurine and stabbing, breaking or spitting on it before burying it. Evidence of over one thousand of these rituals have been uncovered in locations throughout Egypt and took place from the Old Kingdom through the Greco-Roman period. Often execration figurines have been overlooked and neglected for study in museums around the world, likely because these objects were often purchased in the early history of the museum without a known provenance. Three examples of execration figurines from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo are unique. These limestone figurines were enclosed in travertine boxes, which are comprised of a unique shape. This study explores the probable date, find locations, use and symbolism of these figurines, in an effort to expand the state of knowledge about execration figurines and the ritual for which they were used.","['Execration', 'Egyptian Magic', 'Execration figurine', 'Egyptian Museum in Cairo']"

"A devil’s deal? Turning a crisis into a livelihood strategy: The rise of Bodabodamen in an urbanizing Kampala, Uganda","Jacobs, Keoma","['Bruijn, Mirjam de']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The capital city of Uganda, Kampala, experiences many challenges coping with a rapidly expanding urban population. Many young men in Kampala are stripped of their future prospects in the absence of employment. One group of men provide a critical perspective to this disturbing urban trend of unemployment, namely, motor taxi drivers (locally knows as bodabodamen), constituting an informal economy that flourishes as never before. Why did the bodaboda business appear so strongly in Kampala, at a time when the city was experiencing a deeply rooted institutional crisis? My hypothesis is that some bodabodamen increase their livelihood opportunities via an entrepreneurial and confidential spirit in which they profit from a political structure of crisis. This ethnographic analysis of bodabodamen is based on three months of extensive fieldwork in Kampala in which I observed and held semi-structures interviews with bodabodamen, and participated in the activities that are part of the popular bodaboda industry. Out of the many encounters I chose four leading bodaboda characters who I followed intensively, and who form an essential part of my analysis in the form of four elaborated life histories. The research is built on several layers, starting with a meta-debate of the duality of social change between structure and agency, followed by a second layer in the form of a historical perspective of political economy in an urban context, which leads to a contemporary worrisome trend and relevant academic work of youth unemployment in Africa. Then, I argue, through the life histories of bodabodamen, that the local bodaboda industry has found space to manoeuvre in the structure of crisis, thus creating a window of opportunity for bodabodamen to improve their livelihoods, starting with their motivation to seek change, and the confidence that they are actually able to bring about this change. This increased self-esteem, translated in a trustworthy behaviour (human capital), is the basis that is necessary to build a large social network (social capital) that indirectly increases their income (financial capital). The whole process of change comes together in the mobile and connecting capacities of the motorcycle itself. The space in the urban environment to manoeuvre with the motorcycle is the facilitation of agency between bodabodamen (actor) and the city in crisis (structure). A critical perspective of bodabodamen through the lens of mobility gives a positive, although temporarily, flow in an otherwise dramatic trend of a growing group of poor, unemployed urban youngsters. Mobility, however, cannot stop the crisis of political economy itself. The mobility change that comes along with the omnipresent rise and importance of the bodaboda industry, raises questions concerning governance, freedom of spatial and social movement, urban space and ideas of modernity and progress.",['motortaxi bodaboda livelihood']

Seeing Culture by Ear: The Function of Radio Broadcasting in the Socialisation and Cultivation of Two Communities in Northern Japan,"Hoogerbrug, J.E.","['Smits, I.B.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Under the title ‘seeing culture by ear’, this thesis discusses what radio and radio studies is able to ‘show’ academia, what Japanese radio listeners get to ‘see’ when they tune in to their favourite (community) radio stations and why these stations can be eye-opening for scholars researching radio and communities. The main argument is that radio is able to (greatly) contribute to the socialisation and cultivation of its listeners (especially on a local level) and that it is an appropriate medium for creating a sense of locality. To show how this could possibly be achieved, this thesis uses George Gerbner’s “Cultural Indicators Approach” and applies it to two community radio stations in northern Japan, namely FM Wappy in Wakkanai (Hokkaidō) and BeFM in Hachinohe (Aomori). By looking at the institutions involved with the creation of broadcasts and the messages which actually fill the airwaves, it becomes easier to see how the cultivating (and socialising) capabilities of these radio stations are realised. A few of the results are the large emphasis on the experiences of people, the participation of the station with local events and the opportunity for members of the community to create their own (short) shows. Also, especially in the case of BeFM, a continuous referral to local history, culture and language adds to the idea of radio being a tool for strengthening communal sentiments and local identity. Besides secondary (academic) literature, this thesis also contains fieldwork done by the author in 2015, an interview held with Mrs. Katō Yumi, the chairwoman of the board of directors at FM Wappy, and a message analysis of radio programmes broadcast during the summer of 2016.","['Radio', 'Japan', 'Cultivation', 'Socialisation', 'George Gerbner', 'Cultural Indicators', 'Hokkaido', 'Aomori', 'Community Radio', 'Message Analysis']"

#Accountability? The Changing Dynamics of Political Accountability through Social Media in Nigeria.,"Henckes, Ruth-Marie","['Goede, Meike de']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"After the Arab Spring, social media have been attributed great potential for democratization and enhanced political accountability, which has raised hopes for Africa’s stagnant democracies. Research is, however, inconclusive on whether this potential is seized and what this means in practice. Moreover, no research on political accountability in Africa has used social media as a primary source yet. Therefore I have studied the everyday Nigerian political accountability dynamics on social media as participant observer for 75 days. The observations exhibited four important shifts in accountability dynamics on social media away from traditional, offline accountability practices. First, social media has created an incessant and two-directional accountability cycle in which citizens find a unified voice through hashtags and the government replies to accountability demands instantly. Secondly, social media facilitate the traditionally much sought proximity between citizens and their leaders, as a channel for complaining, reassurance and interaction. Third, clientelist accountability dynamics have shifted from only demands for private and club goods, to mostly demands for collective and public goods, despite some deviations. Lastly, social media also allowed for slacktivism, but this did not inhibit the success of one online campaign. These shifts are significant, as they strengthen political accountability and thus democracy, even though the limits of the impact of online accountability and its meaning to the average Nigerian put the democratizing powers of social media in perspective. The observations nevertheless highlight the new opportunities and new dimensions to traditional accountability in Nigeria, and possibly Africa, enabled and channelled by social media.","['Political Accountability', 'Nigeria', 'Social Media', 'Reciprocity', 'Twitter']"

Are the South Sudanese youth the hope of the nations' future?,"Speelman, Manella","['Mous, M.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"South Sudan has been in war since 1955. Devastating consequences of both successive civil wars, and conflicts both within and between different ethnical clans, have resulted in an education system that is world’s worst. Among other things, this has resulted in an extremely low illiteracy rate, namely, an illiteracy rate of 73% for the boys and 81% for the girls in 2013 (VAS 66). In addition, in 2013, 1.3 million children of primary school age had no access to any form of education; a number that shows how daunting the context of basic education South Sudan really is (VAS 66; Linden et al, 651). Is there any hope left for a better future for South Sudan and its population, when there is hardly any opportunity for (quality) schooling, and therewith development? Through the use of existing literature on education in South Sudan, several case-studies, and in-depth interviews, the objective of this paper is to help pinpoint the importance of education in South Sudan, both for boys and girls. Through devoting sections to the history of the two civil wars, the political point of view of the role of ethnicity, and the role of South Sudanese culture in explaining the high drop-out, this paper looks at education from different perspectives. It discusses the current state of education in South Sudan, the importance of education, with reasons specific to South Sudan, and refers to possible manners on how both quantity and quality of education can be improved in South Sudan. This paper makes use of the most recent data available on education in South Sudan. For example by using the data from the 2009 National Baseline Household Survey, which was “the first nationally representative household consumption survey conducted in Sudan”, the Educational Management Information System of South Sudan, that highlights gaps in educational services, and the Village Assessment Survey of 2013. The latter has been used across South Sudan for humanitarian and development purposes; providing detailed information on access to basic services, healthcare, education, infrastructure and other key indicators. Altogether, this paper looks at the context of education in South Sudan, in order to find out whether education can attribute to youth being ‘the hope of the nations’ future’; developing the country through peace- and nation building.","['Education', 'South Sudan', 'youth']"

Popular Culture: The Political Narrative in Contemporary Manga,"Buren, Nick van","['Wakefield, B.A.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis, submitted as a graduation thesis for the BA International Studies at Leiden University, discusses how contemporary manga can serve as a medium for political messages and ideas. Due to its unique features vis-à-vis other forms of comics, manga has been a powerful tool for the production and consumption of cultural meaning by both its author and audience. Indeed, manga artists, such as Shigeru Mizuki and Osamu Tezuka, have actively used their works to convey various political messages and ideas, thereby forming public opinion on certain matters. However, scholar Hiroki Azuma claims that contemporary manga lack such capabilities, stating that they merely provide fan-service to consumers. Since no other author challenges Azuma’s claim, this thesis performs qualitative analyses on contemporary manga about the Japanese constitution and constitutional revision, in order to disprove Azuma’s claim, and to prove that contemporary manga, too, can have a political narrative. Analysing one government manga (Honobono Ikka no Kenpo Kaisei tte Nani?), two instructional manga (Ishinomori Shotaro no Manga Nipponkoku Kenpou and Manga de Wakaru Nipponkoku Kenpou), and one story manga series (Time Slip), this thesis reveals the various messages on constitutional change these contemporary manga seek to convey. Ultimately, this thesis disproves Azuma’s claim, showing that contemporary manga, too, can act as carriers of political meaning, and that they can either challenge or assert a certain hegemonic discourse.","['Manga', 'Popular Culture', 'Japan', 'Political Narrative', 'Constitutional Revision', 'Article 9']"
A Battleground For Opposition: Exploring the Nature of Civil Society Under Burma's Military Rule,"Vugt, Svenja van","['Verver, Michiel']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The term civil society started to gain worldwide prominence as a political force during the widespread collapse of authoritarianism in the mid-1970s and 1980s. With this extensive demise of dictatorships across the globe, Burma became an increasingly isolated regime in the wake of mass democratisation. This thesis will analyse civil society within Burma in a holistic manner, utilising three distinct levels of analysis. The theoretical framework will introduce conceptualisations of civil society in the context of varying political regimes such as authoritarianism and democracy, introducing prominent theories postulated by Antonio Gramsci and Alexis de Tocqueville. The general political history of Burma will be dissected through the lens of civil society, in order to examine the environment within which civil society organisations were forced to develop. Lastly, specific case studies on three civil society organisations operating during or as a result of heightened public discontent, specifically during the 1988 and 2007 uprisings, will determine whether civil society in Burma was forced to develop a Gramscian frame or a Tocquevillean frame.","['Civil Society', 'Burma', 'Myanmar', 'Authoritarianism', 'Military Rule', 'Gramsci', 'De Tocqueville', 'Battleground']"

The Chile - Argentina bilateral relationship from 1973 until 1989: The trans-Andean security dilemma and bilateral cooperation between two authoritarian regimes,"Derks, Harm","['Solheim, Håvar']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the tense dynamics of trust and hatred within Latin America and looks into the involvement of the United States in its military and economic support for rightist governments in Latin America. It starts with an analysis of the bilateral relations, the regional integration and the authoritarian state. Following is an extensive examination of the development of regional integration in Latin America, the threat of Communism and authoritarian responses to it. The authoritarian regimes threatened the social lives of millions of Latin American people and allowed a military regime to maintain the domestic economic and political structure according to the objective of the authoritarian leader and the military junta, which was centred around the eradication of Communism. Within Latin America, regional integration caused bilateral and multilateral successes and failures and conflicts. The high quantity of natural resources in several countries such as Venezuela, Brazil and Chile for example, provides the opportunity to maintain relations with other countries in the international system and to increase foreign investments. However, geographical factors limited bilateral relations in various countries in Latin America and territory remains a crucial factor in the analysis of bilateral relations within the region. The final chapter scrutinizes the bilateral relation between Chile and Argentina in the years from Pinochet’s coup d’état in 1973 until his successor Aylwin took over presidency in 1989. These 17 years are divided in two time periods. The first period goes from 1973 until 1983, a period in which military diplomacy acted out by both countries symbolized territorial conflicts, but where both countries’ governments and secret services cooperated to protect their countries against Communism in Operation Condor. The second period starts with the Peace and Friendship Treaty in 1984 in which it seemed like conflicts softened, and where the democratic transition in Argentina contributed to the lowering of the long-lasting binational security dilemma between Chile and Argentina. Hence, this thesis identifies the major factors that have been contributing to and have been restraining the bilateral relation between Chile and Argentina. The contextualization is characterized by military responses to the threat of Communism within both countries, territorial interventions in the Southern Cone of Latin America and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1984 which fostered the incentives for bilateral integration and economic cooperation between Chile and Argentina.","['Bilateral relation', 'Authoritarianism', 'Regional integration', 'Security cooperation', 'Operation Cóndor', 'Military dictatorship', 'Communism']"

In response to this, the European Commission produced the language learning and linguistic diversity Action Plan (2004-2006). The main aim of this thesis is to evaluate if the Member States of the European Union complied to the seven recommendations set in this Action Plan that directly addressed the Barcelona objective. The seven recommendations were made towards the pre-primary and primary language-in-education policies of the Member States. Furthermore, this thesis investigates whether the national linguistic factors of the countries are reflected in their language-in-education policies, and if this in turn affects the countries ability to comply to the recommendations. This thesis took a case study approach, concentrating on Luxembourg and Ireland. The key findings of this thesis were that both Luxembourg and Ireland did not comply to the recommendations. Moreover, for both cases the linguistic situations were highly reflected in the language-in-education policies, which affected their compliance to the recommendations. Luxembourg complied to three out of the seven recommendations, and it was found that the teaching of German and French as foreign languages were a huge reflection of the linguistic situation within Luxembourg; which largely affected the countries compliance with the recommendations. Ireland complied to none of the recommendations, as they fail to teach any compulsory foreign languages in their pre-primary and primary curriculum. It was found that the teaching of Irish, which is not considered a foreign language, came at the expense of teaching foreign languages. This showed that the linguistic situation of the country was highly reflected within the language-in-education policies and in-turn affected the countries ability to comply to the recommendations.","['European Union', 'Multilingualism', 'Mother tongue plus two', 'Language learning and linguistic diversity Europe', 'language-in-education policies', 'Luxembourg', 'Ireland']"

"According to the principles of Samuel P.

The ultimate aim of this research was to assess ability of the most influential nation in the world to navigate the changing world order in a way that precedes mutually beneficial international relations, using the interesting example of its tumultuous relationship with Southeast Asia. In order to approach such an overwhelming topic, the framework for this thesis draws upon the ideas of Samuel P. Huntington's expressed in his work The Clash of Civilizations: Remaking the World Order, and uses it to identify three areas where change has manifested itself most in the region since the early 1990s – religious diversity, rise of alternative powers and economic integration. The next step was to link the findings to the wider discussion on how shifting dynamics have given rise to the different power strategies. Using the conclusions from these findings, we can assert that, in the case of Southeast Asia, the US might have decided on the pivot of interest just in time. Indeed, it is very possible we could see more positive American presence in the future in the Asia-Pacific region in the form of ‘smart power’.","['US-Southeast Asia Relations', 'Post-Cold War Order', 'Vietnam War', 'Francis Fukuyama', 'Samuel P.

Exploring Identity Formation and Tensions Within the European Union,"Baljeu, Zachariah","['Bertens, Laura']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Literature on European identity construction and the delineations involved is extensive. This paper’s theoretical approach intends to add to the epistemological debate by looking at case study examples of the European Union’s ‘new’ member states, referring to member states that acceded the union in or after 2004, which this paper argues exemplify the rejection of European identity, and analyse them from the culturally anthropological perspective of the binary concepts of cosmopolitanism and cultural relativism. Whether or not a European-wide identity exists has long been a contested topic. Rather than attempt to add to this extensive debate, the purpose of this paper will be to locate points of tension between what is increasingly being constructed by the EU as a universal ‘European identity’ on the one hand, and the existing strong national identities of two case study member states, Hungary and Poland, on the other. By identifying the points at which these clashes occur, this paper will argue that identity construction cannot simply be politicised in the manner in which the EU’s institutions have attempted.","['Europe', 'European Union', 'Identity', 'Cosmopolitanism', 'Cultural Relativism']"

Painting the Concrete Jungle: Cranio's use of the streets as a platform for socio-political communication,"Schweiger, Francesca","['Brandellero, S.L.A.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Brazil is a nation whose streets pulsate with energy and vivacity. However, the streets of contemporary Brazil continue to be plagued with injustice; racism, poverty, marginalisation of groups, rainforest depletion and wealth disparity play a significant role in the lives of many local inhabitants. Thus, Brazil’s streets have quickly served as a unique platform for socio-political communication, upon which commentaries and critique of political systems or wrongdoings can be expressed freely. As such, the practice of street art has become a highly popular phenomenon to emerge across the region, tackling a plethora of issues with a creative flair. Fabio de Oliveira Parnaiba, more commonly known as Cranio, is a Brazilian street artist whose goal is to highlight the socio-political injustices of his country through his graffiti. Utilising an indigenous character placed in numerous situations and contexts, Cranio invites the local as well as the international population to re-contemplate the societies in which they exist. This thesis explores Cranio’s use of context, location, style and technique, to understand how graffiti can be used as a socio-political communicative and critical tool. Including a personal interview with Cranio, it strives to display the power of the arts in achieving a heightened socio-political awareness.","['Cranio', 'Street Art', 'Brazil', 'Socio-political graffiti', 'Brazilian political fragmentation']"

The academic debate on violations against journalists in Latin America seems to be dominated by the independent variables freedom of press, media concentration and impunity as lack of rule of law in the context of globalization and democratization. While according to Josephi mostly Western evaluation is used in the Studies of Journalism (Mellado et al. 61), the thesis presented will include Latin American literature as well. One of these Western assumptions is, that democratization simultaneously leads to higher press freedom and less media control which will be investigated in the case studies of Chile and Mexico. Moreover, it will mainly be a comparison of especially Chile and Mexico in 2000-2016, because both countries illustrate two sides of a coin, Mexico as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists at the moment and Chile with no recent cases of murdered journalists and officially a free press. It will, therefore, be a comparison of two extreme cases which promises insight on the development of journalism in Latin America and the importance of emphasizing on local differences rather than generalizing a whole continent.","['violations', 'journalists', 'press freedom', 'impunity', 'democratization', 'Chile', 'Mexico', 'Latin America']"

Despite being claimed to be universally applicable, the theory has been subject to a large share criticism for being Euro-centric, and thus inapplicable beyond the liberal-democratic context of the 'West'. However, soon after the US launched the 'Global War on Terror' in 2001, the Chinese authorities initiated the so-called China's War on Terror against Muslim Uyghurs; part of this policy was to construct a discourse that classified the Chinese Muslims as an existential threat not only to China, but likewise to the rest of the international community. Through substantial discourse analysis, this thesis provides evidence of how China's main news outlet, Xinhua News, constructs a discourse of the Uyghurs as a threat to justify extraordinary Chinese policies directed at Islamic practices, and simultaneously underlines the argument that the ST is universally applicable.","['Xinhua News', 'Securitization Theory', 'Copenhagen School', 'Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region', 'Global War on Terror', 'Discourse']"

In addition, since research has claimed that the provision of AIDS medication causes a drop in AIDS-related mortality rates, the second question which the thesis aims to answer arises whether the provision of the AIDS medication indeed contributed to a higher decrease in the AIDS-related mortality rates. Both questions will be examined in the context of Brazil since this country was the first developing/middle-income country which implemented the provision of free AIDS medication as a national policy. In order to answer both questions, this thesis compares the data found concerning Brazil's provision of the AIDS medication and Brazil's AIDS-related mortality rates, between the period before and after the Doha declaration in 2001. The comparison of the data shows that a negligible difference can be find in the provision of AIDS medication before and after the Doha declaration in 2001. Nevertheless, the difference in the data of the AIDS-related mortality rates in Brazil is rather significant and represents a high decrease in the AIDS-related mortality rates after the implementation of the Doha declaration in 2001.","['AIDS-related mortality rates', 'Provision of AIDS medication', 'Brazil', 'Doha declaration']"
The Influences of Political Discourse in the Narrative of Newspapers in Colombia,"Ruiz Ramos, Claudia","['Solheim, H.A.S.', 'Isla Monsalve, Pablo']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The influence of political discourse in mass media has been a topic of discussion over the years among academia, due to the complexities and discussions this topic have created. On the one hand, democratic regimes have aimed to separate politics from mass media in order to protect freedom of speech and press. On the other hand, totalitarian regimes and military regimes have fully controlled what is said or written in the different channels of in order to reinforce and impose their political views. However, in some Latin American countries this relation is more complex to explain and study due to the different socio political issues that have created a hostile relation between these both. For Instance, and despite the fact that Colombia is the oldest democracy in Latin America this relationship has been connected throughout history. As political discourse has exerted and still exerts influence in mass media, especially in the narrative of written mass media. This thesis analyzed the influence of political discourse in two of the most important newspapers in Colombia “El Tiempo” and “El Espectador”, in order to understand the different roles that mass media have played in the politics of this country. This analysis will allow the reader to understand why this country represents an especial case in the region.",

In order to answer this central issue, this thesis will be separated into three chapters, together arguing that the DTOs are placing an immense threat on Guatemala’s public security and the state. Additionally, it will be argued that the collapse of the PRI contributed to this issue by causing uncontrolled competition between the DTOs after they gave up their hegemonic position within Mexico’s political system. Chapter one shall focus on the theoretical background surrounding this topic, expanding on three central concepts guiding this thesis: transnational organised crime, the state, and public security. Chapter two is where the historical-political context of the problematic issue is elaborated upon, analysing how both Mexican and Guatemalan national occurrences are factors contributing to the threat the Guatemalan state is facing now (O’Neil; Schirmer). Here, it shall also be shown that it is not only the presence of the Mexican cartels that are disintegrating the Guatemalan state; there are other factors, coming from within Guatemala’s national history, that are an influence on the weakening of the state (Molina Mejía). Lastly, chapter three is the chapter in which the Sinaloa cartel and Los Zetas are analysed in the context of Guatemala’s border and coastal provinces, investigating the effect these groups have had on the state and local life from 2000 onwards (Dudley; Pérez).","['Guatemala', 'Mexico', 'Drug trafficking', 'Narcotics', 'Public security', 'Transnational organised crime', 'Transnational cooperation', 'Sinaloa', 'Los Zetas', 'Drug trafficking organisations']"

Stepan Bandera: national hero or outcast? The limits of rehabilitation.,"Doorn, Maxim","['Boele, Otto']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recently a referendum has been held in the Netherlands, concerning whether the Dutch government should or should not ratify an association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine. Immense political campaigns ensued, involving politicians, funding and political narratives from a multitude of countries. This same association agreement caused a revolution within Ukraine during the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014. While the then president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, was supposed to sign the association agreement with Europe, he instead decided to sign a new trade-treaty and loan with the Russian Federation. This decision sparked (student) protests in Ukraine's capital Kiev in November, which ended in a full fledged revolution by February 2014 that would eventually debouch into a civil war, still afflicting the country two years later. Although in November mostly students took to the streets, during the months to follow people from different lineages and classes with a variety of political ideas would team up to make sure the government which they deemed corrupt would resign. During these protests the portraits, and the name, of one historical figure would often come up. The figure in question is Stepan Bandera. During what has been named the EuroMaidan protests, Bandera portraits, alongside the wolfsangel, a former SS symbol, and the slogan “Слава Україні! Героям слава” (meaning: Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!) became more and more prominent especially among, but not limited to, ultra-nationalist protesters, often affiliated with the political party Svoboda (Freedom), or Praviy Sektor (Right Sector). Stepan Bandera, a political activist and leader of a militant group called the OUN-B during the 1930's until the end of the 1950's was mostly regarded as a (war)criminal in the Soviet Union, and is still regarded as such by many Russians and Eastern Ukrainians. By many Western Ukrainians he is however regarded a hero, and a symbol for an independent Ukraine. Not only was he hailed during, and after, the EuroMaidan revolution, he was awarded with the title of Hero of Ukraine in 2010, which has sparked many debates among academics, politicians and 'common folk'. The controversy surrounding this person has lead to the research question this thesis sets out to answer, being: Although regarded as a (war)criminal during Soviet times, Stepan Bandera has reached the status of national hero of contemporary Ukraine. Considering a country in conflict with not only varying political ideologies but also clashing identities/cultures a question arises: Why is someone previously regarded a (war)criminal now perceived as national hero, why is the role of this controversial person suddenly so important for modern Ukrainian ideologies, to summarize, what is Stepan Bandera's legacy and its impact on modern Ukrainian identity, culture and mentality?","['Stepan Bandera', 'Ukrainian culture', 'Nationalism', 'Ukrainian History']"

Turkey and The Conflict Of Memories: An analysis of Halil Altındere’s challenge to the divisive nature of Turkish official collective memory,"Charlton, Grainne","['Dessing, N.M.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper explores the divisive impact of official collective memory upon the position of the Kurdish minority in the Turkish society. Contextualized in the recent upsurge of violence in Turkey, this paper emphasises the role of memory in constructing conflict. Turkish official collective memory cultivates anxiety concerning the ‘other’ through emphasising religious or ethnic differences with the majority, ethnic Turks. The impact of Turkish official collective memory does not go unchallenged, Halil Altindere, a Turkish Kurdish artist presents a counter-memory to the state in his critical artwork «Welcome to the Land of the Lost ». Altindere’s artwork in the form of postage stamps, depicts the missing faces and names of twelve victims of the 17,000 missing under state custody in the 1990s. Unrecognised and unremembered, Altindere undermines official collective memory by depicting state violence to the Turkish audience. This paper outlines how Altindere’s work diverges from official collective memory, by calling for commemoration, recognition, and acceptance of minorities in Turkish society. Altindere’s protest against official collective memory engages the Turkish public, by questioning their anxiety in their identity and the ‘other’.","['Official Collective Memory', 'Turkey-Kurdish Conflict', 'Counter-memory', 'Halil Altindere', 'Governmentality', 'Minority']"

The Dragon on the Nile - The Impact of Chinese Hydro-Infrastructure Investment on the regional power balance of the Nile River Basin,"Gajan, Maurice","['Ennis, Crystal A.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"As the militarily most powerful and economically most developed riparian, Egypt occupied the position of the Nile’s hydro-hegemon for centuries. The appearance of China, a new influential actor, previously unconnected to the region, however, has significantly impacted the Nile River Basin’s historic power balance. China’s emergence as a financier and contractor of hydro-infrastructure in the Upper Nile basin has provided upstream riparians with unprecedented leverage. Chinese engagement in the hydro-politics on the Upper Nile undermines Egypt’s established hydro-hegemony, as it equips upstream states with viable powers to contest the status quo for the first time in history. Additionally, Beijing’s involvement alters the individual riparians’ approaches towards the hydro-conflict. Whereas certain upstream states seem encouraged by Chinese backing to pursue an increasingly unilateral agenda, Beijing’s presence might contribute to a basin-wide hegemon-led multilateral initiative. Surprisingly, despite China’s role in the hydro-political conflict, its relations with Egypt have not been impacted significantly.","['Hydro-Politics', 'Hydro-Hegemony', 'China in Africa', 'China in the Middle East']"
Women empowerment in community-based eco-tourism,"Sabogal Habedank, Diana Maria","['Carmody, M.F.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Community-based Eco-tourism (CBET) has been promoted as a model that can reconcile sustainable development and environmental conservation, and ultimately empower local populations. However, how this empowerment is achieved in particular among women is still largely debated given the gender norms in which these models are embedded. By focusing on Costa Rica as a case study, and drawing on an array of empirical evidence collated through desk research, this dissertation examines the role and participation of women in CBET initiatives; seeking to understand how women have been empowered through such models, and what the underlying factors that can promote or inhibit this. This study highlights that while the participation of women in CBET has been largely confined to the domestic spheres and underpinned by gender-defined activities, such opportunities are important in kick-starting and fomenting an initial process of empowerment that can be positively attributed to these schemes. Such changes are an initial stage of empowerment that can certainly ripple to other spheres and ultimately empower women.","['community', 'gender', 'empowerment', 'eco-tourism', 'development', 'Costa Rica']"

The tradeoff between security and human rights in Mexico: the situation during Calderón’s ’war on drugs’,"Rijk, Linda de","['Solheim, Havar André Sivertsen']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The rise of drug-related violence which Mexico has experienced since 2007 has attracted a lot of attention worldwide. The rise of violence is related to the administration of president Felipe Calderón, which term of office began in December 2006. Although the violence within Mexico was already at a high level to begin with, the level of violence increased even further under his government. This was due to his ‘war on drugs’ which he launched immediately after his inauguration on the first of December. This meant an extremely militarized approach, in an attempt to diminish the activities of the drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) heavily present in the country. While the final goal of the president was to limit the extent of the drug cartels to such a degree that it would no longer be a threat to Mexican national security, but instead a problem for the country’s law enforcement, the Calderón administration failed severely in accomplishing this. This has also been illustrated by the Conflict Barometer, composed by the Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research (HIIK), which classified Mexico’s armed conflict as an ‘intrastate war’ in 2010, which raised the level of conflict intensity from 4 to 5 (Lier 1). The focus of this paper will be the trade-off between security and human rights during the Calderón administration. With the government’s approach to enforce security in the country, they have increased both the levels of violence within the country, with disastrous results for the human rights situation in the country with not only the DTOs as perpetrators, but also the Mexican government. This paper will research whether the human rights violations by the governments can be allowed to ensure Mexican national security regarding the DTOs, and look into the factors which have influenced this. This will be accomplished by firstly establishing a theoretical framework for further understanding of the paper, followed by giving a historical context of the security issue within Mexico. For this will be looked to the period between 1970 and 2006, which should allow a clear understanding of the former authoritarian regime which is due to the recent transition to electoral democracy, extremely relevant to the security issues Mexico experienced under the Calderón government. Subsequently, it will also look into the policies related to the DTOs conducted by the governments before Calderón came into power and how these were influenced by external actors. This second chapter will also analyze the human rights situation under the authoritarian regimes before the careful transition to democracy in 2000. Naturally, both the earlier policies regarding the DTOs, and the human rights situation during earlier de Rijk 3 Mexican governments have strongly influenced the situation the Calderón government was dealing with, making it also extremely relevant to the trade-off between security and human rights during the ‘war on drugs’. The third chapter will look into the actual Calderón administration, and thoroughly analyze the policies employed during Calderón’s term of office and the human rights situation influenced by this, in order to finally make an extensive conclusion regarding the balance between security and human rights between 2006 and 2012.","['Mexico', 'Calderón', 'human rights', 'security']"

Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Technology for Sustainable Development and Poverty Alleviation in Rural Kenya,"Hendrik, Oye","['Corey, Williams']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Renewable energy (RE) has become increasingly important in the past decades, and it is expected that renewable energy will play a significant role in mitigating greenhouse gases and other negative consequences of climate change (Sathaye et al. 714). Out of all renewable energy technologies, Solar Photovoltaic has grown particularly fast in the last years and Africa is often portrayed as the perfect place for its installations. Given that the majority of the world’s poorest population is living in rural areas in Africa, it is posited that it will be valuable to examine the potential consequences of promoting renewable energy use on the African continent. The conclusion of this work's analysis is t that despite the fact that Solar PV systems appear to be beneficial within the context of the sustainable development goals of the international community (e.g. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development) it can be said within reason that the contributions of Solar PV to the global society are relatively insignificant and capital intensive. All things considered, and given the unique local circumstances, the promotion of Solar PV systems for the purpose of poverty alleviation and sustainable development ought, as of this moment, not be endorsed in Kenya.","['Solar Energy', 'Solar PV', 'Sustainable Development', 'Poverty', 'Kenya', 'Rural Development', 'Post-development theory']"

"The Domestic and Foreign Implications of the 'One Road, One Belt'","Calcoen, Laurens","['Warnaar, Maaike']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Although it appears that mainstream history has second ranked Central Eurasia, throughout most of history, the region has been at the forefront of world politics. Successively called Sogdiana by the Arabs, Transoxiana by westerners or Turkestan, literally ‘land of the Turks’ by the Persians; the region has come to our minds as Central Asia. Until the Age of Discoveries, Central Asia constituted the nervous system of the Eurasian international system (Frankopan 2015). Historically, whoever dominated trade along Central Asia dominated the Eurasian landmass. Trade took place primarily between China and Europe while Central Asia acted as the middle man. As such, the native nomadic tribes pacified the region in order to foster trade. Intensive exchanges in goods, peoples and ideas were the hallmark of the Eurasian economy in which continental trade dominated. Land and see routes where integrated into a single international system in which Central Asia was located at the center while the rest of the world constituted the periphery (Beckwith 2009). In 1877, the distinguished German geologist Ferdinand von Richthofen coined the Eurasian economic system as the ‘Seidenstraße’: the Silk Route. Nevertheless, Central Asia’s golden era did not last. With the maritime expeditions of Columbus and Vasco de Gama the ‘Eurasian continental system’ began to unravel. The revolutionary discoveries of alternative sea routes led to the establishment of new trade lanes (Frankopan 2015). As Beckwith explains in his book Empires of the Silk Road, the final blow to the continental system was struck by the partitioning of Central Eurasia by the Russian and Chinese empires. Newly erected borders led to soaring tariffs and increasing insecurity causing trade to spiral downward. Economic disintegration brought about intellectual decay which further isolated the region (Starr et al 2015). As a result, trade along sea lanes became much more competitive. The fundamental shift in trade patterns ushered the ‘Littoral system’ characterized by mass maritime trade (Beckwith 2009). Consequently, the center of gravity shifted from Central Asia to the coastal peripheries who dominated the sea lanes. Mastering state of the art naval technology, European countries such as Britain became the primary beneficiaries of the new ‘Littoral system’. The maritime system endured with the creation of the canal of Suez and the establishment of the Soviet Union which redirected the ancient networks of the Silk Road to Moscow. For the next three centuries, the world witnessed the European Era followed by the American Era. However, the ‘Littoral system’ is not invulnerable. In his renowned article ‘The Geographical Pivot of History’, MacKinder outlines the threats facing the Littoral system; noteworthy, a reunified Eurasia. It seems that the tide is turning once more. In 1991, the Soviet Union disintegrated in what President Putin called “the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century"". The momentous event enabled Central Asian people to regain their independence. Almost immediately, the European Union and Eastern European countries launched a bold trade and transportation project named the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA) with the aim of restoring the “Historical Silk Road” (Starr et al 2015). Inaugurated in great pomp, the weakly executed project met with little success (Matveeva 2006). Then, in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the United States intervened in Afghanistan in order to gain a foothold in the Central Asian area (Genté Régis 2014). In 2010, recognizing Afghanistan’s historical importance, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton instigated the News Silk Road initiative aimed at establishing Afghanistan as a key trade hub (Hormats 2011). Nonetheless, the project failed to receive the vital endorsement of the U.S. President and soon thereafter fell apart (Starr et al, 2015). Three years later, China’s supreme leader, President Xi Jinping, made an ambitious proposal for the revival of the Silk Road. Could Xi’s momentous plans succeed in revitalizing the Eurasian system?","['Silk Road', 'China', 'Pivot to Asia', 'Xi Jinping', 'economics', 'continental sysem', 'littoral system']"

The Scottish National Liberation Army: Marzipan Gang or Real Terrorist Threat? A case study of the Scottish National Liberation Army and the reasons why they did not become a large terrorist movement during the years 1979-1997,"Dijken, Lara van","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Scottish National Liberation Army was, and still is, a very small violent Scottish nationalist movement with the aim of establishing an independent Scottish Republic. From their inception in 1980 they knew how to make the headlines of the newspapers through an insistent campaign of letter bombs to important figures like Lady Diana, Margaret Thatcher and even the queen. They planned bomb hoaxes and were even responsible for some actual bombings. Somehow they were, however, never really (visibly) taken seriously by the media or the authorities. And that might just be one of the reasons why they did not become a large terrorist movement. The aim of this study is to contribute to wider terrorism research by looking at the factors that kept the SNLA from becoming a large terrorist movement. By figuring out what kept the SNLA from becoming the Scottish equivalent of, for example, the IRA we might be able to recreate these conditions and policies in our societies today and reduce the number of people joining such a movement resulting in the gradual decline of terrorist movements. Beatrice de Graaf’s theory on performative power proved to be of crucial importance to answer the research question of this paper: Why did the Scottish National Liberation Army not become a large terrorist movement during the years 1979-1997? By building on a firm theoretical framework of new and proven terrorism research and investigating newspaper articles and parliamentary debates from that period for anything relating to the SNLA this study has come to the conclusion that one of the major factors that contributed to the SNLA remaining a small and obscure movement was (1) the low performative power of the British Government. By publically ignoring the SNLA and letting the infiltration be done by local authorities and intelligence agencies thus not involving the public in the terrorism discourse, the British government minimised the performative power and thus the influence of the movement. Other factors were; (2) the way the media reported the actions of the SNLA, which was usually with disdain; (3) errors from within the SNLA itself, like failed attacks or other actions and; (4) there were other alternatives for the SNLA, movements like the trade union or political parties which were more successful at achieving the same goals as the SNLA but through legal means. On this basis it is recommended for future counterterrorism policies to keep the performative power of the government as low as possible and to keep an open dialogue with and invest in the alienated and marginalised groups of society. Providing them with other alternatives for terrorism.","['Terrorism', 'Scotland', 'Nationalism', 'Scottish National Liberation Army', 'Counter terrorism', 'Performative power', 'Media influence']"
