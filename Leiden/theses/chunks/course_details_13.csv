"The impact of reward anticipation on the accuracy, confidence and precision of long-term memory, and how quality of sleep plays a role","Flamand, Matthijs","['Lloyd, B.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Memory is complex and poorly understood. In this study we aim to measure the effects of arousal on long term memory using an established positional response paradigm often used in short-term memory research. Using this paradigm, the relationship between arousal and the accuracy, confidence and precision of long-term memory was tested. The effect of sleep quality on the successful recall and precision of long-term memory was also tested. Sleep quality was measured using the Sleep Quality Scale (SQS). We introduced a state of arousal by promising a reward for correctly categorizing man-made or natural stimuli. Participants were shown these stimuli on the first day and given a surprise test after 24-hours. Performance was measured using the positional response paradigm. Afterwards they filled in the SQS with additional questions. Arousal was expected to increase the accuracy, confidence and precision of the recall of the stimuli in the rewarded condition. SQS scores were expected to correlate negatively with precision and accuracy. We found a significant effect of arousal on confidence and accuracy. There was no effect of arousal on the precision of long-term memory. This is likely due to the design of the experiment, as well as the small sample size. There was no significant effect of SQS scores on accuracy or precision, although trends were observed that support the original hypothesis. The results support the theory that arousal increases accuracy and confidence of long-term memory. Further research is needed to determine how arousal affects the precision of long-term memory.",

The influence of social skills and social anxiety on the perception of likeability in children,"Davidse, Yolinda","['Voogd, L. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the current study we investigated whether social anxiety and social skills had an effect on the discrepancy between self-reported and peer reported likeability in children. We expected to find a negative relationship between social anxiety and self-reported likeability, and a positive relationship between social skills and peer-reported likeability, as shown in previous studies. Within this pilot study we used a community sample. Here, 22 children between 8 and 15 years old filled out questionnaires about social anxiety, estimates of their own likeability and how much they liked their classmates. Their teachers completed a questionnaire regarding the children’s social skills. Differences were found between boys and girls, where girls scored significantly higher on social skills. Social skills were positively associated with self- and peer-reported likeability, but not with perception biases (discrepancy scores) on likeability. Social anxiety was not associated with any of the likability scores, which is in contradiction with previous findings, which state that social anxiety is associated with a lower perceived likeability. Since the current study sample was small and contained little variety in social anxiety, more research is needed to better evaluate social skills and likability both in socially anxious and non-anxious children.",

Democratische volksvertegenwoordiging: Een onderzoek naar gepercipieerde volksvertegenwoordiging onder hoger en lager opgeleiden,"Broek, Dennis van den","['Holsteyn, J. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In mijn onderzoek verdiep ik mij in het academische debat over diplomademocratie, een democratie waarin hoogopgeleiden de meeste politieke macht en invloed hebben. Er is sprake van descriptieve oververtegenwoordiging van hoogopgeleiden in de politiek en een dominante invloed van hoogopgeleiden op de politieke besluitvorming. Er is binnen de academische literatuur veel geschreven over descriptieve en substantieve volksvertegenwoordiging, maar weinig over wat burgers zelf vinden van deze twee vormen van volksvertegenwoordiging en of zij zich vertegenwoordigd voelen. Daarom voer ik een onderzoek uit naar de politieke percepties op volksvertegenwoordiging onder hoger en lager opgeleiden. Op basis van theorie stel ik dat lager opgeleiden gemiddeld gezien negatiever lijken te oordelen over volksvertegenwoordiging dan hoger opgeleiden. Verder vraag ik aan respondenten waarom zij zich wel of niet vertegenwoordigd voelen door politici in de Tweede Kamer en wat zij vinden van de descriptieve oververtegenwoordiging van hoger opgeleiden. Hieruit concludeer ik dat de visie van de meeste respondenten op volksvertegenwoordiging beter aansluit op substantieve in plaats van descriptieve representatie. Ten slotte is de gepercipieerde democratische vertegenwoordiging onder de meeste respondenten overwegend positief, waarbij opleidingsniveau echter geen verklaring biedt.",

It is hypothesized that at the base of this socioeconomic problem lies a negative relationship between the Need for Autonomy and the Acceptance of Free Debt Advice. This is based on the notion that through accepting help you relinquish a part of your ability to fully make your own choices, meaning you would actually give away a piece of your autonomy by accepting help. Participants, (N=75), completed an online questionnaire that measured their need for autonomy, using the Implicit PSEAutonomy Measure, and their acceptance of help, using a question based on the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. The data showed no significant correlation between the two variables. We must conclude that in the current research we were unable to detect there a possible relationship between Need for Autonomy and Acceptance of Debt Relief Help. Recommendations to improve on this research in the future are offered however, such as ensuring more balanced samples on the basis of gender and educational level.",
Investigating the N400-Component as an Implicit Measure of Supernatural Belief,"Brousianou, Athina","['Elk, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Despite the increase of secularism, implicit religious and spiritual (jointly termed “supernatural”) reasoning persists even in individuals who identify as nonbelievers; however, previous studies have used behavioral implicit measures to examine differences between implicit and explicit belief. The aim of this research was to investigate these differences in atheist and spiritual-but-not-religious (SBNR) individuals using event-related potentials, and explore the N400-effect as an implicit marker of (un)belief. We conducted two studies: Study 1A (N = 101) examined supernatural attitudes and study 1B (N = 109) examined supernatural beliefs. Participants were presented with positive/negative (1A) and belief/disbelief (1B) religious, spiritual, and control statements, and were asked to provide their explicit evaluation (i.e., agree/disagree) of the statements while ERPs were being recorded. The results showed inconclusive evidence of the utility of the N400 as an implicit measure of belief. Specifically, we did not find significant differences between atheists and SBNR individuals in the N400- amplitude between positive and negative (1A), or belief and disbelief (1B) religious, spiritual, and control statements. In light of the lack of statistically significant results, exploratory analyses were performed, and implications and limitations of our study, as well as suggestions for future research, were discussed.","['N400', 'event-related potentials', 'EEG', 'unbelief', 'spirituality', 'religiosity', 'secularism', 'naturalness of religion hypothesis', 'dual-process account']"
"Implementation of CenteringPregnancy® in the Netherlands: Investigating Relationships between Model Fidelity, Social Support, Group Cohesion, and Satisfaction with Care","Paukkunen, Jonna","['Wirken, L.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"CenteringPregnancy® (CP) is a prenatal care model that provides all aspects of prenatal care in a group setting. This retrospective cohort study investigated how the CP group facilitators’ fidelity to the CP model, social support (as perceived by the CP participants), group cohesion (as perceived by the CP group facilitators), and the CP participants’ satisfaction with care were related. Additionally, it was assessed how the perceived social support and the observed group cohesion developed over time, and to what extent these were related to each other. 637 women (mean age 30.44) and 69 groups were included. Questionnaires were used to measure perceived social support at the 28th week and 36th week of pregnancy, and satisfaction with care (PPSQ) at the 36th week. Model fidelity and group cohesion were measured by a questionnaire filled in by the group facilitators after each session. A parallel mediation analysis, a dependent samples t-test, and a one way repeated measures ANOVA were conducted. The results showed that women that felt more supported by their peers were generally more satisfied with CP care (95% CI [.15, .22]). In contrast, group facilitators’ perceptions of the groups’ cohesiveness did not predict how satisfied the women were with CP care (95% CI [-.17, .12]). It was also found that the group facilitators’ fidelity to the CP model did not predict the participants’ satisfaction with care (95% CI [-0.01, 0.00]). Further, the results showed that the participants felt increasingly supported by their peers over the course of the program (p < .001, d = .82). Similarly, the group facilitators’ perceived the CP groups to be increasingly cohesive over time (p = .001, η 2 = .02). Finally, the participants’ and group facilitators’ perceptions of social support and group cohesion were found to be weakly related (p < .001). These findings highlight that the implementation of CP in the Netherlands shows promise in enhancing maternal social support, and consequently, satisfaction with care. This study also adds unique knowledge to the evidence base of CP by assessing the cohesiveness of the groups. Future research is called upon to examine the presented relationships by applying different instruments regarding the group facilitators’ (in)fidelity to the CP model.","['CenteringPregnancy', 'Group Prenatal Care', 'Social Support', 'Group Cohesion', 'Model Fidelity', 'Satisfaction with Care']"
Temporal stability of idiographic psychological networks,"Proppert, Ricarda","['Fried, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Evidence-based mental health programs have long conceptualized mental disorders as interactions between thoughts, feelings, behaviours and external factors. Idiographic network models are a relatively novel way of estimating such intra-individual psychological processes. These methods are not without limitations, and concerns have been raised about the stability and accuracy of estimated networks. The extend to which idiographic networks are stable, or vary over time, is unknown. We explored temporal network stability from three angles, exploring variation within people, across different stability metrics, and across people. We reanalysed daily symptom records of people with personality disorders. We fit graphical Vector Autoregressive models separately for the first and second 50 days of consecutive measurements. Contemporaneous but not temporal idiographic networks appeared to be relatively stable within people. The assessment of stability varied considerably across metrics applied. There was large variation in network stability of contemporaneous structures across people, which could not be explained by subject-specific variables. We illustrate the temporal changes in contemporaneous network structures of two participants with high and low network stability and discuss the most pressing questions to be considered by future research.","['stability', 'replicability', 'consistency', 'idiographic', 'subject-specific', 'psychological networks', 'network comparison']"
A Comparative Simulation Study on the Performance of Nonmonotonic Tests in Psychology,"Perez Alonso, Andres","['Karch, J.D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The identification of the dependence between variables is a common task in Psychology. The most common approaches to this task are Pearson’s, Spearman’s, and Kendall correlation coefficients. A clear limitation of those coefficients is that they can only identify linear and monotonic relationships. In recent years, several methods to identify nonmonotonic associations have been developed. Nevertheless, there is not a clear answer to which method should be used when facing unknown conditions in research as is often the case in Psychology. In this study, we aimed to identify which dependence test performs the best under conditions that can be found in psychological research. Method: A simulation was performed to compare nine dependence tests through hypothesis testing. The conditions assessed were sample size, type of relationship, and noise. Three approaches were employed to summarize the statistical power and analyse the results: complete class, average power, and Maximin. Results: There was not a uniformly most powerful test across all conditions. However, several nonmonotonic tests presented a good performance in terms of power for most conditions. Moreover, Mutual Information (MI) estimated through Kernel Density Estimation with the Epanechnikov kernel and the Sheater-Jones plugin bandwidth outperformed all other methods in terms of the analysis approaches of this study. Conclusion: For the evaluated conditions we recommend the use of MI estimated through the defined settings. Nevertheless, other modern tests should not be immediately discarded as their difference in performance with MI is small and could be due to the design of this specific simulation.","['dependence tests', 'correlation', 'nonmonotonic associations', 'MonteCarlo simulation', 'hypothesis testing']"
Observed parental autonomy support and psychological control: how they relate to adolescent attachment,"Müller, Barbara","['Wentholt, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study used hierarchical linear modelling to examine parental behaviors such as autonomy support and psychological control and their relation to adolescent attachment. Another goal was to find whether there were differences between mothers and fathers on their display of the investigated behaviors. The present sample consisted of adolescents (N=80) participating with their mothers (N=78) and fathers (N=65) from the Netherlands. Observational ratings of parental autonomy support and psychological control were obtained in mother/father-adolescent dyads performing a problem-solving task. Adolescent attachment was measured by adolescent report, using the parent scale of the revised inventory of parent and peer attachment (IPPA-R) by Raja et al (1992). Analyses indicated that parental autonomy support positively relates to adolescent attachment, while psychological control was not found to relate to adolescent attachment in this sample. Furthermore, results of parental gender differences were inconlusive. This study emphasizes the need to take into account parental behaviors when working with teenagers and the impact parents might have on their children. Further, this study poses important implications for family therapy or social workers, while raising questions for future research.","['attachment theory', 'parenting', 'psychological control', 'autonomy support', 'adolescence']"

Differentiating how individual factors affect memory and determining which neural circuits are involved in different parts of memory is very difficult because when memory is tested or consolidated, multiple brain regions and neural circuits are involved in these memory processes. In this study, we examined what effect arousal, specifically inducing reward anticipation during memory encoding would have on participants’ memory performance, when tested after a 24-hour delay. Participants were also asked to report on their sleep quality, in the interval between day 1 and day 2 of testing. The Sleep Quality Scale scores were compared with the participants’ overall memory performance in order to determine whether sleep had a beneficial effect on their memory. Memory performance was measured based off of three different components. We measured memory accuracy, memory confidence and memory precision in the memory test. Our results showed that reward anticipation does indeed modulate and enhance memory performance. However, within our sample, only memory accuracy and memory confidence were enhanced. Furthermore, we were unable to find a direct relationship between sleep on memory performance. Nevertheless, given that previous research has found evidence to suggest that sleep promotes better memory performance, we conclude that there were limitations in our study, and that ultimately sleep and reward anticipation do exert beneficial effects on memory performance. Nonetheless, to what extent, and which specific aspects of memory, i.e., memory encoding or memory consolidation are modulated by sleep and reward anticipation, has to be researched further.",
The Role of Intrinsic versus Extrinsic-Social Religious Orientation in Dealing with Identity Threat as a Function of In-Group Identification among Muslims: Implications for Emotions and Action Intentions,"Noçon, Franziska M.","['Scheepers, D.', 'Wirtz, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Threats to Muslim identification are common (Wellman & Tokuno, 2004). Religious identity threats target the individual or group, but also attack the revered system of beliefs on which the identity is founded (Ysseldyk, Matheson, & Anisman, 2010; 2011). Hence, a fundamental coping resource (i.e., religious beliefs) might be undermined and negative consequences for emotions might ensue. The present study that used a survey design and examined 59 Muslims investigated religious identity or religiosity in understanding how a religious identity threat is dealt with by Muslims forming a religious minority. Intrinsic (religious belief) vs extrinsic-social (social aspects of religious identity) religious orientations underlying religious identity were hypothesized to differentially predict threat appraisal, emotion vs problem oriented coping and negative emotions. Results show an intrinsic orientation to predict emotion-focused coping and intense negative emotions. An extrinsic orientation relates to problem-focused coping and less intense negative emotions. To conclude, especially in the context of intrinsic religiosity, a strong impact of identity threat is linked to a heightened focus on as well as experience of negative emotions. These findings point to importance of considering particularly intrinsic identification in regard to its wider ‘construction’, to improve the understanding of religious identification (in religious minorities) in the context of recurrent negative evaluation.","['intrinsic and extrinsic-social religious orientations', 'religious identity threat', 'threat appraisal', 'emotion- and problem-focused coping', 'negative emotions']"
Relationships between direct and reflected self-concept and maternal communication during adolescence,"Koert, Vera van","['Cruijsen, R. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction One of the main tasks during adolescence is to develop a positive directself-concept, how a person thinks about him- or herself. This study investigates how warmth, negativity and emotional support in maternal communication, and reflected self-concept, how a person thinks peers think about them, are related to the positivity of the direct self-concept of adolescents. Since the importance of peers during adolescence increases and the importance of parents decreases, the relationship between maternal communication and direct self-concept is expected to be weakened and the relationship between reflected and direct self-concept is expected to be strengthened with age. Methods 93 adolescents between 11 and 21 years old evaluated how they perceived themselves and how they think peers perceive them by indicating how well positive and negative traits fit them. Additionally, they participated in a conversation between mother and child, in which maternal communication was scored on warmth, negativity and emotional support. Results Maternal warmth, negativity and emotional support showed no significant relationships with direct self-concept. Age seemed not to have a moderating effect. However, the moderation was marginally significant in the relationship between warmth and direct self-concept, in which warmth was significantly related to direct self-concept in mid-adolescence but not in early or late adolescence. A positive relationship was found between direct and reflected self-concept. No moderating effect of age was found in this relationship. Discussion This study provides evidence that both peers and parents are important for the positivity of self-concept of adolescents. Maternal warmth seems to be of importance during midadolescence, suggesting that parents still seem to have influence on how adolescents evaluate themselves during this period. The perceived opinions of others seem to be important during entire adolescence. Limitations and implications of the findings are discussed.",
To Avoid or Not to Avoid? The Impact of Experiential Avoidance on the Relation between Interpersonal Trauma and Feelings of Depression,"Jacobs, Seff","['Tollenaar, M.S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The experiences of interpersonal trauma can have long-lasting effects on multiple life domains including mental health. Literature suggests that the strength of this relation may be impacted by the amount of experiential avoidance individuals use. This study aims to examine the relation between interpersonal trauma and depressive feelings and the impact of experiential avoidance on this relation. This was investigated by means of online self-report questionnaires performed by 27 females with an average age of 46.26 (SD = 11.85). To measure whether participants experienced interpersonal trauma the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 was administered. Depression scores were assessed by means of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Experiential avoidance was measured with the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire- II. Linear and multiple regression analyses were performed, and indicated that females who experienced interpersonal trauma score significantly higher on depression than females who did not experience interpersonal trauma (p = .008, R 2 = .25). Findings of the multiple regression analysis indicate no significant interaction of interpersonal trauma and experiential avoidance (p = .614). However, experiential avoidance by itself was a significant predictor of depression (p =<0.01) and reduced the explanatory variance of interpersonal trauma. This possibly indicates a mediating effect of experiential avoidance on the relationship between interpersonal trauma and depression. Recommendations for future research is to investigate this possible mediating role of experiential avoidance on the relation between interpersonal trauma and depression. The current findings suggest that treatments 5 targeting greater experiential acceptance, possibly through peer support groups, might help victims of interpersonal trauma.",

The original version IQCODE-sf contains 16 items and the IQCODE-sf-M contains 21 items, of which 11 items are newly added, assuming to be less culturally biased.Methods: This study is a case control design. In this study 111 patients of the memory clinic and 50 healthy participants with the age of 55 years or older were included. The patient group was divided in three groups; dementia (n = 49), MCI (n = 34) and cognitively healthy (n = 28). At least 50% of participants in the patient sample were illiterate. The informants of the participants filled out the IQCODE, for example a caregiver or relative. Results: The area under the curve (AUROC) of the IQCODE-sf was 0.86. A cut-off point of 3.69 yielded a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 74%. The AUROC of the IQCODE-sf-M was 0.87. A cut-off point of 3.57 yielded a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 86%. We found no statistically significant difference in the psychometric properties between the new modified IQCODE (IQCODE sf-M) and IQCODE in short form (IQCODE-sf).Conclusion: In this study it has been shown that the original version of the IQCODE in short form works fine for the elderly migrants in the clinical and community settings and could not be improved by adding 11 new items","['Dementia', 'illiteracy', 'informant report', 'sensitivity', 'specificity']"
Rachman’s Pathway of Verbal Information Transmission: Children’s Fear of the Covid-19: Virus and the Influence of Behavioural Inhibition,"Wessely, Aliena","['Nimphy, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The present study focuses on the worldwide pandemic of the Covid-19 virus, investigating fear acquisition through Rachman’s third pathway. He suggests that fear can be induced via verbal information transmission. Especially during childhood and adolescence, information about novel stimuli is given by parents. In addition, the present paper investigates the impact on a child characteristic temperament (behavioural inhibition) and how this interacts with parental verbal threat information and their respective fear of the virus. Methods: A healthy sample of 88 children and their respective parents filled in online questionnaires individually concerning their fear of the Covid-19 virus and the source of information they retrieve about the virus. Secondly, children filled out a questionnaire on behavioural inhibition to measure temperamental tendencies. Results: Results supported the view that higher fear towards the virus of the parent can elevate fear of the child. It seems that parental fear of the virus might result in more communication of their fear, mediating the raised fear levels of the child regarding the Covid 19 virus. Lastly, behavioural inhibition did not impact the attention towards threat information provided by the parent and hence, was not associated with promoting the acquisition of fear. Discussion: Parent-child conversation poses an important learning context to the child, trying to understand the virus experienced and is hence, fundamental for developing fears of viruses. As those children who showed behavioural inhibition were not more sensitive to the threat information provided, future research should test the existence of this relationship","['Child Fear', 'Verbal Threat Communication', 'Parental Fear', 'Behavioural Inhibition', 'Covid-19 Virus']"

Validating the AU-mapping recognition of emotion recognition software (OpenFace),"Meekel, Sander","['Boekel, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the beginning of Ekman's (1970) research, a lot of research has been done on emotions. According to Ekman there are 6 different emotional facial expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear,surprise, and disgust. Originally these emotions were coded by trained professionals. The current research therefore focuses on the question of whether emotional facial expressions can also be recognized correctly by facial recognition software (such as OpenFace). This is done by showing participants a selection of stimuli (3 second segments) after which they must score this segment on the 6 basic emotions of Ekman (1970). The current results indicate that facial recognition software derives the same kind of emotion as the participants do. This is an indication that facial recognition software could replace trained professionals. However, much research isstill needed about the quality of the software recognition compared to the recognition quality of a trained professional. In addition, research has also been conducted about the influence of moods on recognizing emotions. According to Bower's (1987) mood-congruence theory, people process a stimulus faster 4 and more attentively when it portrays the same mood. In addition, Steephen et al. (2020) argue that the intensity of recognition increases, when the stimulus contains the same emotion as the mood of the individual. This is exactly what has been studied. The results show that this is not the case, except for anxiety. This contradiction may be related to the study design, but also to the number of participants who participated in the study.",
The Need for Autonomy and the Acceptance of Help when in Debt,"Rasch, Florianne","['Weiden, A. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The combination of rising debts in the UK and the evidence for debts negatively affecting people’s health is alarming. There are organizations that offer help to those struggling with debts. To improve the help that these organizations offer, more knowledge on help-seeking behaviour is needed. Based on previous research indicating the diminishing effect of the need for autonomy on the willingness to accept help, we investigated if the need for autonomy serves as a barrier for accepting help for people living with debts. We hypothesized that there is a negative relationship between the need for autonomy and the likelihood of accepting help. In this study, respondents answered a questionnaire that measured their implicit need for autonomy and their willingness to accept help. A negative correlation was found, however non-significant. Our sample showed a strong willingness to accept help, which is unrepresentative of the UK population. We argue that the relationship between the need for autonomy and the willingness to accept help is likely to exist, even though we were unable to detect it. Future research is needed to understand this phenomenon better. We recommend future research to use a sample that is living with debts.",
Why Not Accept Help When in Debt? A correlational study with the need for autonomy and accepting free debt advice,"Behar, Defne","['Weiden, A. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Debt and poverty are vastly growing issues of our society that come with psychological risks. Receiving free debt advice improves well-being psychologically, yet those in debt do not often get this help. We argue that the need for autonomy can be an influential construct in the acceptance of free debt advice, given that poverty is accompanied by lower perceived autonomy and that when ones autonomy is endangered, this lowers their tendency to accept help of other kinds. So, we hypothesised that having a higher need for autonomy would indicate lower tendency to accept debt advice. We conducted an online survey with 75 UK citizens in which an implicit measure of the need for autonomy (Picture Story Exercise) as well as a likert scale for accepting debt advice were administered. There was an insignificantly negative correlation between the implicit measure and the acceptance of free debt advice. We speculate that, how dependency/autonomy oriented debt advice was perceived as well as the fact that our participants were not experiencing real life debt, weakened the correlation. As exploratory analysis, the correlation between the explicit measure of need for autonomy (IAF) and likelihood of accepting help was tested. This correlation was also nonsignificant yet positive. We speculate that this could be due to the social desirability bias. Future research should explore the autonomy/dependency orientation of free debt advice to pave the way for increasing the acceptance of debt advice.",

It’s hard to learn with all this noise: The influence of computational noise in reward guided learning through noradrenergic modulation using transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation,"Katopodis, Vasilis","['Wurm, K.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In a volatile environment, learning which decision is constantly rewarding can be difficult. Humans surprisingly make many decisions which seemingly go against earning rewards. In the current research we disentangle these non-greedy decisions between information seeking and triggered by computational noise using a reinforcement learning model. Based on previous research we hypothesize that noradrenaline (NE) acts as a neuro modulator responsible for the sequential update of expected values of rewards. To this end, we stimulate the vagus nerve of the left ear using transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS), compared to sham stimulation, while participants played a two-handed value-based learning bandit task. In line with similar research, we expect NE to have an influence on decisional precision. In contrast, we do not find concluding evidence for NE augmenting the underlying learning process but show how a big portion of non-greedy decisions is due to computational noise rather than information seeking . Taken together, our findings indicate that most behavioural variability occurs from the limited computational precision that is encapsulated in reward-guided learning.",
"The Influence of Noradrenergic Modulation on Learning Noise in Value-Based Decision Making, using tVNS.","Nootebos, Lara","['Wurm, F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Decision making is a necessary skill people use every day. We, as humans, learn from our previous decisions and use this new-learned information as a basis for our future decisions. This way we aim to maximize the value of the outcome of our decisions. However, sometimes we seem to make decisions that are non-greedy and will result in a lower outcome. This behaviour could be explained by noise during the learning of these value-based stimuli. One neurotransmitter that is involved in the modulation of learning noise is norepinephrine, and can be manipulated using tVNS. Using a learning noise model, the data obtained during this study shows that previous findings by Findling et al. can be replicated, suggesting that many non-greedy decisions can be explained by learning noise. Further results showed no significant effect of our tVNS manipulation, taking into question the effectiveness of the tVNS method, as well as tonic and phasic manipulation. Further research is needed into the specific neurotransmitter pathways related to value-based decision making in order to create a better understanding of our decision making process.",

This study aims to investigate the relationship between the use of psychedelics and long-term supernatural beliefs. Additionally, we investigate the option that long-term ontological confusions and anthropomorphism mediate this relationship. A survey was conducted among 245 participants who all had an interest in psychedelics. The survey used previously existing scales to assess scores on ontological confusions, anthropomorphism and supernatural beliefs. The results showed there was a correlation between psychedelics use and the tendency to anthropomorphize. Also, ontological confusions and anthropomorphism are positively correlated with supernatural beliefs. However, no correlation between psychedelic use and ontological confusions was found nor was there a significant correlation between psychedelic use and supernatural beliefs. Additionally, the data did not support a mediation model of the variables. Exploratory analyses suggested that the type of psychedelic compound and the frequency with which a compound had been consumed did not have a significant correlation with anthropomorphism. Future research is required to provide more accurate findings.",

Uit onderzoek blijkt dat mensen lichamelijke, psychische en cognitieve problemen ervaren na het verzetten van de klok. Om een beter beeld te krijgen van welke factoren invloed hebben op de mate van last die mensen hebben gaat dit onderzoek in op de rol van persoonlijkheid. Er is specifiek gekeken of mensen die relatief lager scoren op de eigenschap ‘nauwgezetheid’ meer last hebben van de transitie van winter- naar zomertijd dan mensen die relatief hoger scoren op de eigenschap ‘nauwgezetheid’. 33 participanten hebben een week voor het verzetten van de klok tot en met een week erna hun tijden van opstaan en van naar bed gaan bijgehouden. Daarnaast hebben ze eenmalig de subschaal voor het meten van de karaktereigenschap ‘nauwgezetheid’ van de Big Five Inventory ingevuld. Vervolgens werd aan de hand van de ingevulde tijden berekend na hoeveel dagen de participanten na het verzetten van de klok weer terug waren in hun normale ritme. Het aantal dagen werd vergeleken met de BFI scores door middel van een regressieanalyse. De resultaten waren niet significant. Desondanks waren er wel lichte trends te zien die in overeenstemming waren met de hypothese dat chaotische mensen meer moeite hebben met aanpassen aan de zomertijd dan ordelijke mensen. Dit aspect van persoonlijkheid speelt hier dus mogelijk een rol, maar meer onderzoek is nodig om dit te bevestigen.",
Psychedelics & Religion: Is religiosity related to religious experience during the use of psychedelics?,"Liu, Yanan","['Elk, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The current study experimentally investigated the effects of personal religiosity level on an individual’s attribution of psychedelic experience to be religious. And whether the frequency of using psychedelics could contribute to religious attribution of psychedelic experience under the moderation effect of an individual’s level of belief in God. The number of 516 people responded to a survey assessing their religiosity, indicated by the level of faith in God and other religion-introduced concepts such as angels and demons, their frequency of using psychedelics, and the degree to which they considered their psychedelic experience to be religious-related. SPSS (Version 26) was used to run regression analysis to measure the scores. The results indicated that people with a high religiosity level were more likely to experience psychedelics in a religious-related way. However, there was no effect found of frequency of psychedelic usage on religious-related psychedelic experience with or without belief in God as a moderator. Despite the central hypothesis being significant, there remained partly insignificant results and other limitations of this study. As a result, more research should be conducted to understand better the relationship between religiosity and psychedelics drug and their possible implication in the clinical and non-clinical psychology field.","['Psychedelics', 'religiosity', 'belief in God', 'supernatural beliefs', 'psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy']"
"Trippy Matters: A psychedelic cross-sectional study investigating the association between setting, nature relatedness and connectedness","Karl, Anna","['Elk, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Humans seem to be increasingly disconnected from nature and from themselves, which appears to be essentially linked to mental illnesses and lower levels of well-being. However, current literature reveals promising results for psychedelic interventions. Previous research findings suggest that nature relatedness and feelings of connectedness increase via psychedelic experiences, and that natural trip settings might amplify these relationships even more. Methods: Using linear regression analysis, moderation and mediation analysis we investigated the association between trip setting and nature relatedness and connectedness among psychedelic drug users (N=190) in a cross-sectional online survey. For exploratory purposes we investigated the effect of predominant living environments. Results: More naturalistic settings were positively associated with increases in nature relatedness and connectedness. Naturalistic living environments did not predict nature relatedness. Connectedness mediated the relationship between trip setting and nature relatedness. Conclusion: The present study provides evidence for a correlational effect of naturalistic environment during psychedelic use on increases in nature relatedness and connectedness, which appears of great relevance for the field of mental health and treatments using psychedelics.","['psychedelics', 'nature relatedness', 'connectedness', 'awe', 'living environment']"
Thinking out of the box in the classroom: The influence of teachers on intelligence and creativity in primary school children,"Oldenhuis, Annejet","['Stolte, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this study, the influence of teachers’ attitudes, beliefs and opinions regarding the creative and intellectual abilities of primary school children on the achievement of these children is investigated. Intelligence and creativity are both crucial for problem solving, high achievement and reasoning on a daily basis. The first hypothesis states that intelligence and creativity have a positive relationship, where intelligence predicts creativity, according to the “necessary but not sufficient” hypothesis. The second hypothesis states that the influence of teachers operates as a moderator in this relationship, thus strengthening the connection between intelligence and creativity. According to the idea that the social context is important in the development of intelligence and creativity and that this development commences early in childhood, teachers are seen as influential in this development. Intelligence is measured through the Nederlandse Intelligentietest voor Onderwijsniveau (NIO). Creativity is measured through the Creative Problem Solving task (CPS) and the Test of Creative Thinking and Drawing Production (TCT-DP). Teachers’ opinions is measured through a questionnaire. Results show that intelligence does significantly predict creativity, but that teachers have little to no influence on this connection and therefore do not operate as a moderator. Further research is needed to investigate the influence of teachers more comprehensive, expand the use of intelligence tests, examine the effects of a longitudinal instead of a cross-sectional study design, and look into the possible influence of parents, age and gender on the development of intelligence and creativity.","['intelligence', 'creativity', 'primary school children', 'teachers', 'social environment']"
Anthropomorphism and Conspiracy Beliefs – Understanding the Consequences of Psychedelic Drug Use,"Gerlach, Kiana","['Elk, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The present study looked at whether psychedelic drug users could be more inclined to believe in conspiracy theories, and what role anthropomorphism plays in this potential relationship. For this, we created an online survey and presented respondents with an open-ended question relating to their general worldview and combined different items from conspiracy belief scales that we expected to relate to psychedelic drug users. The results relating to the anthropomorphism questionnaire showed that psychedelic drug use is related to increased anthropomorphism. However, even though this study also showed that anthropomorphism predicts believing in conspiracy theories, psychedelic drug users proved not to be more likely to believe in conspiracy theories than people who have never taken psychedelic drugs before. Responses to our open-ended question showed that many psychedelic drug users tend to be increasingly open-minded and re-evaluate their attitudes or beliefs after their psychedelic experience, but showed no indication of conspiratorial thinking. In contrast to this finding, we also found that an increased frequency of psychedelic drug use did predict conspiratorial thinking. This study gives a very detailed insight into the experiences during and after the use of psychedelic drugs, thereby extending on previous studies investigating psychedelic drug use and its effects.","['psychedelic drug use', 'conspiracy beliefs', 'anthropomorphism']"
Noradrenergic Modulation by tVNS has no Impact on Computational Noise,"Grempel, Max","['Wurm, F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Learning by trial and error is a very fundamental type of learning. In cognitive sciences, this concept is called reinforcement learning and is widely used for research, since it allows comparably easy operationalisation. In order to translate this into computable data, models of reinforcement learning such as the Rescorla-Wagner learning rule are used. These models usually neglect disturbance in learning, which is called computational noise and reduces the precision of neural computations during the learning process. Recent research has looked further into exactly this parameter of learning and found that it indeed plays a big part and should not be neglected (Drugowitsch, Wyart, Devauchelle & Koechlin, 2016). Besides replicating a study by Findling and colleagues (2019), this study specifically looks into the role of noradrenaline in the reinforcement learning process and learning noise. Noradrenaline excretion was triggered by transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation, while a two-armed bandit task was used as learning task. We did not find significant effects of this neurotransmitter on the learning process, however, successfully replicated the research of Findling et al. (2019). These results imply that computational noise during the learning process is still a crucial factor in reinforcement learning and should therefore be further investigated. Noradrenaline might not impact the amount of learning noise to the expected extent.","['noradrenaline', 'computational noise', 'reinforcement learning', 'tVNS']"
Intervention for Physical Activity Promotion: Risk Proneness Predicts Uptake of Deposit Contracts,"Pihlaja, Rea","['Buisonjé, D. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Physical inactivity is related to multiple health problems. Financial incentives have been shown to be motivating factors in prompting people to increase their amount of physical activity. From these incentives, deposit contracts (DC) based on loss aversion mechanisms are suggested as the most cost-effective method. Here, personal investment is made at the beginning of the intervention, which the depositor gradually earns back through physical activity, simultaneously avoiding the aversive feeling of financial loss. However, the uptake of the DCs has been poor, for largely unknown reasons. The present study examined the role of probable predictors behind the uptake of the DC, i.e., the decision to accept the physical challenge and pay the required deposit. The two week challenge involved increasing the daily amount of walking by 120 % from the previous base level, monitored by mobile application. The participants consisted of healthy, young students from European universities. Based on previous studies, it was hypothesized that risk proneness, gender, previous levels of physical activity and related self-efficacy beliefs could predict the uptake of the deposit contract. Among the eligible participants accomplishing the pre-intervention steps, the percentage of uptake was 79 %. The results from the multiple logistic regression analysis showed that risk proneness was the only studied variable that predicts uptake. Thus, risk proneness is one potential factor to be included in DC-based interventions for young adults. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to limitations, the most important being biased gender distribution, small sample size and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","['Financial incentive', 'deposit contract', 'physical activity', 'risk proneness']"

Eerdere studies hebben gevonden dat subjectieve stress gerelateerd is aan pijngevoeligheid in zowel de gezonde als klinische populatie. In deze studie is onderzoek gedaan naar de relatie tussen subjectieve stress, pijntolerantie en pijndrempel. Voor het eerst werden deze relaties onderzocht door pijn aan te brengen middels een cold pressor test. Pijndrempel werd gemeten als de tijd in seconden totdat het pijn deed en pijntolerantie werd gemeten als tijd in seconden totdat de participant de pijn niet meer kon verdragen. Subjectieve stress is gemeten met vragen over huidige stress. De eerste hypothese was dat er een negatieve relatie is tussen subjectieve stress en pijntolerantie. De tweede hypothese was dat er een negatieve relatie is tussen subjectieve stress en pijndrempel. De huidige studie is uitgevoerd op gezonde vrijwilligers (N = 38) tussen 18 en 26 jaar. Er is een significante negatieve relatie gevonden tussen subjectieve stress en pijntolerantie (τ = -.25, p = .015), maar geen relatie tussen subjectieve stress en pijndrempel (τ = -.07, p = .269). In lijn met de eerste hypothese is er een negatieve relatie gevonden tussen subjectieve stress en pijntolerantie. Tegenstrijdig met de tweede hypothese is er geen relatie tussen subjectieve stress en pijndrempel. In nader onderzoek zou de focus gelegd kunnen worden op hoe we de huidige kennis over subjectieve stress en pijngevoeligheid kunnen toepassen, met het doel om zowel stress als pijn te verminderen.","['stress', 'pijntolerantie', 'pijndrempel', 'pijngevoeligheid']"
Niet-geacteerde gezichtsuitdrukkingen: Van Ekmans basisemoties tot Action Units in OpenFace,"Braam, Laura","['Boekel, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is gebaseerd op onderzoek van psycholoog P. Ekman (1970) dat onderscheid maakt tussen zes basisemoties: angst; boosheid; verdriet; 3 afschuw; blijdschap; en verrassing. FACS wordt veel ingezet in het veld van Facial Expression Recognition (FER), een veld waarin veel innovatie plaatsvindt. Het blijft namelijk een uitdaging om de complexiteit van de menselijke emotie te vangen, een proces waarbij verschillende factoren als houding en belichting een rol spelen. Dit leidt tot dit onderzoek naar de nauwkeurigheid van het vastleggen van emotionele emanaties door prototypische categorieën voor gezichtsuitdrukkingen. Om te onderzoeken of er verschil is tussen de emotionele evaluaties van niet-geacteerde gezichtsuitdrukkingen door FACS-naïeve personen en geautomatiseerde FACS-categorisering, is er een survey ontworpen waarin proefpersonen per videosegment met sliders aangeven in welke mate zij vinden dat een bepaalde emotie getoond wordt. Deze resultaten zijn vergeleken met de emotie-evaluaties van OpenFace, waarbij uit de analyse bleek dat er daadwerkelijk overlap is met de emotionele evaluaties van de proefpersonen. Ook werd aangetoond dat deze overlap significant minder is naarmate de proefpersonen de ambiguïteit van de video hoger beoordeelden. Aan de hand van deze resultaten kan geconcludeerd worden dat er overlap is in de emotionele evaluaties van niet geacteerde gezichtsuitdrukkingen door FACS-naïeve personen en geautomatiseerde FACS categorisering, waaruit blijkt dat emotionele emanaties in een bepaalde mate nauwkeurig worden vastgelegd door prototypische categorieën voor gezichtsuitdrukkingen.

Financially dire situations can result in feelings of shame, impacting the chances of the individual reaching our for help. We investigate whether inducing shame resilience in people facing debt can increase the willingness to contact a creditor for financial help. Hypothesizing that shame resilience and a sense of belongingness can increase this willingness to contact, we conducted an online survey and measured recall in two conditions: the manipulation condition where a creditor email primes shame resilience, and a control condition consisting of a standard email, then we measured the willingness to contact the creditor company in each group. The results showed that after reading the manipulation condition email which gave reassurance about feeling shameful for one’s financial situation, participants were more likely to contact the company for financial help compared to the control condition. These significant results suggest that working towards building shame resilience can be a great tool to utilize in future research where the relationship between shame and seeking out financial help is measured.","['shame', 'shame resilience', 'financial shame', 'willingness to contact', 'sense of belongingness']"

Een serie multipele regressieanalyses toonde dat a) collectief, maar niet individueel, psychologisch eigenaarschap over de organisatie een directe positieve relatie heeft met bereidheid tot het doneren van geld, b) identificatie met de organisatie een directe positieve relatie heeft met de bereidheid tot het doneren van geld, en c) zelfinvestering in de organisatie en het gevoel van bij de organisatie te horen allebei een directe en positieve relatie hebben met zowel individueel als collectief psychologisch eigenaarschap van de organisatie én identificatie met de organisatie. Mediatieregressieanalyse toonde dat het gevoel van bij de organisatie te horen en zelfinvestering in de organisatie, via een collectief gevoel van psychologisch eigenaarschap over de organisatie en identificatie met de organisatie als mediatoren, een positieve indirecte relatie hebben met donatiegedrag in de vorm van geld.

In de huidige wetenschappelijke literatuur is hier nog weinig over bekend. Het onderzoek is gedaan middels een vragenlijstonderzoek met een cross-sectioneel design met vrijwilligers bij organisaties uit de Verenigde Staten als deelnemers (n = 105). Wat betreft donatiebereidheid liet een serie multipele regressieanalyse enkel zien dat identificatie met de organisatie invloed heeft op gelddonaties. Wat betreft positieve-mond-tot-mond reclame liet een serie multipele regressieanalyses met name zien dat identificatie met de organisatie bijdraagt aan de bereidheid van vrijwilligers om positieve mond-tot-mond reclame te maken voor het doneren van tijd en geld aan de organisatie. Uit een navolgende multipele regressieanalyse bleek niet dat het hebben van controle binnen de organisatie onder vrijwilligers zorgt voor gevoelens van psychologisch eigenaarschap van de organisatie. Daarnaast zijn respect en moraliteit onderzocht als voorspellers van identificatie met de organisatie. Een multiple regressieanalyse liet ondersteuning zien. Er is ook een mediatieregressieanalyse gedaan, hieruit kwam met name naar voren dat zowel respect als moraliteit een indirecte relatie heeft met donatiebereidheid in de vorm van geld én bereidheid om positieve mond-tot-mond reclame te maken voor het doneren van geld aan de organisatie.

Who follows the health guidelines? The potential role of media exposure in the relationship between perceived vulnerability to disease and people’s engagement in health care behaviours,"Lange Abzueta, Claudia","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD) refers to a human mechanism, that facilitates avoidance behaviour when it detects immunological threats for the body. Recent research shows that increased PVD and increased media exposure have been significantly associated with increased engagement in preventive health care behaviours related to protecting one from contamination with the Covid-19 virus. The possibility of a moderation of media exposure between PVD and preventive health care behaviours has not been investigated yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the moderation effects of media exposure on the relationship between PVD and preventive health care behaviours. Online questionnaires were distributed to a convenience sample through social media platforms and Leiden University’s participant recruitment platform (n = 184). No moderation of different levels of media exposure on the relationship of PVD and preventive health care behaviours was found (b = .011, t = .879, p = .380). An increase in both media exposure and PVD was associated with an increased engagement in preventive health care behaviours. This study calls future researchers to investigate the hypothesised relationship with different media exposure measurement tools. Apart from PVD, media exposure seems to be a potential factor related to the engagement in preventive health care behaviours which could help to dampen the fast transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study highlights the importance of being selective when seeking media sources that provide useful information about the pandemic and the engagement in preventive health care behaviours instead of relying on the overabundance of information","['Covid-19', 'perceived vulnerability to disease', 'engagement in preventive health care behaviours', 'potential role of media exposure', 'moderation analysis']"
Trauma-specific linguistic markers in domestic violence victims during the Covid-19 stressor,"Mohar, Maruša","['Molendijk, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Domestic violence is a highly prevalent form of violation of human rights. Victims often exhibit trauma symptoms and/or suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Identifying individuals at risk for PTSD can sometimes be difficult, yet it is the key in ensuring prevention of later treatment. The solution might be recognition of early trauma-specific symptoms that are predictors of PTSD and can be detectable through spontaneous narratives. Under extreme stressors individuals experience even more distress, which can amplify pre existing trauma symptoms. This study investigated the linguistic characteristics of trauma specific symptoms over two periods – before Covid-19 and during Covid-19 in a domestic violence (DV) victims’ group and a control group. The sample consisted of a total 4413 Subreddit posts that were analyzed using the software Language Inquiry and Word Count. The following categories were investigated: word count, cognitive processes, 1st person singular pronoun, positive emotions, and death. A MANOVA analysis showed that the linguistic markers of trauma were stronger in the victims group compared to control. Victims had longer narratives that included more 1st person singular pronouns, and fewer cognition words and fewer positive emotion words. However, the markers did not differ over the two time periods. The results indicate that victims exhibit stronger trauma-specific discourse compared to control. Unlike self-reports, linguistic analysis of natural word use is free from response bias, a problem often encountered by clinicians. Analysis of linguistic characteristics of spontaneously written material can contribute to early detection of trauma symptoms and prevention of PTSD.","['trauma', 'PTSD', 'linguistic analysis', 'domestic violence', 'victims', 'Covid-19']"
Covid-19 Stress and the Exacerbating Element of Disgust: How Obsessive-Compulsive Tendencies Moderate the Relationship Between Disgust Sensitivity and Covid-19 Related Stress,"Plunkett, Abigail","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019 led to mass panic about its potential implications on global health. Research into previous pandemics such as swine flu, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have acknowledged the fear and development of mental health disorders. Especially anxiety concerning obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), specifically contamination-based OCD, can be heightened during these times of health crises. Disgust sensitivity (DS) is a core elicitor in OCD symptomatology and can exacerbate pre-existing tendencies. Two hypotheses were proposed for this study investigating whether those with high levels of disgust sensitivity and high levels of obsessive-compulsive tendencies had increased levels of (1) Covid-19 stress and anxiety and (2) Covid-19 danger and contamination fears. A convenience sample of 184 respondents participated through an online survey including questionnaires such as the Disgust scale revised (DS-R), the Padua inventory, and the Covid-19 stress scale (CSS). Both hypotheses were confirmed as the results indicated a significant moderation effect of obsessive compulsive tendencies on the relationship between DS and CSS as well as for DS and Covid danger and contamination fears subscale of the CSS. This research can inform and contribute to the existing literature on stress regarding health pandemics and how OC tendencies can elevate it. Recommendations for the prevention of exacerbating pre-existing tendencies include giving effective education and coping mechanisms to educate individuals on how to help reduce stress and anxiety in the face of future world health crises.","['Covid-19 stress', 'disgust sensitivity', 'obsessive compulsive disorder', 'moderation analysis']"
Parental Fear Transmission during Covid-19,"Simon, Sebastian","['Nimphy, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Verbal threat transmission is significant part of the etiology of fear as Rachman (1977, 1991) suggested in his three pathway theory. To test his theory, as Remmerswaal & Muris (2011) did, our research investigated the contribution of verbal threat information which is provided by parents to the development of children’s fear in the context of Covid-19. In order to do that, we tried to observe the relationships among the parental verbal threat information, parents’ and children’s fear of Covid-19, also, we tested whether parents’ and children’s fear of the Covid-19 were mediated by parental verbal threat transmission related to the Covid-19. Furthermore, this paper tried to depict if the different information sources in addition to the parental verbal threat information, parents’ fear of the Covid-19, children’s general fear of medical affairs, parents’ general fear of medical affairs, direct experience of children and direct experience of parents significantly contributed children’s fear of the Covid-19. Methods: Children aged between 8-18 years old (N=90) and one of their parents (N=90) completed Fear of Covid-19 Questionnaire (FCV-19), the Sources of Information about the Covid-19 Scale (SIQ) and Fear Survey Schedule for Children’s Revised version (FSSC-R; Ollendick, 1983) online. To test the mediation, we conducted multiple regression analysis using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) statistical method and to see different information sources’ contribution on children’s fear of the Covid-19, we conducted hierarchical regression. Results: We concluded that parental verbal threat information partially mediated the relationship between children’s and parents’ fear of the Covid-19 and different information sources significantly contributed to the children’s fear of the Covid-19 in addition to other predictors. Discussion: Our results provided support for Rachman’s (1977, 1991) theory which argued the existence of the verbal threat transmission. Another important area was, different information sources might contribute into fear acquisition of children. It leads other future studies that can investigate which information sources are more effective in the children’s fear acquisition.","['Children', 'Covid-19', 'Fear', 'Parents', '(Parental) verbal threat transmission', '(Parental) verbal threat information']"

The participants were asked to fill in an online survey. Mixed evidence was found for the estimated likelihood of guilt and final judgments of guilt when comparing video evidence with audio to without audio. In addition, no evidence was found for an existing bias. It was also hypothesized that video evidence with audio would lead to a higher feeling of presence and vividness, compared to without audio.

Wij verwachtten een verband tussen cijfers en zelfwaarde, een beschermende relatie bij een hoge vriendschapskwaliteit en het effect van cijfers op zelfwaarde en een versterkende relatie tussen cijfers en zelfwaarde bij een lage vriendschapskwaliteit. We verwachtten een verband van positieve motivatie door leeftijdsgenoten en cijfers en een negatieve samenhang tussen negatieve motivatie door leeftijdsgenoten en cijfers. Hiervoor hebben 119 adolescenten uit de tweede en derde klas van de middelbare school een vragenlijst ingevuld over deze variabelen. Om de hypotheses te toetsen zijn er drie regressieanalyses uitgevoerd. Er is geen relatie gevonden tussen cijfers, vriendschapskwaliteit en zelfwaarde. Ook is er geen verband gevonden tussen motivatie door leeftijdsgenoten en cijfers.

Comparison of videoconference and face-to-face treatment effects of personality disorders,"Pan, Jie Jie","['Beurs, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The societal lockdown due to COVID-19 forced a change from in-person therapy to videoconferencing, which was introduced on March 16, 2020. Swift implementation of telehealth care was asked of therapists all over the country. Aim: To investigate whether the effects of treatment for personality disorders through videoconferencing were lower than through in-person therapy. Method: Patients who received treatment between January 2018 and May 2021 were divided into three groups, before (1), partially (2) and entirely during COVID-19 (3). With the ROM score OQ-45 SD as pre- and posttest measurements, a general linear model repeated ANOVA was conducted. We controlled for other variables that were potentially of influence on the achieved outcomes. Results: The hypothesis was not confirmed by the results. The results rather suggested that treatment through videoconferencing was more effective than treatment (predominantly) conducted through in-person. Conclusion: No evidence was found supporting the hypothesized diminished effects of treatment for personality disorder through videoconferencing. Videoconference therapy appeared non-inferior to face-to-face therapy for the treatment of personality disorders. The groups did not differ at the onset. However, treatments were shorter and the dropout rate was 15% higher in the videoconferencing group, which could have led to selection bias.

The Degree to which Boys and Girls differ in Measures of Motivation & Personality Traits – A Meta-Analysis,"Schäfer, Maximilian","['Wierenga, L.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"It has been known for many years now, that girls consistently outperform boys in school. Previous research has shown that there are two non-cognitive factors, motivation and personality traits, which might be able to explain some of the variance for school achievement. Therefore, the current meta-analysis investigated whether boys and girls show significant differences for these two variables. During the analysis, particular emphasis was laid on the influence of age and school subjects. After the literature search on Web of Science, the results of 48 studies (motivation: 38, personality traits: 10) from western countries, were analysed in R. All included studies were published between 2011-2021 and exclusively included healthy students between ages 5-21. The results for motivation showed that, across all ages, girls have significantly higher intrinsic motivation for languages, and that from primary school onwards, boys have significant more intrinsic motivation for subjects related to math and science. The results for personality traits showed that girls scored significantly higher on measures of conscientiousness and measures of agreeableness. Based on these results it was concluded that there are significant gender differences for motivation and for personality traits. In the future policy makers should consider the current results and incorporate solutions that control for these differences.",
Exploration of criteria for mental healthcare allocation. Empirical study on the NZA-model of referral to mental healthcare.,"Strien, Dniancia van","['Spinhoven, P.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Dutch mental healthcare system can be divided into three echelons: Primary general medical healthcare, Primary Mental Healthcare and Specialized Mental Healthcare. Based on this framework, the Dutch Healthcare Authority has composed different patient profiles for each of the three echelons. This total of patient profiles with associated echelons constitutes the NZA model. The General Practitioner (GP) serves as a ""gatekeeper"" to adequately refer patients to the appropriate echelon based on initial assessment. Although the model provides a clear overview of the criterion domains that are required per echelon, it is unknown how heavy each criterion domain weighs in the decision outcome, whether using less criterion domains would yield a similar outcome and if some criteria may be moderated by various protective factors. To fill this gap in knowledge, this study focuses on the question: To what extent are the criteria domains redundant and can the NZA-model be replaced by a more comprehensive model without sizeable loss of predictive ability? To answer the research questions, an observational study was conducted at 1008 patients with mental health problems from fifty GP practices in the western part of the Netherlands. This was done in the form of an analysis of data obtained from a screening instrument that was administered as part of regular general practitioner care for clients with a request for psychological help, namely the Decision Support System - Transparent Next (BOI-TN). The BOI-TN survey consists of various internationally known (sub) scales and items and a number of ad hoc questions as an extension of the existing measures. The results of this analysis showed that of all the criteria domains, eleven predictors were found to be significantly predictive of NZA-indicated echelon advice. Especially probable presence of at least one current DSM disorders, positive mental health, developmental disorder and risk of sudden worsening appear to be predictive for the NZA-indicated echelon advice. At a group level, these eleven predictors explain 79.2% of echelon advice. On an individual level, it can be seen that the agreement of the advice of the reduced model with the NZA model, corrected for chance, is 'substantial' to 'almost perfect'. On the basis of the present study, it could therefore be argued that the reduction in the number of variables at both group and individual level still leads to an accurate prediction of the NZA-indicated echelon advice. An important note here is that the reduced model shows that in order to arrive at a good prediction, it is not enough to look only at the presence of a DSM diagnosis. A multidimensional model, with all five criteria domains, is considered necessary to arrive at a reduced model that explains as much of the NZA indicated advice as possible. Several limitations are discussed.",
Accepting Help when in Debt: How the need for autonomy relates to willingness to accept help in the United Kingdom,"Blumrich, Tim","['Weiden, A. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"More and more people get into debt every year. However, they rarely receive the freely offered services to help them out of debt. Previous research suggests that a person’s high need for autonomy can be seen as an obstacle to accept help. Hence, this study examines the effect of explicit and implicit need for autonomy on the willingness to accept help when in debt. Participants were asked to fill out an explicit (Index of Autonomous Functioning) and an implicit (Picture Story Exercise) measure for autonomy. Afterwards, a hypothetical scenario in which participants’ likeliness to accept free debt advice was administered. Results suggest that explicitly measured need for autonomy is non-significantly, positively correlated with the willingness to accept the offered help. Contrary, the implicit measure showed a non significant, negative correlation with the help-acceptance of the participants. The discussion revealed that the definition of the need for autonomy differs between the measures, which might influence the discrepancy in results. Additionally, as the form of help was autonomy oriented in the current research, there are strong arguments for a greater influence of need for autonomy on dependency-oriented types of help.",
Being in the same classroom or not? The effect on self-regulation in twins.,"Munten, Diewertje","['Meulen, M. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Self-regulation is the ability to regulate emotions and behaviour. This is an important skill in life and necessary to achieve your goals. When a child attends school, a high level of self-regulation is necessary. Self-regulation is affected by many different factors, such as school context. Some of these factors are different in twins compared to singletons, since twins are more often compared to each other. It is still unclear how being in the same classroom or not effects the development of self-regulation in twins. Therefore, this study was designed to examine the effect of being in the same classroom on selfregulation in twins. There were 90 participants between the age of 3 and 4, followed for six years at three measurement timepoints. Self-regulation was measured by Dutch versions of caregiver questionnaires, the Children’s Behaviour Questionnaire and the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire. The long-term effect of being in the same classroom or not on the development of selfregulation and the effect of zygosity were also examined. The results showed a significant increase of self-regulation in twins from T1 to T2, but this was not affected by whether twins were in the same classroom or not. There was neither a significant long-term effect on being in the same classroom or not on self-regulation in twins nor an effect of zygosity. There seemed to be no difference in the development of self-regulation when twins were separated in school and when they were not, but for a broader understanding further research is recommended.","['self-regulation', 'twins', 'school context', 'zygosity']"
Student behavior and gender influence primary school teachers’ overestimations of their students’ mathematical abilities,"Wohlleben, Felix","['Stolte, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper investigated whether student behavior and gender influence teachers’ overestimations of students’ mathematical ability. The sample consisted of 301 Dutch primary school students between the ages of 7 and 13. Student behavior and teachers’ assessment of students’ mathematical ability were measured by a questionnaire answered by the teachers. Mathematical ability was measured by a combined percentile score of three mathematical ability tests. Contrary to previous research it was found that girls’ mathematical abilities are overestimated less than boys’ mathematical abilities. While student behavior was related to the probability of being overestimated, it was not related to the magnitude of overestimation. However, there was a moderation effect of gender resulting in positive behavior and magnitude of overestimation negatively correlating for girls but not for boys. These findings suggest systematical teacher bias in estimating students’ mathematical abilities. Further research should focus on understanding teacher bias, testing the effects of alternatives to numerical grading, and identifying effective ways of assessing students’ ability when needed.",

Linguistic markers of PTSD among domestic violence victims: before and after COVID-19 onset,"Hamm, Sharina","['Molendijk, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders emerging due to impaired memory consolidation and negative appraisal of trauma. Word use has shown to reflect these symptoms in victims describing their experience through natural expressive writing. Domestic violence (DV) is a high-risk factor for developing PTSD that has increased sharply worldwide with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aimed at investigating if there is an increase in linguistic markers of PTSD (high negative emotions; high emotional distancing; low cognitive processing) in people experiencing DV and whether this is intensified through the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, it was examined whether PTSD linguistic markers correlate with decreased social support words. Overall, 5880 text posts were obtained for analysis from three reddit forums. First person DV experiencer posts from r/domesticviolence subreddit were used as experimental group and two neutral subreddits (r/changymview & r/femalefashionadvice) functioned as control groups. DV victims showed significantly higher use of negative emotions than both control groups (r = -.45; r = -.76), higher use of emotional distancing than r/changemyview control group (r = - .14) and lower cognitive processing than r/femalefashionadvice control group (r = -. 3). An increase during the COVID 19 pandemic was not found. Contrary to our hypothesis, social support words showed an increase in DV users but correlated with cognitive processing and negative emotions. Gender differences in word use and intensity of trauma exposure may be investigated over time for further insight.",
Linguistic markers of PTSD symptoms and decreased cognitive processing in domestic violence victims during Covid-19,"Toubassi, Talin","['Molendijk, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Past research has shown that during natural disasters, domestic violence cases tend to increase. As a result of domestic violence, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are likely to develop which decrease cognitive processing capacity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on PTSD symptoms and cognitive processing in domestic violence victims through their word use. Linguistic analysis was performed on posts from the domestic violence and control subreddits from 2019 and 2020 (N = 2858). 1 st person singular pronouns and negative emotions were used as markers of PTSD symptoms, and causation, insight, and tentative were used as markers of cognitive processing. The results showed a significant effect for subreddit only with a strong effect size of η 2 = .693. Compared to the control, the domestic violence subreddit showed significantly greater use of 1st person singular and negative emotion, and significantly lower use of insight, causation, and tentative. However, there were no significant effects of year (η 2 = .003) or interaction between year and subreddit (η 2 = .001). Therefore, there was no significant effect of Covid-19. These results highlight the effect of domestic violence trauma, suggesting an increase in PTSD symptoms and a decrease in cognitive processing. Implications and suggestions for future studies are also discussed.",
"Psychological impact of COVID19 and stress sensitivity in domestic abuse experiencers, according to their word use","Marel, Fréderique van der","['Molendijk, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"OVID-19 has shown to have significant negative impact on mental health, especially in vulnerable groups. One of these groups is experiencers of domestic violence, a group that seems to be growing during the epidemic. Linguistic markers of high stress sensitivity have been identified in earlier research but not used to discover groups vulnerable to developing or possessing high stress sensitivity. The aim of this paper is to determine whether experiencers of domestic violence show more signs of high stress sensitivity as compared to other groups and to test whether COVID-19 has affected the population's levels of mental distress. In this paper, 4186 posts from three subreddits were analysed from pre- and during COVID-19 periods. The results showed a significant positive correlation between the indicators of mental distress and COVID-19 related words (rs = .120, p < .001), as well as between the linguistic indicators of stress sensitivity and anxiety (rs = .352, p < .001). Scores of linguistic indicators of stress sensitivity are significantly higher for 1st person experiencers of domestic violence than for other groups. From this it is concluded that there is a positive relationship between mental distress and the use of COVID-19 related words, as well as between stress sensitivity and anxiety. It also indicates that 1st person experiencers of domestic violence tend to show higher stress sensitivity than others. Further research, specifically non-linguistic research, is needed to provide extra support for the aforementioned relationships found, so as to not rely on linguistic indicators alone.",

A total of 1173 posts were extracted from the Reddit social platform. The posts were put through an LIWC software to acquire the linguistic scores of well-being. The results show that experiencing IPV contributes to lower cognitive processes, personal concerns and religion, while reporting higher negative emotions and drives, accounting for 29.3% of variance explained. COVID19 accounts for only 0.3% of variance explained, as writing during COVID19 leads to significant differences in the drives category, with bystanders reporting the highest scores. Differences between staying or leaving the relationship account for a small variance explained of 0.9%, as those who stay report higher negative emotions and personal concerns, whereas those who leave report higher cognitive processes and drives. Females reported higher cognitive processes than males (r = -.12). Finally, future studies should aim to match control and IPV experienced writers when assessing the linguistic scores by age, cultural background and writing skill for more comparable and reliable results",

The relation between motivational state and emotional expression of gaze cues,"Mulders, Fleur","['Mulckhuyse, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Gaze direction and recognition of emotional expression are crucial aspects of nonverbal communication. Gaze cueing studies showed that gaze can trigger an automatic shift in the focus of the observer’s visual attention. Emotional expression would facilitate this gaze even more because it gives relevant information about the environment. However, findings from gaze cueing studies with emotional expression are inconsistent. Possibly, the influence of motivational state of the observer may influence attention in response to gaze cues with an emotional expression. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate if the tendency of the observer in motivational state (approach/avoidance) affects attentional orienting in response to emotional gaze cues. We expected that sensitivity for an activation or inhibition motivational state has a relation with emotional expression on gaze cues, with a fearful expression showing a positive relation between cue validity and BIS and happy expression showing a negative correlation between cue validity effect and BAS. The results of the study showed a significant gaze cueing effect. However, no significant correlation was found between emotional expression on gaze cues and sensitivity for an activation of inhibition motivational state. This led to the conclusion that emotional expression on gaze cues motivational state does not facilitate attention in such a way that it enhances the reaction time for the detection of targets.",
Niet-geacteerde emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen: van action units naar Ekman’s basic six,"Costa Senior, Quinten de","['Boekel, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Daar waar onderzoek naar emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen eerder met geacteerd, prototypisch materiaal werd uitgevoerd, is het door de ontwikkeling van verschillende sociale media platformen als YouTube, TikTok en Instagram mogelijk om onderzoek te doen met natuurlijke gezichtsuitdrukkingen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om te achterhalen of er overlap is tussen de emotionele evaluaties van geautomatiseerde detectiesoftware en de evaluaties van menselijke deelnemers. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld; In welke mate worden emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen vastgelegd door prototypische categorieën voor gezichtsuitdrukkingen? Om een antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag is een experiment uitgevoerd waarvoor online vragenlijsten onder Nederlandse respondenten zijn verspreid. Respondenten nemen online deel aan het onderzoek en krijgen 30 video’s van 3 seconden te zien met daarin emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen. Deze moeten zij beoordelen met gebruik van 9 sliders. Zes hiervan zijn voor Ekman’s basisemoties en de andere 3 zijn voor ambiguïteit, intensiteit en authenticiteit. Om de algoritmische evaluaties te onderzoeken zijn dezelfde videosegmenten verwerkt met OpenFace software. De resultaten die hieruit voortkomen zijn ingeladen in het statistische inferentie programma R en er zijn verschillende statistische analyses toegepast om correlaties te berekenen. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat er een gemiddelde correlatie is tussen de algoritmische evaluatie en de menselijke evaluatie. Echter, deze correlatie is niet perfect en het kan zijn dat de geautomatiseerde detectiesoftware verbeterd kan worden.",
The Extent To Which Personality Traits Play A Role In The Sex Differences In School Achievement: A Meta-analysis,"Akarsu, Ceren","['Wierenga, L.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recently it has been brought to schools’ attention that the grade gap between boys and girls is increasing over generations, where boys are likely to perform poorly when compared to girls. The purpose of the present study is to estimate whether there are sex differences in big five personality traits and whether this might be related to the grade gap between girls and boys in different school levels. Especially during secondary school, children are subject to major changes in their scores of personality traits since they enter adolescence. A meta-analysis was conducted from 10 articles that presented sex differences in big five personality traits for children in primary and secondary school level. The effect sizes did not significantly differ between personality traits. Results displayed that overall girls score significantly higher than boys on agreeableness and conscientiousness. The effect sizes for school levels also did not differ between primary and secondary school levels. It is concluded that significant differences in certain traits could account for sex differences in academic achievement. The reason why girls score higher on the big-five personality questionnaires could be related to their self-perceptions being shaped by socio-cultural norms stating that girls should be organized and well-behaved, while these norms state that boys can be misbehaved and assertive. Future research requires to take possible moderators into account and investigate studies that include parent-report rather than only self-report.",
Sex differences in coping strategies. Managing stress and academic performances as a student,"Hemert, Yentel","['Wierenga, L.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the past decades extensive research has been done regarding sex differences in coping and the use of different coping strategies. Contradicting findings on the presence of sex differences in coping make it difficult to understand this concept and to generalize findings that may contribute to the creation of helpful interventions for both boys and girls. This meta-analysis includes seven studies that study sex differences in coping in students from the age of 13 till 18 years old. The analysis was performed in R and a main effect of coping was studied as well as an effect for the grouping variable that measured three different coping styles; problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping and avoidant coping. The effect size of the main effect of coping was found to be significant, indicating girls tend to use coping more often than boys. The grouping variable was found to be non-significant indicating the three different coping strategies, problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping and avoidant coping, did not differ significantly from each other. For this reason no post hoc analysis on the grouping variable was performed thus no findings on sex differences regarding the different coping strategies, problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping and avoidant coping, could be established from this meta analysis. A significant main effect of coping suggests sex differences in coping are present but not whether different strategies are used more by either boys or girls. Future studies should focus on the specific sex differences that occur regarding the use of different coping strategies as this knowledge can contribute to future sex depended coping interventions.",
Sex differences in social competency and motivation in school children,"Klap, Esther","['Wierenga, L.M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the years there has been a shift in school performance, where girls perform better than boys. Previous research has shown that social competence and motivation can influence school performance. It is not yet entirely clear if these factors can explain the difference in performance between boys and girls. Therefore, the present meta-analysis was performed to look at possible sex differences on these two variables. The literature search conducted in March 2021 led to the inclusion of 16 articles for social competence and 39 articles for motivation. The results show a significant sex difference in social competence, in favor of girls. There was no significant sex difference in motivation. However, there was a significant sex difference on the grouping variable domain. The difference between language and science was significant. The significant difference in language was in favor of girls, but the significant difference in science was in favor of boys. The results indicate that social competence might be associated with the sex differences seen in school performance. The results from the motivation subgroup analysis suggest that the association with school performance might depend on the type of motivation. Additionally, social competence and motivation can be influenced by implicit expectations or associations. More research is needed to examine these effects. It is important to make teachers, as well as people outside of the school setting aware of the effects of social competence and motivation, and the implicated stereotypes associated with them, and to find possible solutions.",
Stereotypical self-concepts in the classroom: Linking sex differences in academic self-concept to sex differences in reading performance,"Krale, Noa",['Wierenga L.'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"According to many stereotypes, boys and girls have their own particular academic strengths and weaknesses. It is currently unknown where these differences stem from. This meta-analysis focuses on sex differences in reading performance and sex differences in self-concept of academic ability. Based on he results, the aim is to speculate about stereotype threat as a possible mediating factor for explaining the relationship between gender stereotypes and academic self-concept and performance. 12 articles on sex differences in self-concept of academic ability, and 4 articles on sex differences in reading performance were statistically analyzed with a meta-analysis. According to the results, there are no significant sex differences in reading performance. However, the analysis did find significance for a more optimistic self-concept of academic ability for girls compared to boys. More specifically, girls appear to have more positive academic self-concepts in alpha subjects and general academics. Boys had slightly better self-concepts for beta subjects. Interestingly, these findings confirm the stereotypical ideas about sex-specific academic strengths. The analysis of all constructs suffered from high heterogeneity. However, this meta-analysis does display that there are sex differences in academic self-concept. Academic selfconcept influences not only academic performance, but is also crucial in determining educational and career aspirations. Society is already undergoing a shift in perspectives on sex and gender, but it maintains important that we become aware of the influence of our schemas on our children, possibly leading to either flourishment or restriction of their academic potential.",

The Role of Learned Expectations in Pain-Avoidance Behavior: An Experimental Investigation Into the Effects of Negative Pain Expectations,"Konttinen, Maria","['Laarhoven, A.I.M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Pain-avoidance behavior has been associated with adverse pain outcomes. Past research has identified predictors for pain-avoidance behavior but the role of negative expectations in the avoidance of pain has been largely undetermined. The present study aimed to fill the gap by investigating the relation between negative pain expectations and pain-avoidance behavior using a sample of healthy volunteers. Participants were randomly divided into control and experimental groups. In the experimental group, negative pain expectations were induced through verbal suggestion and conditioning of high and medium intensity electrical stimuli which were associated with two color cues. Participants in the control group received high and medium intensity electrical stimuli but no verbal suggestion or conditioning. During the pain-avoidance test, participants made a selection between two versions of the Tower of Hanoi game, differing in the level of difficulty. For the experimental group, hard and easy versions of the game were accompanied with color cues signifying medium and high intensity electrical stimulation, respectively. Based on the previous learning contingency, it was hypothesized that participants in the experimental group would choose to play the hard version of the game to avoid high intensity electrical stimuli. Results showed that verbal suggestion and conditioning are effective techniques at inducing negative pain expectations and nocebo effect on pain. The relationship between negative pain expectations and avoidance of pain was found to be nonsignificant, suggesting that learned negative pain expectations are insufficient at producing pain-avoidance behavior. Further research is needed to clarify predictors of pain-avoidance behavior in clinical populations.",
Painful expectations: The induction of nocebo hyperalgesia through verbal suggestions and conditioning,"Slagter, Judith","['Laarhoven, A.I.M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Chronic pain is a great hindrance in daily life. Treatments for chronic pain can unfortunately also have negative side effects, that a doctor has to inform patients of. It has been suggested that information about side effects could induce them in patients via a nocebo effect. A nocebo effect can also occur because of negative expectations, for example due to previous bad experiences with treatments. Nocebo hyperalgesia can be induced by a combination of verbal suggestions and conditioning. This paper verified whether this is possible in healthy adults. Participants (N = 27) were allocated in two groups; a nocebo and a control group. The experiment consisted of multiple phases. During the conditioning phase, participants received high and medium intensity electrical stimuli paired with color cues. In the nocebo group, one cue was conditioned. Participants were told it would activate a third electrode, making it more painful. In the control group, participants received electrical stimuli with randomized cues. During the testing phase, only medium intensity stimuli were given to both groups. In both phases, participants rated their pain after each stimulus. In the nocebo group, participants were expected to rate their conditioned cue as more painful. A 2x2 mixed ANOVA was performed of the testing phase, showing verbal suggestions and conditioning combined induced hyperalgesia in healthy adults. A large effect size was found. Further research should investigate nocebo hyperalgesia in clinical samples, to check if nocebo effects work in the same way and if there are ways to minimize nocebo hyperalgesia.",

Creativity Development in Dutch Primary School Children: Chasing the Fourth-Grade Creativity Slump,"Führer, Lisa","['Stolte, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In contemporary society, creativity is an important ability and personality characteristic, and yet there are uncertainties about its development. Particularly Torrance’s (1968) fourth-grade slump is controversial. The current study investigated how Dutch primary school children from grade three to five differ in their performance on creative ability tests. It has been assumed that children will display a decrease in creative abilities in the fourth grade of elementary school. Furthermore, this study investigated whether this decrease in creative abilities is domain-specific or domain general. The final sample comprised 360 Dutch elementary school children between age 7 to 12 years. Out of this sample 336, 353, and 346 children completed three different creativity tests. The tests were completed on two days. Each testing session comprised one hour. A multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess the differences in creative performance among the children. Results indicated significant differences on Fluency, Flexibility and Originality for creative problem-solving, as well as significant differences for Fluency for mathematical problem-solving. Performance differences are most evident between grade three and five. However, no evidence for a generalizable fourth-grade slump was found. These insights will be discussed in the light of the Amusement Park Theory, and implications for the educational curriculum and future creativity research are discussed.",

Dit gedrag is een grote voorspeller van suicide, ook als men niet de intentie heeft tot zelfdoding. Om zelfbeschadiging te verminderen is het nodig meer zicht te krijgen op de risicofactoren. Er is aanleiding te onderzoeken welke rol copingstrategieën spelen als beschermende en risicofactoren. Methoden: Om dit te onderzoeken is een zelfrapportage vragenlijst afgenomen bij de respondenten (n= 199). In deze vragenlijst zijn de Borderline Symptom List (23) en de Behavioural Emotion Regulation Scale opgenomen. Hier is een multipele regressie analyse op uitgevoegd om zicht te krijgen op de voorspellende waarden van verschillende copingstrategieën, geslacht en leeftijd op zelfbeschadiging. Resultaten: Copingstrategie Ignoring en Geslacht waren significant en hebben dus een voorspellende waarde op Zelfbeschadiging. De andere vier copingstrategieën en leeftijd waren niet significant en hebben dus geen voorspellende waarde. Discussie: Dit onderzoek ondersteund de verwachting dat copingstijl een voorspellende waarde kan hebben op zelfbeschadiging en mogelijk ook een risicofactor kan zijn. Er is meer inzicht nodig op dit gebied, daarvoor is vervolgonderzoek met een hoger respondenten aantal en een hetereogenere groep gewenst.",
The Effect of Fear of Pain on the Relation Between SelfEfficacy and Pain Tolerance,"Broek, Merel van den","['Veldhuijzen, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"To improve treatments for patients with chronic pain, research into the experience of pain is valuable. Several factors have been found to influence pain experience, including self-efficacy and fear of pain. Researching relations between these factors and pain tolerance might contribute to an improvement of pain treatments. This study aimed to answer two research questions regarding this topic: “Does self-efficacy influence pain tolerance?” and “Does fear of pain influence this relation?”. The first hypothesis was that self-efficacy would influence pain tolerance. The second hypothesis was that the relation between self-efficacy and pain tolerance would be mediated by fear of pain. The study was performed on 38 healthy participants between the ages of 16 and 35 years old. Self-efficacy was manipulated using verbal suggestions, pain tolerance was measured using a Cold-Pressor Test, and fear of pain was measured using the Fear of Pain Questionnaire III. This study found no significant effect of self-efficacy on pain tolerance (p = .784), and no significant effect of fear of pain on the relation between self-efficacy and pain tolerance (Effect = 6.78, 95% C. I. (-7.56, 26.30). Therefore, the hypotheses for this study were not confirmed, which could imply that self efficacy and fear of pain might not be targets for treatment. Strengths and limitations of this study were presented in the discussion. Future research could focus on the effects of factors such as gender on pain tolerance, on methods of manipulating self-efficacy, and on the relation between fear of pain and pain tolerance.",
"The Relationship Between Handwashing, Covid-19 Stress Scale and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease during the Covid-19 Pandemic","Mirkovic, Josip","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Covid-19 can spread through close contact with an infected individual, but also through contaminated surfaces. Handwashing can reduce transmission by eliminating viral particles. This study aimed to investigate if handwashing behavior could potentially be predicted from perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD) and Covid-19 related stress (CSS). Furthermore, this study examined if CSS possibly moderated the relationship between PVD and handwashing. The results of the simple, multiple linear regression and moderation analysis indicated that an increase in the PVD score was associated with an increase in the handwashing habits score. The results of the simple linear regression indicated that the CSS score was also associated with an increase in the handwashing habits score, however the CSS lost its significance in the multiple linear regression and moderation analysis. The results of the moderation analysis also indicated that the relationship between the PVD and handwashing was not moderated by CSS. In conclusion, this study found that the individual’s perceived vulnerability to disease and Covid-19 related stress are associated with a significant increase in handwashing behavior. The relationship between perceived vulnerability to disease and handwashing behavior was not associated with different values of Covid-19 related stress. For future research, it would be valuable to conduct a mediation analysis to investigate the effect of PVD on the relationship between CSS and handwashing, since CSS lost its significant association when considering PVD in data analysis. Predicting handwashing behavior could provide possible targets to increase the effectiveness of public campaigns that aim to improve preventive behaviors.","['Perceived Vulnerability to Disease', 'Covid-19 Related Stress', 'Handwashing', 'Regression', 'Moderation']"
Contamination and Perceived Exposure: Is the Relationship Between Disgust Sensitivity and Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms Moderated by Perceived Exposure to Covid-19?,"Kesim, Işık Eren","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research has proposed disgust sensitivity as a contributor to the development of various mental disorders, such as phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Curtis, 2012; Mancini et al, 2001; Olatunji et al., 2005, 2007). This study examined the relationship between disgust sensitivity and OCD symptoms in a non-clinical sample after one year into the Covid-19 pandemic. During a pandemic, individuals might have different perceptions regarding how much they have been exposed to the virus (Brand et al., 2013). Therefore, it was hypothesized that the relationship between disgust sensitivity and OCD symptoms may differ for different levels of perceived exposure to Covid-19, a newly developed item for this study. Thus, it was hypothesized that perceived exposure to Covid-19 would moderate the relationship between disgust sensitivity and OCD symptoms. A survey was administered to collect the data, and moderation analysis was conducted to investigate the hypotheses. Analysis has shown that the expected moderation was not present as the interaction effect was insignificant (b = -0.178, t = -0.252, and p = .801). The same moderation effect was also not present between OCD subscale contamination obsessions and washing compulsions and disgust sensitivity subscale contamination-based disgust as the interaction effect was insignificant (b = .251, t = 1.380, and p = .169). Nevertheless, this study paves the way for further research in pandemic factors and pandemic perceptions and their potential role in the relationship between disgust sensitivity and OCD symptoms","['Disgust sensitivity', 'Contamination', 'Obsessive-compulsive symptoms', 'Perceived exposure', 'Covid-19', 'Pandemic']"

We conducted a survey study and the sample of the research included volunteers with different types of volunteer jobs and organizations (n = 84). The data were analyzed with multiple regression analyses, mediation regression analyses, and moderation regression analyses. The main results showed that among volunteers the identification with the organization, but not the psychological ownership of the organization, had a direct and positive relation with respectively willingness to promote and intent to remain. Furthermore, it was found that among volunteers having control within the organization relates directly and positively to psychological ownership of the organization, while self-investment relates directly and positively to identication with the organization and to the intent to remain a volunteer via organizational identification. Finally, it was found that among volunteers openness to diversity as a moderator strengthens the effect of organizational identification on the willingness to promote the membership of the organization to persons who belong to groups that are currently underrepresented within the organization. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings, and limitations of the current study and suggestions for further research, are discussed.","['Psychological Ownership of the Organization', 'Organizational Identification', 'Volunteering', 'Recruitment', 'Retention', 'Non-profit Organization']"
The difference in attentional bias towards emotional faces between naturally cycling women and hormonal contraception users,"Roskam, Mariek","['Bruijn, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Attentional bias (AB) refers to increased attention or salience to certain stimuli. Women who use hormonal contraception only have a greater accuracy and response bias for sad expressions, which can be linked to depression symptoms and diagnoses. It was hypothesized that women who use hormonal contraception have a larger AB towards negative emotions in comparison to naturally cycling women. Healthy female volunteers (N=266) participated in an online AB task, the emotional dot-probe task including the facial expressions: neutral, angry, happy, and fearful faces. Additionally, the participants filled in the DASS-21 questionnaire, where this study utilized the depression subscale. AB was quantified as the difference between reaction times to incongruent and congruent trials. A significant AB was found in this online set-up. The naturally cycling women group showed a stronger AB in comparison to the hormonal contraception users. This effect was independent of emotion. Even though no significant effect of depression was found and no correlation between AB and depression was found, there was a trend for the naturally cycling women group to score higher on depressive symptoms, which may contribute to the higher AB in this group. The contradictory results may be clarified by the fact that, compared to naturally cycling women, hormonal contraception users experience less variation in mood during the menstrual cycle and there is less negative mood throughout the menstrual period. By comparing these groups, these findings contribute to increasing evidence of research examining the use of hormonal contraception and the influence it may have on mood.","['hormonal contraception (HC)', 'naturally cycling women', 'attentional bias', 'depression']"
The Pathways of the Fear Acquisition of the COVID-19 in Children in the Netherlands,"Mucharskaja, Tatjana","['Nimphy, C.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study investigated whether parents’ fear of the COVID-19 is associated with children’s fear of the COVID-19. Further, the study examined whether the association is mediated by parents’ verbal threat information. In addition, it was studied which sources of information about the COVID-19 contribute to children’s fear of the COVID-19. In this online study participated 90 parent-child dyads (child mean age M = 13.22, parent mean age M = 46.49). The present study has a cross-sectional correlational design. The participants completed online self-reported questionnaires. The results of the study showed that parents’ fear of the COVID-19 is positively linked to children’s fear of the COVID-19. Parents’ fear of the COVID-19 is positively associated with parents’ verbal threat information. Also, parents’ verbal threat information is positively related to children’s fear of the COVID-19. The link between parents’ and children’s fear of the COVID-19 is partially mediated by parents’ verbal threat information. Further, the results showed that various sources of information accounted for 39% of the variance in the children’s fear of the COVID-19. Parents, television and friends are important contributing sources of information to the children’s fear of the COVID-19. The results support Rachman’s information pathway in explaining fear transmission from parents their offspring in the context of the COVID-19. The results are also in line with the previous research about parents’ threat information mediation between parents’ and children’s fear of the swine flu.","['children', 'fear', 'parents', 'COVID-19', 'verbal information pathway']"
The Relation between Prosocial and Selfish Learning and Self-esteem,"Rebergen, Sarah","['Bruijn, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction The reinforcement learning theory shows that learning for another (prosocial learning) and learning for ourselves (selfish learning) can both be used as an effective way to learn. Low self-esteem is linked to many clinical disorders and with prosocial and selfish behavior. The current study further examines selfish and prosocial learning and a possible relation with self-esteem. Method A total of 139 healthy participants finished the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and performed an online learning task. Participants had to choose between different stimuli that were probabilistically associated with rewards for themselves (self), another person (prosocial), or no one (control). The number of high probable stimuli (correctly chosen trials) for the selfish condition, prosocial condition and the none condition were analyzed. The two probability ratios that were used were 40/60 and 30/70. Results In contrast with our hypothesis, in the 30/70 probability context there was no significant difference found between conditions over time. Additionally, no significant effect was found between conditions and the 25% high and low self-esteem over time. Additionally, no significant correlations were found between self-esteem and the difference score ‘Prosocial minus Selfish’, the selfish condition and the prosocial condition. Discussion The current study found no significant relation between selfish and prosocial learning and self-esteem. The insignificant effects found in this study may be due to the difficulty of the task, uncontrollable environment, in diversity of sample and differences between global and specific self-esteem. Future research should focus on providing better insight in the relation between prosocial learning and self-esteem.","['Learning', 'Prosocial Learning', 'Selfish Learning', 'Self-esteem', 'Probabilistic Learning Task']"
The prevalence of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder in personality disorders,"Hogewoning, B.","['Blom, J.D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: A large number of studies have been conducted on the topic of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in borderline personality disorder (BPD), however, there is hardly any research that examines the comorbidity rate of PTSD in non-BPD personality disorders (PDs). Knowledge about all clusters of PDs in terms of comorbid PTSD is needed in order to generate a more detailed clinical picture of PDs. Aims: This study is primarily designed to investigate the point-prevalence of comorbid PTSD in clinical practice and, in addition, to explore to what extent the point-prevalence of comorbid PTSD differs between BPD and non-BPD PD patients and gender. Secondly, this study also investigates whether the amount of comorbid disorders is predicted by BPD (versus non-BPD PDs), PTSD and/or gender. Methods: For this retrospective study, data of 183 PD patients was used. During the intake process, the PD diagnosis and comorbid psychiatric disorders were examined using The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V and The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus. Results: The point-prevalence rates of comorbid PTSD in this non-BPD PD sample is 12.7% and in this BPD sample is 23.1%. Additionally, there was no difference in likelihood of comorbid PTSD in BPD and non-BPD PD patients and between gender. Furthermore, BPD (versus non-BPD PDs), PTSD and gender did not predict the amount of comorbid disorders. Conclusions and implications: The results indicate that in clinical practice, comorbid PTSD and other comorbid disorders might not be recognized so often and thus might be underdiagnosed in PD patients. Hence, there must be more sensitivity in clinical practice for the recognition of comorbid PTSD and other comorbid disorders in PD patients.","['personality disorders', 'borderline personality disorder', 'posttraumatic stress disorder', 'comorbidity']"
"Evaluaties van emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen: De samenhang tussen emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen, zoals voorgeschreven door Action Unit combinaties, in OpenFace en de evaluaties van de populatie en tevens de genderverschillen daarbinnen.","Kakebeen, Romy","['Boekel, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Gezichtsuitdrukkingen zijn een van de meest belangrijke en krachtige manieren van mensen om emoties te communiceren. Gezichtsuitdrukkingen ontstaan door activatie van bepaalde gezichtsspieren. Een groep gezichtsspieren die samen een actie uitvoert, zoals het optrekken van de binnenkant van de wenkbrauw wordt een Action Unit (AU) genoemd. OpenFace is een softwareprogramma dat AU’s detecteert die zijn gekoppeld aan zes basis emoties. Bij onderzoek hiernaar wordt voornamelijk gebruik gemaakt van geacteerde emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen. Er is nog relatief weinig bekend over ‘niet-geacteerde’, ‘spontane’ emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen en de classificatie hiervan door OpenFace. Tevens is weinig bekend over genderverschillen in de evaluatie van emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen. In deze studie is de samenhang onderzocht tussen OpenFace evaluaties en participant-evaluaties van (semi-)spontane emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen en genderverschillen daarbinnen. De steekproef van deze studie betrof 78 participanten, die videosegmenten van (semi-)spontane emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen hebben geëvalueerd op basis van de zes basis emoties. Met correlatietoetsen is samenhang gevonden tussen de evaluaties van de participanten en OpenFace. Ook is een genderverschil gevonden in de evaluaties. Er is geen verschil gevonden in de samenhang die de verschillende gendergroepen hadden met OpenFace. Deze bevindingen zijn een startpunt voor vervolgonderzoek, dat kan beantwoorden welke alternatieve AU-combinaties mogelijk aanwezig zijn bij (semi-)spontane emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen en de genderverschillen binnen de herkenning daarvan.","['emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen', 'OpenFace', 'Action Units', 'basis emoties', 'gender']"

Echter wordt in onderzoek vaak gefocust op één van deze factoren. Om een completer beeld te schetsen van de relaties tussen executieve functies, klassenklimaat, geslacht en gedragsproblemen in de adolescentie werden deze factoren in dit onderzoek tegelijkertijd meegenomen. Specifiek werd onderzocht in hoeverre gedragsproblemen in de adolescentie voorspeld kunnen worden op basis van executieve functies, klassenklimaat en geslacht. 160 participanten met een leeftijd tussen 11 en 15 jaar hebben online zelfrapportagevragenlijsten ingevuld over gedragsproblemen, problemen met executieve functies en klassenklimaat. Uit een meervoudige lineaire regressieanalyse bleek dat problemen met executieve functies positief samenhangt en een voorspeller is van gedragsproblemen in de adolescentie. Klassenklimaat en geslacht bleken geen voorspellers te zijn van gedragsproblemen in de adolescentie. Door deze kennis uit te breiden kunnen in de toekomst interventies worden ingezet om adolescenten met gedragsproblemen goed te begeleiden. Mogelijk kan hierdoor voorkomen worden dat de gedragsproblemen in de adolescentie een negatieve invloed gaan hebben op de lange termijn. Zo kan vervolgonderzoek naar de verschillende dimensies van gedragsproblemen en klassenklimaat mogelijk meer inzicht geven in de precieze relaties tussen executieve functies, klassenklimaat, geslacht en gedragsproblemen in de adolescentie.

This study considers the question whether, and how, friendship quality, stress of peer pressure and classroom climate relate to happiness. Where previous research found friendship quality to be directly associated with happiness, there is little to no evidence for the direct associations between stress of peer pressure and happiness and classroom climate and happiness. This study aims to fill in these gaps. Happiness was measured with the subjective happiness scale (SHS). Stress of peer pressure was measured with a shortened version of the adolescent stress questionnaire (ASQ s). Classroom climate was measured with two questions. Friendship quality was measured with the Lerid Friendship Questionnaire (FSQ) and the Network of Relationships Qualities Version (NRQ-RQV). Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis, which showed three main findings. Friendship quality was not associated with happiness, stress of peer pressure and happiness were negatively and significantly related, and classroom climate had a positive and significant relation with happiness after correcting for influential cases. Limitations are discussed, with the conclusion that future research should focus on the inclusion of psychological disorders and the effects of the corona virus pandemic.","['adolescence', 'friendship quality', 'stress of peer pressure', 'classroom climate', 'happiness']"

The Relation of Threat-Related Attention and Trait Anxiety: The influence of trait anxiety and attentional control on attentional bias to mildly and highly threatening pictures in a dot-probe task,"Janken, Sophie","['Putman, P.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Threat-related attentional biases (ABs) in anxiety show considerable heterogeneity; there is evidence for hypervigilance to, and avoidance of threat. Taking the stimulus threat level and attentional control (AC) into account is thought to aid in explaining this heterogeneity. Prior work on the relations between these variables showed inconclusive results. Hypotheses: Trait anxiety levels, AC levels, and their interaction are associated with different patterns of AB scores, depending on the stimulus’s threat level. Methods: Fifty-two participants completed self-report measures of trait anxiety and AC and participated in a dot-probe task with neutral, mild threat, and high threat pictorial stimuli. Hypotheses were tested with rm ANOVAs and post-hoc correlation tests. Results: High trait anxiety was associated with hypervigilant AB to mild threat, but no association with AB to high threat was found. Low AC was related to more avoidance of high threat, but not to AB to mild threat. AC did not moderate the relationship between trait anxiety and threat-level dependent AB. Discussion and Conclusions: These findings confirm that threat level influences threat-related ABs in anxiety. While this relationship was not further influenced by individual differences in AC, the role AC on its own plays in threat-level dependent ABs is supported.","['attentional bias', 'attentional control', 'avoidance', 'dot-probe', 'threat level', 'trait anxiety']"

The idea was that 576 participants read their goal was to either strive for the best (maximizing condition) or for good enough (satisficing condition) and choose a tablet from either a limited (6) or large (30) assortment. Decision difficulty and anticipated regret were measured as underlying processes in the choice overload effect. The results showed no effect of maximising. However, the tablet choice task showed that an increase in assortment size leads to more difficulty which increases anticipated regret, and results in more decision avoidance. Interestingly, results showed that anticipated regret was decreased in large compared to small assortment conditions. The findings added to the research of Göbbels (2020) by showing significant results of assortment size and decision avoidance, and their relationship through decision difficulty.","['maximiser', 'satisficer', 'choice overload', 'decision avoidance']"
The Evolution of Trust in Automated Vehicles and its Gender Differences,"Tosellini, Riccardo","['Walker, F.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Self-driving vehicles are not a science fiction novelty anymore, but an upcoming reality. For widespread usage to occur, it is important for people to be able to trust automated vehicles. This study investigates how trust evolves in drivers experiencing “reliably unreliable” vehicle behaviour, compared to drivers who experience a single critical event in an otherwise reliable vehicle. The gender difference in trust in self driving vehicles is also researched and its possible connection with risk-taking attitude. An online survey is used. Respondents first answered a few general questions and then filled in a risk taking attitude questionnaire and the pre-test version of the modified trust in automation scale. Afterwards the participants were put in either the ‘poor driving condition’ or the ‘perfect driving condition’. The respondents watched eight self-driving simulation videos on their computer and filled in the post-test version of the modified trust in automation scale after each video. Respondents experiencing ‘reliably unreliable’ vehicle behaviour did not change significantly in trust and respondents experiencing a single critical event recovered immediately in trust. According to Wayne and Miller (2018) and Bergdahl (2005), women are less confident in their driving abilities than men. Our study confirms that women have a lower trust in automated vehicles than men. No gender difference in risk taking attitude was found. The risk-taking attitude also did not correlate with the trust in automated vehicles. For future research we recommend to use physical driving simulations. Also, since the risk-taking attitude did not explain the gender difference in trust in automation, we recommend further investigation of how females differ in perceiving the dangers of risky driving.","['trust in automated vehicles', 'self-driving vehicles', 'gender differences', 'risktaking attitude']"

To do so, we set up an online experiment with two conditions. The first condition is called ‘Perfect’, and the second condition is called ‘Poor’. In addition, we measured the risk-taking attitude of the participants in this study. We performed multiple statistical analysis to determine the link between trust in the automated vehicle and the phase (in each condition there are eight phases). Furthermore, we utilized regression analysis and correlations to see whether risk taking could predict the level of trust. The results showed a significant main effect for phase and a significant interaction effect for phase and group. Especially the trust in Phase 4 decreased in the perfect vehicle condition and increased again after Phase 5. However, there were no significant correlations between risk-taking attitude and trust in the automated vehicle. Together, these results provided insight into the development of trust over time in automated vehicles, especially after one critical incident. To conclude, we suggested several improvements for future research. These suggestions included taking gender differences into account, replicating our study in a driving simulator and providing the participants with information about the system.

Struggling in silence: The relationship between debt-help acceptance and the need for autonomy,"Benjamins, Sabine","['Weiden, A. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over half of all households in the UK experienced some type of debt between 2016 to 2018. Being in debt can pose a serious threat to wellbeing. Many of these households are not able to get out of debt by themselves. However, many of these households also do not accept the help, often existing of free debt-advice, that is provided to them. Literature from domains such as education suggest that people might not accept help due to their autonomy being limited. This thesis looked into whether this was also the case for the domain of debt. Respondents were asked to fill out a questionnaire, existing of an implicit measure of autonomy and a hypothetical debt letter. After receiving the letter, participants were asked how likely they would be to accept the help (free debt-advice) offered in the debt letter. Surprisingly, many of the participants accepted the help, leading to the rejection of our hypothesis that the need for autonomy could predict help acceptance. The results showed that there was no relationship between the need for autonomy and help acceptance. A possible reason for this finding could be that in the domain of debt, a different barrier against help acceptance, like shame or stigma, is at play.","['Autonomy', 'Debt', 'Help Acceptance', 'Implicit (Motive)']"

Looking into the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Azjen,1991) and Goal Setting Theory (Latham & Lock, 2013), we argued that means information (i.e., information about the goal and means to achieve that goal) would affect intention towards disconnecting from the gas grid, attitude and motivational perceived behavioural control (MPBC) more positively than only communicating the goal information. The survey study (N = 305) tested three conditions: no information, goal information condition, and means information condition. This research supports the expectation that attitude, MPBC, Capacity perceived behavioural control (CPBC), and subjective norms have a positive association regarding the intention to disconnect households from the gas grid. Additionally, a new distinction between a motivational component (MPBC) and a physical component (CPBC) within Perceived Behavioural Control for TPB is discussed. No effect was found of type of information on attitude, MPBC and intention, suggesting that the manipulation was ineffective. A suggestion for follow-up research is to provide tailored information.

Dementia Diagnostics in Non-Western Immigrants: The Validity of an Adapted Test Battery for Dementia Diagnostics in Non-Western Immigrants in the Netherlands,"Özcan, Reyhan","['Schuitema, I.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objectives. In the Netherlands, a significant part of the population consists of non-Western immigrants, such as people from Turkey, Morocco and Surinam. The number of these elderly, non-Western immigrants is expected to increase and they are now reaching an age at which cognitive deteriorations due to dementia might occur. Although many instruments are available for the diagnosis of dementia with native Dutch patients, research showed that there is a high rate of under- and misdiagnosis among ethnic minority patients. The diagnosis of dementia for this group can be considered as challenging, as there is a major lack of appropriate neuropsychological assessment methods for culturally different and low-educated or illiterate populations. Therefore, adapted neuropsychological test batteries were developed by neuropsychologists at Erasmus MC for non-Western immigrants, in order to assess dementia. The aim of this study was to examine the validity and to investigate the relation and importance of these adapted neuropsychological tests. . Methods. This study consisted of patients with cognitive decline (n = 29) and cognitively healthy controls (n = 23), with a non-Western immigration background. Patients were referred to the Alzheimer Centre of the Erasmus MC, whereas controls were recruited through social networks and were assessed by a neuropsychologist in training. The RUDAS, verbal fluency tests and literacy screening were used as screeners, after which a number of adapted neuropsychological tests, such as Clock Reading Test and Recall of Pictures Test were administered. Results. As expected, controls showed significantly better performance on most tests in the battery than patients. Against expectations, education level of the patients and controls appeared to be associated with performance on a large part of the battery. Education level was found to be highly associated with participants’ literacy. Tests measuring similar cognitive functions were found to be significantly related. . . Conclusion. This study indicates that various adapted test batteries form a foundation to discriminate dementia between non-Western immigrants with cognitive decline and cognitively intact non-Western immigrants, in the Netherlands on group level. Although these results should be interpreted with caution, as the samples were small and not homogeneous, this study has an important clinical relevance. Future research is needed to obtain more generalizable results.","['non-Western immigrants', 'cross-cultural diagnosis', 'neuropsychological assessment', 'dementia', 'education level', 'illiteracy']"
COVID-19 Related Stress’ Moderation Effect on the Relationship Between Perceived Vulnerability to Disease and Preventive Health Care Behaviors,"Dinç, Lara","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Practicing preventive health care behaviors (PHB) to avoid illness is an essential part of our lives. According to the Health Belief Model (HBM), one of the predictors of to what extent people engage in such behaviors is perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD). Research suggests an increase in PVD leads to an increase in engagement in PHB. Every individual’s concern about the likelihood of getting infected varies and this perception tends to be stable over time. Nevertheless, other factors like COVID-19 related stress, might have a role in the relationship between PVD and PHB. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of PHB has increased dramatically. This study examined the potential role of COVID-19 related stress on the already established relationship between PVD and PHB. We administered an online survey that included questionnaires assessing PHB, COVID-19 related stress and PVD. Moderation analysis was conducted to analyze the possible moderation effect of COVID-19 related stress. The study confirmed that an increase in PVD, leads to an increase in PHB. However, no moderating effect of COVID-19 related stress between the relationship of PVD and PHB was found. The findings support the previously established relationship of PVD and PHB and forms a base for future research regarding the role of COVID-19 related stress in this relationship. In the future, health campaigns should focus on the perceived benefits, such as not getting infected, as this can increase engagement in preventive health care behaviors by increasing people’s motivations to engage in such behaviors.","['preventive health care behaviors', 'perceived vulnerability to disease', 'COVID-19 related stress', 'moderation analysis', 'pandemic', 'health belief model']"
Neuroticism and COVID-19 Stress in relation to ObsessiveCompulsive Symptoms: The potential moderation effect of COVID-19 related stress on the relationship between neuroticism and obsessive-compulsive symptoms,"Timal, Amber","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Worldwide infectious disease outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with negative mental health consequences. Researchers found that patients with obsessive compulsive symptoms (OCS), scored higher on neuroticism. In stressful situations, for instance, during a pandemic, neurotic people might experience more stress. However, there is still not a lot of information about the relationship between neuroticism and OCS in the specific context of a pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the potential moderation effect of COVID-19 related stress (CSS) on the association between neuroticism and OCS. The Padua Inventory, Neuroticism Questionnaire and the COVID-19 Stress Scale were used to assess OCS, neuroticism and CSS, respectively, in a non-clinical convenience sample (N = 184). The results of this study suggest that neuroticism was significantly related to OCS (p = .002), but was not differentially related with OCS in different levels of CSS (p = .545). The theory of situational pressures sheds some light on how CSS actually might eliminate the relationship between neuroticism and OCS, which could potentially explain the insignificant moderation effect. Alternatively, the theory on psychological distance could explain how a quarantine and/or lockdown may have decreased CSS to the extent where individuals might exhibit less OCS. As significant mental health needs might emerge during the COVID-19 pandemic, knowledge about the potential impact of CSS on vulnerable individuals may be important in order to explain these mental health needs and to learn what to focus on in treatment.","['COVID-19 related stress', 'neuroticism', 'obsessive-compulsive symptoms', 'pandemic', 'quarantine', 'moderation analysis']"
Can Fear of Pain Predict Nocebo Hyperalgesia?,"Pamelen, Inez van","['Laarhoven, A.I.M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Pain is a common complaint that can interfere with daily life severely. Expectations play a crucial role in pain perception. It has been found that fear of pain interacts with these expectations. Research investigating the influence of fear of pain on pain perception is sparse. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether increased pain sensitivity can be induced by conditioning and verbal suggestion of negative expectations. Moreover, the study investigated if fear of pain could predict increased sensitivity to pain. Data of 27 healthy young adults (22 females) was used in this study. Participants received induction of negative expectations regarding electrical pain. Fear of pain was measured prior to the induction of electrical pain by using the minor pain subscale of the Fear of Pain Questionnaire III. Pain was electrically induced and measured by numerical pain rating scales. The participants were randomized into an experimental (induction of negative expectations) or a control group (expectations not manipulated). The results show that the experimental group scored higher on increased sensitivity to pain than the control group. Therefore, it can be concluded that an increased sensitivity to pain can be induced by a negative expectation learning procedure. This effect is strong and can have a strong negative effect on treatment outcomes. Furthermore, it has been found that fear of pain cannot predict nocebo hyperalgesia. This may relate to the healthy sample. It is important to investigate the relation of expectations, increased pain sensitivity and fear of pain. Doing so optimizes treatment and therefore prevents patients with chronic pain to experience increased pain.","['pain', 'fear of pain', 'nocebo hyperalgesia', 'conditioning', 'verbal suggestion']"
Disgust Sensitivity and COVID-19 related Xenophobic Attitudes – A Moderating Effect of Vulnerability to Disease?,"Bodmann, Annabelle","['Aksungur, S.U.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background. The outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 has led to a rise in xenophobic attitudes – a fear that foreigners may be the source of the virus. One important mechanism involved in the rise of xenophobic attitudes is the behavioural immune system, an evolutionary addition to our physiological immune system which helps us to proactively avoid sources of disease. This system mainly works via the emotion disgust and has been found to be influenced by one’s perceived vulnerability to disease. The present study investigated whether perceived vulnerability to disease moderates the association between disgust sensitivity and COVID-19 related xenophobic attitudes. Methods. The research question was investigated by administering three questionnaires to a convenience sample as part of a bigger online survey. Results. While disgust sensitivity was associated with xenophobic attitudes, perceived vulnerability to disease was not associated with xenophobic attitudes and also did not moderate the association between the other two variables (perceived infectibility*disgust sensitivity: b = , t = 1.23, with p = .219). Discussion. The non-significant moderation may be the result of habituation. While the behavioural immune system may respond particularly strong in a context where vulnerability to disease is high, this may change if a disease context is present for too long. In that case, the behavioural immune system may become habituated to the situation and may therefore no longer be influenced by one’s perceived vulnerability to disease. Accordingly, the present study adds a nuance to the existing literature on the behavioural immune system.","['disgust sensitivity', 'xenophobic attitudes', 'perceived vulnerability to disease', 'COVID-19', 'pandemic', 'behavioural immune system', 'habituation', 'moderatio']"
Is Fear of Pain Associated with Experimentally Induced Nocebo Hyperalgesia?,"Lahidheb, Nourhene","['Laarhoven, A.I.M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Chronic pain is one of the most prominent medical conditions associated with significant limitations in various life aspects. Nocebo hyperalgesia which refers to increased pain perception due to negative expectations about pain plays crucial role in pain chronification. Nocebo effects have also been linked to dispositional characteristics. Studies investigating the role of fear of pain and nocebo hyperalgesia found inconsistent results. This study used conditioning and verbal suggestions hypothesizing that nocebo hyperalgesia will occur. We further investigated the association between fear of pain and nocebo hyperalgesia, expecting a positive relationship. In this study, 27 healthy individuals were randomly assigned to either a control group or a nocebo group in which negative expectancies about pain were induced. This was done by means of conditioning, through pairing electrically painful stimuli with color cues, and by giving negative verbal suggestions about an increase in pain related to a color cue and a sham electrode. Pain levels were rated on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and compared between groups. Dispositional fear of pain levels was measured using the fear of minor pain subscale of the Fear of Pain Questionnaire-III (FPQ-III). Nocebo hyperalgesia was successfully induced, as reflected by a significant difference (p =.005) in nocebo responding between the two groups. No significant relationship was found between FPQ-III scores and nocebo hyperalgesia. Findings are in line with previous research suggesting that conditioning and verbal suggestions can induce nocebo hyperalgesia. Since no association has been found between fear of pain and nocebo hyperalgesia, future research should investigate this relationship using other subscales of the FPQ-III.","['Pain', 'Nocebo', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Fear of pain', 'Conditioning', 'Expectations']"
Het Verband tussen Empathie en Aandachtsverschuiving,"Welschen, Marianne","['Mulckhuyse, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Onderzocht werd of empathie een verband heeft op het gaze cueing effect met een angstige expressie. Hoog empathisch vermogen wordt geassocieerd met een nauwkeurige identificatie van emotionele gezichtsuitdrukkingen. Zo is er een verband aangetoond tussen iemands inlevingsvermogen en het oogbewegingspatroon van een persoon. Mensen met een hoog empathisch vermogen zouden meer tijd besteden aan het kijken naar de oogregio in een emotioneel beladen gezicht dan in een neutraal gezicht. Vanwege hun inlevingsvermogen wordt verwacht dat mensen met een hoge empathie langer hun aandacht laten hangen en dus meer moeite zouden hebben om hun aandacht los te maken van een angstig gezicht dan van een neutraal gezicht. Op basis daarvan werd een kleiner cueing effect verwacht bij hoog empathische mensen na een angstige cue en geen verschil in cue effect bij de neutrale cue in vergelijking met laag empathische mensen. Vijfendertig deelnemers hebben deelgenomen aan het experiment bestaande uit een gaze cueing taak en het invullen van de Cambridge Behaviour Scale of de Empathy Quotient vragenlijst. De resultaten lieten een significant hoofdeffect zien voor cue validiteit, wat aantoont dat er sprake was van aandachtsverschuiving. Er was geen significant effect van emotionele expressie. Daarnaast werd er ook geen correlatie gevonden tussen empathie en het cueing effect met de angstige cue, mogelijk omdat de deelnemers gevraagd werden het gezicht te negeren. Om dit verder te onderzoeken zou toekomstig onderzoek zich kunnen richten om emotionele expressies taak relevant te maken.","['gaze cueing', 'empathie', 'emotionele expressie', 'emotie', 'amygdala', 'aandachtsverschuiving', 'blikrichting', 'gezichtsuitdrukkingen']"

"Let’s get it on(line) Do personality traits influence partner-perceived attractiveness, and does this assumed relationship affect online dating success? A mediation analysis.","Borrelli, Sara","['Roth, T.S.', 'Samara, I.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: With the recent emergence of online dating as a way of initiating and establishing romantic relationships, online dating has become an important strategy for couples to meet. However, no previous studies have thoroughly investigated the possible mediation effect of partner-perceived attractiveness between personality traits and online dating success. In this thesis, I will test whether personality traits influence partner-perceived attractiveness, and whether this assumed relationship affects online dating success. Methods: Through the use of a mediation analysis, this present study will investigate how the personality dimensions of extraversion and neuroticism are linked to attractiveness and whether a specific trait contributes to more online dating success. Results: It cannot be concluded that there is a mediating relationship between personality traits and online dating outcomes. A significant relationship was found between partner perceived attractiveness and dating success when running a linear regression, without controlling for the relationship between personality traits and online dating outcomes. Conclusion: More research needs to be done in order to differentiate between the different personality traits, and whether possessing one trait makes you a more successful online dater. Future studies can add a new dimension to the variable of partner-perceived attractiveness and look into the possible role played by self-esteem.","['Online dating outcomes', 'Big Five', 'neuroticism', 'extraversion', 'social compensation hypothesis', 'rich-get-richer hypothesis', 'match suitability', 'mediation analysis', 'mediator', 'partner-rated match suitability']"
Perception is Attraction: Does Actual Similarity in Personality or Perceived Similarity Predict a Partner's Perceived Suitability,"Beer, Daniel de","['Samara, I.', 'Roth, T.S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"What causes attraction? This question has occupied the human mind for ages. In the present day, online dating companies try to find an answer to this question while creating algorithms that provide people with better matches than their competitors. Knowing what makes people like another person is of vital importance for thriving in the world of online dating. The aim of this thesis is to add to this search by looking at the impact of similarity in personality versus perceived similarity on the probability that one considers their match a suitable partner. Participants (N= 568) were matched to a blind date and had to fill in a questionnaire concerning their perception of their match. In this study no significant effect was found between similarity in personality (X2 (1) = 3.49, p = .062) and how suitable they perceived their partner to be, but a significant relationship was found between perceived similarity and how suitable they perceived their partner to be (X2 (1) = 7.51, p = .006, OR = 1.799; X2 (1) = 10.48, p = .001, OR = 1.978). If future research can determine if this effect is a causal relationship, this could be used for improving dating applications, but also couples counselors could create new interventions for struggling couples based on increasing perceived similarity.","['similarity', 'personality', 'Big Five', 'perceived similarity', 'suitable partner', 'online dating']"
30 and Single: Do women become less choosy after their prime reproductive age: An evolutionary Perspective,"Ott, Paula","['Samara, I.', 'Roth, T.S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Prior research drawing on evolutionary psychology has shown a link between women’s fertility and sexual market value, suggesting a lower sexual market value for women past their prime reproductive ages. In relation to this, I investigated changes in women’s dating strategy as a function of age. I predicted women past their prime reproductive age to be less choosy as reflected in partner choice, sexual behavior and demands placed on a potential partner in terms of age. Methods: I used data from 323 heterosexual, female participants (aged 18-44) of an online dating paradigm. Participants were matched with a partner based on similarity on either task performance or questionnaire responses, after which they could contact their match for an (online-) date. Two follow-ups investigated how suitable they found their partner. Results: No direct relationship between women’s age and choosiness in terms of partner choice was found. However, women’s age positively predicted more unrestricted sexual behaviour, possibly reflecting lowered choosiness. The change in women’s demands placed on a partner in terms of age could not be investigated due to methodological restrictions. Conclusion: This thesis is not conclusive about age-related changes in female choosiness in terms of partner choice. However, exploratory findings are promising, suggesting lower sexual restrictiveness in older women. Further research is needed to clarify the reasons behind this finding. Further, future research needs to allow for natural age assortment in order to test changes in women’s demands in terms of age difference.","['choosiness', 'women', 'reproductive age', 'dating']"
Pretty on the inside? or outside? How Objective and Subjective Attractiveness Levels Influence Partner Choice,"Ben-Ami, Itamar","['Samara, I.', 'Roth, T.S.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Objective attractiveness level is defined as many raters rating one person similarly in terms of physical attractiveness. Subjective attractiveness level is influenced by the raters’ attributions and lacks universal agreement. Previous literature proposes objective and subjective attractiveness levels to predict short term and long term match success, respectively. By gaining clarity on the relationship between these levels and their influence on match success, this thesis aims to improve match prediction from a new perspective. A positive relationship between objective attractiveness level and match success was expected. High couple similarity on subjective attractiveness was expected to increase the first relationship. Methods: A total of 1,668 individuals aged 18-44 were matched based on demographics, subjective attributions and personality questionnaires. After receiving each other’s email addresses for the purpose of meeting, the study proceeded with 2 post-matching follow-ups, each containing questionnaires assessing match success. Results: A significant negative relationship was found between objective level of attractiveness and match success. Moderation analysis indicated that subjective attractiveness level does not influence the relationship between objective attractiveness levels and match success. Conclusion: Consistent with previous research, a relationship between objective attractiveness level with match success was found. Unexpectedly, participants rated high on objective attractiveness had a lower probability for match success. Possible explanations are given. No clarity was gained on the relationship between objective and subjective attractiveness levels with match success, however objective level seems to be more predictive. For more precise measurement, future research must quantify the importance of variables predicting match success.","['objective attractiveness', 'subjective attractiveness', 'horizontal attributes', 'vertical attributes', 'match success', 'partner choice']"
The Influence of the Presence of Siblings on the Development of Graphical Symbolism Skills in Children,"Pijl, Robi van der","['Mendoza Straffon, L.', 'Groot, B. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"To contribute to the current body of literature, this study aimed at investigating the role that siblings have on graphical symbolism skills in children. There were 68 children, aged between 3-7 years old, who participated in the study, and performed the Graphical Symbolism Task. One of their parents/caretakers had to fill out an online survey to provide the demographic information. The aim of this study has been tested by using an ANCOVA-analysis, considering the difference in graphical symbolism skills between: children with siblings and children without siblings, and between children with aged-related siblings, 1-12 years, compared to (a) children with no siblings, and (b) children with non-aged-related siblings, with the children’s ages as the covariate. The results of the research of the influence on children with siblings, compared to children without siblings on graphical symbolism skills, showed that there was no difference (p = 0.059). Although, the influence of children with aged-related siblings compared to children without siblings on the graphical symbolism skills was significantly different (p = 0.017), then again there was no difference between children with aged-related siblings compared to children with non-aged-related siblings (p = 0.125). The results suggest that children with aged-related siblings are more proficient in using graphical symbols than children without siblings, but this does not apply to children with siblings compared to children without siblings and children with aged-related siblings compared to children with non-aged-related siblings. These findings implicate that further research is necessary to investigate the role of the presence of siblings on the development of graphical symbolism skills.","['graphical symbolism skills', 'sibling presence', 'Graphical Symbolism Task', 'aged-related siblings and non-aged-related siblings']"
"Giftedness: A Matter of Intelligence, Creativity or Both? Predicting Giftedness by Intelligence and Creativity","Meuldijk, Rebecca","['Stolte, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this study, it was examined whether both intelligence and creativity significantly predict giftedness in students aged seven to thirteen years. More specifically, we investigated whether giftedness can be predicted by spatial as well as verbal intelligence, creative problem-solving and mathematical creativity. Results from previous research have indicated that these factors are interrelated, especially spatial intelligence and mathematical creativity. Four hypotheses were described, based on an extensive and diverse body of literature. The current used sample consisted of 310 participants, of which 36 children were gifted. After conducting forty logistic regression analyses, we concluded that, overall, only spatial intelligence was a significant predictor of giftedness, having significant p-values in 80% of the analyses for specifically this predictor. The other three variables were not found to significantly predict giftedness, as they were significant predictors in only 20%, 30% or none of the analyses. These findings highlight the need to differentiate between subtypes of giftedness. Therefore, the present conclusions are of significant importance for the improvement and broadening of gifted assessment instruments, scientifical developments with reference to the concept, theories and definition of giftedness and specialized educational programs in both primary and secondary school for gifted students. Optimizing educational programs for gifted students provide them with more opportunities to optimize their learning experience and to flourish at school. Future research on subtypes of giftedness will enable more confident conclusions about the importance of creativity in the concept of giftedness, hence contributing to improvements of giftedness assessments and policies for gifted education.","['Giftedness', 'spatial intelligence', 'verbal intelligence', 'problem-solving', 'mathematical creativity']"

The Beery Visual-Motor Integration Test (Beery VMI) was administered to 68 children, with ages ranging from 3 to 7 years, and their parents were asked to fill out a questionnaire. The data was collected at three primary schools in The Netherlands and the questionnaires could be filled out online. To test the effect of gender on drawing skill, an independent sample t-test was conducted. This showed that girls scored significantly higher on the Beery VMI than boys (p < .01). To test whether parents showed support to a different extent based on gender of the child, another independent sample t-test was conducted. This finding showed no significant effect (p = .938). Finally, a mediation analysis was conducted to test whether parental support mediated the effect of gender on test score. This turned out to be a non-significant effect (p = .938). Based on these findings, it can be concluded that girls score higher on drawing skills than boys, parents support boys and girls to the same extent, and parental support does not mediate the effect of gender on drawing skills. These findings implicate the need for schools to adjust their general (art) curricula to an individualized one, and advise future research to address possible influential factors on test score, besides parental support.","['gender differences', 'drawing skill', 'parental support', 'Beery VMI', 'questionnaire']"

Particularly, individuals experiencing financial shame oftentimes partake into avoidance behavior when it comes to financial support. This study aimed to investigate whether shame resilience increases the willingness to contact a creditor and whether shame resilience decreases avoidance action tendencies of individuals experiencing financial hardship. A between-subject design was implemented whereat participants in the shame resilience group (N = 64) were compared to participants in the control group (N = 69). Within an online experiment, the randomly assigned participants recalled a financial hardship experience, read one out of two creditor letters, and were presented with several Likert-scale questions. Participants in the shame resilience group reported higher levels of a willingness to contact compared to the participants in the control group. Regarding the voidance action tendencies, three items were analysed separately due to a low reliability. No differences were found on refuse action and distract action tendencies between the participants in both groups. However, participants in the shame resilience group reported lower levels of ignore action tendencies compared to the participants in the control group. Potential explanations for this, additional findings, strengths, and limitations are discussed and implications for future research are proposed.","['financial hardship', 'financial shame', 'shame resilience', 'financial support', 'approach behavior', 'avoidance behavior']"

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether increasing shame-resilience leads to an increased willingness to contact a creditor and to a reduced use of avoidant action tendencies. Additionally, the study examined whether men and women differ in their experience of financial shame. Participants (N = 133) were assigned to two conditions (shame-resilience and control condition) and they were asked to recall a negative financial situation. After this, the participants were shown an email from an imagined creditor, which asked them to be in contact with the creditor as soon as possible. In the control condition the communication style of the email was neutral whereas in the shame resilience condition the communication style aimed to induce a sense of connectedness with other people, who also share experiences of financial hardship. After the email, the participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire that assessed their behavioural action tendencies regarding their situation. The intervention was found to significantly increase the participants’ willingness to contact the creditor and to significantly reduce a tendency to ignore a severity of the situation. However, no significant effects were found on a tendency to refuse to believe the situation or on a tendency to distract oneself with other activities. Also, no gender differences were found. The study provides valuable information on how to encourage people in financial hardship to take action to improve their financial situation.","['shame', 'financial hardship', 'debt', 'sense of connectedness', 'shame-resilience theory', 'help-seeking behaviour']"

The effects of different types of hearing loss on experienced emotion when listening to music,"Kester, Jordy van","['Pannekoek, J.N.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Music is known for its therapeutic value and connection with emotion. These aspects are the core principles of music therapy, a promising therapy for the dementia population because the cognitive processes of music are relatively spared in this population. Most patients are of older age and often have hearing damage, which may be a limiting factor in the use of music therapy. Earlier research showed that participants with hearing damage have a more limited emotional range and perceive pleasant sounds as less pleasant than people without hearing damage. The aim of this research was to replicate this effect but for emotions elicited by music. The participants (N=507) did hearing tests which measured the smallest range they could discriminate between for pitch, tempo and dynamics. Furthermore they listened to five pieces of music and rated them from negative to positive. Additionally, they completed a survey (Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index, GMSI) which mapped their emotional responsiveness to music. The results suggest that in this population with various degrees of hearing damage, perception of pitch, tempo, dynamics and self-reported hearing loss are not predictors of the experienced emotions when listening to music or the emotional responsiveness to music. A small effect of age was found for emotional responsiveness to music: older participants scored slightly lower than younger participants. A small effect of age and gender was found on the positivity rating of music: older people and females rated the music as slightly more positive. The results are inconsistent with the effects found on non-music stimuli in previous studies. A reason could be that we investigated the effect of musical stimuli, which can be different from non-music stimuli in that they can be emotionally ambiguous and participants might already have built up certain emotions and memories with a particular song. The practical implication is that hearing damage may not be a limiting factor for music therapy in people with dementia. However, music therapy is different from passively listening to music, so these results might not be transferable. Additionally, there were few dementia patients in the sample so we did not control for this.",

Much of the literature suggests that these effects are mostly negative, but some theories such as the Life History Theory have inspired studies that show positive effects of childhood scarcity. The current work aims to highlight the effects of experiencing childhood scarcity on adult cognitive performance in a current financial scarcity situation. We hypothesized that people who experienced childhood scarcity performed better, on a memory and attention task during a situation of current financial scarcity, then people who had not experienced such scarcity. To test their memory we used a restaurant menu containing dishes with prices and calories that participants had to recall; further, to measure attentional shifting, the menu contained a discount code that participant could copy and paste in order to save money. In the experiment 190 participants were randomly assigned to two groups – respectively low budget and high budget condition. The hypotheses were not confirmed, however a significant effect of childhood scarcity on the memory of dishes’ prices and calories was found.","['Childhood scarcity', 'current financial scarcity', 'cognitive performance', 'memory', 'attention']"

Daarnaast werd er onderzocht of de oriëntatie en het loskoppelen van aandacht wordt gemoduleerd door het angst niveau van de participant. De resultaten lieten zien dat hoog angstige personen niet sneller zijn in het oriënteren van aandacht in reactie op een afgewende kijkrichting dan laag angstige personen. Daarnaast zijn hoog angstige personen niet langzamer in het loskoppelen van aandacht in reactie op een directe kijkrichting dan laag angstige personen. Ook lijkt dit effect niet te worden versterkt door een angstige expressie. Het niet optreden van deze effecten heeft mogelijk te maken met dat de gebruikte dynamische cue reeks niet natuurlijk genoeg is. Daarnaast is het experiment uitgevoerd in de vertrouwde omgeving van de participanten, waardoor het niveau trait-angst niet volledig tot uitdrukking kon komen. Ten slotte lijkt de combinatie van de positieve en negatieve emotionele expressies in het experiment ervoor te zorgen dat de impact van de angstige expressie niet hoog genoeg is.",

The association between anxiety and nocebo hyperalgesia,"Händel, Letícia","['Laarhoen, A.I.M. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Chronic pain can lead to disability. This relationship is influenced by the patients' beliefs and negative expectations regarding pain. The negative expectations can lead to higher levels of pain experience, also known as nocebo hyperalgesia. Through these and other effects, chronic pain has debilitating effects on patients' everyday functioning. These expectations may be related to anxiety, which can increase pain sensitivity through different processes, such as attention shift to pain experience. The present study looks into whether expectations induced by conditioning and verbal suggestion can lead to a nocebo hyperalgesic response in a healthy population of young adults and whether state anxiety, assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety questionnaire (STAI-s), is associated with the strength of the nocebo hyperalgesic response. The pain was induced through electrical pain stimulation. The sample, which consisted of 27 young adults, was randomly divided into two conditions, a nocebo and a control one. An independent t-test and a correlation analysis were conducted to analyse the data. The results showed a significant nocebo hyperalgesic response between the nocebo and control conditions (d = 1.21). However, no significant association between the STAI ss scores and the nocebo hyperalgesic response was found. More research needs to be conducted on the relationship between anxiety and nocebo hyperalgesia due to its implication on the treatment and functioning of chronic pain patients.",

There is No Shame in Wanting to Belong: Could a Sense of Belongingness Help You Get out of Financial Debt?,"Balta, Anesa","['Seip, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Many individuals in financial hardship feel ashamed of their economic situation. Existing literature suggests that feelings of shame can lead individuals to exhibit avoidant behaviours, such as social withdrawal, which prevent them from taking steps to solve their difficult situation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether promoting shame resilience in individuals with financial problems leads to more willingness to contact their creditor. We also explored if experienced shame is a mediator in this relationship and whether shame resilience would lead to a reduction in avoidant action tendencies. 133 participants with financial hardship experience completed a survey on an online platform in which the intervention of shame resilience was promoted by inducing a sense of belongingness through the content and communication tone of a creditor email. We found that promoting shame resilience led to a higher willingness to contact the creditor and a lower tendency to ignore the severity of the situation. Other measures of avoidant action tendencies, such as refusing to believe one has debt and turning to other activities as a distraction, were not found to be significantly affected by shame resilience. Only one aspect of experienced shame, the feeling of worthiness, was found to mediate the effect of experienced shame on willingness to contact. The findings offer a feasible intervention that may prove to be effective in helping individuals take on a problem-solving approach to their financial hardship and come one step closer to settling their debt.",

The Effect of Inducing Shame Resilience on Avoidant Tendencies and Willingness to Contact in Individuals With Financial Hardships,"Bettex, Sophie","['Seip, E.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Individuals can experience financial difficulties which tend to have negative psycho-socio-behavioural consequences. They feel shame and are avoidant regarding their financial situation rather than reaching out for help or proactively dealing with the root of their problem. To what extent does inducing shame resilience decreases the avoidant tendencies and increases the willingness to contact the creditor for individuals with financial hardships? This research proposes that by increasing shame resilience, avoidant tendencies can decrease, and participant’s willingness to contact increases. Shame resilience represents the ability to identify shame when it is experienced and move past it in a constructive manner allowing the individual to maintain authenticity and grow from such experiences. Participants were recruited online and were asked to recall a negative financial situation. They were randomly assigned to a creditor letter in which the communication style differed. There was a control letter and a shame resilience letter from a creditor. As predicted, participants in the shame resilience condition were more willing to contact the creditor compared to the control condition. The results revealed no significant difference between the shame resilience and the control group on avoidant tendencies. Therefore, by using different communication in the letters, participants were more willing to contact compared to the control condition.",

Additionally, it aimed to determine if gender has a moderating effect on such associations, hypothesizing that gender does act as a moderating variable. The goal of the research was to better understand creativity so that educators and parents can be informed about strategies on how to better foster creativity in children and what the benefits of doing so are. 341 Dutch primary school children (Mage = 9.67) participated in the study, completing a test battery containing different tasks aimed to measure executive functioning, mathematical ability, creativity and intelligence. A correlation matrix and moderation analyses were used to explore the associations between all variables and gender as a moderator. Results showed that only the subcomponent of fluency was significantly correlated with inhibitory control and that gender was not a significant moderator. However, considering the limitations of the methods used to measure inhibition and creativity, future research requires to look beyond just measures of divergent mathematical creativity and to possibly investigate the directionality of the relationship to provide more concrete evidence to help facilitate cognitive and creative abilities in children.",

The effect of mathematical learning difficulties on mathematical creativity in primary school children,"Driel, Lisa van","['Stolte, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The current study researched whether mathematical learning difficulties (MLD) affects mathematical creativity (MC) in children from grade 3 to grade 5 aged 7 to 12 years old. Earlier research has shown that important predictors of mathematical ability (MA) were found to be number sense, creativity and working memory. Other studies found that students with creative talent turned out to have more cognitive resources than academically gifted mathematics students. In the current study it was hypothesized that the mean composite score of MC is lower in the MLD group compared to the TD group. MC was measured by three components: originality, flexibility and fluency. Also, it was hypothesized that the scores for fluency, flexibility and originality are lower in the MLD group compared to the typically developing (TD) group. A distinction was made between children with MLD, which included 35 participants, and typically developing (TD) children, including 318 participants. An ANOVA was performed. The results showed that the mean composite score of MC was lower for the MLD group compared to the TD group. For the three components, the MLD group scored lower on all components indicating that having MLD has a negative relation with MC. The study is of importance to support children with MLD by providing more multiple solution tasks in the classroom. This teaches them how to be mathematically creative and in turn supports their MA. More research is still necessary to research the specific direction of the relation and other possible factors influencing the relation.",

The role of pain catastrophizing on pain tolerance: Is pain catastrophizing a predictor of pain tolerance?,"Treffers, Romy","['Veldhuijzen, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Pain catastrophizing, which is an exaggerated negative mental state during actual pain or the expectation of pain, has shown to contribute to a more intense pain response and to increase emotional distress, but the literature on the topic is inconsistent. The present study aimed to establish whether higher levels of pain catastrophizing are related to lower levels of pain tolerance. This study tested the hypothesis that pain catastrophizing is negatively predicting pain tolerance in an experimental setting with healthy participants. Thirty-eight healthy participants, including 26 women, participated in this study. Pain catastrophizing was measured with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), while pain tolerance was measured with the Cold Pressor Test (CPT), which was used to induce experimental pain. Simple linear regression analysis showed that the PCS-score did not significantly predict pain tolerance, F(1, 36) = 3.95, p = .055, which led to rejection of the predefined hypothesis. It is advised to further research the relation between pain catastrophizing and pain tolerance, while minimalizing the effects of other variables, for example weight. In addition, it might be useful to do more research on how pain catastrophizing distinguishes itself from other mood-related concepts, such as anxiety, or more cognition based concepts, such as worrying. More research on pain catastrophizing might be beneficial when evaluating strategies for pain management. It could give more insight into which factors to focus on when improving pain management interventions.",
Het Effect van Optimisme op de Relatie tussen Zelfeffectiviteit en Pijntolerantie,"Oskam, Madelief","['Veldhuijzen, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Eerdere onderzoeken hebben aangetoond dat positieve psychologische factoren pijn kunnen verlagen. Deze studie onderzocht of zelfeffectiviteit en optimisme pijntolerantie verhogen, om te bepalen of het bij pijnbehandelingen waardevol is om op deze factoren te focussen. De onderzoeksvragen waren “Is pijntolerantie verschillend voor mensen met een hoge en een lage zelfeffectiviteit?” en “Wordt dit verschil gemedieerd door optimisme?”. Er werd verondersteld dat mensen met hoge zelfeffectiviteit een hogere pijntolerantie hadden dan mensen met lage zelfeffectiviteit. Verder werd een mediatie door optimisme verondersteld, waarbij hoge niveaus van optimisme het verschil in pijntolerantie tussen mensen met hoge en lage zelfeffectiviteit zouden versterken. Dit is onderzocht bij gezonde participanten (n = 38) in de leeftijdscategorie 16-35 jaar. Zelfeffectiviteit werd verbaal gemanipuleerd, pijntolerantie werd gemeten met de cold pressor task (CPT) en optimisme werd gemeten met de Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R). Uit de Mann Whitney U toets bleek dat er geen significant verschil was in pijntolerantie voor mensen met hoge en lage zelfeffectiviteit (p = .784). Uit de mediatieanalyse, uitgevoerd met Process macro, bleek dat er geen mediatie was door optimisme (Effect = 13.17, 95% CI [-9.61, 38.33]). Deze bevindingen kwamen niet overeen met de veronderstellingen. Al met al kan uit deze studie niet worden geconcludeerd dat manipulatie van zelfeffectiviteit pijntolerantie beïnvloedt en dat zelfeffectiviteit en optimisme een gecombineerde invloed hebben op pijntolerantie. Toekomstige studies kunnen deze mediatie opnieuw onderzoeken met een grotere steekproef en geslacht als extra variabele.

De Invloed van een Zelfeffectiviteit Manipulatie op de Geslachtsverschillen in Pijntolerantie,"Bruijn, Amy de","['Veldhuijzen, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Geslachtsverschillen in reactie op experimentele pijnstimuli worden steeds vaker in de literatuur beschreven, waarbij vrouwen over het algemeen een lagere pijntolerantie vertonen dan mannen. Een psychologisch construct die deze geslachtsverschillen in pijntolerantie zou kunnen verklaren, is zelfeffectiviteit. Voorgaand onderzoek suggereert namelijk dat een hogere mate van zelfeffectiviteit kan zorgen voor een hogere pijntolerantie, maar dat deze relatie anders is afhankelijk van geslacht. Het huidige onderzoek heeft deze hypothese onderzocht door middel van een zelfeffectiviteit manipulatie, waarbij willekeurig aan 26 vrouwen en 12 mannen werd gesuggereerd dat zij wel (hoge zelfeffectiviteit conditie) of niet (lage zelfeffectiviteit conditie) goed met stressvolle stimuli konden omgaan. Er werd verwacht dat een hogere mate van zelfeffectiviteit voor een hogere pijntolerantie zorgt en dat dit effect groter is bij mannen dan bij vrouwen. Hiernaast werd verwacht dat mannen een hogere pijntolerantie hebben dan vrouwen. Pijntolerantie is gemeten met de Cold Pressor Test (CPT). De hypotheses zijn getoetst met een tweeweg ANOVA. De resultaten hebben niet kunnen aantonen dat een hogere mate van zelfeffectiviteit voor een hogere pijntolerantie zorgt (p = .876) en dat dit effect groter is bij mannen dan bij vrouwen (p = .780). Het bleek wel dat mannen een hogere pijntolerantie hadden dan vrouwen (p = .006). Er is voorgesteld om in vervolgonderzoek te onderzoeken of een op gender-gerichte zelfeffectiviteit manipulatie wellicht voor andere resultaten zorgt. De resultaten van het huidige onderzoek, samen met die van vervolgonderzoek, kunnen meer informatie leveren voor het ontwikkelen van pijn-interventies gericht op zelfeffectiviteit, zodat de geslachtsongelijkheid in pijn wellicht kan worden verkleind.",
Neuroticism and Pain Tolerance in Healthy Adults: Can our personality predispose us to pain?,"Hermelink, Floris","['Veldhuijzen, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Pain represents a significant problem in modern society. Personality factors have been suggested to play a role in the experience of pain, though much remains unknown about this relationship, with many previous studies yielding somewhat contradictory results. This study looks at the influence of neuroticism on pain tolerance specifically. It was hypothesized that neuroticism scores would be negatively associated with tolerance times. Participants in this study were 38 healthy students between 18 and 26 years old. Neuroticism was measured using the revised short-form Eysenck personality questionnaire and pain tolerance was measured using the cold pressor test. Participants submerged their hand in cold water for as long as they could. This time was recorded as the pain tolerance. The assumptions of a linear regressions were violated, so a logistic regression was used instead with neuroticism scores as the independent variable and pain tolerance times as the dependent variable. To transform pain tolerance times into a dichotomous variable that could be used in logistic regression, tolerance times were divided into a high and a low category split at the median score. Analysis revealed a significant association between neuroticism and pain tolerance (p = .030), with individuals who score higher in neuroticism exhibiting lower tolerance for pain. The model managed to explain approximately 13% of the variance in tolerance times based on neuroticism scores. This finding may prove useful in the development of individualized interventions for chronic pain, by providing valuable information on how individual characteristics contribute to the experience of pain.",

ANOVAs showed that disrespect from subordinates instils anger and acceptance anxiety in work group leaders. Power threat also instils anger and acceptance anxiety in work group leaders. Mediation analysis showed that disrespect, through anger, leads to destructive leadership. Mediation analysis also showed that disrespect and power threat, through acceptance anxiety, do not lead to more constructive leadership.

Can illness perceptions predict treatment adherence to Mhealth tool ‘The Box’ in cardiac surgery patients’?,"Schalkes, Joyce","['Janssen, V.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background The beliefs patients hold about their disease and their corresponding treatment (illness perceptions) have been shown to predict adherence to both medication and self-management. However, it is not clear if this is also the case concerning adherence within mHealth applications. Purpose The present study investigates whether (changes in) illness perceptions in cardiac surgery patients are related to adherence towards mHealth care-track ‘The Box’. Method ‘The Box’ is a mHealth care-track, developed by the LUMC. Participants received several mHealth devices with whom they can measure and therefor monitor their health. Participants were asked to take measurements over a three-month period. Illness perceptions were measured with the Brief illness Perceptions Questionnaire (BIPQ) immediately after open-heart surgery, and three months later. The level of engagement was measured using the Twente Engagement with eHealth technologies (Tweets) questionnaire. Results Two multiple regression analyses showed that, after controlling for mHealth literacy, illness perceptions were unable to predict the degree of adherence to mHealth care-track ‘The Box’. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA ‘s revealed that in this sample illness perceptions did not change over time. Conclusion Illness perceptions measured directly after cardiac surgery, were not related to adherence towards mHealth care-track ‘The Box’. Foremost, it seems that mHealth literacy is an important component in explaining the level of engagement, and therefor adherence.",['Coronary artery disease . Mhealth . Illness perceptions.

Private house owners from the municipality of Leiden (N = 305) were randomly assigned to one of the three different manipulated information conditions: control (no information), goal information (information about the high and abstract goal of the municipality to have all houses disconnected from the gas grid by 2050), and means information (goal information, including steps on how to reach this goal). According to goal-setting theory and elaborating on the distinction between capacity PBC (CPBC) and motivational PBC (CPBC), we expected participants to have a more positive attitude and more feelings of MPBC when informed with more concrete information. As expected, attitude, subjective norm, and MPBC correlated with behavioral intentions towards disconnecting from the gas grid. A limitation was that our manipulation was not successful in the different conditions. On the other hand, prior knowledge had a large effect on intention. A suggestion for further research is to adapt their approaches to the needs of the different kinds of homeowners by adding a checklist on the GaGoed website and increasing the use of the neighbourhood ambassadors.","['Pro-environmental behaviour change', 'Goal-setting', 'Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)', 'Extended Theory of Planned Behavior (ETPB)', 'Attitudes', 'Motivational PBC', 'Capacity PBC', 'Perceived behavioral control', 'Subjective norms', 'Gas-free']"

The tragedy of the anticommons is a phenomenon that arises when individuals have the right to exclude other individuals from a limited common resource. This can result in no one having an opportunity to benefit from the common resource and the common resource becoming underused and wasted. Varying the degree of uncertainty and accountability, a social decision-making task on the computer was conducted with 136 participants. The participants indicated their willingness to accept (WTA) price of a lottery ticket with three different degrees of uncertainty about the offer of the buyer of the lottery tickets (certainty, low uncertainty or high uncertainty). Furthermore, there were two accountability conditions where participants either did or did not justify their decisions to their group members. As predicted by previous research, uncertainty had a negative effect on decision making. Participants indicated a higher WTA price and thus behaved less cooperative as uncertainty increased. Unexpectedly, accountability had no significant effect on decision making. Participants indicated a similar WTA price whether they had to justify their decisions to group members or not.",

Even though water-temperatures can drop to 4 degrees during the coldest months, there is a quickly growing community of surfing enthusiasts who enter the water year-round. By using visual-ethnographic methodologies during fieldwork such as observational and participative methods, combined with several semi-structured interviews, this study explores how different aspects of surfing such as the uncertainty of waves, the experience of surfing, stoke, and the never-ending search for the ever-changing perfect wave, contribute to the mindset, dedication and closeness among surfing enthusiasts in Scheveningen. The following thesis consists of both a textual component and an ethnographic film of 30 minutes. The written part analyzes various concepts related to the experience of surfing, and moreover how the appeal and experience of surfing relate to the mentality and mindset of surfers, both within and outside of the water. The natural component of surfing is explored, as surfing is not merely conducted in nature, but with nature, and the experience of surfing is formed partly because of the elements that one is engaging with. Types of weather, the moon, the wind, the tide and countless other natural circumstances, such as the dependency of waves and forecasting are all deemed important to understand for surfers in Scheveningen and often become part of the everyday life of surfing enthusiasts. I moreover examine concepts such as experience, forming of identity, and the importance of stoke through comparing my own research with the academic discourse surrounding culture and surfing. The documentary film provides audiovisual means to help understand the experience of different surfing conditions that can occur within Scheveningen through the following of four participants, the researcher herself included. It portrays various people experiencing different kinds of stoke through both surfing and surf-related activities. Through both observational, participatory and sensorial aspects, the documentary-film is created to compliment the written thesis. The key finding of this research is that the aforementioned uncertainty and never-ending search for the ever-changing perfect wave has an impact on the mindset of surfing enthusiasts in and around Scheveningen, creating higher levels of stoke, causing them to continue surfing on a daily basis, whether through surfing or by preparing for the next swell.",

Possible Effects of Menstrual Cycle on Mood and Depression Mediated by State Self-Esteem,"Hofmann, Marie","['Bruijn, E. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current research investigated the role of state self-esteem in the relationship between menstrual cycle and mood symptoms, specifically depression and anxiety. Research has not only generally shown a higher incidence rate of depression in women but also specifically increased rates of depression in women with menstrual related symptoms. In the present study it was hypothesized that women during their menstruation, compared to during their ovulation, show more depressive and anxious symptoms. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that there is a mediating effect of self-esteem. It was predicted that women during their menstruation have less self-esteem and that women with less self-esteem show more depressive and anxious symptoms. An online questionnaire about depression, anxiety, self-esteem, and additionally questions about women’s menstrual cycle was filled out by 268 participants. Focusing on only naturally cycling women, 18 women were grouped into the ovulating and 25 women into the menstruating group. Contrary to the predictions, results from the multiple regression analyses showed that there was neither an effect of the menstrual cycle phase on mood symptoms such as depression and anxiety nor a mediation effect of state self-esteem in the relationship of the menstrual cycle phase on mood symptoms. However, there seemed to be a relationship between self-esteem and depressive symptoms. This means the lower the woman’s self-esteem, the higher she scored on depressive symptoms. It thus seems as if depressive and anxious symptoms are not influenced by whether a woman is currently ovulating or menstruating. The results of the study add to the body of literature about the menstrual cycle, self-esteem, and mood symptoms.",

The Effects of Stress on Threat-Selective Attention in Relation to Trait Anxiety,"Leopold, Dion","['Putman, P.', 'Verkuil, B']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The presented study targets the interplay of stress exposure and attentional responses towards threats in connection to trait anxiety. Previous research suggests that an underlying change in threat-appraisal (indicated through higher trait anxiety scores) might significantly alter the attentional response of individuals when exposed to stress. Instead of displaying an attentional bias towards mild threats, it was hypothesised that the higher the score in trait anxiety assessment, the greater the avoidance behaviour. This project included 64 female students of Leiden University and assessed trait anxiety via Spielberger’s State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory. Stress (psychosocial, physiological and anticipatory) was induced with three tasks prior to the start of the main experiment. To measure the attentional bias, a dot-probe task was implemented. The task consisted of 206 trials with an 80ms cue delay. Multiple regression analyses and post-hoc correlation analyses were performed, where almost no significant results were observed. Trait anxiety displayed significant effects, while stress exposure remained non-significant. The interaction of trait anxiety and stress exposure did not explain additional variance. The hypothesis regarding the change in attentional responses was thus rejected. Posthoc testing showed no significant correlations between trait anxiety and attentional bias and stress exposure and attentional bias. It remains unclear whether stress exposure significantly affects the attentional response towards threats in relation to trait anxiety.","['Trait Anxiety', 'Stress Exposure', 'Attentional Bias', 'Threat-Appraisal']"
A Self-Efficacy Intervention and its Effect on Cold Pressor Pain Tolerance Levels: What are the Roles of Catastrophizing Beliefs and Fear of Pain?,"Papanikolaou, Faidra",['Veldhuijzen. J.'],2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Following the neuromatrix theory of pain and pain avoidance theories, self-efficacy has a central role in the experience of pain. Previous research demonstrated that self-efficacy can be verbally manipulated and correlates with different pain outcomes. Furthermore, pain catastrophizing beliefs and fear of pain are important psychological factors, often also investigated in relation to pain and self-efficacy. This study aimed to answer whether a self-efficacy intervention affects pain tolerance levels, and secondly, whether pain catastrophizing and fear of pain moderate this effect. We hypothesized that the intervention would result in different pain tolerance levels, and the two psychological variables would moderate the effect. Thirty-eight healthy participants were recruited and randomly allocated in two conditions, where they received verbal suggestions about their abilities to tolerate pain. We assessed pain tolerance levels using a cold pressor test, and the fear of pain and pain catastrophizing beliefs using suitable questionnaires. A one-way ANOVA was conducted for manipulation checks, a Kruskal-Wallis test for the effects of self-efficacy on pain tolerance, and two linear regression moderations. Our results suggest that the intervention did not affect self-efficacy levels (F(1, 34) = 3.42, p = .07), and pain tolerance levels (� (1) = 0.09, p = .768). The moderation 2 analysis did not show either pain catastrophizing (Δ� = .005, ΔF(1, 34) = 0.20, p = .660, b = 1.12, 2 t(34) = 0.44, p = .660) or fear of pain (Δ� = .02, ΔF(1, 33) = 0.80, p = .377, b = 1.23, t(33) = 0.90, p 2 = 0.377) as moderators. Our results were in contrast to previous research and could be due to several factors. We suggest future studies may benefit by differentiating “pain threshold” and “pain endurance” and making mindful choices of statistical analyses due to the common non-normality of cold pressor pain tolerance. It should be noted that those results are preliminary from an ongoing study, therefore a small sample size was a major limitation.",
Factors Predicting Loneliness During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Öztürk, Cemre","['Krause-Utz, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Loneliness has become an increasingly common phenomenon due to lockdowns put in place to minimize spread of COVID-19. The current body of literature suggests the relationship between loneliness and various Big-5 personality dimensions, except openness to experience. The current study aimed to fill this gap by investigating if there is a predictive effect of 1) openness to experience and 2) tolerance to uncertainty on loneliness during COVID-19 pandemic. It also aimed to investigate if this relation is influenced by gender. Methods: Responses from 349 participants were collected in anonymous online surveys at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim and at Leiden University. The survey was posted at online platforms and distributed amongst social media and the University Research Systems. Openness was assessed with the 10-Item Big Five Inventory (BFI10). Loneliness was measured with UCLA loneliness scale (ULS8). Intolerance of uncertainty was assessed with the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (UI18). Results: The results showed that higher BFI10 scores predicted higher ULS8 scores (loneliness) (B = .066, SE= .031, p =.036, 95% CI= [.004, .128]). Similarly, higher UI18 scores (intolerance of uncertainty) predicted higher scores on ULS8 (loneliness) (B = .298 , SE= .036, p =<.001, 95% CI= [.228, .369]). There was no significant effect of gender on loneliness.

Further investigation is is important to study this relationship using longitudinal designs and accounting for other personality characteristics.","['loneliness', 'openness to experience', 'big-five', 'intolerance of uncertainty', 'covid-19', 'pandemics']"
An Online Pain Management Intervention for Migraine Patients – A Single-Case Design,"King, Skye","['Hiele, K. van der']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Providing behavioral treatment via online interventions allows greater ease of access and less stigma for migraineurs. However, online interventions for migraineurs are limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the within person effects and outcomes of an online behavioral intervention. A single-case AB quasi-experimental design was utilized. Three Dutch-speaking participants, above the age of 18 with chronic migraines according to the ICHD3-beta, were recruited and allocated to care as usual and the intervention. Several questionnaires were completed: before the intervention (baseline), post-intervention (T2), six weeks after T2 (T3), and again three months after T2 (T4). Participants kept a headache diary daily before baseline and between baseline and T2 (intervention) to assess migraine frequency, severity, and duration. Ratings on these questionnaires were analyzed for clinically significant improvement (showing 30% improvement and 0.5 SD change using the normative sample SD) from baseline across time points. Improvement after intervention as compared to baseline was seen in pain, coping, physical and mental quality of life, locus of control, self-efficacy, migraine-related interference and distress, and illness cognitions for at least two participants. Migraine frequency, severity, and duration during baseline and intervention were analyzed using visual inspection, nonoverlap of all pairs (NAP), and Tau-U calculations. None of the NAP results were significant, however Tau-U results showed significant trend differences. Migraine frequency significantly increased for two participants (Tau-U = .67, p < .001; Tau U = .91, p < .001). Migraine severity significantly decreased for one participant (Tau-U = -.55, p = .01), but significantly increased for another participant (Tau-U = .98, p < .001). Migraine duration significantly decreased for one participant (Tau-U = -.49, p = .04), but significantly increased for another participant (Tau-U = .70, p < .001). No significant changes in migraine frequency, severity, nor duration were seen for one of the participants. While the methodological limitations of the current study made the results less valid, the results showed promise. Therefore, future studies could utilize a randomized control trial design to test feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention further and make it possible to generalize results to the greater patient population.",
An exploration of interference control and post-error adjustment in the context of the menstrual cycle: A study on women’s performance in an online version of the flanker task,"Jansen, Josina","['Bruijn, E. de', 'Putman, P.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Steroid hormones are frequently highlighted as an important modulator of women’s susceptibility for developing mood and anxiety disorders. One of the often-considered influences is the effect of estradiol on the dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex. Given this association it was investigated if natural levels of estradiol might affect women’s executive functions. The focus of measurement was the participant’s performance on the flanker task. It was hypothesised that women in a menstrual cycle phase marked by high estradiol show enhanced interference control and post-error adjustment. The study was conducted as an observational, natural group design and executed in an online format. Self-reports on the menstrual cycle were used for an approximation of the women’s current estradiol levels based on which two groups of women, either high or low in estradiol, were created. Main comparisons were made between 29 naturally cycling women in total and 48 men. The outcomes suggest that the cycle phase of women and the assumed levels of estradiol may not have influenced the processes of interference control or post-error adjustment. To interpret the obtained results, the measured constructs, interference control, error monitoring, and the menstrual cycle are discussed, and possible uncontrolled variables outlined. Future research is needed to further explore women’s executive processes and related neural correlates in the context of the menstrual cycle. Research in this field may provide better understanding of possible influences on women’s cognitive and emotional circuits in the brain, which will help to achieve a clearer picture of women’s psychological wellbeing throughout their life span.","['Menstrual cycle', 'estradiol', 'adapted online version flanker task', 'interference control', 'post-error slowing']"
Space For Artistic Practice: A Visual Ethnography of an Artist Community and Artistic Practice,"Erzeybek, Dilara","['Postma, M.', 'Saptari, R.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study aims to shed light on the artist community Treehouse in Amsterdam as a space for artistic practice. By applying the concepts: place and space, community, artistic practice and artistic process, this study focuses on place and space as conditions in which artistic process can emerge. My goal is to explore the diversity of these artistic practices and spaces in which it is practiced. In terms of discussing the experiences of place and space, I would like to explore the perspectives of policy makers and the lived experiences of the artists within the place and space. This study aims to offer a more focused navigation of artistic processes; and explores what (pre)conditions are needed for the artists to engage in their artistic process. It aims to shift the approach from exploring art as established institution, to art as “practice”. Therefore, my aim in this article is to explore artistic practice and the role of place and space, and the artistcommunity in it (both physical and social). I used qualitative research methods and observational filmmaking as a research tool to generate empirical data. The results of this research are presented in a textual output (this article), and an audio-visual output (the film: Space for Artistic Practice, 2021), with both being part of the same overarching research. Two of my participants allowed me to study them more intensively on their artistic process. This provided insight in the small-scale aspects of their social reality, such as interaction, the forms of communication through art and their artistic processes. I introduce the concept of “creative sphere” as a mental space, which artists can experience when the workspace meets certain desired preconditions, and artistic process can happen. This approach discusses how the division and ordering principles of the space is part of an artistic interpretation and discusses different conditions in which art is made. Place and Space for artistic practice and artistic process has a political side, but it also has a personal side. Therefore, this article is divided in two parts. In the first part, I explore artistic practice in relation to place and space in a macro perspective (political and community), and in the second part, I will discuss the role of space in artistic process (personal and in a more philosophical perspective).","['Art', 'Artist', 'Artistic Practice', 'Place & Space', 'Breeding Grounds']"

Mindfulness as a Potential Buffer against Depression among University Students: Exploring the link between depressive symptoms and mindfulness within a network framework,"Gassenbeek, Lotte","['Veenman, M.', 'Putman, P.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The issue of depression among university students and the seriousness of the consequences of this problem is highlighted by numerous studies. The aim of this study is to examine if mindfulness is a potential prevention against the development of depressive symptoms among university students. We used the collected data from the study of Alzahrani et al. (2020), assessing depressive symptoms and mindfulness characteristics in 289 medical students in Saudi-Arabia (measured with the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the PatientHealth Questionnaire). With the use of a network analysis we examined the associations among the five facets of mindfulness and depressive symptoms together with the variable history of meditation. The constructed network informs us if, and how, facets of mindfulness are related to specific depressive symptoms, and thus can potentially act as a buffer against the onset of depressive symptoms among university students. Our results point out that four of the five facets of mindfulness are negatively related to depressive symptoms, consecutively acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, describing and nonreactivity to inner experience. However, the observed associations are relatively weak. In addition we found that history of meditation was unrelated to depressive symptoms but positively associated with the mindfulness subscale observing. Future research should focus on a qualitative assessment of depressive symptoms and the isolation of specific facets of mindfulness in order to improve data collection. These suggestions together with the use of network analysis could further explore the value of mindfulness practices as prevention for depression among university students.",
Not My Truth: A digital ethnography of the Dutch-speaking truth seeker community during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Elliott, Alice","['Hölsgens, S.', 'Westmoreland, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Together with the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, something else started spreading just as fast as the novel coronavirus: misinformation and disinformation. An infodemic was born, and groups and pages focused on Covid-19 related conspiracy theories started popping up all over the internet. In this digital ethnography, I examine the online community of Dutch-speaking truth seekers, who claim that the corona restrictions are a first step towards a dystopian, global, totalitarian regime. The resulting thesis consists of an ethnographic video essay and a written text. Through the combination of a reflexive voiceover, screen recordings, interview fragments, found footage and screenshots, the film explores both the thoughts and experiences of my research participants being part of this community, as well as those of me doing this research. Focusing on the themes of truth, community and freedom, the written part examines the individual and social dynamics behind the rapid growth of this community. My findings are in line with earlier research on conspiracy belief and suggest that the appeal of the Dutch-speaking truth seeker community is threefold. It answers a desire to reduce the complexity of a chaotic reality, it provides social support in a world where many experience a lack of a sense of community, and it gives a sense of control in uncertain times.","['Covid-19', 'conspiracy theories', 'social media', 'online community', 'conspiracy belief']"

The Influence of Parental Behavior and the Importance of Self-Esteem in Adolescents,"Daniels, Geena","['Wentholt, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adolescence is a time of great psychological change and research highlights the importance of self-esteem in relation to wellbeing. However, it is not clear which parental techniques contribute to high levels of self-esteem. In this research parental behavior strategies are investigated in relation to self-esteem of adolescents. The first aim of the study was to investigate the association between autonomy support and psychological control (AS/PC) and self-esteem in adolescents. Secondly, we explored if the relationship between observed parental behavior and self-esteem was mediated by adolescent gender and/or cognitive emotion regulation skills (CERS). Data from 142 parents and 80 healthy control group adolescents from the larger, ongoing Dutch research project ‘Relations and Emotions in Parent-Adolescent Interaction Research’ (RE-PAIR) were used. Self-esteem and CERS were measured with the Rosenberg self-esteem scale and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Multiple hierarchical regression analyses showed that AS/PC did not significantly predict self-esteem in adolescents and no moderating effect of adolescent gender was found. However, we did find a moderating effect from CERS on the relation between AS and self-esteem, with a weaker relation between AS and self-esteem for higher levels of CERS (β = -1.97, p = .002). Further studies are recommended to investigate the underlying mechanisms between parental behavior strategies and self-esteem in adolescents.","['adolescence', 'self-esteem', 'autonomy support', 'psychological control', 'cognitive emotion regulation skills', 'multiple regression']"

This study examined the extent to which a specific play intervention, i.e., Loose Parts Play (LPP), improved social inclusion of children with disabilities who attend mainstream schools. An LPP intervention was conducted with two classes at a mainstream school. The classes included 42 children (mean = 9.79; age-range = 9-11), out of whom three were deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) or had autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children were observed and wore sensors during break time. The children and classroom teachers filled out questionnaires and an interview was conducted with the playground teachers at the end of the intervention. The following variables were examined: 1) quantity of social interactions; 2) variety of interaction partners; 3) social play; 4) peer acceptance; 5) friendships; and 6) social well-being. An increase was found in the variety of interaction partners as well as a decrease in the proportions of social interactions and social play in the total sample. Before the intervention, children with disabilities scored lower on the proportion of social interactions; the proportion of social play interactions; and all peer acceptance and friendship variables compared to their peers. This did not improve during LPP. LPP had little effect on the total sample and failed to improve the social inclusion of children with disabilities. These results suggest the need of more research aiming at social and emotional effects of LPP, especially for children with disabilities since these results are based on three children.","['children', 'hearing loss', 'social inclusion', 'disability']"
"Predictive factors of harm expectancy in PTSD patients: The relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, posttraumatic cognitions and emotion dysregulation with harm expectancy levels before the first exposure therapy session","Thomassen, Thalia","['De Kleine, R.', 'Mouthaan, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction: harm expectancy violation is a strategy that enhances exposure therapy for PTSD patients. Before exposed to trauma reminders, patients formulate anticipatory harm expectancies regarding the occurrence of aversive events. Exposure is maintained until this expectancy is violated, creating crucial learning effects. However, harm expectancies are under investigated. Our goal is to gain more insight into harm expectancies prior to treatment and to investigate other related variables. Methods: this study is part of the overarching IMPACT-study of Oprel et al. (2018). CA-PTSD patients (N = 150) from PsyQ Psychotrauma departments filled in one standardized and one idiosyncratic harm expectancy prior to the first exposure session. PTSD symptom severity (CAPS-5), posttraumatic cognitions (PTCI) an emotion dysregulation (DERS) were measured at baseline. Relationships were examined using Spearman correlation analyses. The relationship between harm expectancy and PTSD severity, possibly mediated by posttraumatic cognitions and emotion dysregulation, was examined using PROCESS. Results: small significant positive correlations were found between the standardized harm expectancy and other variables. The idiosyncratic harm expectancy only correlated with the standardized harm expectancy. A small proportion of harm expectancy variance was explained by predictors in the mediation. Posttraumatic cognitions and emotion dysregulation were no significant mediators. Discussion: results indicate that the harm expectancy instrument is not a good measure and that there might be no relation between harm expectancy levels and PTSD-pathology related instruments. Secondly, harm expectancies might not be traced accurately with existing explicit techniques, since these cognitions might operate on a more implicit level. Measurement improvements were discussed.",
"The heart-brain axis: associations between cardiac activity, insular connectivity and trait worry and anxiety: A study in healthy volunteers","Eraslan, Dilek","['Rover, M. de', 'Wentholt, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Worry and anxiety are associated with an increase in absolute heart rate, while heart rate variability decreases. Low heart rate variability is associated with an active anterior insula. A hyperactive anterior insula is observed in individuals with anxiety disorders. However, it is not yet known whether a hyperactive anterior insula makes a person vulnerable to developing anxiety disorders or whether the anterior insula becomes hyperactive as a result of the disorder. Therefore, this study aims to investigate these associations in healthy participants. The following research questions were asked, ""Is there a correlation between absolute heart rate and trait worry?"" and ""Is trait worry associated with low heart rate variability?"" the same questions are posed in the context of anxiety. Finally, the question ""Is trait anxiety associated with a hyperactive insula?"" is asked. To examine this, data from the HADS, PSWQ, vectorcardiogram measures of heart rate and the heart rate variability, and the functional connectivity of the salience network from the 30 female participants were used. Results show no significant relationship between absolute heart rate, heart rate variability, and trait worry and anxiety in healthy participants. A significant relationship between the functional connectivity in the anterior insula and trait anxiety was found in our sample (r = .42, p = <.05). The effects of worry and anxiety on cardiac activity are mainly seen in clinically diagnosed individuals under an unpredictable and uncontrollable stressful environment. Our sample were healthy individuals, so symptoms were apparently not severe enough. The effects of trait anxiety are directly reflected in brain connectivity in the anterior insula observed in our analysis. The results can be applied to treatments reducing anxiety and worry.","['Heart rate', 'HRV', 'insula', 'salience network']"
The Neural Processing Of Positive & Negative Financial Reinforcement,"White, Emily","['Reijnders, T.', 'Veldhuijzen, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research on the neural processing of reward and punishment thus far has indicated the complex and constant role it plays in decision making and behaviour. Current findings suggest that an action can be incentivised by the desire to avoid punishment as well to gain reward. A means of gauging how effective a financial incentive is to motivate behaviour is via the neural response it elicits using EEG data. This study uses the Monetary Incentive Delay task (MIDt) to examine financial incentive-driven behavior. Due to loss aversion, we expected a greater neural response (feedback related negatively; FRN), in punishing conditions where money is lost compared to reward or control where it is not. We investigate how reward and punishment sensitivity of the participant could moderate this relationship between FRN and the type of incentive, assuming that higher punishment sensitivity will predict an increased FRN amplitude generated in the punishment compared to reward conditions. This thesis is a preliminary analysis, involving university students with no substance abuse or problematic gambling histories (N = 21) that complete the MIDt while EEG was being recorded. The short Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire was administered pre-experiment and all money earned during the MIDt was awarded to the participants upon completion. Data was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA, with contrasts as follows: control vs gain; control vs loss; gain vs loss. A moderation analysis was run of punishment/reward sensitivity (SP/SR) on gain versus loss with FRN amplitude as outcome using PROCESS in SPSS. Data is still being obtained at this point in time to achieve necessary power for this study. This is potentially why our preliminary results were non-significant for our hypotheses. However, the trends shown in the FRN absolute values indicate a greater neural response in punishment conditions where money is lost compared to either the reward or neutral counterparts. Additional analysis is required to fully ascertain how punishment and reward sensitivity impact the neural correlates of financial incentives and how this finding can be applied when using such incentives practically.","['Financial Incentive', 'MID task', 'FRN', 'Reward & Punishment Sensitivity']"

The resulting thesis comprises a written text and an ethnographic film. The text offers a reflection on methodological issues and critically explores how my conceptual framework connects with my research findings, while the ethnographic film focuses upon the subjective experiences and the emotions of three nurses of exclusive duty and juxtaposes theirs with my own experiences as a granddaughter of grandparents that were taken care of by a ‘stranger’. My key research finding is that the precarity of this profession, the stereotype of women as ‘natural’ caregivers, the inequalities because of ethnicity and socio-economical status and the consequent crossing of the personal/professional boundaries impact their physical and mental health since they supplement the challenges of this job. The nurses constantly try to negotiate their position and prove their value to the society while working without governmental provision and support. Thus, I argue that their gender, ethical positions, ethnicity and socio-economical status affect the perceptions of their caregiving role and identity.","['visual ethnography', 'remote ethnography', 'nurses of exclusive duty', 'caregiving', 'healthcare system']"
"Too tired to live healthy? The assessment of fatigue, diet adherence, physical activity adherence, and intervention adherence in patients with chronic kidney disease.","Hondema, Julia","['Van Dijk, S.', 'Karacaoglu, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adherence to a healthy lifestyle is an important requirement for patients with chronic kidney disease, as it can prevent disease progression and mortality. However, many patients find this difficult. In addition, people living with chronic kidney disease also experience various symptoms, of which fatigue is the most common and also the most impeding when it comes to carrying out daily activities. To increase adherence to a healthy lifestyle it is necessary to investigate which factors hinder or facilitate this adherence to a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, this study examined (1) whether fatigue may be a barrier for adhering to a healthy lifestyle, defined as adhering to guidelines regarding a healthy diet and taking physical activity, and adherence to an intervention to support a healthy lifestyle. This study also examined (2) whether actively participating in a lifestyle intervention is indeed related to improving lifestyle over time, and (3) whether the relation between fatigue and a change in healthy lifestyle adherence over time is mediated by the level of intervention adherence. To answer these research questions, an observational study was conducted. This study was a sub-project of the E-GOAL study, which comprised a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) among patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 121) to assess the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention. The participants who were randomly assigned to the intervention group (N = 60) received an online intervention program including tailored e-coach modules with home assignments and e-coaching of a psychologist. This study distinguished two measures of intervention adherence: objective and subjective intervention adherence. Questionnaires were used to measure fatigue (SFQ), diet adherence, physical activity adherence (SQUASH), and subjective intervention adherence, which participants had to complete at baseline (t = 0) and after the 3-month during intervention (t = 3). To measure objective intervention adherence, the psychologist's records were used to calculate the average number of modules completed per week. To test the hypotheses, hierarchical multiple regression analyses and mediation analyses with Hayes' PROCESS macro model were performed. During the analyses, adjustments were made for baseline values, age, gender, and employment situation. The analyses revealed that, contrary to expectations (1) fatigue was not related to a change in physical activity adherence over time, and (2) fatigue was positive instead of negative related to a change in diet adherence over time, (3) and this effect between fatigue and a change in diet adherence overtime was fully mediated by patients' selfreported level of intervention adherence. In conclusion, more fatigued patients reported better adherence to the intervention and were, therefore, more adherent to a healthy diet over time. A suggestion for clinical practice is therefore to incorporate interventions such as the E-GOAL intervention into the standard treatment of chronic kidney disease. Further research is needed on fatigue as a barrier and what interventions need to improve physical activity adherence as well.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'fatigue', 'healthy lifestyle adherence', 'diet adherence', 'physical activity adherence', 'intervention adherence.']"
Together against Corona? The Relationship between poor Sleep Quality during COVID19 and Depressive Symptoms and Role of Perceived Social Support in University Students,"Antwi, Hannah","['Janssen, L.', 'Van den Berg, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its negative consequences for psychological health are omnipresent. Increased poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms, which are knowingly interrelated, have been reported amongst the general public. From previous research we know that social support can have a protective function and diminish the negative consequences of stressful life situations, such as the pandemic. We hypothesized that poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic was linked to depressive symptoms. We also assumed perceived social support to moderate this association. This cross-sectional study included 3484 students with Mage= 22.1 and SD = 3.1; 73,5 percent were female; 26.5 percent were male. Three multiple regression analyses were conducted, a moderation term was added to the equation. The post hoc analysis was a subgroup analysis. A positive association between experiencing poor sleep quality during COVID-19 and depressive symptoms was found (β = .38, p < .001). Perceived social support was a statistically significant moderator of poor sleep quality during COVID-19 and depressive symptoms (β = -.03, p = 025). However, only when comparing the beta value of the high social support group (β = .36, p < .001) with the medium-high social support group (β = .33, p < .001) a mitigating effect of perceived social support was identified. In conclusion, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms co-occurred. Also, the study suggested that perceived social support had a protective effect concerning both, poor sleep quality during COVID-19 and depressive symptoms, a moderating role on the association was not confirmed.","['COVID-19', 'poor sleep quality', 'depressive symptoms', 'social support']"
Substance use disorder and violent crime: The relationship between single- and polysubstance use disorder and violent offenses in a Dutch clinical youth population,"Hetten, Marinde van","['Van den Berg, J.', 'Spijkerman, R.', 'Van Giezen, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In the past decade, one of the main difficulties in describing a general relationship between substance abuse and violent crime is the question whether different types of substances may relate differently to violent crime, and which other factors may be influential. The current study investigated the effect of different types and combinations of substances on violent offenses committed by Dutch youth (16-22 years) who were starting an addiction treatment for a substance use disorder (SUD) with alcohol, cannabis, or stimulants (cocaine or amphetamines). Participants (N=310) were individually assessed, with questions about their substance use behavior and whether they had committed a violent offense. The independent variables for this study were polysubstance use, combined stimulants and alcohol use, and singular or combined cannabis use. Contrary to the hypotheses, the association between polysubstance use and violent offenses was not significant (OR=1.14, 95% CI= 0.62–2.08), and the association between stimulants use and violent offenses (OR=1.20, 95% CI=0.47– 3.04) and between cannabis use and violent offenses (OR= 0.63, 95% CI=0.34–1.18) was not significant either. The covariate ‘indication of conduct disorder’ had a significant influence on the relationship between types of SUD and the occurrence of violent offenses, but an influence of age and gender on this relationship was not found. Because this is the first study with a clinical youth sample, the best explanation for these findings is that the psychoactive effects of the substances were (at least) not the primary influence of the occurrence of violent offenses committed by youth.","['substance use disorder', 'violent crime', 'Dutch youth', 'psychoactive effects']"
The effectiveness of sleep-mood intervention on enhancing life satisfaction and reducing anxiety symptoms: a randomised controlled trial,"Wu, Beibei","['Tona, K.D.', 'Antypa, N.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"University students experience heightened sleep disturbances and anxiety symptoms, which may lead to a decrease of life satisfaction. Research suggests that there are apparent associations between sleep disturbances, life satisfaction, and anxiety symptoms. Previous studies have assessed the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the reduction of sleep outcomes in university students, but the present study is the first one to incorporate various therapeutic approaches (CBT for insomnia, mindfulness, lifestyle guidance) into one short and cost-effective treatment protocol tailored to university students. This study assesses the effectiveness of such group sleep-mood intervention. It is hypothesised that the intervention, compared to a waiting-list group, will enhance life satisfaction and reduce anxiety symptoms in a sample of university students suffering from sleep disturbances. Participants (n = 35) were randomised into intervention group and waitlist control group, with pre- and post- testing on life satisfaction, anxiety symptoms, and insomnia. The intervention group consisted of four weekly therapy sessions. Results showed no significant time x group allocation interaction for quality of life and anxiety. Higher life satisfaction was associated with less sleep disturbances at post-intervention.

Effects of rumination on the default mode network and the central executive network in healthy individuals,"Hemminga, Demi","['Rover, M. de', 'Wentholt, W.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: rumination is both a symptom and predictor of major depressive disorder (MDD). In MDD patients, rumination is correlated with depression severity, and for healthy people rumination is a predictor of the onset and duration of a depressive episode. Recently, rumination was shown to be correlated to functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) in the brain. During working memory (WM) tasks, the central executive network (CEN) shows high connectivity and the DMN shows low connectivity, whereas during rest this is the other way around. This ‘switching’ between DMN and CEN connectivity is blunted in MDD patients, but it is still unknown whether this ‘switch’ is affected by acute rumination in healthy participants. The aim of the current study is to determine the effect of acute rumination on the switching between the DMN and the CEN in healthy participants. Methods: 36 healthy females, randomly assigned to the acute-rumination group (n=18) or the no-rumination group (n=18) underwent fMRI assessment during a rest-WM task (alternating rest and WM conditions). Only for the acute-rumination group, an acute rumination phase immediately preceded the rest-WM task. Pearson’s correlation was performed to analyze the correlation between the DMN and the CEN in each participant. A mixed ANOVA was performed to analyze the effects of acute rumination. Results: Negative Pearson correlation coefficients were found between DMN and CEN for both groups. A statistically significant interaction effect was found for network (CEN versus DMN) × condition (rest versus WM). However, no statistically significant main effect was found for group (acute-rumination versus no-rumination). Conclusion: Consistent with previous studies an interaction in the expected direction was found between the DMN and CEN. However, this study does not support the effect of acute rumination on this interaction. The current study contributes to an increased understanding of the effect of rumination, and contributes to research of this prominent symptom of MDD and other psychological disorders.","['CEN', 'DMN', 'fMRI', 'functional connectivity', 'rumination']"

Interventions for parentally bereaved adolescents: What is their effectiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Markaki, Afroditi","['Tona, K.D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Parentally bereaved adolescents constitute a high-risk group susceptible to many short and long term negative outcomes, such as prolonged grief and depression. Numerous different interventions have been proposed and implemented aiming to support this population. However, there has been no comprehensive review or empirical support for all of them. This thesis aims to systematically review intervention studies for parentally bereaved adolescents and report on their effectiveness. Time interval between loss and treatment, symptom severity at baseline, interventions’ structure, therapeutic confrontation, participants’ age, and percentage of parental death were examined as plausible moderators. The dataset was extracted in December 2019 from nine electronic databases. Study characteristics regarding the interventions, samples, measures, and outcomes were extracted from 30 articles. Based on the sufficiently reported statistical data of 25 studies an overall effect size was estimated for the interventions and moderator analyses were conducted. A pooled effect size of -0.397 was found, indicating a small to moderate positive effect of these interventions on the participants’ life. Therapeutic confrontation, unstructured interventions, and targeting severely distressed participants were the intervention characteristics that positively moderated the intervention effectiveness. Different effect sizes were reported for separate outcome constructs, ranging from g = -0.029 to g = -1.203. Trauma-related outcomes reported the largest point estimate, while cortisol levels the smallest. To summarize, interventions targeting parentally bereaved adolescents can positively affect their participants during the difficult period following the loss of their parents. However, further and more targeted research is required to achieve larger effects.","['adolescent', 'bereavement', 'parental death', 'parental loss', 'grief', 'death', 'intervention', 'bereavement support', 'effectiveness', 'systematic review', 'meta-analysis']"
Individual Differences in the Response to COVID-19: Do Health Anxiety and BIG 5 Personality Traits Predict COVID-19 Perceived Risks of Infection and Preventive Behavior?,"Raterink, Jur","['Verkuil, B.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Research suggests that in times of a pandemic, perceived risk cognition and preventive behavior are essential factors for containing the outbreak. Previous studies suggest that health anxiety and neuroticism are important determinants of the behavioral and cognitive response to the virus. Method: The current study investigates these determinants during the beginning of the new coronavirus outbreak using longitudinal questionnaire data derived from the LISS panel. In a sample of Dutch participants (N = 2903), we tested the hypotheses that neuroticism and health anxiety predicted the corona response. Results: Regression analyses showed that higher health anxiety – assessed 6 years before the pandemic - was a predictor of more preventive behaviors and perceived risk. Contrary to the hypothesis, neuroticism was not associated with preventive behavior and risk perceptions. Exploratory analyses showed that higher agreeableness, extraversion, being a woman, and higher education predicted more preventive measures. Furthermore, being a woman and of lower age predicted a higher risk of infection cognitions. Limitations: These findings only shed light on the initial response to the threat of a new, unknown pandemic in the Dutch population. Furthermore, the study did not measure the effect of determinants on harmful behaviors or cognitions. Conclusion: Individual differences play a vital role in the behavioral and cognitive response at the beginning of the pandemic. Tailored interventions can target men, low health anxiety, lower educated, low agreeable, more introverted persons to promote preventive measures and slow down the spreading of a virus.",
Breaks in Motion: Understanding Self Loss and Self-making of recent Chinese Migrant-workers in the catering industry in the Netherlands.,"Zhang, Chen","['Suidgeest, K.', 'Postma, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This research sees the act of ""going abroad for work"" from two perspectives. One is leaving home and then conducting a cross-cultural life. The other is the expansion or adjustment of a career trajectory. This research examines how recent Chinese migrant workers cope with their overseas life when working in the catering industry in the Netherlands. By doing so, I have tried to understand what is the “social world” of my participants and how they interact with it. During 3 months of fieldwork, I talked with 8 participants and closely yet remotely studied social media content from this group. Our online conversations were based on getting along even virtually. The outcome comprises a written text and a film. The text discusses how these migrant workers engaged with labor and explores how the self was lost and rebuilt. As a trajectory pursuing success, and through daily practices in break times, I gradually gained insight in these migrant workers’ migration journey and witnessed their awareness and sacrifice of self. Sacrificing leisure life and prioritizing work, men I engaged with, can hardly think of their own feelings and needs or reflect on who they are. Yet their practice and narration indicated s certain expectation on self-presentation. The film portrays narratives of “labor migration” from several perspectives as a polyphonous testimony. Overall, the key findings are that for recent Chinese migrant workers who come to the Netherlands and work in the catering industry, the act of migration and adjusting to cross-cultural life are reported to be experienced as a ""normal"" process: It is experienced as natural that one needs to adjust to different coworkers and to the new work environment. As it is for money that they came overseas, they perceive it as normal to bear difficulties. Rather than entering in a process of trans-national transition and adjustment as I imagined, their journeys can be seen as a continued precarious yet independent career trajectory that illustrates how they, as labor migrants, do not relate more than necessary with their new environment. At the same time, these labor migrants seek and create breathing space for themselves in their daily break-times, and single free weekday, to maintain a sense of self. Also, bearing the uncomfortable, their tendency is to normalize it, and tend to talk about the self in a positive and independent way, together composing a sense of self.","['Self', 'Body', 'Mobility', 'Labor', 'Chinese labor migrants in the Netherlands']"

"Investigating Predictors of Loneliness During the Covid-19 Pandemic: Psychological Distress, Childhood Trauma, Mistrust and Living Situation","Eser, Özge","['Krause-Utz, A.', 'Tona, K.D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Research on loneliness suggests that loneliness increases physical and mental health concerns. This study aimed to investigate the predictor role of psychological distress, childhood trauma, mistrust, and the living situation on loneliness during the Covid-19 pandemic to identify vulnerable groups. Methods: 349 participants took part in this cross-sectional study. They completed online selfquestionnaires assessing their level of loneliness, psychological distress, childhood trauma, mistrust, and living situation. The study was conducted online during September 2020 and April 2021 at the Universities of Leiden (the Netherlands) and Mannheim (Germany). Most of the respondents were 18-25 years old university students from 30 different nationalities. Results: The results indicated that childhood trauma (B =.074, SE =.012 t = 6.29, p < .05) and psychological distress (B = .007, SE = .003, t = 2.11, p < .05) predict loneliness while mistrust (B = -.074, SE =.044, t = -1.68, p = .092) does not. The effect of psychological distress became insignificant, when controlling for the other predictor variables (β = .003, SE =.003 t = 1.11, p =.26). No significant effect was found on loneliness score between two categories of living situation (F(1,347) =.64, p =.424, ηp 2 =.002). There was no significant interaction between childhood trauma and psychological distress. Conclusions: The current study highlights that experiencing childhood trauma is a risk factor for the feeling of loneliness during the Covid-19 pandemic. Prospective research is needed to fully understand the reasons and consequences of loneliness and its relationship with possible risk factors.","['Covid-19 pandemic', 'loneliness', 'psychological distress', 'childhood trauma', 'mistrust', 'living situation']"
Students in Lockdown: The Effects on Depression and Suicide Ideation as Moderated by Loneliness,"Wossidlo, Lotte","['Mouthaan, J.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: The lockdown that ensued the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted people’s mental health, the extent of which still needs to be further investigated. Young people and students are generally more susceptive and vulnerable to developing depression and suicide ideation. This study focused on the specific sample of university students. The student’s living situation (living alone vs. living with other people) and their perceived loneliness was assessed to determine the lockdown’s impact on their mental health, specifically on depressive symptoms and suicide ideation. Methods: A survey including Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck’s Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) and the De Jong-Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS) was sent out to students of Leiden University at two different time points in March 2020 (N=216) and during a follow-up in April and May 2021 (N=49).The data of 49 participants was analysed using paired samples t-tests and multiple linear regression analyses. Results: there was a significant increase in mean BSS scores (p = 0.020, M2020: 0.7 and mean2021:1.8), but not in mean BDI scores (p = 0.454, M2020:10.3 and M2021: 10.9). Adding living alone vs. living with people as another predictor in a regression analysis yielded non-significant results (BDI: p = 0.842; BSS: p = 0.716). The interaction between living alone and the scores on the DJGLS were also not significant (BDI: change in R2 =0.008 & p = 0.541; BSS: change in R2 = 0.045 & p = 0.089). Discussion: The results suggest that over the period of the lockdown the student’s mental health problems, specifically suicide ideation, increased. However, loneliness and the living situation did not impact the difference in scores. Both the universities and the appropriate governmental authorities should take action to support this vulnerable population. What specific aspect of the lockdown influenced the results needs further studies. Future research should additionally aim to severely increase the sample size as well as studying the long-term effects of this pandemic on students mental health.",
The impact of childhood maltreatment on adult inflammation and the role of social support and loneliness as moderators in this relationship,"Kohl, Julia","['Tollenaar, M.S.', 'Sieh, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Childhood maltreatment has been linked to higher risks for poorer health in adulthood with elevated levels of inflammatory markers as a potential mechanism explaining this link. Close social relationships might buffer against the negative consequences of stress, such as childhood maltreatment, on immune function. Research objective: This study aimed at investigating the association between childhood maltreatment and adult inflammation and the role of loneliness and social support as potential moderators in this relationship. Methods: Data from the 3G study (Buisman et al., 2020) with a multi-informant multigeneration cross-sectional design was used. In total, a sample of 113 adult individuals who provided saliva samples for IL-6, IL-8, TNF-⍺, and IFN- analyses and completed self-report questionnaires about loneliness, social support, and experienced childhood maltreatment in the first 18 years of life was included in the analyses. Results: Childhood maltreatment did not predict the inflammatory markers IL-6, IL-8, TNF-⍺, and IFN-. Further, loneliness and social support did not moderate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and adult inflammation. Conclusion: Future research is needed to investigate the role of social support and loneliness as potential moderators in the association between childhood maltreatment and adult inflammation. Several implications for future research are discussed that will help to establish interventions that aim at reducing the risks for poorer health in adults with a history of childhood maltreatment.",
Safe Space at Leiden University: Agency Behind and Beyond 'the Veil' (Du Bois) for People of Colour and LGBT+,"Boomsma, Rixt","['Pels, P.', 'Suidgeest, K.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This research project about the construction of safe space for people of colour and LGBT+ people at Leiden University utilizes the theory of W.E.B. Du Bois (1903) and his metaphor of 'the veil'. Even though there are diversity and inclusion policies in place at Leiden University, it does not necessarily feel like a safe environment for many people. This thesis aims to illustrate that for the diversity practitioners at Leiden University, students and staff, both private and public safe spaces play a role in establishing agency and empowerment under conditions of oppression. Private safe spaces (queer and coloured spaces 'behind the veil') are created by marginalized people for marginalized people – atmospheres where people can process racialized and sexualized experiences together. Public safe spaces (mixed spaces 'beyond the veil') are collaboratively created – atmospheres where people can be themselves and voice their opinions. Ideally, these spaces are experienced as 'brave space', where people feel comfortable enough and confident enough to contribute to the social setting. This thesis aims to explore safe space – both physical and emotional – and desires to contribute to a safe and inclusive learning and working environment at Leiden University.","['diversity and inclusion', 'LGBT+', 'people of colour', 'oppression', 'university']"
Building shame resilience in a financial context,"Hünd, Josephine","['Seip, E.', 'Dijk, W. van']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"People who are experiencing financial hardship often feel ashamed about their financial situation. This experienced shame prevents them from seeking contact with their creditor. A way to cope with this experienced shame is to build shame resilience. We built on shame resilience theory (Brown, 2006) by focusing on two elements: fostering connectedness and addressing shame. Participants were randomly assigned to the control condition or to the shame-resilience condition. In the control condition, participants read a standard creditor email. In the shame resilience condition, participants read an email that fostered connectedness and addressed shame. Our shame resilience email didn’t lead to a significant higher willingness to contact the helping organization or a decrease in avoidant tendencies. Our shame resilience email did lead to a significant decrease in shame. A practical implication of this is that we found a way to approach people experiencing (financial) shame, in order to reduce their shame.","['financial stress', 'perceived control', 'financial self-efficacy', 'problem-focused coping', 'debtor-creditor relationship']"

Risk and protective factors for adolescent stress,"Lindeijer, Kim","['Sieh, D.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Adolescent stress can yield both precipitating and perpetuating factors for internalizing and externalizing disorders. This cross-sectional Dutch study examined possible risk and protective factors to find a predictive model for adolescent stress. We hypothesized that mental and/or physical illness in the family, incomplete family composition and financial problems were possible risk factors for adolescent stress. Further, we expected that being religious, having a positive parental relationship and being part of a social group were possible protective factors for adolescent stress. This study included 13,411 participants (52% female, mean age 14.2) completing the Health Monitor Youth 2019 of the Community Health Service North and East Gelderland. Linear regression analyses indicated that having a family member with a mental and/or physical illness, incomplete family composition and having financial problems negatively correlated with adolescent stress. Also, having a good parental relationship positively correlated with adolescent stress. No significant relationship was found between being part of a social group or degree of religious beliefs and adolescent stress. In comparison with males, females reported higher amounts of adolescent stress. With respect to interaction effects, familial illness appeared to affect females more than males. Lower education level and higher age were related to higher amounts of adolescent stress. The results suggest that health care professionals and teachers that come in contact with adolescents should pay special attention to the abovementioned risk and protective factors, so possible interventions can be implemented promptly.",
The link between harm expectancy violation and change in PTSD symptoms during exposure therapy,"Tesarova, Monica","['Tollenaar, M.', 'Kleine, R. de']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"After decades of widely studying fear habituation as a mechanism of change in exposure therapy, the focus seems to be shifting towards harm expectancy violation through which new non-threat associations are acquired. Expectancy violation has found a more consistent support in modern literature, but it has not yet been sufficiently investigated as a mechanism or a marker of change in exposure, when treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Understanding what drives change could facilitate designing effective interventions that would improve exposure outcome, and high dropout or non-response rates, that are often accompanying PTSD treatment. The aim of this master thesis was to explore the relationship between harm expectancy violation, within and between the first two exposure sessions, and change in PTSD symptoms, after these two sessions and post-treatment, as measured by PCL. To put these relationships into perspective, predictive value of fear habituation indices in relation to the outcome was also assessed; and further, it was evaluated whether expectancy violation and habituation act as separate constructs when standing together. Results have shown that early indices of between-session expectancy violation and within-session fear habituation had a significant, though weak, relationship to early treatment outcome, while acting as separate predictors. However, this study has not found any of the early indices of expectancy violation or fear habituation to be indicative of the end-of-treatment outcome. Furthermore, it points to limitations regarding measuring harm expectancies and provides recommendations for future research.","['harm expectancy violation', 'fear habituation', 'exposure therapy', 'PTSD']"
The influence of depressive symptoms on the relationship between sleep quality and psychological stress response,"Janssen, Hanneke","['Wolters, F.', 'Van Houdt, C.A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: The present study aims to better understand possible multidirectional interactions between depressive symptoms, sleep quality and stress response. Although a significant amount of research has been done studying the effect of sleep quality and depression on stress response, they provided mixed results and showed large methodological differences. We extend previous research by testing three hypotheses: (a) Poor sleep leads to increased stress responses; (b) Higher levels of depressive symptoms lead to increased stress responses; and (c) The effect of minimal levels of depressive symptoms on stress reactivity is greater for individuals with poor sleep. Method: In 46 participants (69,60% female; 18–29 years), we assessed sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (and depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a psychosocial stress task, was used to induce moderate stress in a controlled environment in order to assess stress reaction. Results: Participants with poorer sleep quality did not have elevated salivary cortisol response after being exposed to a social stressor compared to participants with better sleep quality. Also, no proof was found for (minimal) depressive symptoms being a predictor of salivary cortisol response to psychosocial stress. The results further indicated that individuals with poor sleep quality did not experience a greater effect of (minimal) depressive symptoms on stress reactivity. Conclusion: No support was found for a role of sleep quality and depressive symptoms in cortisol stress response. Future research should take person- and situation-specific characteristics into account when analyzing cortisol responses to psychological stress.","['stress', 'stress response', 'cortisol', 'sleep quality', 'depressive symptoms']"
A cross-sectional study on age- and gender-related changes in the extent to which self-esteem depends on social evaluation,"Bendt, Luisa","['De Rover, M.', 'Jansen, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this study was to test whether state self-esteem shows stronger fluctuations in response to social feedback in adolescents compared to young adults, and more female than in male participants. A social evaluation paradigm was used on 261 participants between the ages of 12 and 38. It included the creation of an online profile, on which participants received approval, disapproval or no feedback and then reported on their state self-esteem. We hypothesized that adolescents would show greater state self-esteem fluctuations than adults, that women and girls would show greater fluctuations than men and boys, and that this gender difference would peak during adolescence. Results showed no evidence for an effect of age. However, there was a significant effect of gender, where women and girls showed consistently stronger state self-esteem fluctuations in response to approval or disapproval than men and boys. Additionally, in an exploratory t-test, adolescents showed greater drop of state self-esteem when receiving no feedback, compared to adults, who did not significantly differ from their self-esteem baseline. Limitations include low power on certain tests, unequal sample sizes paired with unequal variances, experimental differences and lower ecological validity due to the use of an online profile. Our results imply that within the age range we tested, containing mainly older adolescents and younger adults, the two groups might show relatively similar state self-esteem responses to social approval and disapproval. Adolescents might react more negatively to not receiving feedback. Girls and women seem to react more strongly to social feedback.",

Does dispositional optimism modulate the relationship of fibromyalgia disease duration and disability with the magnitude of nocebo hyperalgesia?,"Franke, Joy","['Van Laarhoven, A.I.M.', 'Karacaoglu, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Nocebo hyperalgesia (pain worsening after a sham treatment) is found in both healthy and clinical populations, induced by classical conditioning and verbal suggestions. This study experimentally investigated the magnitude of nocebo hyperalgesia in patients with fibromyalgia, fibromyalgia disease duration and disability as predictors of nocebo hyperalgesia, and the moderating effect of dispositional optimism, to identify risk factors for nocebo effects in these patients. Thirty-one adult female patients were included in the experiment, in which classical conditioning and verbal suggestions were implemented to experimentally induce nocebo hyperalgesia. In the learning phase, moderately painful pressure stimuli, administered on the thumbnail, were paired with sham device activation (experimental trials), slightly painful pressure stimuli with sham device deactivation (control trials). In the testing phase, slight pain intensity was administered in both experimental and control trials. Participants rated pain intensities after each stimulus on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale. Higher average pain intensity ratings for experimental trials compared to control trials in the testing phase indicated nocebo hyperalgesia (NH). Duration of fibromyalgia diagnosis was calculated in years (YOD), disability from fibromyalgia was assessed with the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and dispositional optimism with the Life Orientation Test- Revised (LOT-R), collected at baseline. Included covariates were baseline pain intensity levels and age. There was a trend towards nocebo effects, although not significant. Both YOD (R 2 = .083) and FIQ (R 2 = .111) were not found to be significant predictors of NH. The interaction effect between YOD and LOT-R (R 2 change = .029), and between FIQ and LOT-R (R 2 change = .008) did not significantly change these outcomes. The non-significant findings might be explained by the small sample size, and a safe controlled laboratory environment. It should be further investigated whether personality and clinical characteristics affect nocebo outcomes, to individualize treatment strategies and minimize nocebo effects in clinical treatments.",

The sudden change of working from home causes blurry boundaries between work and non-work life and, therefore, has an impact on work-life balance. This study provides insight into the possible effect of boundary control on employee’s well-being who are working from home. The present paper investigated the interaction between job demands and job control in relation to emotional exhaustion. Subsequently, the study investigated the possible moderating effect of boundary control on this relationship. An online questionnaire, based on the Leiden Quality of Work Questionnaire (LQWQ), The Work-Life Indicator, and the Utrecht Burnout School (UBOS-A), was distributed among employees who performed their work from home (N=151). To test the four hypotheses, a hierarchical regression analysis was performed. Contrary to the hypotheses, the interaction between job demands and job control did not predict emotional exhaustion nor boundary control. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that boundary control moderates the relationship of the interaction between job demands, job control, and emotional exhaustion. However, no moderating effect of boundary control was found within this study. This study did find a relationship between boundary control and emotional exhaustion. To conclude, this paper showed that having low boundary control is related to higher levels of emotional exhaustion. However, these results should be interpreted with some caution, due to the low reliability and validity of boundary control. Based on these results, strengths, limitations, suggestions for future research, and practical implications were proposed.",

Underrepresentation of Women in Cardiac Rehabilitation and Referral Strategies to Promote Enrollment: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Ehmer, Maren","['Reijnders, T.', 'Van der Doef, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Research has shown that cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reduces morbidity, mortality, and unplanned hospital admissions. In addition, improvements in exercise capacity, quality of life, and mental health were reported. However, women are substantially less likely to be referred to CR and are additionally less likely to enroll when they are referred. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review about potential barriers which women face when entering CR. Underlying factors causing underrepresentation of women in CR are multifactorial and consist of individual-, healthcare provider- , and system-level factors. Individual-level factors which negatively influence enrollment rates are, for example, disease related factors and demographics, including older age. On a systemic level, for instance, a lack of health insurance financial coverage for the CR program deterred women from enrolling. One healthcare provider factor is the characteristics of CR programs, since some women were reluctant to enroll in CR due to the high intensity exercising. A meta-analysis about the effectiveness of strategies aiming to improve enrolment rates of women was performed. The risk ratio analysis did not yield clear evidence for suitable referral strategies for women to improve enrollment rates. However, two studies showed that coaching and motivational interviewing strategies can increase enrolment rates among female CVD patients. According to an event rate analysis, implementing an adequate referral strategy such as peer navigation, in combination with coaching as well as the combined peer navigation, automatic, and coaching strategy could facilitate overcoming barriers which are particularly challenging for female patients. An examination of current standards of care in each health care system or country is needed, followed by addressing the aforementioned multifactorial level barriers and the implementation of suitable referral strategies.","['cardiovascular disease', 'cardiac rehabilitation', 'underrepresentation of women', 'gender', 'health care access', 'referral strategies', 'enrollment']"

Stress & Approach Biases Towards Food,"Vasilias, Kyriakos","['Zech, H.', 'Giffin, M.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This paper examined the effects of stress on the approach and avoidance tendencies of a sample of university students. High levels of stress have been linked to a variety of health burdens, including unstable and unhealthy dieting which, in turn, can lead to weight problems such as overweight or underweight. In both cases, the overarching theme in literature is that stress increases consumption of comfort food. In this study, an approachavoidance explanatory pathway was taken to examine this effect of stress. ApproachAvoidance Tasks (AAT) have been successfully utilized in previous studies to examine the attraction or repulsion towards food stimuli in typical and clinical populations. In this study, a mobile AAT was used to collect the participants’ responses to food and object (control) stimuli. It was hypothesized that (a) an approach bias would be shown for food and (b) comfort food cues. Furthermore, (c) the Body Mass Index (BMI) scores and (d) stress scores would predict an approach bias towards comfort food cues. An approach bias was found both for food and comfort food cues. However, BMI and stress scores did not predict an approach bias towards comfort food. The implications of these findings are discussed.",

What may facilitate social inclusion in mainstream education? Intrapersonal characteristics of close friends of deaf and hard of hearing children,"Oldenburg, Eline","['Rieffe, C.', 'Eichengreen, A.']",2021,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Since the implementation of inclusive education, studies have shown that deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students are at risk for being socially isolated in their classrooms. Peer-factors hypothesized to relate to social inclusion of DHH students (prosocial empathy, self-compassion and attitudes towards children with disabilities) were investigated through self-report questionnaires that were administered in mainstream classes with DHH students (total n = 249). Interviews were conducted with 18 close friends of the DHH students to explore their attitudes about differences between children, inside and outside of the context of friendships. Prosocial empathy, self-compassion and attitudes, as measured by self-reports, were compared between close friends of DHH students and other classmates, resulting in no significant differences between the groups. The interviews with close friends were analyzed through thematic analysis, resulting in three superordinate themes. The first superordinate theme focused on differences between oneself and one’s friends, and included differences not having an effect on the friendship, the effect of having different hobbies on a friendship and having friends who act or look different. The second superordinate theme focused on the differences between children in general such as; looking different, behaving differently and having a disability, and how other people might judge you when you have a different look. It also included not minding if someone is different and being ok with someone looking different from others. The third superordinate theme focused on the differences between oneself and others in looks, behavior and interests and it also included not feeling different from others and feeling negative emotions because of being different. Findings suggested close friends of DHH children to find hobbies and play to be of high importance in friendships. Close friends of DHH children also appeared to be accepting of differences in physical appearance. These findings should be taken into consideration by schools and teachers when managing mainstream classes with DHH students by encouraging social activities between DHH students and other classmates through more active guidance of playtime in class and during breaks.",
