The Social Credit System and China’s Image in the Netherlands: Deconstructing Discursive Communication through a Micro-Macro storytelling account,"Sizoo, Isaura","[""Ingrid D'Hooghe""]",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"With China’s increased economic growth there is a greater interest towards China’s foreign policy strategies. For example, questions arise on how this new power acts in the international sphere, or how it intends to adhere to the international order. Alongside these questions an upsurge in discussions on “Chinese Soft Power” is detected. This article investigates Chinese Soft Power developments in the Netherlands, by analyzing the discussion over the advancement of the Chinese Social Credit System (SCS); within Dutch news sources. A Constructivist approach is adopted, using discourse analysis, as the SCS is discussed as a micro-story that contributes to an audience’s interpretation on macro-structural processes in China. The research therefore sets out to analyze the complexity of storytelling, exploring how narratives are driven by a web of contexts. A number of topically linked narratives in China’s Soft Power are selected and analyzed, focusing on how they articulate China’s identity from a recipient standpoint. The thesis contributes to the academic field of International Relations by explaining how actors give Soft Power narratives meaning and interpretation, confirming how the Netherlands looks at China; and how the SCS further impacts this image. The thesis therefore aims to give more insight in how Chinese Soft Power is built up, deconstructing the communication processes between the China and the Netherlands.","['Soft Power, China, Constructivism, Netherlands, Social Credit System']"

Through his activities with the music and performance group Mambesak, Ap challenged the Indonesian state’s hegemonic ‘Unity in Diversity’ framework, giving voice to Papuan agency and demands for autonomy in the face of cultural assimilation, resource extraction, and extrajudicial violence. Moreover, by tracing Ap’s legacy across transnational print and activist networks, we observe how the indigenous affinities and inalienable connection with the land espoused in his music was incorporated into regional discourses of kastom and wantokism, facilitating grassroots solidarity in the face of formal diplomatic deadlock. In turn, these early initiatives laid the groundwork for contemporary renewal of the West Papuan independence movement through the ‘Pacific Renaissance’ of the 2010s, sustaining the spirit of Ap’s rooted, decolonial cultural practice.","['WEST PAPUA, DECOLONISATION, INDIGENEITY, CULTURAL RESISTANCE']"

The Alienation of a Nation: The Effect of the EU’s LGBT Rights Aspirations on the Position of Poland as an Internal ‘Other’,"Vijftigschild, Merlyn","['Witty, Thijs']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, multiple Eastern European countries found a sense of safety in becoming member states of the European Union (EU). While this ensured a novel form of European unification, this process also caused division, as the EU’s interests do not always align with those of its member states. Whereas the EU has a certain mission, its attempts to unify the European continent result in various forms of conflict, as focusing on supranational matters leaves room for domestic issues to exist and escalate. This thesis examines the identity struggle of the EU that results from the conservative EU member state Poland not conforming to the EU’s constructed role of protector for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) individuals. This thesis aims to explore the effect of the EU’s LGBT Rights Aspirations on the Position of Poland as an internal ‘Other’. By recognizing the EU as a normative power and by using the concept of the relational Self/Other binary as part of the Othering process, it looks into the interrelationship between the EU and Poland, regarding the overarching theme of LGBT equality. A case study on the documentary ‘Invasion’, as part of the 2019 election campaign in Poland, is used to observe how Poland’s leading political party sees the LGBT community as an Other, combining this view with the supranational normative power that the EU imposes on its member states regarding LGBT rights. Additionally, the thesis addresses how the notion of the EU as a collective LGBT-friendly Self positions conservative Poland as an Other within EU borders.","['LGBT rights', 'European integration', 'right-wing populism', 'Self/Other binary', 'identity politics', 'normative power']"

Vanuit kunsthistorische hoek wordt de betekenis van de pronkvogels onderzocht binnen het kader van het debat tussen twee kunsthistorici, te weten Svetlana Alpers (1936) en Eddy de Jongh (1931). E. de Jongh betoogt dat de 17de -eeuwse kunst bekeken moet worden in het licht van symbolische en verborgen betekenissen. Daarentegen betoogt Svetlana Alpers dat de 17de -eeuwse kunst een afbeelding is van de visuele contemporaine cultuur en dat er niet altijd iets achter gezocht moet worden. Daarnaast wordt de betekenis van de pronkvogels gezocht in de tradities van de 17 de -eeuwse tafelcultuur (afb.1, afb.2).","['pronkvogels', 'maaltijdstillevens', 'Pieter Claesz.', 'tafelcultuur', 'visuele cultuur']"

The Drug Trade and Corruption in Mexico: The Impact of the Drug Trade and Drug Violence on Mexico's Pervasive Corruption,"Scott, Asia",['Dr Rebeca Fernández Rodríguez'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Mexico has long struggled with widespread corruption, from low-level, daily bribes to avoid a ticket, to presidential scandals and electoral fraud. The academic community has generated significant debate as to why Mexico has experienced such rampant corruption, particularly since the 1980s. Through a qualitative analysis of the academic literature, this thesis has identified several factors for further investigation, looking into their role in driving the ongoing corruption in the country. Through examination of the economic situation, the democratisation process, and the drug trade and its subsequent violence, this paper argues that the poor economic situation over recent decades has driven the high levels of corruption in Mexico. The economic circumstances that many people; citizens and officials alike, have found themselves in, have created situations prone to corruption as a means of maintaining status or improving ones standing in society. This research aims to provide a starting point for further understanding of the causes of corruption and therefore what measures may be taken to tackle these issues.",

Sustaining the status quo: the commitment to sustainability of Ecuador’s Plan Nacional para el Buen Vivir 2013-2017,"Kroese, Marijn","['Fernández Rodríguez, R']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Buen Vivir, an alternative development model based on indigenous Andean knowledge, focuses on sustainability, equality, and identity. The Ecuadorian constitution implemented the concept in 2008 and it was at the centre of the country’s development plan in the period 2013 to 2017. This thesis asks: to what extent does Ecuador’s Plan Nacional para el Buen Vivir 2013– 2017 show a commitment to sustainability? To answer this, a critical discourse analysis is conducted on the writings of two concepts that are related to sustainability: (1) extractivism, the extraction of natural resources for export purposes, and (2) indigenous rights, since the protection of indigenous people has a positive effect on the environment. This analysis concludes that the writings related to extractivism and indigenous rights are vague, abstract, and do not go into detail about achieving their policies. As such, the Plan Nacional demonstrates that it deems the economy and society more important than the environment. These findings were then linked to the three types of sustainability as presented by prof. Jianguo Wu (Wu 2013): Triple Bottom Line, weak sustainability, and strong sustainability. By comparing the findings to each type of sustainability, it becomes evident that Ecuador performs weak sustainability, which is in turn a weak commitment to sustainability.",['Buen Vivir – Ecuador – Plan Nacional para el Buen Vivir 2013-2017 – critical discourse analysis – sustainability']

"""Green Mountains Are Gold Mountains"" How the Chinese Government Views the Role of Public Participation in Environmental Management","Greven, Julianne Rosalie",['Dr Adam Knight'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“How to respond to climate change and revive the world economy are challenges of our times that we must meet” (Nikkei Asia 2021). These words were part of the written speech that Xi Jinping sent to the World Leaders Summit at the 26th Conference of the Parties in 2021. Climate change is the crux of many countries and their governments all over the world, directly and indirectly affecting not only people and their livelihoods and prospects, but also processes such as economic development and social stability. Especially the Chinese Communist Party, which has underpinned its legitimacy partially with economic growth, is realizing that the quality of its environment needs to be improved if it wants to safeguard its authority and security. A tool that many democratic governments use to streamline their environmental management is public participation, but China as an authoritarian state does not always boast the institutions necessary to guide such activities. Nevertheless, grassroots forms of participation are present, and the Chinese civil society is always assessing the permissible boundaries of its involvement. To ensure the environment is managed in such a way that the desired economic growth is still possible, the Chinese government is experimenting with forms of public participation. Therefore, this thesis looks at how the Chinese government views public participation in environmental governance. Using a comparative analysis of two case studies, it is concluded that the government is appraising new channels of participation in the management and improvement of the country’s environment. Despite this, public participation is still viewed as a threat to the stability of the state's security and is still harshly prohibited.","['climate change', 'environmental management', 'public participation', 'authoritarianism', 'Chinese government']"

Latest natural gas discoveries in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea have prompted many to wonder whether natural resources might help the area to reach peace and prosperity. However, the recent tensions and navy confrontations reveal that competition extends beyond the race for energy. By focusing on the 2018 energy dispute between the Republic of Cyprus (in alliance with Greece) and Turkey, this thesis paper examines the fluctuations of geopolitical strategies in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as their influence on regional cooperation and the new foreign relations realities between the competing regional powers. What impact do regional and international powers' actions and policies have on regional security? Does the discovery of energy resources lead to closer cooperation or increased competition? This thesis paper looks beyond the economic importance of energy resources and analyses the energy problem in the Mediterranean Sea as primarily a geopolitical and strategic one, with economics playing a secondary role.","['Cyprus', 'Turkey', 'Eastern Mediterranean', 'Energy Security', 'Regional Cooperation']"

Hodges Supreme Court ruling that legalized LGBTQI+ marriage within the United States. Since then, academics have worked to analyze the social, political, and cultural contexts that contributed to the ruling and rulings related to LGBTQI+ marriage. However, when considering the evolution of media framing relating to LGBTQI+ marriage in the period surrounding the landmark ruling, there is a noticeable paucity of contemporary research. Through the use of computer-aided tools (natural language processing, linguistic sentiment analysis) that allow the collection of data relating to the change in language use within articles relating to LGBTQI+ marriage, I aim to quantitatively model the development of media framing relating to LGBTQI+ marriage in the period of 2010-2020. Humanities-based reasoning will then be employed in the discussion of these results in order to contextualize them within the wider social, political, and cultural context of the LGBTQI+ marriage debate. The aim of this thesis is therefore to identify how language use within print-based media coverage of LGBTQI+ marriage changed from 2010 to 2020.","['Same-sex marriage, framing, text mining, sentiment analysis, collocation']"

The bakvisroman as a snapshot of social change, 1894-1921","Dingemans, Maartje","['Janse, M.J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis makes a case for literature as a legitimate historical source and argues that literature provides a historical snapshot of social change. The Dutch bakvisroman, a girls’ book about rebellious girls who are partially tamed at the end of the story, is selected as a case study. The research question therefore is: How does the Dutch bakvisroman negotiate social change from 1894-1921? First, it is analysed via close reading how five such books deal with accepted, controversial and unaccepted gender and class norms - Tine van Berken’s Een Klaverblad van Vier (1894) and De Dochters van den Generaal (1897); Top Naeff’s Schoolidyllen (1900); and Cissy van Marxveldt’s De H.B.S.-Tijd van Joop ter Heul (1919) and Joop ter Heul’s Problemen (1921). How the books are a product of social change is explored by looking into the lives of the women writers, analysing their gender and class attitudes. Lastly, how the books are an agent of social change is explained by discussing the readers’ experience, delving into its reception by pedagogues, but also its reception by girls and boys via memoirs and diaries. By historicising the books, it becomes clear why the bakvisromans perpetuate class norms while being ambivalent towards gender norms, as well as what readers actually internalised from the books.","['Literature', 'Girlhood', 'Gender', 'Class', 'Netherlands', 'Bakvisroman', ""Girls' books"", 'Women Writers']"

The focus of this paper is particularly on the success of law 19.122 in the three governmental branches of the state from years 2014-2020. Having been passed in 2013, the abovementioned law was one of the first of its kind in Latin America and interpreted as being of a pioneering nature due to its national wide approach. Nevertheless, the success of these policies are yet to be seen, which has brought many academics to criticize its implementation or rather lack thereof. Monica Olaza along with other authors attribute the unsuccessful nature of this law to the lack of institutional tools provided for its enforcement. This paper will provide further investigation into the quota compliance rates, particularly of the three governmental branches. The conclusions derived from this paper coincide with a large part of the academic debate around the implementation of law 19.122 by stating that the quotas are not being respected by the three governmental branches with compliance rates below 50% for all branches.",

Believing that these issues evidence the need for alternative epistemologies able to overcome the limits of anthropocentric thought, this research will propose the ontology of ecocentrism as a theoretical background capable of promoting and sustaining socioecological recovery in the region. Specifically, the core of the research will revolve around how ecocentric policies could foster ecological and social restoration in the Niger Delta. After having delved into an analysis of the chosen ecocentric theoretical framework, as well as the historical and environmental specificities of the Delta’s context, two ecocentric proposals will be investigated. Firstly, the legal notion of ecocide will be presented as a pathway able to strengthen the rights of local ecosystems and of their components and inhabitants. Secondly, the concept of permaculture and its practical value will be discussed as tools capable of improving the ecological, agricultural and economic condition of the region. Building on these arguments, the concluding chapter will evaluate the enunciated proposals to confirm the initial hypothesis that ecocentrism could concretely benefit the region in the considered areas of study.",

This paper deciphers the concept of energy security, linking the environmental sustainability as a new dimension to the energy security discourse with the main objective of examining the Moroccan Solar Plan, looking specifically at the Nooro solar complex as a case study, to determine whether it can contribute to increasing a nation’s energy security. Utilizing renewable energy as an alternative to fossil fuel energy production, can be profitable to a country depending on their global position. In the case of Morocco, a country that in 2009, had a recorded 95% of its energy imported, was in dire need for a change. Its implementation of the Moroccan Solar Plan has proven to be successful on three different geographical levels; the local, national and international level. With the use of this case study, this paper can be used as an example for local and regional decision making and national policy-making reforms in the energy sector of nations, to obtain a more environmentally sustainable, independent and secure energy system.",

Adaptable Authoritarian Regimes: Scrutinising Al Sisi's Dictatorial Comeback in the Light of the Authoritarian Resilience Debate,"Radeck, Mats","['Yenen, A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Authoritarian resilience, a concept mostly debated within the context of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA region), describes the durability and strengths of authoritarian regimes in resisting the pressure of democratisation. Both authoritarian consolidation, referring to the employment of authoritarian tactics by a regime to increase its stability, as well as the related sub-concept of authoritarian adaptation, meaning learning processes of a regime and respective adjustment of these authoritarian tactics in the wake of challenges to a regime, are crucial to the understanding of the debate on authoritarian resilience. Drawing on scholarship on this debate, most notably the theoretical conceptualisations by Göbel, who classified the tactics for authoritarian regime survival into despotic, infrastructural, and discursive powers, I develop a theoretical framework for regime consolidation in the wake of popular discontent and protest. Applying the framework to the case study of the authoritarian Al-Sisi regime in Egypt shows how the regime adapted its tactics to consolidate in the light of the challenges of popular discontent and protest and ultimately survived. This underscores the significance of the concept of authoritarian consolidation to authoritarian resilience. Furthermore, it substantiates how the skilful and well-integrated application of authoritarian adaptation contributes to authoritarian stability. Therefore, such an analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of authoritarian regime dynamics and the concept of authoritarian resilience.","['Egypt', 'Authoritarian Regimes', 'Al Sisi', 'Autocracy', 'Dictatorship', 'Consolidation', 'Adaptation', 'Challenge', 'Regime', 'Coercion']"

Strong trade unions: Exploring their sufficient or necessary condition for a successful just transition in coal phase-out projects,"Trujillo, Florencia","['M.Markert', 'N.Timmer']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Just transition is a challenging concept due to the diverse definitions that each stakeholder gives, including feminist groups, trade unions, non-governmental organizations, indigenous people, and philanthropic organizations. In the last decades, many coal mines and plants began to phase out due to global warming and workers were laid off. Consequently, trade unions began to speak up to ask for a just transition for coal workers. In this way, this thesis aims to investigate if strong trade unions are a sufficient condition for a successful just transition or if there are other conditions necessary. In the literature, some scholars evaluate that strong trade unions played a crucial role in just transition in the coal sector; other scholars consider that socio-economic context and the part of the government boosted this transition. A mixed-method analysis will be conducted to explore the thesis research question. Firstly, it will be conducted a comparative analysis of just transition outcomes in twelve countries. Secondly, Poland, as an outlier case study, will be assessed. The results suggest that trade unions are not a sufficient condition for a successful just transition. Still, it is necessary to evaluate it with state involvement and socio-economic policies.","['Just transition, coal phase-out, trade unions']"

CROSS-ADOPTION OF GENDERED KINSHIP TERMS IN KOREAN,"Vik, Oda Amalie Rogne","['Alves Vieira, E.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"An essential part of communication in Korean involves a set of rigorously gendered, family-derived kinship terms which are used when referencing or addressing any slightly older peer. These terms – oppa (older brother of a woman), hyeong (older brother of a man), eonni (older sister of a woman) and nuna (older sister of a man) – can be “adopted” across gender identities to manipulate the social and communicative relations between speaker and addressee. This thesis posits that they can also be used unconventionally as a way of negotiating and expressing to negotiate and express identity. An online questionnaire surveying attitudes and perceptions of such “cross-adoption” (Kim 1999) is used as a way to gain insights into how successfully identity and gender expression can be negotiated and to what extent this kind of linguistic behaviour is perceived as indexical of LGBT identities. Said questionnaire also offers insights into other views that Korean speakers tend to have about speech scenarios where cross-adoption occurs. One of the main findings is that there is a difference depending on whether the “adopted” kinship term is traditionally used in same-gender communication (hyeong and eonni) or mixed-gender communication (oppa and nuna), and argues that the former is used to negotiate peer-like and platonic relations, while the latter is perceived to be an expression of personal identity.","['generalised kinship terms', 'language attitudes', 'perceived identities']"

Seen from the theoretical perspective of knowledge as a power-increasing commodity, the melting Arctic becomes a site of non-violent power struggle through scientific, economic and political means. This paper observes China's increasing role in the region through these avenues as it seeks to influence Arctic governance, despite not being an Arctic state. In addition to a general overview, a case study of Chinese state and non-state actors' activities in Norway's Arctic region seeks to further illustrate the ties between science, economics, and politics in the Arctic political landscape. Through a qualitative examination of secondary and primary sources, the paper concludes that the mutually beneficial ties between knowledge production and market expansion in the Arctic have the potential to aid a non-Arctic great power such as China in achieving political influence in the region.","['East Asia', 'China', 'Norway', 'the Arctic', 'geopolitics', 'political economy', 'science diplomacy', 'commodity frontiers']"

A Tryst with Hindutva: Secularism at Risk? On the relationship between the RSS and the politicization of religious identity in India,"Uljée, Maan",['Dr. Irene Hadiprayitno'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Around the globe, India is praised as a secular, democratic and pluralistic nation. However, the 2014 elections represented a watershed moment for politics and the saturation point for Hindutva in India. This thesis seeks to examine the developments around the politicization of religious identity in India and its consequences for constitutional secularism. This will be discussed against the background of the Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). This organization is omnipresent in India and has been engaged in a discursive struggle of establishing its vision of Hindutva as ideologically dominant. This modern political ideology, which can be regarded as the major form of Hindu nationalism, advocates the establishment of a Hindu nation. In recent times, the RSS has profoundly shaped Indian politics and society. Through the lens of social constructivism, this paper addresses the issue of “How the RSS has contributed to the politicization of religious identity in India through the propagation of Hindutva ideology since 2014” at the hand of two study cases, the Ayodhya dispute and the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act. It will also explain how the RSS makes use of highly selected narratives of the past, “Chosen Traumas,” to amplify the threat of an enemy and to mobilize a Hindu collective under the umbrella of Hindutva. The ruling Hindu right thereby revisits the very concept of India’s constitutional secularism, a type of secularism which is not anti-religious but respectful of all religious, for its non-secular agenda, placing secularism under serious threat.","['Hindutva', 'India', 'Identity politics', 'Secularism', 'Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)']"

Het Turkse onderwijs kampte al voor de pandemie met ernstige problemen, zoals kansenongelijkheid. Door kansenongelijkheid hadden sommige leerlingen geen toegang tot ICT-voorzieningen. Tijdens de pandemie werd er overgestapt naar het afstandsonderwijs, waardoor de verschillen in toegang tot technologie, oftewel de digitale kloof, verergerden. Alhoewel de digitale kloof impactvol was voor alle middelbare scholieren, was het mogelijk problematischer voor 12e-klassers. Zij bereidden zich namelijk voor op de toelatingstoets voor de universiteit. Er zijn echter geen onderzoeken die de gevolgen voor 12e-klassen in de context van de digitale kloof onderzoeken. Om dit (gedeeltelijk) tegemoet te komen, is een enquête gehouden. Uit de enquêteresultaten bleek dat onvoldoende technologische mogelijkheden het grootste obstakel vormde. Leerlingen konden hun lessen niet bijwonen of voortzetten door verbindingsproblemen met het netwerk/systeem, dat werd veroorzaakt door het ontbreken van een (stabiele) internetverbinding. De digitale kloof, en kansenongelijkheid, had aanzienlijk meer gevolgen voor leerlingen die in een dorp woonden, en/of naar openbare scholen gingen. Ook is geconstateerd dat door COVID-19 kansenongelijkheid is toegenomen, doordat sommige leerlingen privélessen kregen of naar een dershane gingen en anderen niet. Tot slot speelt ongelijkheid in onderwijskwaliteit tussen 12e-klassers van tijdens COVID, en 12e-klassers van voorgaande jaren.",
"From Monsters to Icons, from Silence to Loudness. The de-monsterification of gay men through the appearance and the performance of the Italian drag queen Croce Atroce.","Manzoni, Asya",['K. de Wild'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper explores an Italian contemporary reality: the rising drag scene, particularly in the city of Milan, and particularly at The Toilet Club. This paper will reflect on how the negative perception of gay men as monstrous figures is being deconstructed through the appearance and the performances of the drag queen Croce Atroce (1978). To understand the process of de-monsterification, it is necessary to understand when and how gay men started to be considered as monsters. Using Jeffrey Jerome Cohen’s monster theory as a theoretical framework, the hiv crisis will be identified as a relevant turning point for the monsterification of gay men in the common imaginary. After explaining the process of stigmatization that started in the 80s, the opposite process, that of de-stigmatization and de-monsterification, will be explored. Through an extensive visual analysis of the case study of the drag queen Croce Atroce, and the employment of an historical archive made of interviews, images and performances, the process of de-monsterification through drag will be researched. The results of this paper show the complexity of the Italian social and cultural scene, where matters of representation, education and communication play a crucial role. This research paper aims to contribute to the topic of de-stigmatization through the alternative form of art that is drag.","['hiv crises, monster theory, representation, queerness, drag.']"
Witnessing Conflict: Transitional Justice through the lenses and perceptions of Colombia’s war photographers,"Varda, Lidia LV",['Dr M.J. Schoenmakers-Klein Gunnewiek'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"It is only through the acknowledgement of a multitude of truths and perceptions that the myths that war perpetuates, and from which it has stemmed, can be deconstructed. This deconstruction is essential to reach the goals of transitional justice (TJ), the peace-building effort implemented by a state that has suffered human rights abuses owing to authoritarianism and war during its transition to democracy or after the signing of a Peace Agreement. Photographs that captured the times preceding such transition, might offer a testimony to the violence from which the state seeks to heal through TJ’s mechanisms. These mechanisms are aimed at repairing the profound damages that the country has suffered at legal, political, economic and societal levels (Díaz, 2018, 3-5). These images might offer fragments of evidence that could be adopted to hold perpetrators accountable and facilitate the construction of collective memory of the past. This thesis argues that when photography offers a representation of the conflict capturing its complexity and nuances, it might foment the understanding of its seeds and the nurturing of socio-political narratives to promote its non-recurrence. In this way, photography might contribute to TJ’s peacebuilding goal. By 2018, over 8 million people had officially been registered as victims of the Colombian conflict, which started in 1964 and is Latin America's longest war. Despite the signing of a Peace Agreement with the FARC in 2016 and the ambition to build peace in Colombia, this number is increasing through new waves of violence (Navarro, 2019, 290). Considering the country’s historical and contemporary context, this thesis aims to explore how Colombia's war photographers reflected and contributed to its transitional justice efforts. It will focus on the significant photographic works of Jesús Abad Colorado, Federico Ríos, and Stephen Ferry, produced between the 1990s and the post-2016 period. This research is inspired by two beliefs. First, considering Colombia’s forthcoming presidential elections and its candidates’ need for fomenting an effective peace process to end its violence, it is contemporarily relevant to understand the Colombian conflict (Sardiña, 2022). Second, war photography is not a mere objective reflection of conflict, but it is rather a mirror of the perceptions of image-makers on it. Consequently, their subjectivity is worth being researched as it crucially affects how conflicts are represented, remembered, and perhaps even resolved. 4 Chapter 1 reviews literature debating the connection between TJ, photography, conflict, and peace. Chapter 2 contextualises the Colombian conflict from the 1990s and the 2016 Peace Agreement (2.1 and 2.2), introduces the photographers that have documented it (2.3) and presents the qualitative methodology, i.e iconological analysis and interviews, used to analyse their works (2.4). The images used derive from the exhibition “El Testigo” (2020) by Jesús Abad Colorado, the book ""Verde"" (2021) by Federico Ríos and the book and exhibition ""Violentology: A Manual of the Colombian Conflict"" by Stephen Ferry (2012). Chapter 3 analyzes the images of the photographers, which are organized around the themes of violence (3.1), conflict's complexity (3.2) and armed actors (3.3). The conclusion of the thesis reflects on photography's potential as a tool for TJ.","['photography', 'transitional justice', 'Colombian war', 'Colombian conflict', 'art.']"

To begin with, this question will be discussed from the perspective of Just War Theory. The analysis will demonstrate that solely the jus in bello category of JWT, as opposed to jus ad bellum, is relevant for information warfare. Furthermore, scholar alternative ethical framework designed by Taddeo will be critiqued. According to Taddeo, the application of Just War Theory to information warfare causes a problem because physical harm and harm in the cyber domain are in different ontological domains. Her theory strives for ontological equality by merging information ethics with Just War Theory. However, our analysis will show that the resulting theory is unsatisfactory in several ways. As an alternative, I will suggest to distinguish four categories of harm and six forms of information warfare. These forms of information warfare can be associated with the categories of harm in order to determine to what extent jus in bello is suitable to assess the justifiability of IW attacks by looking at their consequences.",['Just War Theory Cyberwarfare Information Warfare Harm']

Lex semper dabit remedium: Incongruity between theory and practice in legal source doctrine in nineteenth-century France and The Netherlands,"Scholtens, Jaap",['H. te Velde'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to shed light on legal practice of the nineteenth century in France and The Netherlands and contrast it with legal theory and current historiography. In both older and newer French and Dutch historiography, the nineteenth century is described as the century of legalism, also referred to as exegetical thinking. This exegetical school of law considers the codified law to be the highest and practically the only source of law on which the judge and legal scholar must rely. This historiography is mainly based on the development of legal theory as practised at universities. Implicitly or sometimes even explicitly, legal practice is equated with this legal theory. This fallacy obscures the practice of law, which did not take place in the university or the chambers of scholars, but in the courtroom. To address this lacuna, the following question was answered: To what extent was legalism in the Netherlands and the exegetical school in France really the dominant approach in legal practice and how can possible differences between both countries be explained? In order to know the practice of law and to assess whether judges, like legal theorists, were under the spell of exegetical thinking, judgments of courts were analysed. These can be found in case law journals that emerged in the nineteenth century. This study looked specifically at the judges' references to case law; the work of colleagues. The reference to case law is contrary to the doctrine of the exegetical school which accepts codification as the sole source of law. Referral to sources of law outside the codification by the courts, either implicit or explicit, imply a freer attitude towards the codification than legal scholars of the nineteenth century and current historiography would have us believe. Analysis of approximately two thousand Dutch and French judgments throughout the nineteenth century showed a difference in the quantity and nature of the references between both countries. In France, judges themselves referred explicitly to specific case law or to case law in general, whereas in the Netherlands judges did not refer to case law themselves, but relied on the arguments of the litigants and the Advocate-General, who did explicitly invoke case law. My research gives cause to adjust the image of nineteenth century legal history. The nineteenth-century judge was a child of his time, but not a puppet of legal theory. Lex semper dabit remedium: The law always provides a remedy; this was the starting point, but case law often supplemented it.

Japan’s Immigration Policy and Public Opinion: A Case Study of the 2018 Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act Revision,"Dijkstra, Iris","['Black, L.O.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper analyses the role public opinion had in the revision of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act in 2018. Previously, the majority of the public felt economically and culturally threatened by foreign residents. Over time, this belief largely disappeared from the public’s consciousness and changed into a more receptive view of an increase of foreigners. Consequently, a majority of the public came to believe that an increase of unskilled foreign labourers to address Japan’s labour shortage was a satisfactory solution. Alleviating labour shortages would in turn strengthen Japan’s economy which was a priority for both the public and Prime Minister Abe. Having looked at both businesses and Abe as different actors in the revision, I found that thanks to Abe’s tight control over both the Diet and the Cabinet, the bill was approved by the Diet without Abe facing public backlash. Nonetheless, the public’s preference has not been attained as they wanted more deliberation time in the Diet. Therefore, public opinion and the 2018 revision are correlated, but it cannot be concluded that public opinion influenced the revision.","['demographic crisis', 'labour shortage', 'unskilled foreign labourers', 'public opinion', 'immigration policy', '2018 revision']"
Suicide Amongst Japanese Women on the Rise: About Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Motivations for Suicide,"Goorbergh, May van den","['Bausch, I.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Relevance Suicide amongst women in Japan is on the rise since a decline of twelve years. However, suicide amongst men has stayed fairly stable. The pandemic has caused many issues to emerge and enlarge. It may help to start and understand more about this increase when looking from a societal point of view. Objective To see what the troubles seem to be for women who think about committing suicide from a sociological point of view and if we can find and back up the reasons that make people more at risk of committing suicide. Methodology The statement of mental health, domestic violence and unemployment being the main drivers of increase in suicide, written in White Paper Reiwa 3, is our first building block. We will use the writings/works from sociologists and anthropologist, to build a framework around femininities and masculinities in Japan. Followed by recent data on suicide as well as writings and data on mental health, domestic violence and unemployment in Japan and more specifically amongst women. We will continue with looking at various casestudies that help to sketch a picture of the situation. Results and Discussion In our case studies we mostly found that loneliness was a big factor. However, it was interesting to see that work was a common denominator in many of the casestudies. Loneliness seemed to be a symptom. In many of the other cases it was economic stress, contradictory to earlier done research mostly applying economic distress as a predominantly male reason. Also societal pressures of what a women needs to accomplish and family obligations came to the forefront. However-so entertained with them also wanting to work. This thesis only sums up a very small amount of reasons and sheds light on just a fraction of everything that has to do with suicide. Other stories that came to the forefront when doing the research for this thesis were bullying in high schools and cyber bullying. With the last also pertaining a few celebrities that took their own lives in the past years. Conclusion It seems that economic distress for women has risen. Additively more women have jobs and because of the pandemic and relatively more women feeling the consequences of that pandemic, more women commit suicide. Because of Japans’ social history more women are being laid off.","['COVID-19 pandemic, suicide, employment, mental health, domestic violence']"

This paper tries to give a clearer view on moral enhancement and its possible connection to duties. This is done by researching the claim of Persson and Savulescu who say that moral enhancement should be a duty. Three important aspects will be analyzed to understand, criticize and expand on their argument. The first important aspect that will be covered is the justification that Persson and Savulescu give for moral enhancement to be a duty. It will be argued that this connection is weak and underdeveloped. I shall try to connect their argument to the Kantian duties of a duty to others and a duty to oneself to make this connection stronger and more clear. The second aspect is the defensibility of moral enhancement. Arguments from freedom of choice and mental freedom will be applied to the definition of moral enhancement of Persson and Savulescu. It will become clear that the main argument of the authors is less defendable against the arguments from mental freedom. The third aspect that will be analyzed is the content of moral enhancement. The moral attitudes of altruism and a sense of justice that the authors determine will be criticized. A possible alternative Kantian attitude will be proposed and criticized. This paper concludes that main argument of Persson and Savulescu can successfully be connected to Kantian duties. This connection is, however, not without problems.","['Moral enhancement', 'Kantain duties', 'moral motivation', 'moral attitudes', 'bioenhancement', 'mental freedom', 'freedom of choice.']"

This essay wishes, in the first place, to critically analyze current politics, as well as political moral theory, with regards to political (in)action with regards to climate change. In particular, if it is the case that moral theory could provide us with strong arguments for (proper) action against climate change, why is not enough being done? I will argue that many moralist theories are too ideal – i.e. too fact-insensitive – which causes a number of problems. In order to provide the necessary practical strength to political action against climate change, I will develop a non-ideal, realist argument for climate resilient development. In particular, I relate climate change policy to legitimacy of states such that, if states do not do enough to combat climate change, their very authoritative power is illegitimate. I will consider a few possible criticisms against this view, after which I will further developed this view from a cost-sensitive perspective, as well as from a global collective action perspective. It is my view that this realist perspective is both fact-sensitive and practice-focused enough to provide the necessary normative force to take proper action with regards to climate change.","['Climate change, future generations, legitimacy, political realism, political moralism, ideal theory, non-ideal theory, Williams']"

Crisiscommunicatie door het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken: Casestudie: hoe de Directie Communicatie tot een coronacrisisresponse op sociale media is gekomen,"Uden, Ludovicus Constantijn van",['J.P. Burger'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken stond voor een immense opgave: de coronacrisis. Tijdens die crisis heeft het ministerie crisiscommunicatie toegepast op sociale media. Crises komen vaak voor, over de hele wereld. Maar elke crisis is uniek. Daarom zijn er theorieën en modellen ontworpen die aangeven hoe te reageren op verschillende crises. Maar crises en de reacties daarop veranderen ook over tijd, bijvoorbeeld door de opkomst van online media. Om de theorieën up-to-date te houden zijn casestudies nodig. Dit onderzoek is zo’n casestudie. Er wordt via een kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethode onderzocht ‘Hoe de Directie Communicatie van het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken tot crisiscommunicatie is gekomen op haar sociale mediakanalen tijdens de eerste coronagolf, en in hoeverre die responsestrategie overeenkomt met de ideale reactie volgens de Situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) van Coombs.’ De onderzoeksvraag is aan de hand van een kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethode beantwoord. Dat is gedaan doormiddel van semigestructureerde interviews, die online zijn afgenomen. De respondenten krijgen daarin de kans om uit te weiden over zaken die zij belangrijk achten. Met deze manier van onderzoek is bijvoorbeeld wel iets te zeggen over de mening of attitude van de respondenten, maar is niks te zeggen over de inhoud van de crisiscommunicatie door het ministerie, en over hoe de crisiscommunicatie is ontvangen door stakeholders. De resultaten laten zien dat de respondenten op basis van expertise, met voorbereiding en een crisisplan, maar ook met onderbuikgevoel tot crisiscommunicatie zijn gekomen. En de respondenten hadden voornamelijk als doel de stakeholders snel te informeren. Dit komt in grote lijnen overeen met het gedachtegoed van Coombs. Toch waren er ook verschillen: de crisisresponse van de communicatiemedewerkers week bijvoorbeeld af van een ideale reactie volgens Coombs. Er werd bijvoorbeeld gecommuniceerd over successen terwijl stakeholders nog in gevaar waren en er werd niet of nauwelijks geëvalueerd na afloop van de crisis. Coombs had gelijk: er is niet een model te ontwerpen wat de ideale reactie op een crisis kan voorspellen. Er spelen zoveel factoren mee. Als laatste kan men dit onderzoek zien als een springplank voor uitgebreider vervolgonderzoek. Met een inhoudsanalyse kan nog onderzocht worden of de daadwerkelijke communicatie op sociale media geschikt was volgens Coombs. En met een online survey kan nog onderzocht worden of stakeholders de crisiscommunicatie van BZ op sociale media een geschikte response vonden.","['Crisiscommunicatie, Buitenlandse Zaken, Timothy Coombs']"

Transparantie als heilige graal? Experimenteel onderzoek naar het effect van transparantie op de geloofwaardigheid van nieuwsberichten en -bronnen en de invloed van betrokkenheid bij het onderwerp.,"Kannekens, Elsa",['Dr. A.R.J. Pleijter'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Dankzij digitale innovaties, sociaal-culturele ontwikkelingen en veranderingen in de Nederlandse journalistiek, is er een toegenomen behoefte aan transparantie in de journalistiek. In het wetenschappelijke discours wordt transparantie vaak gekoppeld aan geloofwaardigheid. Volgens het Dual Processing Model of Credibility Assesment zouden transparantiekenmerken namelijk als perifere aanwijzingen kunnen dienen om de informatiekwaliteit vast te stellen en mensen gaan vaak uit van zulke perifere aanwijzingen om de geloofwaardigheid van online-informatie te beoordelen. Op die manier zouden transparantie-elementen ervoor kunnen zorgen dat mensen het nieuwsbericht en de nieuwsbron geloofwaardiger vinden. In deze scriptie wordt dit door middel van een experiment getoetst. Daarnaast toetst deze scriptie of betrokkenheid bij het onderwerp van het nieuwsbericht, dit verband modereert. Volgens het principe van Hostile Media Perception zouden individuen die sterk betrokken zijn bij een kwestie, neutrale berichtgeving over deze kwestie namelijk eerder zien als vooringenomen tegen hun opvattingen. Dit zou de geloofwaardigheidsbeoordelingen van individuen kunnen beïnvloeden waardoor het effect van transparantie op geloofwaardigheid kleiner wordt. Uit de analyses is gebleken dat het toevoegen transparantiekenmerken aan een nieuwsbericht geen significant effect heeft op de geloofwaardigheidsbeoordelingen van zowel dit nieuwsbericht als de nieuwsbron. Ook betrokkenheid bij het nieuwsbericht blijkt niet van invloed te zijn om de geloofwaardigheidsbeoordelingen. Vervolgonderzoek moet aantonen of er een andere aanpak nodig is om de geloofwaardigheid van nieuwsberichten en nieuwsbronnen te verhogen.","['Journalistiek, transparantie, betrokkenheid']"

Camera of Dignity: Defying Colonial Climate Injustice Through an Ecocentric Representation of Eanan in Sámi Fourth Cinema,"Romeijn, Emma","['Houwen, J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Using a framework of Fourth Cinema, first constructed by Māori filmmaker Barry Barclay, this thesis explores the (historical) identity politics of the Sámi and employs an eco-critical approach to trace a bridge to climate politics. Fourth Cinema is a movement which empowers Indigenous people to take back control of their narrative and invites its audiences to envision an alternative to the Ecological Exotic Other constructed by Western colonial accounts. Whereas the roots of Fourth Cinema were first theorized in the 90s to strengthen Indigenous identity politics, it is now unquestionably intertwined with climate politics in the case of the Sámi. The cultural identity of the Sámi is so closely tied to their land that the increased threat of global warming is a direct assault on their social distinctiveness. Time and again the Sámi are at the forefront of climate change in the North. Consequently, Fourth Cinema meets ecocinema in the effort by Indigenous peoples to transmit their ways of knowing to a larger audience. Fourth Cinema is a space where the Sámi have the authority to voice their outlooks on environmental issues from the perspective of their values and traditional ways of knowing. At the core of this thesis is a study into the dialogue between ecocriticism and Fourth Cinema in Sámi film. The thesis’s focal hypothesis is that an eco-critical study of Sámi Fourth Cinema offers alternative outlooks to contemporary Nordic climate discussions and crises while simultaneously empowering cultural sovereignty to Sámi communities oppressed by colonial mechanisms of Othering.","['Fourth Cinema', 'Sámi', 'Ecocinema', 'Othering', 'Spectacle', 'Essentialism', 'Indigeneity', 'Indigenous Cinema']"
How we monitor our own thoughts: Inner speech and inner hearing,"Blokland, Dominique","['Sleutels, J.J.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis broadly reviews the current literature on voice-like thought. I observe two major lines of explaining the phenomenon of inner speech (‘the little voice inside our heads’), which are perception-based and action-based approaches. The former focuses on inner speech as an auditory experience, and the latter focuses on inner speech being an act of speaking. This thesis discusses a currently dominant action-based model on inner speech (the forward model). The model includes a theory of how errors in inner speech generation can lead to clinical symptoms commonly found in people diagnosed with schizophrenia, such as auditory verbal hallucinations (‘hearing voices’). The way I will approach the topic is to find key assumptions on which the forward model is based, and discuss the concepts used in these assumptions. I argue mainly that inner hearing as a concept should be considered in further developing the model, and that the definitions of sense of agency, sense of ownership, intention, and source-monitoring need to be sharpened. This review aims to contribute to mapping our verbal mental experiences and their interrelations, which will ultimately be useful in clinical contexts. Hence, this work is meant to guide future research projects and inspire ongoing discussion about our verbal mental experiences.","['Inner speech', 'Inner hearing', 'Auditory verbal hallucinations', 'Forward model']"

Narratives have transformative potential because the way we talk about displaced communities influences how we think and treat them. My research journey in Cairo is about Stories of Strength. Cairo is dust, organized chaos, and constant noise, but I enjoyed walking on Cairo’s gritty streets with my friend Didi who told me her story. Life in exile is not easy, especially if you are a young African refugee female dreaming about going to university and becoming a businesswoman. Life in exile is not easy, but none talks about it, and none cares, or at least, this is how my friends felt. This thesis intends to denounce the exhausting social context that young African refugee females experience when accessing education in Egypt, while at the same time, demonstrating that those girls are warriors. Ethnography became the central research method used to test the hypothesis, while the outcome resulted in non-fictional life stories of young African refugee female students, including their flight to Egypt and their struggle to survive, gender, and racial discrimination, and obtain an education. Two life experiences have been included in the Annexes of this study, while an analysis of them has been conducted in the main body. The results showed that African refugee females effectively navigate alternatives in a challenging educational context that limits them from achieving their academic and professional dreams. On this basis, it was confirmed that the stories of young African refugee girls are Stories of Strength while reminding the reader that narratives have transformative potential and that the way we tell stories matters.","['Education, Female, Africa, Refugee, Strength, Eritrea, Cairo, Dreams, Stories.']"

Examining the Kantei's leading role in Japan's accelerated pro-Taiwan shift: Has the LDP's nationalist right-wing 'hijacked' Japan's foreign policymaking 'cockpit' ?,"Speé, Bruno","['Black, L.O.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"After 2020, Japan-Taiwan relations have seen an accelerated change from an informal, ambiguous relationship towards a relationship based on Japan’s support for Taiwan’s de facto independence. This thesis argues that the drivers behind the accelerated shift challenge the paradigm that Japan’s Prime Ministerial executive office (the Kantei) exerts unchallenged control over Japan’s foreign policymaking (Mulgan 2017). Namely, influential LDP nationalist right-wing politicians have utilized the Hong Kong protests, 2021 LDP presidential elections and Russia’s attack on Ukraine to make unprecedented pro-Taiwan statements. These statements have called upon the Kantei to more explicitly demonstrate its support for Taiwan’s position, which is in line with the preference of nationalist right-wing politicians for a strong Japan in the international order and their desire to maintain political influence over Japan’s policymaking. Through these statements, LDP nationalist right-wing politicians have more or less ‘hijacked’ Japan’s foreign policymaking. As this undermined the Kantei’s leading role in Japan’s policymaking, the paradigm that Japan is a Kantei-led state in foreign policy needs to be reviewed in order to accommodate the influence of the LDP’s nationalist right-wing.","['Japan', 'International Relations', 'Japan-Taiwan relations', 'Japanese politics', 'LDP', 'Kantei']"

‘When Last We Saw Our Heroes’: Medieval Oral Tradition and Formulaic Narrative in Dungeons & Dragons,"Horst, Bob van der","['Porck, M.H.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The history of mankind is intrinsically linked to the history of narrative, since it is in our very being to communicate, and to produce narratives. In earlier times, people sat around the campfire or in the banquet hall to partake in the telling and hearing of stories about the world, about gods and higher powers, about heroes or extraordinary events, and so on. In the late 20th century, this oral tradition made a mainstream resurgence of sorts in western culture, with the rise of the (tabletop) Role Playing Game or ‘TTRPG’. These games, while not exact replications of oral tradition, are heavily reliant on its orality and collaborative storytelling elements, and its gameplay owes much to the narrative features and typescenes of oral tradition, especially medieval oral tradition, since the original TTRPG’s were inspired mainly by the medieval period. While scholars such as Walter J. Ong (Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word, 1982) have already discussed oral tradition in detail, its link to the relatively new medium of the TTRPG has yet to be touched upon in scholarship. This thesis will attempt to close this gap to a degree, by investigating to what extent the non-linear narrative structure of the TTRPG Dungeons and Dragons resembles that of medieval oral tradition. First, this thesis will define what exactly constitutes medieval orality, by presenting (among others) Walter J. Ong’s theory pertaining to the “Psychodynamics of Orality,” and illustrating the presence of his characteristics in extant historical sources of medieval oral tradition, such as the Old English Beowulf and the Norse sagas. Second, an overview will be provided of the popular TTRPG Dungeons & Dragons, detailing its content, gameplay mechanics, history, and development. Finally, this thesis will demonstrate the relation between Dungeons & Dragons and medieval orality, by applying Walter J. Ong’s theory on oral characteristics to the TTRPG. In so doing, this thesis will demonstrate that (TT)RPG’s can provide valuable contributions to the scholarly fields wherein the topic is otherwise overlooked.","['Dungeons & Dragons', 'oral tradition', 'oral culture', 'psychodynamics', 'Medieval', 'orality', 'role playing games', 'role playing', 'RPG', 'D&D', 'Walter Ong', 'Dungeon Master', 'DM']"

The issue of state immunity in lawsuits brought by South Korean former comfort women against Japan,"Gielen, Paul",['Dr Jang'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The purpose of this research is to give an argued answer to the question if South Korean former comfort women who were forcefully mobilized by Imperial Japan to brothels of the Imperial Japanese armed forces can, despite the principle of state immunity, obtain reparations from the state of Japan for the unfathomable horrors they experienced every day at the hands of the Japanese soldiers during the Asia-Pacific War. The principle of state immunity is a customary international law rule which entails that states are immune from prosecution in other states. State immunity has the power to prevent a court from possessing jurisdiction, and it can prevent a court from executing a judgment. According to this principle, the former comfort women should not be able to sue the state of Japan in the Korean domestic courts. However, in January 2021 the Seoul Central District Court ruled in a lawsuit against Japan brought by a group of former comfort women that, based on a violation of jus cogens norms, state immunity could be lifted. The decision of the Seoul Central District Court was in violation with international law. An exception of state immunity based upon a jus cogens violation finds no corroboration in existing customary international law, and is in conflict with the current international immunity norms. It could, however, be possible that the South Korean constitution can be interpreted to exclude state immunity from the domestic legal order if it interferes with the right of the former comfort women to obtain reparations. However, the South Korean Constitutional Court has not yet ruled on the matter of state immunity, and it is not possible to determine how to correctly interpret the South Korean constitution. Therefore, it seems that the fate of future lawsuits instigated by former comfort women will, for now, remain uncertain.","['State immunity, comfort women, reparations, litigation, law, court, South Korea, Japan']"

The Feminist Data Set: the effort to reveal and reimagine power structures within data science and the Web,"Herceg, Hugo",['Dr. K. de Wild'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"With the current trend of moving toward automation (replacing human workers with technology) based on AI technology, developers often highlight their motivation as one of the progress and necessity. However, they often forget the social implications of large-scale implementation of these technologies, such as potential discrimination and oppression from automated decision-making systems. This thesis takes the community-based art project, The Feminist Data Set by Caroline Sinders, as a source of interest in how its activism reflects on these concerns and reveals the power structures in data science and networks. The Feminist Data Set essentially recognizes its power in its capacity to act and propose alternative practices to large technology companies. Through the analysis of the text by Sinders about the project and workshops, this thesis tries to review what specific strategies Sinders offers to tackle the issue of biases within AI and how to make networks more democratic. The model that The Feminist Data Set emphasizes actively involves participants, where the education and access to the data about algorithms could benefit social networks and the internet in more democratization and accountability, which could bring society closer to the ideas of social justice within AI-based systems.","['The Feminist Data Set', 'Caroline Sinders', 'Theory of Networks', 'Data Feminism', 'Social justice', 'AI']"

Nazi propaganda and its’ impact on public support for the Nazi regime: An assessment of the impact of Nazi propaganda on public opinion in Nazi Germany 1932-1945,"Klein Ikkink, Vincent","['Milevski, L.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"From 1871 until 1945, a period of less than a century, Germany underwent incredible developments as a nation-state. While Germany was only a bundle of separate and divided states in 1848, it managed to turn itself into a unified country by 1933. Furthermore, during an even shorter timeframe (1933-1942), the Nazis physically succeeded at turning an economically and politically broken country into a continental superpower. It is also important to mention that Germany in 1914-1918 lost over 2 million soldiers and 400,000 civilians during the First World War.1 In this light, it is difficult to understand how the Nazi government mentally prepared its’ population for the idea of waging another World War. Given this contradictory and volatile context, it is historically relevant to re-examine the relationship between Nazi propaganda and public opinion. Therefore, this research attempts to explain how Nazi propaganda reinterpreted realities in a way that created an inescapable context of propaganda for a majority of the German population.","['Nazi Germany', 'Nazi propaganda', 'Adolf Hitler', 'Joseph Goebbels', 'public opinion', 'authoritarian regime', 'World War Two', 'anti-Semitism', 'Holocaust', 'German nationalism']"
Sustaining Extractivism in the Atacama Desert: Examining the Role of Sustainability Reporting in the Extraction of Lithium and the Global Energy Transition,"Rodríguez-Gironés Bergsträsser, Elisa","['Palacio Ludeña, M.G.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the context of a global transition away from fossil-fuelled energy production, the coming shift to low-carbon electromobility will require substantial increases in the extraction of so-called energy transition materials. Critical for the production of battery-based electric vehicles, lithium represents a metal whose accelerating extraction in the Chilean salt flats of Atacama and its local consequences are set to pose fundamental questions for the sustainability of the global political economy. In my thesis, I view lithium extraction through an extractivist lens, exploring how corporate sustainability reporting discursively frames and justifies extractive activities in light of shifting global contexts. My point of departure is rooted in critical discourse analysis: Using frame analysis in a qualitative methodological approach, I analyze documents published by the Sociedad Química y Minera (SQM), one of Chile’s foremost lithium producers, to answer the following research question: To what extent are discourses of sustainability employed to legitimize the persistence of lithium extractivism in Chile in the context of the global energy transition? I argue that through its sustainability policies and reporting, SQM develops a corporate brand that situates the company at the intersection of local sustainable development and global climate action. The sustainability frames it employs establish a narrative in which the extraction of natural resources, particularly energy transition metals, becomes a global necessity – SQM positions itself as part of the solution, rather than the cause of socio-environmental challenges. In this way, extractivist modes of economic organization perpetuate themselves through discursive auto-insertion in global visions of more sustainable futures.","['sustainability', 'energy transition', 'lithium', 'resource extraction', 'electromobility']"

Decentralised Diplomatic Relationships between Europe and China: A Comparative Case Study of the Moravian Silesian Region and Noord-Brabant’s Provincial Economic Relationship with Jiangsu Province,"Vos-Zwart, Sanne","['Wang, J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"All over the world local governments engage in ‘decentral diplomacy’, which refers to the international relations of sub-state regions (Dams, 2022; Šimalčík, Šebok, Kalivoda, & Blablová, 2021). European regions often engage in decentral diplomacy with Chinese provinces because of the expected economic outcome. The question is often asked, however, how does a region economically make the most out of these relationships? This thesis studies the domestic state-local political dynamism that influences economic opportunities emerging from the provincial relationship with Jiangsu province. In an interview-based comparative case study using a most similar systems design, the Dutch province Noord-Brabant is compared to the Moravian Silesian Region in Czechia. Whereas these regions are comparable in certain aspects, of which their relationship to Jiangsu is the most important, this thesis makes the comparison studying three dissimilar factors: the extent of central-local coordination on China policy, the institutional structure of the regional relationships, and the local institutional bureaucratic effort. These factors are expected to explain the difference in economic opportunities emerged through the relationship with Jiangsu province. Studying the determinants of good interstate relations at the local level, this thesis finds that based on these two cases particularly the institutional structure of the regional relationships and the local institutional bureaucratic effort are important for economic opportunities emerged through the relationship with Jiangsu.","['decentral', 'diplomacy', 'China', 'Europe', 'Czechia', 'Netherlands', 'regions', 'Jiangsu', 'Brabant', 'province', 'economy']"

Beyond India: Sangh International and Vernacular Hindutva Politics in the UK,"Barrow, Alessandra","['Gupta, R']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In the midst of the 2019 UK general election, a story broke that an affiliate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India’s ruling Hindu nationalist party, was openly campaigning for Conservative Party candidates in forty-eight marginal constituencies. The ideology of the BJP and its affiliates in the Sangh Parivar, Hindutva, has often been treated by scholars as a siloed entity that only affects India and the Indian or Hindu diaspora. Instead, this paper argues that Hindutva has become a transnational, right-wing populist vernacular that is grounded in the UK as a local political discourse through the principal Hindu nationalist organisational network, the Sangh Parivar. So, this paper asks; How has the organization and discourse of the Sangh Parivar vernacularised in the UK and affected the discourse of British politicians? Events such as Modi’s 2014 ascent to power and Brexit (2016) in the UK have facilitated the move of right-wing populist repertoires into the mainstream. This shift simultaneously enables the Sangh Parivar and Hindu nationalists’ growing confidence and organisational visibility. Thus, this paper updates previous scholarship's mapping of the multifarious network of the UK Sangh Parivar, highlighting the importance of identifying the component organisations of the Sangh Parivar to understand the discourse of global Hindutva. Moreover, this paper highlights how right-wing populist and far-right discourses intersect with Hindutva discourses in the UK. Right-wing, far-right and Hindutva discourses are networked in online spaces, such as social media platforms, where the difference between national and international discourses is often blurred. Finally, this paper argues that the activities of the Sangh Parivar have also affected the parliamentary discourse of British MPs. This effect shows the broader impact of Sangh Parivar discourses in the UK, and on other Hindu organisations that seek to represent British-Hindus and Indians. Thus, contrary to what previous research has assumed, the Sangh UK is political. Importantly, the Sangh Parivar UK has also contributed to the development of global Sangh organisations and collaborations. As such, the Sangh Parivar is a multi-polar, multi-directional and diffuse network of organisations that non-Sangh organisations and individuals, such as British-Hindu umbrella groups and parliamentarians, become entwined with. This can best be understood as ‘Sangh International.","['Hindutva', 'Hindu nationalism', 'Sangh International', 'UK politics', 'Sangh Parivar', 'Indian diaspora', 'electoral politics', 'right-wing populism', 'UK-India relations', 'political discourse', 'ethnic minority politics', 'global Hindutva', 'Operation Hindu Vote', 'HSS', 'OFBJP', 'RSS']"

This study looks into similarities and differences in the framing of climate change in articles in China’s state-owned newspaper People’s Daily, government speeches and statements at international conferences. The research attempts to demonstrate whether or not the framing of climate change differs when the target audience, i.e. international organizations or other nation states and domestic populations, is different. This study uses frame analysis as theoretical basis and it applies a comparative approach. The study looks into the framing of climate change through examining three case studies: China’s target to peak carbon emissions by 2030, China’s target to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and the country’s promise to stop building overseas coal-fired power plants. 39 articles in People’s Daily and 6 international speeches that contained these three topics are analyzed in order to detect the prevailing climate change frames. The results show that the international speeches place policy goals in the context of climate change, but that a reference to climate change is often absent in articles in People’s Daily. Both ways of communication mainly make use of the domestic politics frame and emphasize international collaboration. Furthermore, the speeches and articles frequently regard China as vanguard in dealing with climate change. The insights gathered by this study contribute to the field of research on framing and climate change communication by the Chinese government.","['climate change, framing analysis, china, newspaper, speeches']"

I first discuss and compare Moon’s campaign strategies from 2012 and 2017, noting several elements that would have a high probability of influencing Moon’s decisions on promising to be a feminist president. I then analyze Moon’s promises on feminist issues during the February 2017 speech in which Moon declares to become a feminist president, and the fulfillment thereof, which highlights certain parallels between the US and South Korean presidential democracy. The paper concludes that Moon has done a reasonable job at fulfilling around two-thirds of a public feminist agenda, but has failed to address problems in South Korean society that opponents of public feminism, postmodern and radical feminists in particular, would consider important.","['Issue Politics', 'Promise Fulfillment', 'Feminism in South Korea', 'Gender Politics', 'Presidential Behavior']"

Van zeventiende-eeuwse specerijenserviezen zijn afbeeldingen bewaard gebleven van buitenlandse stukken en een enkel Nederlands voorbeeld. Dit zilveren specerijenservies voor gebruik aan tafel lijkt het enige nog bestaande Nederlandse exemplaar. Het roept daarom vragen op met betrekking tot zijn plaats binnen de Nederlandse en Europese edelsmeedkunst van de zeventiende eeuw, de ontwikkeling en het gebruik van een dergelijk voorwerp. Met behulp van literatuuronderzoek, archiefonderzoek, biografisch onderzoek en objectgericht onderzoek worden deze kwesties onderzocht en toegelicht. Als de biografische gegevens van Anthonie Grill en de gegevens op de plaat met meestertekens van de Amsterdamse zilversmeden (1627-1649) in samenhang beschouwd worden lijkt het onwaarschijnlijk dat Anthonie Grill zijn meesterteken op dit specerijenservies heeft kunnen aanbrengen. Archiefonderzoek levert onvoldoende en tegenstrijdige informatie op, zodat een definitief oordeel niet mogelijk blijkt. De stijl en decoratie van het specerijenservies zijn anders dan die van vele andere in Amsterdam gemaakte zilveren voorwerpen die uit de eerste helft van de zeventiende eeuw bekend zijn. In Duitsland kwam overeenkomstige decoratie al vroeger voor op zilveren voorwerpen. Naar Nederland geëmigreerde Duitse edelsmeden hebben wellicht invloed gehad op de vormgeving van dit zilveren specerijenservies.","['specerijenservies, zilver, Anthonie Grill, tafelcultuur, zeventiende eeuw']"

The results show that languages in the Guaporé-Mamoré area tend to prefer right-bound, fixed stress, although only the languages south-west of the Guaporé river, corresponding to the Mojo-Chiquito culture area, are significantly different from the control languages (p = .003) in this regard.

Deze ode wordt geanalyseerd aan de hand van een retorisch kader, namelijk de taken van de redenaar. Daarbij ga ik in op waar Pindarus zijn informatie vandaan haalt (inventio), hoe hij dit ordent (dispositio) en welke stilistische middelen hij gebruikt (elocutio). Door middel van deze analyse reflecteer ik op de vraag wat een retorische lezing van een pindarische ode bijdraagt aan ons begrip van Pindarus in het algemeen en deze ode in het bijzonder. Enerzijds concludeer ik dat Pindarus op het gebied van de inventio, dispositio en elocutio grotendeels hetzelfde wil bereiken en dat we een pindarische ode kunnen lezen als een tekst die behoort tot het genus demonstrativum. Anderzijds plaats ik de kanttekening of we niet een bepaalde lading verliezen als we de tekst alleen retorisch lezen, omdat deze lezing vooral functioneel is. Een poëtische tekst heeft namelijk ook esthetische functies. Mijn eindconclusie luidt dat een retorische lezing nuttig is omdat het verschillende aspecten een het licht heeft gebracht die in eerder onderzoek onder de oppervlakte zijn gebleven.","['Pindarus', 'archaïsche lyriek', 'epinikia', 'retorica', 'dertiende Olympische ode', 'genus demonstrativum']"

Rutten'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The present study investigates to what extent students, who originate from outside of the Randstad area, accommodate their accent, during their studies here, to Leiden students who have studied in Leiden for a longer time. Moreover, a linguistically marked feature, the ''Gooise r'' is also said to be employed in Leiden and cultivated among these Leiden students. Both of these phenomena were investigated through qualitative interviews. This was researched via the following questions. 1. To what extent do students who come from outside of Leiden accommodate their accent to their peers and why? a. What did they alter? b. To what extent do students possess the so-called Gooise ''r''? c. What are the social and or linguistic connotations of the Gooise ''r'' in Leiden student circles? d. Do they align with existing academic and popular media ones? It turned out that these students accommodated their accent and language to their peers in varying degrees. Possible reasons were their social network, intergroup relations, remarks and preventing miscommunication. The ''Gooise r'' was also present among the majority of the participants. They associated its usage with posh Leiden students or posh people in general, middle class ''Leids'' or working class ''Leienaren''. They all attributed its usage to the Randstad region.","['Applied Linguistics', 'sociolinguistics', 'social connotations', 'accent accomodation', 'gooise r', 'leiden', 'leiden student circles.']"
Dus ik een scriptie schrijven: Een analyse van zinnen zonder persoonsvorm,"Andree, Milou",['Prof.dr. L.C.J. Barbiers'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"An utterance without a finite verb can be seen as an expressive construction in the Dutch language (in Dutch ‘Zin Zonder Persoonsvorm’: ZZP). An example of this construction is: Dus ik naar de bakker (‘So I to the bakery’). The existing literature on the characteristics of ZZP’s is limited. Hence, this thesis addresses the following research question: what are the characteristics of ZZP’s and how can these characteristics best be analysed? In answering this question, two theoretical perspectives are elaborated: generative grammar and construction grammar. Three methods were used, namely acceptability judgment based on my own intuitions, an informal acceptability judgment test and an additional corpus research. The results demonstrate that a ZZP presumably needs a process and an endpoint. The perspective of the generative grammar shows that a ZZP is likely to be a full Complementizer Phrase (CP). It also shows that, in the beginning, there is a structure in the ellipsis site that is deleted at Phonological From (PF): the deletion analysis. The perspective of the construction grammar shows that ZZP’s can be put in a construction network with more abstract and more specific constructions: pairings of form and meaning. Both the generative grammar and the construction grammar perspective provide useful analyses of the ZZP, although leading to different outcomes.",

Exploring the International Intelligibility of the Czech Accent and Pointing out Common Pronunciation Problems of Czech Learners of English Language,"Měkotová, Tereza","['Smakman, D.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores how intelligible Czech accented English is to foreign speakers and what pronunciation issues Czech learners of English have. With English language becoming the world’s lingua franca, there has been a significant change in the attitude towards English pronunciation teaching over the years. This paper introduces the change from the Nativeness Principle, that focused on sounding native-like, to the Intelligibility Principle, the goal of which is to have a clear pronunciation enough to converse comfortably with other speakers of English. This paper’s focus is particularly on the Czech accented English and its understandability in conversation. Mutual intelligibility is what Jenkins (2000; 2002) aimed at when putting together a list of core pronunciation features one should focus on when learning English. This Lingua Franca Core (LFC), as she named it, serves as a base for this paper. In this study, recordings of less advanced Czech learners of English were collected and analysed, in order to pinpoint the main pronunciation mistakes. These were compared to Jenkins’ LFC to establish how intelligible the Czech accent is. Selected bits of the recordings were also sent to responders through a survey, to find out what their opinion on the Czech accent is. The main findings of the analysis showed that less advanced Czech learners substitute English vowels with Czech ones, they put stress on the first syllable in every word and pronounce English weak vowel forms as full ones. They also struggle with the pronunciation of voiced and voiceless dental fricatives, and they insert a glottal stop in between words, creating clear boundaries. The survey results showed that these aspects of Czech English mainly constitute a problem in isolated words. When context is provided, the Czech accent proved to be quite intelligible and some of the pronunciation features even helped with intelligibility. The study concluded with pronunciation tips for English learners.","['Intelligibility', 'Nativeness', 'Pronunciation', 'L1 Czech', 'L2 English', 'Accents', 'Czech English', 'Lingua Franca Core', 'Speech recordings', 'Tips']"
Technology-Assisted Language Learning Strategies: A Multiple Longitudinal Qualitative Case Study on the Lessons that Can Be Learned from Experienced Language Learners’ Duolingo Usage,"Wouters, Jason","['Jong, N.H. de']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Although much research has been conducted into language learning strategies for the four different skills, i.e., reading, listening, writing, and speaking, no research on this topic has investigated the effect of technology on the language learning process. This thesis examines the language learning strategies that are employed by experienced language learners using a technology-assisted language learning application in order to fill this gap. Data was collected by asking four participants to fill in diary entries related to their language learning behavior for 30 days, while using Duolingo. Two of the participants were then invited to participate in a follow-up interview, which was aimed at uncovering more about what the participants did and why they decided to do so. The data collected in the diary entries and interview transcriptions were analyzed using Grounded Theory. The results showed that the experienced language learners who participated in this experiment employed five different types of technology-assisted language learning strategies, namely (a) internal motivation, (b) external motivation, (c) meta-cognitive, (d) time management, and (e) cognitive. These types can be further subdivided into more specific language learning strategies, such as motivation management and resource selection. Based on these findings a new taxonomy of technology-assisted language learning was proposed and implications for autonomous and classroom-based language learners as well as language educators were concluded.","['Technology-assisted language learning', 'Language learning strategies', 'Duolingo', 'Diary entries', 'Grounded Theory']"

Contributing factors shaping language attitude and intergenerational language transmission are discussed by gaining insights into heritage speakers' attitudes and views on intergenerational language transmission in light of declining numbers of spoken languages, and China's and Mandarin Chinese's growing importance. This study draws on 21 semi-structured online interviews conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic from September to December 2021 and is based on the experiences of the participants, both 1.5 generation and second generation, with varying degrees of Cantonese proficiency. The study applies constructivist grounded theory for its analysis. An analytical model is developed to understand the multivariable factors influencing attitude towards heritage languages. In this model, I distinguish two categories: the heritage speaker's environment and their construction of self-identity. Grounded in the data, I argue that each category has two dimensions, although they are not mutually exclusive. In the former case, necessity and perception of the world may condition the heritage speaker. Concerning the latter, pragamtics and cultural identity also play a significant role in shaping one's attitude towards their heritage language. The findings reveal that a positive attitude prevails amongst the participants and that the majority wish to transmit their heritage language. Yet, due to their limited capacity to transmit Cantonese, the participants were equally pessimistic about the future of Cantonese. Put differently, a positive attitude does not ensure the Cantonese language vitality. As a result, Cantonese as a heritage language in the Netherlands is showing early signs of declining language vitality, prompting researchers, policymakers, Chinese community schools, national school staff, publishers, Cantonese content creators, and, finally, heritage speakers to reconsider heritage languages and seek appropriate ways to safeguard diasporic communities' cultural heritage.","['Cantonese', 'Heritage language', 'Heritage', 'Language attitude', 'Intangible heritage', 'Intergenerational Language', 'Language endangerment', 'Language vitality', 'Overseas Chinese communities', 'Chinese diaspora', 'Cultural identity', 'Multilingualism']"

Korean adoption agencies, especially Korea Social Service, reacted eagerly to the demand in the Netherlands, driven by economic incentives and the maturation of the institutional space wherein adoption agencies operated in South Korea. As the number of children in childcare facilities peaked around 1967, adoption agencies sought to expand their adoption programme to more countries; outsourcing the childcare to foreign families (while getting paid for), compared to increasing the capacity of domestic care facilities, was the only financially viable choice. In a perfect storm, the confluence of socio-cultural and economic circumstances led to the emergence of transnational adoption as a lasting phenomenon, in both the Netherlands and South Korea.","['transnational adoption', 'Korean adoptees', 'Dutch adoption policy', 'adoption history', 'adoption industry']"

Interpreting and Translating Competition Law: A Comparative Analysis of EU and US Methods of Interpretation within Competition Law and its Effect on Translations into Dutch,"Leede, Gwynedd de","['Foster, A.A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research is a literature and jurisprudence study into the effect of the differences in legal interpretation between the EU legal system and the US legal system regarding competition law on the translation of competition law terminology into Dutch. Both EU and US competition law addresses broadly the same categories of anticompetitive behaviour - agreements, monopolisation, mergers - but the wording and interpretation of the legislative provisions varies. EU competition law is originally based upon US antitrust law, and therefore shares a lot of the same terminology. The US antitrust law has undergone some fundamental changes in its interpretation, which has in turn driven EU and US terminology further apart. Nowadays, there are vast differences in economic interpretation, political interpretation and legal interpretation. These differences in interpretation have influence on the translation of competition law terminology from US English and EU English, respectively, into Dutch. In the jurisprudence it is shown that the ECJ interprets textually and teleologically, where the US Supreme Court uses conservative purposivism. This leads to differences in the meaning of the same term. Generally, the US Supreme Court find an additional proof of inefficiency necessary in order to establish a competition violation. Both EU competition law and Dutch competition law do not need this additional proof. Therefore, the semantic meaning of competition law terminology is narrower in the US than in the EU. For translation into Dutch it must be assessed on a case-to-case basis whether it is necessary to add ‘inefficiënte’ before a US term so that the target text reader has the same understanding of the legal term as the source text reader.","['Competition Law, Legal Interpretation, Legal Translation, Antitrust Law']"

The Palestinian Refugee in the Arab Host-State: Threat to the Status Quo & The Role of Citizenship,"Ton, Wouter","['Englert, S.P.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the processes of repression and exclusion of the Palestinian refugee in the Arab host-state. A theoretical framework using theories from Michel Foucault, Hannah Arendt, Giorgio Agamben, Michael Hardt, and Antonio Negri, is used to analyse the situation of the refugee in the three case studies of Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. It is argued that biopolitics are employed to control and exclude the Palestinian refugee. The host-state excuses this exclusion through the retoric of the incommensurability of the right of return to Palestine with citizenship of the host-state. Gaining citizenship of the host-state supposedly cancels the right of return to Palestine. This discourse is a tool that is employed by the host-states when he refugee proses a threat to their status quo. This thesis disagrees with this supposed incommensurability argueing that the two can co-exist. Furthermore, an analysis of the situation of the Palestinian refugee in the case studies leads to the conclusion that Hannah Arendt and Giorgio Agamben were right when argueing that the nation-state is the only institution capable of upholding human rights and that without citizenship the refugee is vulnerable and without protection. Because of this, serious steps need to be taken towards citizenship for the Palestinian refugee.","['Palestinian', 'Refugee', 'Citizenship', 'Human Rights', 'Exclusion', 'Repression', 'Right of Return', 'Lebanon', 'Jordan', 'Syria']"

Therefore, in this study, the NPI tendency of two different types of much were compared: differential and adnominal much. Generally, research shows that much tends to be an NPI, whereas differential much prefers non-negation over negation contexts. Thus, the hypothesis is that there would be a strong tendency towards adnominal much occurring as an NPI, whereas differential much would not be an NPI. From the British National Corpus (BNC), 500-instance samples were analysed, and later compared with BNC searches for specific instances (that much, very much, etc.) in order to confirm their validity. These results were divided into NEG – in which negation took place – and POS – in which (implicit) negation did not take place. The results showed that NEG differential much only occurred in 5% of the instances, whereas NEG adnominal much occurred in 28% of the instances. When both much types were combined with modifiers (i.e., very much, that much, so much, etc.), they mostly occurred in a POS context. The bare adnominal much instances – without any modifiers – are almost equally divided among NEG (100) and POS (109) instances. Overall, the NEG instances did not have a preference for a certain genre in comparison to their POS counterparts. The results imply that differential much is not an NPI, whereas adnominal much may have a tendency to occur in NPI contexts.","['NPI', 'Much', 'Differential', 'Adnominal', 'British National Corpus']"

Gestolen vrijheid en opgehokte burgers: Onderzoek naar metafoorgebruik over het coronabeleid door Tunahan Kuzu en Wybren van Haga in de Tweede Kamer,"Schriel, Luka","['Van Leeuwen, M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Tijdens de coronacrisis werden er veel metaforen gebruikt in de communicatie over het beleid en het virus. Vooral tijdens de persconferenties van minister-president Mark Rutte en minister Hugo de Jonge viel het vele metafoorgebruik op. Metaforen kunnen worden gebruikt om abstracte concepten die lastig te begrijpen zijn, uit te drukken in simpelere concepten. Lakoff and Johnson (1980) waren de eersten die metaforen niet alleen als een stijlmiddel beschreven, maar ook stelden dat bijna al ons alledaagse taalgebruik metaforisch is. Het spreken over ziekten in metaforen heeft een rijke geschiedenis en er is dan ook veel eerder onderzoek naar metafoorgebruik in combinatie met infectieziekten, epidemieën en pandemieën. Er is internationaal ook veel literatuur geschreven over metafoorgebruik rondom het coronavirus, maar veel minder over metafoorgebruik over het beleid tegen het coronavirus. Reijnierse (2020) en De Jong (2020) schreven wel al eerder over metafoorgebruik in de coronapersconferenties, op populariserende en niet-systematische wijze. Er is in Nederland dus gering onderzoek gedaan naar metaforen in combinatie met coronabeleid. Dit onderzoek beoogt bij te dragen aan het opvullen van deze leemte, door voorbereide bijdragen uit plenaire vergaderingen van de Tweede Kamer te analyseren. Dit onderzoek richt zich in het bijzonder op Tunahan Kuzu en Wybren van Haga, die een kritische houding aannemen tegenover het coronabeleid. Reijnierse (2020) doet in haar eerste artikel een oproep voor meer metafooronderzoek naar het taalgebruik bij coronabeleid. In deze scriptie wordt gehoor gegeven aan deze oproep door de volgende onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden: Welke conceptuele metaforen worden er gebruikt door Kuzu en Van Haga bij het spreken over het coronabeleid in de Tweede Kamer? Uit de literatuur is gebleken dat onderzoek naar conceptuele metaforen een aantal problemen met zich meebrengt op het gebied van criteria en afbakening tijdens de analyse. Aan de hand van die kritiek is de MIP-methode opgesteld door Pragglejaz (2007). Dit onderzoek maakt voor de corpusanalyse gebruik van de versie van MIP zoals bijgesteld door Dorst (2015). Uit de analyse is gebleken dat Kuzu en Van Haga vooral negatieve en gewelddadige metaforen gebruikten in de geselecteerde teksten. Deze negatieve lading kan worden verklaard door de kritische houding die Kuzu en Van Haga hebben tegenover het coronabeleid en het kabinet. Het metafoorgebruik van de twee sprekers kwam grotendeels met elkaar overeen, op enkele keuzes voor bepaalde conceptuele metaforen na. De resultaten van dit onderzoek nodigen ook uit tot verschillende vervolgonderzoeken naar metafoorgebruik in de politiek.",

Multilateral Regionalism with Chinese Characteristics: A Case Study of the Macau Forum,"Wejchert, Samuel","['Ferchen, M. G.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the early 2000s, China has experimented with a range of development-oriented diplomatic initiatives based on multilateral regionalism. One of these initiatives is the Macau Forum, a grouping created in 2003 that brings China together with nine lusophone countries to promote economic and trade exchanges. This case study investigates China’s motives for creating and maintaining this multilateral project and examines perceptions from its lusophone participants. The significance of this analysis is that it provides a more granular understanding of the rationale and results of China’s ever-increasing promotion of alternative international development cooperation frameworks in the Global South. To research this topic, I relied primarily on historically-contextualised discourse analysis of primary material from diplomatic and academic sources. Results of this analysis reveal that China was motivated (1) to promote and test out a Chinese vision of development cooperation, (2) to strengthen Macau’s integration with mainland China and (3) to secure Beijing's diplomatic recognition among lusophone countries. Commentary from lusophone diplomats, however, highlights the lack of perceived concrete benefits for the Macau Forum’s participant members.

Why the Belt and Road Initiative furthers the marginalisation of ethnic minorities: a case of Balochistan,"Janusz, Alina Ly-Ly",['Dr. Lindsay Black'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Chinese development projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are promoted as being “value-free”- in contrast to western development projects that are promoted in terms of western values such as human rights and democracy. Chinese development projects in countries where oppressive or marginalising structures are already present are thus expected to worsen this situation. The China-Pakistan Economic corridor (CPEC) has received criticism for leading through Balochistan, where the Baloch people have been marginalised for decades. Constructivist norm diffusion assumes that the marginalisation of the Baloch people is a result of China’s norms diffusing through CPEC.

Past research concerning CDS argues that capitalist projects, by design, further the marginalisation of oppressed groups.

Understanding the nature of a rising political phenomenon: Populism in times of crisis: a comparative discourse analysis on populist rhetoric during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Tevonderen, Tjitske","['Gerrits, A.W.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Over the last two decades, we have observed a surge in support for populist parties. As populism is known to thrive on crisis, the current COVID-19 pandemic provides an interesting case to study its nature. This thesis tests whether the three-folded paradox of populism observed in the U.S. by Rogers Brubaker (2020) holds for the Netherlands and Germany, by means of a comparative discourse analysis. This analysis covers the Twitter discourse of Dutch politicians Geert Wilders and Thierry Baudet, and the German populist party, Alternative für Deutschland, during the first wave of COVID-19. This thesis thereby enters the conceptual debate on populism, arguing the observed discourse to not convey a consistent ideology, but instead to adhere to certain stylistic elements that could be qualified as characteristic of a populist political style. Moreover, the comparative analysis will shed light on whether the rise of populism can be classified as a global, perhaps ideological phenomenon, or whether national characteristics also play a role. Throughout this thesis, the role and importance of the contemporary media landscape with its various online channels for the mobilisation of contemporary populists are taken into consideration. As a surge in populist rhetoric could further uproot the established global political landscape, understanding this phenomenon is of high importance for the future of international relations.",
The impact of the February 2021 coup on China's strategic economic and security interests in Myanmar: Beijing's worst nightmare or a blessing in disguise?,"van Mulken, Cas",['Dr. L.O. Black'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Mainstream International Relations theories perceive the China-Myanmar bilateral relationship in terms of a zero-sum game, in which the close ties between the two countries either benefit China or not. Such theories are too simplistic. Often overlooked is not only the complex domestic situation in Myanmar, but also how China and Myanmar cultivated a strong bilateral relationship during the NLD era. In order to account for Myanmar’s complex domestic context, this thesis analyses the security impact of the coup on the ethnic rebel-controlled areas bordering China, and the economic impact on the Sino-Myanmar pipelines, one of China’s major Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. The research question of this study is: to what extent did China materially benefit from the February 1 coup in Myanmar? This thesis concludes that the coup increased the intensity of the conflict with EAOs, thus worsening the subsequent adverse conflict spill-over effect in the border areas. Furthermore, China’s BRI investments, including the pipelines, have historically been more secure under civilian NLD rule then under the military Tatmadaw rule. Thus, the February 2021 coup does not materially benefit China.","['Myanmar', 'coup 2021', 'NUG', 'China', 'EAOs', 'KIA', 'MNDAA', 'Tatmadaw', 'Sino-Myanmar pipelines', 'BRI']"

Pardon My Sumerian: A Typology of Insults and Offensive Language in the Old Babylonian Lexicon,"Eertink, Mark","['Dercksen, J.G.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Oude Nabije Oosten-studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"One of the most universal expressions of language is probably the invective, that is to say insults, slurs, and other offensive utterances. As a scholarly discipline, ‘swearing research’ has been slow to take hold, but is now increasingly popular among historians, and to a lesser extent linguists. Within the field of Assyriology we know of many texts that contain derogatory language, which have been studied in isolated contexts. This thesis marks the first systematic study into insults in the Old Babylonian lexicon. It incorporates Sumerian school texts – famous for their combative dialogues – and letters from the AbB and ARM series. It lays the groundwork for further research in the form of a database that includes over 900 entries: insults from various contexts, as well as the terms that denote the act of insulting. This forms the basis for a typology that characterises every insult by language, genre, type, directness, context, and other categories. A number of interesting patterns are immediately visible. Firstly, a very small number of literary texts accounts for the majority of insults that were collected. However, the types of slurs generally correspond with those found in less represented categories, such as personal letters. Secondly, one can identify a division between extensive offensive statements with a build-up and punchline, and individual insulting words. Animal names are common here, especially ‘dog’ and ‘pig’, but more creative ones also occur abundantly. Thirdly, the inclusion of insulting terms (e.g. ṭapālum “to insult”) allows us to cross-reference them with their respective most popular insults. This is especially useful to determine what the ancient authors of the texts perceived as offensive, rather than us modern commentators. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the collection and study of insults shows just how human they were. The results demonstrate the promising possibilities of this new branch of Assyriological scholarship. They are not necessarily restricted to the negative and belligerent aspects of humanity communication. The study of offensive language can also, for example, serve to study the social context of literature produced by the scribal elite, and by extension rhetoric, argumentation, or sentiment among real-life historical agents in different settings.",

“Of the Universal Mind Each Individual Is One More Incarnation”: An Individualist-Collectivist Approach to Reading Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Nature and “Self-Reliance”,"Steen, Jenniffer van der","['Morgan-Owens, J.J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Ralph Waldo Emerson is nowadays known as one of the foundational philosophers of individualism, mostly in the United States of America (though he has also influenced thoughts on individualism in Europe, e.g., Nietzsche). Common misinterpretations of Emerson’s self-reliance position him as promoting egocentric ideas of individualism. Examples of this can be found in the works of scholars Cary Wolfe (1993; 1994) and Myra Jehlen (1986). In this thesis I will examine the criticisms of Emerson and refute these by reading Emerson’s work through the lens of “individualism-collectivism”, as introduced by Wagner and Moch (1986). It is in this cooperation between the self and the other, the individual and the collective, that I will show Emerson can in fact be read as promoting collectivism alongside individualism. The introduction will give a brief overview of this thesis, including some background on critical scholars both within the field of literary analysis on Emerson, as well as providing the reader with some basic background information on individualism-collectivism-scholarship in philosophical and sociological research fields. Chapter one will focus on criticism of Nature and my reinterpretation of the essay where Emerson operates in the individualism-collectivist dimension. Chapter two will focus on “Self-Reliance” and how this truly individualist work can still be found to represent the collective in society. In the conclusion I will not only give the reader an overview of arguments made in this thesis, but also consider how this reading of Emerson can be relevant in contemporary society.","['Ralph Waldo Emerson', 'Individualism', 'Collectivism', 'Philosophy', 'American Literature']"

Narendra Modi’s Janus Face: Economic Saint or Radical Divider?,"Fargel, Maximilian","['Hadiprayitno, I.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis seeks to answer the following research question: in what ways has economic development enabled the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the ensuing spread of Hindu-nationalism in India? Despite India’s impressive economic growth of the last decades, India society is still lacking widespread human development. Social cohesion is not only threatened by discontent over stagnating overall quality of life but also by the increase of Hindu-nationalist rhetoric, violence, and policies. By examining India’s neoliberalization since 1991, this thesis attempts to draw potential correlations between neoliberalism and surging nationalism. The goal is to highlight how the BJP and their leader Narendra Modi opportunistically employs pledges of inclusive growth to either attract or appease the Indian electorate. The research of this thesis sets off with a literature review of secondary sources about economic development with a focus neoliberalism as a model and its relationship to populism. The case of Chile is employed as an example to highlight the potential implications a neoliberal economy has on human development and social unrest. The literature review is followed by a short chapter on India’s history since independence. A thorough analysis of Narendra Modi’s political beginnings as well as the Gujarat Model give a first idea of his vision for the South Asian nation. Then, this thesis discusses how a declining economy led to another switch in rhetoric and gave the BJP impetus to exclusive Hindu-nationalist policies, resulting in an ever-increasing division of India’s heterogenous society that leaves the Muslim minority subordinated and oppressed.","['economic development', 'neoliberalism', 'India', 'Hindu-nationalism', 'BJP']"

Het aantal referenten van woorden die met na of no kunnen worden gekoppeld,"Kardol, Lenneke","['Berlo, M.J. van']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In het Japans bestaat er een soort bijvoeglijke naamwoorden die in verschillende opzichten zelfstandige naamwoorden lijken, en bestaan er zelfstandige naamwoorden die in verschillende opzichten op bijvoeglijke naamwoorden lijken. Sommige van de woorden uit deze categorieën zijn te plaatsen in beiden. Er is al veel onderzoek gedaan naar de semantische verschillen tussen deze woorden wanneer ze grammaticaal als bijvoeglijk naamwoord bestaan en wanneer ze als zelfstandig naamwoord bestaan. Er is echter nog maar weinig onderzoek gedaan naar de syntactische verschillen. Om dit te onderzoeken analyseer ik in deze scriptie het aantal referenten dat deze woorden hebben in een zin. Doorgaans heeft een combinatie van een bijvoeglijk en een zelfstandig naamwoord één referent, en heeft een combinatie van twee zelfstandige naamwoorden twee referenten, dus lijkt het aannemelijk dat dit hetzelfde zou zijn bij deze woorden. Om dit te analyseren is een lijst met de soorten woorden in kwestie onderzocht in een corpus bestaande uit zinnen geschreven Japans, en is op basis hiervan geobserveerd hoeveel referenten de woorden hadden. De resultaten van het onderzoek lieten zien dat de zelfstandige naamwoorden in meer dan de helft van de gevallen maar één referent hadden, wat een aanwijzing is voor de theorie dat de categorieën van Japanse woorden soms overlap hebben.",

Kleur op de Bourgondische tafel: Een politieke boodschap,"Rooijakkers, Erica","['Dencher, A.R.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De befaamde Johan Huizinga heeft uitvoerig over de laatmiddeleeuwse samenleving geschreven, waarbij ook de onderwerpen symboliek en kleur behandeld werden. Zo schreef hij dat er een allesomvattend denksysteem van religieus symbolisme bestond waarin al het zichtbare zijn eigen plaats had, en door de kleurrijke visuele wereld te duiden kon een diepere betekenis van een voorwerp onthuld worden. Ook de bekende historicus middeleeuwse letterkunde Herman Pleij, die specifiek onderzoek deed naar kleuren in de middeleeuwen, geeft aan dat kleur gezien werd als een tekensysteem van God. Hun bevindingen over kleur in de middeleeuwse samenleving zijn de uitgangspunten van deze scriptie, waarin gekeken wordt naar de nog steeds onderbelichte rol van kleur in de tafelcultuur van de Bourgondische hertogen. Honderdachttien jaar lang (1364 -1482) streefden de Bourgondiërs ernaar hun gebied uit te breiden en hun invloed in Europa te vergroten. Zij maakten daarbij bewust gebruik van kleursymboliek om zo een subtiele, soms bijna verborgen, politieke boodschap te propageren. Met hun verfijnde tafelcultuur toonden zij hun vorstelijke magnificentia en maakten duidelijk dat zij de wereldlijke macht bezaten in de door hen verkregen gebieden. Door het arrangeren van gunstige huwelijken, het sluiten van voordelige verdragen en het winnen van veldslagen werd hun rijk steeds groter. Propaganda met behulp van kleursymboliek in de visuele cultuur werd ingezet om de bevolking te beïnvloeden en concurrerende machthebbers te intimideren. Door oorlog, pest en hongersnood was de bevolking in de late middeleeuwen het leven nooit zeker en was men gevoelig voor symboliek. Zo dacht men verbanden te zien tussen allerlei zaken in de hoop het lot op deze wijze te duiden en misschien zelfs te kunnen beïnvloeden. Met de beschikbare kleurmiddelen gebruikten de hertogen deze gevoeligheid om hun politieke boodschap via de maaltijd over te brengen.","['Kleursymboliek', 'tafelcultuur', 'magnificentia', 'Bourgondische rijk', 'propaganda.']"
The Organizational Cultures of South Korean and Dutch Businesses from the Eyes of the General Employee: A Comparative Case Analysis,"Dijk, Tiara van","['Jang, S.Y.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In light of creating more mutual understanding between South Korea and the Netherlands, this thesis studies and compares the general organizational cultures of South Korean and Dutch businesses by focusing on the view of a sample population of employees from each country. Consequently, the question this thesis attempts to answer is: ‘How do the organizational cultures of South Korean and Dutch businesses compare, as viewed through the eyes of the general employee?’ This thesis consideres every organization that employs people as a business. Furthermore, this thesis defines organizational culture as ‘values, norms, behaviors and work practices of the members in an organization’. To test the hypothesis that the two current organizational cultures of businesses in South Korea and the Netherlands are similar to each other, despite the different ways in which the organizational cultures of the two countries have been shaped, this thesis made use of a survey method to research how employees viewed their organizational culture. The survey combined qualitative and quantitative approaches through close-ended answers and deeper delving, open-ended answers. Subsequently, the survey was distributed to employees from all different kinds of job positions and workplaces within both South Korea and the Netherlands. The results of this study show that there are many similarities between the organizational cultures of South Korean and Dutch businesses, such as an occasional need to work overtime, after-work gatherings initiated by colleagues, a feeling of being heard by their boss and colleagues and a generally decent job satisfaction. Differences between the countries include a difference in flexibility of working hours, different views on obedience towards people in higher positions and different views on the need for strong personal bonds with collegues. Overall, the organizational cultures of businesses in South Korea and the Netherlands were found to contain more similarities than differences.","['Organizational Culture', 'Korea', 'South Korea', 'The Netherlands', 'Working Cultures', 'Business']"

This thesis aims to unite corpus linguistic methods with the socio-historic topic of the prescriptivist language culture in Late Modern England, when words of either Germanic or Latinate origin carried pronounced social and gender-associated connotations. A multi-method approach of keyness and concordancing of Jane Austen’s repertoire explored her etymological distributional patterns, which appeared mostly Germanic. This was not wholly gender-related, as she used fewer Latinate keywords than the average female contemporary author. Considering her negative keywords were also predominantly Germanic, and taking into account that different characters had different etymological distributions based on their social standing, it was concluded that Austen was likely confident in both Germanic and Latinate vocabularies, and could exploit their respective social connotations to characterise her diction and that of her characters. From this could furthermore be concluded that Austen exhibited, unlike past assertions, a clearly individualised style.",

EGYPT’S ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY: DISCREPANCY BETWEEN AMBITION AND IMPLEMENTATION,"Guillou, Anouck",['C.A. Ennis'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"As the future host of the next United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP27), Egypt is at the critical junction where the implementation of its environmental policy must be immediate and tangible to face climate change and foster environmental action during the conference. The country is classified as highly vulnerable to climate change and has a poor environmental performance. This research provides insights into Egypt’s environmental ambitions and their implementation, which serves as a window into the country’s political economy and the government’s military-led developmentalism. The research aim is to demonstrate and explain the gap and inconsistencies between Egypt’s stated environmental policy and ambitions, and their implementation. To that end, this explanatory research is based on case studies within-case analysis and employs a qualitative content analysis of government-issued documents. It argues that economic growth drive the Egyptian government’s military-led developmentalism at the expense of environmental preservation. This paper demonstrates that the Egyptian government has high environmental ambitions that are not backed by the corresponding environmental actions due to a lack of political will and the prioritization of economic prosperity. The study begins by reviewing the explanations behind this gap in scholarly research, then examines the government’s environmental ambitions, and ultimately reveals the inconsistencies in implementation and environmental outcomes.","['Egypt, environmental policy, implementation']"

Duizend Jaar Rusland: Hoe de Russische Federatie Identiteit Aan De Middeleeuwen Ontleent,"Lüschen, Eline",['Dr. O. F. Boele'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Russische Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De Russische Federatie zoekt naar identiteit en legitimiteit. Na de val van de Sovjet-Unie kon Rusland zichzelf niet meer als grootmacht rekenen en bleek de ideologische, culturele, en politieke basis die het communisme had verschaft niet meer toepasbaar op de nieuwe democratische staat. Het was tevens niet mogelijk om terug te keren naar het keizerlijke Rusland. De Federatie moest een nieuwe identiteit en bijbehorende legitimiteit opbouwen. Door een verbinding te zoeken met het middeleeuwse verleden kan het idee van een Russische democratie worden verworpen en de aanwezigheid van een autocraat in het Kremlin worden gelegitimeerd. Dit kan onder andere worden gedaan door het produceren van culturele producten als films, waarin bepaalde narratieven kunnen bijdragen aan de manier waarop het verleden wordt gezien. In deze scriptie werden drie films geanalyseerd die betrekking hadden op het Russische middeleeuwse verleden. Deze waren 1612: Khroniki Smutnogo Vremeni, Viking (2016) en Legenda O Kolovrate (2018). Over elk van de films is een case study geschreven. Hierin werd gekeken naar zowel specifieke als schematische narratieven om conclusies te kunnen trekken over de manier waarop de afbeelding van de Middeleeuwen bijdraagt aan de identiteitsvorming in de Russische Federatie. In de sectie over specifieke narratieven werden elementen bekeken die uniek waren voor de respectievelijke films. In de analyse van schematische narratieven werden vergelijkingen gemaakt met bestaande opvattingen en terugkerende narratieven binnen de Russische geschiedschrijving. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat bepaalde elementen van de Russische identiteit in deze films worden benadrukt, zoals religie, militaire vaardigheden, en de unieke Russische geest. Verder worden er duidelijke linken gelegd tussen de moderne Russische Federatie en het keizerlijke zowel als vroeg-middeleeuwse verleden van het Kievse Rijk. Dit werd gedaan door middel van het bewerkstelligen van verwijzingen naar het heden.","['Rusland', 'Middeleeuwen', 'Film', 'Poetin']"
Poisonous Knowledge: The Poison Reports of the Dutch East Indies and the transformation of indigenous contributions to colonial science (1885-1914),"Vellinga, Henrike",['dr. Fenneke Sijsling'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis takes the Poison Reports of the Dutch East Indies, a compilation of indigenous knowledge about poisons based on specimens and information which were collected around the turn of the twentieth century, as a case study of the process of colonial scientific knowledge production. It asks why Europeans were interested in indigenous toxicological knowledge and how this knowledge was appropriated and transformed into stable, ‘scientific’ knowledge. Through an examination of scientific publications, archival sources and newspapers, this thesis sheds light on the colonial anxieties and commercial interests that motivated research into poisons home to colonies and the ways in which it relied on indigenous knowledge to lay the groundwork for emerging European, ‘scientific’ toxicological knowledge. I do this by following the Reports through their conception, production, circulation and use between 1885 and 1914. This case study shows that research into poisons from the colonies was a part of a broader movement of empires searching for medically useful plants for commercial benefits in the late nineteenth century. Crucially, this research was shaped by colonial anxieties about the perceived expertise of indigenous people in local poisons, which Europeans living in the Indies imagined to pose. By focusing on the indigenous contributions to the Reports, this illustrates how the production of scientific knowledge was a complex process which heavily relied on the expertise of indigenous people as collectors and informers. Indigenous knowledge of poisons was judged on its authority and then included or excluded into a European ‘scientific’ framework. This transformed indigenous knowledge was then used for various applications, such as pharmacological research as well as medico-legal applications which aimed to control the dangers of poisons in the Dutch East Indies. I show how indigenous knowledge was folded into scientific knowledge, after which the indigenous origins of this knowledge were denied and forgotten. As such, this thesis illustrates the complex process of colonial knowledge production and shows the forgotten indigenous influences on scientific toxicological knowledge.","[""Colonial Science, History of Science, Dutch East Indies, Poison, Toxicology, Indigenous Knowledge, History of Botany, Koloniaal Museum Haarlem, 's Lands Plantentuin, Gif""]"

Silk and Steel: Theorizing the Belt and Road Initiative’s impact on the prospect of Sino-American military conflict,"Bertoli, Stefano",['Stacey Links'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), said to represent the genesis of a Chinese grand strategy, has been placed within intensifying debates about power-transition theories. However, the relevant academic literature analyzes the BRI through economic and diplomatic lenses, failing to explore how it might lead to the aggravating of military tensions and eventually war between China and the United States. This thesis aims to bridge this literature gap by analyzing the BRI through relevant geopolitical, power-transition, and interdependence theories. After an empirical overview of the BRI, this thesis examines how Hegemonic Stability Theory, Mackinder’s Heartland Theory, and the Theory of Trade Expectations provide insightful looks into the present and future of the BRI, as well as into the latter’s potential to starkly increase the possibilities of war between Beijing and Washington. Results are mixed but far from promising, pointing to the urgent need for an exhaustive review of US-China relations by both key parties.","['US-China relations, Belt and Road Initiative, power-transition theory, geopolitics, interdependence, war, Central Asia']"

The PRC’s open disapproval of Taiwan’s independence as well as its power and influence hinders the UN from accepting Taiwan as a new member state. This thesis aims to research how the dynamics between the US and China within the structure of the UN affect Taiwan’s bid to become an internationally recognised state as well as how Taiwan tries to influence this process from outside the UN. Qualitative research together with a historical case study analysis and a conducted interview display that both the US and China use soft power as political strategies to gain more influence within the UN for their objectives, such as the support or opposition of Taiwan’s entry into the international community. Similarly, Taiwan also uses soft power to gain more allies and to increase its eligibility to enter the UN. Moreover, this thesis finds that divergent understandings of human rights divide the UN regarding their position on Taiwan’s official status and affect the decision-making process regarding Taiwan’s independence.","['Taiwan', 'China', 'the United States', 'soft power', 'human rights', 'the United Nations', 'democracy', 'sovereignty', 'Sino-American relations']"

The Relationship Between Economic Inequality and Environmental Degradation: The Case of Brazil,"Henselmans, Manon","['Henderson, C.J.V.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper investigates the mechanisms behind the relationship between economic inequality and environmental degradation in Brazil. The country experienced a significant reduction in inequality and poverty since 1980, which resulted in higher levels of household income and, consequently, consumption. Research of available data suggests that for Brazil, a decrease in inequality and poverty resulted in an increase of consumption of, among other things, beef products. While this most likely led to increased deforestation in the beginning of the 2000s to meet the demand, due to environmental regulations, agreements, and policies, deforestation rates declined between 2004 and 2012. These rates started to increase again after 2012, the year in which the Forest Code was revised and regulations concerning deforestation were relaxed, implying the power of government interventions. While deforestation rates can be decoupled from beef product consumption, CO2 emissions have steadily increased over the studied time frame, also as a consequence of the expansion of the agricultural sector. Biodiversity loss has remained neutral thus far, and Brazil is still considered the world’s most biodiverse country. However, the risk to losing biodiversity might increase in the future if deforestation rates continue to rise. Besides consumption patterns, an unequal power distribution in the country gives big business and rich elites the power to influence policies in their benefit, maintaining or exacerbating inequalities or environmentally damaging activities.","['economic inequality', 'environmental degradation', 'Brazil', 'environment', 'political inequality']"

"The problem of political dirty hands: Moral absolutism, dynamic setting and Confucian thought","Toppari, Juho","['Mokrosinska, D.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Filosofie (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The political problem of dirty hands refers to a situation where a politician must act immorally in order to achieve moral outcomes — doing wrong to do right (Wizje 2007). The philosophy of this problem debates the exact criteria that a moral conflict has to meet in order to be a case of dirty hands, and what we ought to do in such a scenario. By following the footsteps of Walzer’s seminal article I will argue his approach to normative moral absolutist is philosophically dissatisfactory. Reconstruction of Tillyris’ dynamic narrative telos-based virtue ethical approach mimics moral absolutist normativity without problematizing the overall thesis of DH. I will then argue for an agent-inwardness problem that Tillyris' theory faces, and introduce an alternative “virtuous political” approach, namely, virtue politics, which solves the problem by incorporating both the political action and the moral agent. Virtue politics is constructed from a comparative study of dirty hands in Confucian thought articulated by Kim Sungmoon (2016), with a particular focus on Mencius’ writings.","['Problem of dirty hands', 'moral absolutism', 'virtue politics', 'Confucian thought']"

Autism and Maturity: Framing Epistemic Dis-ability,"Schoendube, Fabius",['Dr. J.J.M. Sleutels'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Filosofie (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this paper I bring the vocabulary of disability studies in conversation with queer philosophical reflection to re-read the violent “enabling” educational practices that are applied unto autistic subjects. By using the term violence I am not only referring to the usage of physical force, but mainly to the simplification and realisation of bodies to a core pre-supposed essence. In doing so I am in conversation with queer studies (Kafer, Federici) and critical race theory (Hall, Spivak). Yet, I will expand their thinking by reading the diagnosis of autism within an educational context exists as an interpretation of epistemic dis-ability. The term dis-ability highlighting the fact that a diagnosis is an interventions into a momentary state of disability with the explicit expectations that it should be overcome through the enabling intervention of education. I will further demonstrate that this demarcation of dis-ability is applied beyond the obvious cases of “disabled” bodies and can be traced to the epistemically violent treatment of othered bodies. Thus, the reading of autism functions as a litmus-test that reveals the underlying framing of normalising education to be the rhetoric of caring, which functions as a justification for the employment of violent epistemic stereotyping as a tool to make disabled bodies abled. The target this work can thus claim to have is not violent educational practices in themselves, but the attempt to fixate a simplifying meaning through claims to nature, common sense and othering practices. This is because they end the types of discourse we can have, reading every bit of noise and silence as a justification of itself. Leaving us unable to ask if the dream of a mature society justifies the violent means it attempts to realise itself through.","['Disability studies, queer studies, post-colonial studies']"
"The Fight over the Colonies: The debate on citizenship for free people of colour and the construction of revolutionary narratives in France, 1790-1792","Joosten, Bob","['Fatah-Black, K.J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis studies the way in which colonists and revolutionaries defined the value of the French Revolution and its relation to the colonies. It does so by looking at the issue of citizenship for free people of colour in Saint-Domingue. This question was central to the colonial debate between the colonist lobby, the Club d’hôtel Massiac, and the revolutionaries of the Société des Amis des Noirs. Both these pressure groups used the press to influence the public. A look at some of the relevant newspapers shows how revolutionary discourse developed throughout 1790 and 1792 and how colonial events were shaped in the narratives of the Revolution. By reconstructing this colonial debate in the press, this thesis argues that the colonial question became an essential part of revolutionary and counterrevolutionary ideologies throughout the years 1790-92. In these two years, revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries appropriated the colonial issue in their developing political identities. Questions of colonial reform changed from pragmatic considerations in 1790 to an ideological struggle between revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries in 1792. The integration of the colonial question in revolutionary narratives was stimulated by domestic developments and by the complex connection between metropole and colony. The discourse in the press showed how much the colonies affected the development of ideologies and narratives in the French Revolution and how the colonial issues were appropriated in pre-existing discourses in France. Despite recent attention to the impact of the Haitian Revolution, little is known about the French reaction to the events on France’s most important colony. However, as this thesis argues, the colonial debate was essential to the experience of Revolution.","['French Revolution', 'colonialism', 'racism', 'Haitian Revolution', 'political discourse']"

Nozick's Rectification Principle: A Critical Defense,"Ankum, Frederik Hendrik Maximiliaan",['T. Meijers'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I will discuss Robert Nozick’s entitlement theory of justice as developed in his Anarchy, State, and Utopia. Specifically, I will examine his theory of justice in holdings and its three constituent principles of justice in acquisition, justice in transfer, and the principle of rectification. The core focus of this thesis is, however, on Nozick’s principle of rectification, which ties his entitlement theory together. As part of this analysis, I will also explore questions concerning how far back one must and can go, what a victim may require as rectification for an injustice, and various other complications that cannot be simply ignored in the face of practical real-world applications. Specifically, I will consider the injustice of slavery as it existed in the United States from its foundation in 1776 up until 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment proclaimed that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, […] shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” For the injustice of slavery during this time period, I will provide an empirical and data driven analysis to quantify the requisite Nozickian rectification. Having examined the question of how large rectification for slavery ought to be, I conclude that it should be minimal or nil if the question is analyzed under Nozickian libertarian principles. My conclusion is based on (a) a review of the conceptual problems with claims for rectification, and (b) an empirical analysis that provides a rough estimate of how much claimants can possibly expect to receive for rectification.","['Nozick', 'Robert Nozick', 'Principle of Rectification', 'Justice in holdings', 'Slavery', 'Libertarianism', 'Anarchy, State, and Utopia', 'Counterfactuals', 'The Rate of Interest and Historical Injustices', 'Amount of Unpaid Slave Wages', 'Invisible Hand Theorem']"
