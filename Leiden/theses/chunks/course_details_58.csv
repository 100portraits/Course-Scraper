No Planet Big Enough for the Both of Us: the emotions of nationalist discourse in the era of climate change,"Mundt, Heloisa","['Smith, Karen']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The acknowledgement of climate change as a contemporary existential threat to humankind has been prompting scholarly debate on how it might influence the future of nation-states, nationalism, and their makings. This theoretical discussion has notably included the question of whether appealing to the emotions of nationalism could make national communities willing to make the effort and sacrifice needed to tackle climate change. It remains to be questioned, however, what are the implications of resorting to the affective blueprint provided by nationalism in the era of climate change in both scholarship and policymaking. By performing Qualitative Content Analysis and Emotional Discourse Analysis, this work aims to address this question by empirically mapping the narratives and emotions of the nationalist environmental rhetoric of President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration in Brazil, one that portrays climate change as a threat to the nation-state’s identity and sovereignty and yet explicitly advances climate denialism. The empirical results indicate three core problems with the emotions of nationalism in the era of climate change as they entail five distinct types of exclusions. It is hoped that this research can provide evidence of what the implications of resorting to nationalism may be as far-right nativist populism makes its way into global politics. Importantly, it also seeks to dialogue with attempts at creating typologies of national discourses engaging with climate change and with methodological efforts to systematically incorporate emotions as a promising level of analysis in International Relations research.","['nationalism', 'climate change', 'Jair Bolsonaro', 'Brazil', 'emotions']"
Does Mass Media Affect or Accommodate Public Opinion? A case study of three American outlets framing the issue of the Israeli settlements,"Nanou, Athanasia","['Schonmann, N.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Mass Media and Public Opinion constitute crucial fields in most democratic societies. Yet, their relationship remains uncertain in terms of causality. Some researchers argue that mass media have a significant influence on public opinion, while others contend that public opinion is shaped primarily by real-world events and in turn influences their media coverage. The case study of this paper is the American media coverage of the Israeli settlements. The stimulus for this study was the change in American public opinion; in particular, a 2021 survey revealed a slight rise in the support for the Palestinian side and a gradual decrease in the support for the Israeli one, which is a rare phenomenon, given that the American public opinion has remained stable and pro-Israeli for a long time. Therefore, the question that has been generated based on the change in the American polls is whether this decrease in the support of the Israelis is aligning with the framing being used by the media and specifically with the coverage of the Israeli settlements.","['Public Opinion, Mass Media, American Media, Israeli Settlements']"

Learning to Feel European: A curriculum study on European identity,"Kooge, Mats","['Gerrits, A.W.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"A socio-historical, comparative curriculum study in both time (1945-2010s) and space (France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) concerning the representation of European identity in two types of secondary school curricula: the formal curricula of these four Western European countries and the so-called 'ideological curricula' consisting out of international recommendations from the Council of Europe and UNESCO. The starting point of the research is that a majority of citizens in the European Union consider themselves to feel 'European' in one way or another according to Eurobarometer surveys. The thesis further explores the relationship with curriculum reforms and international educational organisations since 1945. The idea of having complementary, international forms of identity and citizenship requires the increase of international understanding among citizens over time. Meanwhile, fostering international understanding has generally been the main purpose of UNESCO. Curriculum construction is a comprehensive, unfathomable process, but the four cases of formal curricula demonstrate the rise of a global scope in history education throughout the decades. The thesis suggests that education can be understood as a gearwheel accelerating the processes of European integration that were already in place.","['Curriculum', 'Europeanness', 'Identity', 'Education', 'Citizenship', 'Council of Europe', 'UNESCO']"

The Anorexic Quest for Liberation and the Salvific Promise of Early Buddhism: Contextualizing Self-Discipline,"Näpänkangas, Emma",['J.Li'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Filosofie (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Anorexia Nervosa is a debilitating illness characterized by the limitation of food intake and a fear of weight gain. While we might at face value take the illness to be irrational, within this project we find that the dangerous condition is fueled by a foundation of justifications based on shared cultural ideas and the values derived from them. I will argue that anorexia occurs when an individual manages to embody attitudes of mind, body, and desire found in the Western philosophical tradition. For the anorexic, rather than being a project of vanity, losing weight can be understood as a spiritual project of transcending the human body and dissolving craving, thus, a quest for liberation. The illness functions in a way in which the anorexic individual sees the world through a filter that seeks out motivation to continue starving, as the self-denial is so extreme that it goes against the individual’s basic human instinct of survival and thus requires constant fuel to persist. What I call the anorexic worldview is a system of values and beliefs that promises the individual who adopts it liberation through transcending one’s ordinary humanity and becoming invulnerable, but at the end of the day, this worldview serves merely the contrary purpose of powering the mental and physical deterioration of the individual. Interestingly, themes inherent to anorexia such as a negative view of the body and the strict denial of craving are also prevalent in early Buddhist philosophy.","['Embodiment', 'Buddhism', 'Anorexia', 'Cartesian Dualism', 'Christian Theology', 'Foucault', 'Feminism', 'Theravada']"

Attention to Type: using a Convolutional Neural Network to identify colonial Korean printshops,"Pol, Aron van de",['Prof.dr. R.E. Breuker'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Korean peninsula knows a long history of book culture, and attention to it has ranged from the earliest known texts to the recently growing interest in modern Korean literature that came with the ‘Korean wave’. Many of the now canonical works find their roots in the colonial era in Korea (1910-1945) and various aspects pertaining to textual production during this era have been researched by scholars. However, an often-overlooked history is that of the printers and printshops in colonial Korea who had a significant influence over book production. With this loss of primary source material directly stemming from these printshops, the only other source indicating the printer of a text is the included colophon. This colophon is often damaged or simply missing in older books, and to this date there is no efficient method to recover this lost information. Thereby preventing any sizeable quantitative study of printshops in colonial Korea. This MA Thesis will examine the possibility of using convolutional neural networks (ConvNet) to identify the printshop of a given text dating to colonial Korea in order to allow large- scale quantitative research into colonial Korean printshops, which has been impossible thus far It will do this through a case study approach that aims to successfully classify books of four colonial Korean printshops, namely, the Hansŏng Tosŏ Chusik Hoesa (漢城圖書株式會社), Taedong inswaeso (大東印刷所), Sinmungwan (新文館), and Chosŏn inswae chusik hoesa (朝鮮印刷株 式會社). The findings here can be applied to a more extensive set of printers, given enough data and time. Therefore, this research is of high importance to the field of Korean history, as it is an essential step in charting the history of colonial Korean printers. Additionally, the benefits gained from this study are also helpful in the field of digital humanities, as this study will not only focus on the production and performance of a model but also include dataset construction and model explainability. The latter is a vital part and often missing in other DH scholarly work related to ConvNets. Hence, this paper is highly relevant to Korean historical research, and its methodology can be used far beyond the context of colonial-era printshops.","['Korean Studies', 'Colonial Korea', 'Digital Humanities', 'AI', 'Convolutional Neural Networks']"

Modern Freedom,"Valk, Rutger de",['Bruno Verbeek'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"I provide an analysis of modern freedom, introduced by de Dijn. I claim that modern freedom is a vague and ambiguous concept, influenced by many different conceptions throughout history, which all have had different ideas about freedom and the value of freedom within a political context, and that they are all still relevant to this day. To defend this claim, this thesis makes two arguments. The first is that the conceptions of freedom that form the basis of modern freedom, show many differences in their conceptions and valuations of freedom. If the conceptions on which modern freedom is based are diverse and different, it would seem that modern freedom is not a homogeneous conception, but instead an assembly of different ideas and values that can change depending on the context of the discussion in which it is named. The second argument is that there are many elements in De Dijn’s conception of modern freedom that can be traced back to her notion of democratic freedom, which would suggest that the ‘decisive breach’ that De Dijn describes is not as decisive as she claims it was. Instead, while new elements were introduced, our modern conception of freedom has been influenced by both ancient and modern ideas on freedom, leading to a broad and vague, context-dependent conception of freedom in modern times.","['Freedom', 'Negative Freedom', 'Positive Freedom']"
Practical and Normative Challenges for the Serious Conceptual Engineer,"Wierenga, Niek",['Dr. W.F. Kalf'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This dissertation starts by defending that if the conceptual engineer is serious about the new contemporary project of conceptual engineering, the conceptual engineer aims to (at least) change the semantic meaning or the psychological structure of concepts used by most people in a standing language. I continue by arguing that based on this ‘serious’ definition of the conceptual engineer, the new field of conceptual engineering has three practical and normative challenges to overcome before the method can be what its primary participants want it to be. The first problem that is discussed is the widely recognised implementation problem. I discuss various proposed solutions to this problem but conclude that they do not solve the problem. The second significant challenge is what I call the evaluation dilemma. In short, this is the dilemma that the conceptual engineer faces if the engineer could implement conceptual change but has to consider based on what parameters a concept ought to be evaluated. I defend that the first horn of the dilemma that the engineer can take is considering all things about a concept. I argue that this is practically impossible. The second horn of the dilemma will only consider one or a small set of parameters to evaluate a concept. However, my argument is that this will likely lead to more unintended problems than the initial amelioration would solve. Finally, I discuss what I call two motivation problems for the conceptual engineer. The first motivation problem is the problem of accounting for the biassed motivations of the conceptual engineer. I argue that the subjective motivations of the engineer are problematic and that such motivations are likely to lead to the wrong-kind-of-reason-problem. The second motivation problem contends that if the conceptual engineer is successful in his project, one or a small group of engineers has conceptual power over large groups of people. I argue that the conceptual engineer owes us a justification for the motivation to gain such power. In short, based on the serious definition of the conceptual engineer, the new field of conceptual engineering has both practical and normative challenges to overcome before the method can be what its primary participants want it to be.","['Normative challenges', 'conceptual engineer', 'conceptual engineering', 'Implementation Problem', 'Evaluation Dilemma', 'externalist challenge']"

This thesis focuses on the Central Park Five and how the New York Times and the Washington Post described and presented the boys in the media storm. In what way did the New York Times and the Washington Post frame the Central Park Five around the trial, meaning before, during, and after the exoneration in 2002 and the settlement with the city of New York in 2014? Previous research concerning this case study has primarily focused on details of the case and other aspects. This research uses framing theory and the White Racial Frame to show patterns of racial frames in the two newspapers. The research shows that while the racial narratives were prevalent around the trial, they became less visible after decades had passed. This thesis demonstrates that how the boys were depicted was highly influenced by their time. With the years going by, the frame changed as well. In the end, the men were viewed positively instead of demonized.","['Central Park Five', 'Racism', 'Framing Theory', 'History', 'African-American History', 'White Racial Frame', 'Media', 'Framing', 'Central Park Jogger Case', 'New York Times', 'Washington Post', 'Mass Hysteria', 'Exoneration', 'Settlement']"
"“I Am a Kenyan Citizen, but my Identity is also Somali"": The Kenyan-Somali Feelings of Citizenship and Belonging in Nairobi.","Farah, Layla",['G.J. Abbink'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Somalis have been living in Kenya since the colonial era. They were brought to Nairobi by British administrators in the 1800s to be a part of the labour force. Under colonial rule, Somalis were considered to be perceived as racially ambiguous, and this perception remained after the departure of the British from Kenya. The Kenyan state has historically treated the ethnic Somali group in Kenya as “other” by having Kenyan-Somalis continuously prove their citizenship in the form of mass detainments, or through screening processes. This can have an effect on how Kenyan-Somalis feel in Kenya. This leads to the research question: “What are the feelings of citizenship and belonging in Kenyan-Somali women in Nairobi and how are they expressed?” The researcher recruited three experts in this field and Kenyan-Somali women who reside in Nairobi. Participants were gathered through snowball sampling. Moreover, the date was collected in the form of semi-structured interviews which would then be analysed thematically in order to see what their feelings of citizenship and belonging are. The feelings were assessed through three sub-questions. The results indicate that the participants do claim a sense of belonging in Nairobi. This could be associated due to the change in the constitution of 2010 in Kenya. This research also utilised the Allen et al (2021) sense of belonging model, and demonstrated that a sense of belonging has almost been completely achieved. Despite this, perceptions of belonging have not been fully completed. Policies should assess which areas make Kenyan-Somalis feel like they do not belong in Kenya, due to the fact that migration is a recurring theme in society.","['Kenya, Somalia, Citizenship, Belonging, Idenity']"

‘You are the enemy of the American people’’: Een analyse van factcheckkritiek in Facebookcommentaren uit het Trump-tijdperk,"Englebert, Babette",['Michaël Opgenhaffen'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Sinds Donald J. Trumps presidentschap, een periode waarin Trump regelmatig de media bekritiseerde, hebben onderzoeken uitgewezen dat Republikeinen aanzienlijk minder vertrouwen hebben in factcheckmedia dan Democraten (Jennings & Stroud, 2021; Porter et al. 2019; Walter et al., 2019). De vraag is echter of dat enkel aan Trump ligt; blootstelling aan factcheckkritiek online kan er ook aan bijdragen dat mediaconsumenten wantrouwiger worden naar de media (Houston et al., 2011). In dit onderzoek is daarom in kaart gebracht welke vormen van factcheckkritiek voorkomen in Facebookreacties onder factcheckberichten over presidentskandidaten uit 2016 en 2020. Hierbij werd ook bekeken of er verschillende vormen van factcheckkritiek voorkwamen in 2016 en in 2020, of mediaconsumenten andere kritiek leveren op pro-Democratische en pro-Republikeinse factchecks en of deze commentaren onderbouwd en zonder onbeleefd taalgebruik worden geformuleerd – twee belangrijke pijlers voor constructieve kritiek. Zeven verschillende vormen van kritiek werden geïdentificeerd: 1) Kritiek op eenzijdige berichtgeving, 2) Kritiek op inaccuraatheid, 3) Kritiek op onvolledigheid, 4) Kritiek op onbetrouwbaarheid, 5) Kritiek op irrelevante inhoud, 6) Kritiek op incompetentie en 7) Persoonlijke aanval zonder duidelijk standpunt. Deze kritieken zijn over het algemeen te relateren aan eerder onderzoek naar mediakritiek, maar factcheckkritiek heeft ook eigen, unieke eigenschappen. Er werden bovendien verschillen opgemerkt tussen factchecks uit 2016 en 2020 en tussen pro-Democratische en proRepublikeinse factchecks, die onder andere aantonen dat Trump gedurende zijn presidentschap heeft beïnvloed hoe mediaconsumenten kritiek geven op factcheckmedia. Daarnaast bleek dat enkel Kritiek op inaccuraatheid en Kritiek op onvolledigheid prominent aanwezig waren in commentaren met onderbouwing en zonder onbeleefd taalgebruik. Mogelijke oorzaken en implicaties van deze bevindingen worden besproken.","['Factcheck', 'Presidentsverkiezingen', 'Facebook', 'Sociale media', 'Trump', 'commentaren', 'kritiek', 'online', 'Clinton', 'Biden', 'Verenigde Staten']"

Weapons of War? - Debating the Practice of Sexualized Violence Perpetrated by Islamist Terror Organizations,"Eing, Nele","['Duijvesteijn, I.G.B.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Sexualized violence perpetrated by terrorist organizations is a prevalent issue that has continuously been identified as a pressing issue and even a “disturbing trend” in international terrorism. However, the conflation of concepts explaining or defining sexual terror exacerbated by the issue of no universally agreed definition of terrorism blurs explanations of sexualized violence. Furthermore, academic debates do not differ in the instrumentality of their explanations referring to sexualized violence as a tool, weapon, strategy, or tactic, putting sexualized violence at a means-end framework and categorizing it merely as a method to achieve a particular goal while neglecting the act’s social construction and the human factor. This thesis attempted to move beyond the instrumentality lens by utilizing practice theory to investigate patterns of sexualized violence perpetrated by Islamist terrorist organizations using the cases of Boko Haram's targeting of Christian students and the IS' brutal campaign against the Yezidis. The comparison of the two cases demonstrates that the practice of sexualized violence perpetrated by Islamist terrorist organizations is neither singular nor extraordinary. Instead, it presents itself as reoccurring pattern even among different communities of practice, thus, indicating a continuum in the practice of sexualized violence. Hence, by utilizing practice theory, the thesis argues for a more multi-dimensional analysis of sexualized violence, including previously neglected parameters of context, patterns, and discourses inciting and justifying the abuse.","['Practice Theory, Islamist terrorism, Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, Islamic State, Boko Haram']"

To be or not to be engaged?

Yet, compared to volunteers and volunteer tourism organizations (VTOs), host communities receive the least attention in studies on voluntourism. This research has been devoted to bring forward the local, Ghanaian perspective on Western volunteers in community development projects. Results from semi-structured interviews with community members of Tinkong, Ghana, indicate that support from outside, including from Western volunteers, is considered necessary for Ghanaian communities to further develop. At the same time, true contact between volunteers and hosts mostly lacks, which forms a profound barrier to the establishment of cross-cultural interaction. Besides, the way participants speak of Western engagements reveals that their judgement is not just based on the kind of work that Western NGOs or private organizations do, but that it also strongly relates to factors that go beyond the impact of volunteers themselves, such as Ghana’s political situation. More longitudinal research on voluntourism helps in working towards the holistic, multi-disciplinary understanding of the topic that is needed.","['voluntourism', 'Ghana', 'host perspective', 'Western engagements', 'community development']"

Contemporary art as a catalyst of change: reviving neglected rural communities in Japan through the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale and the Setouchi Triennale,"Deun, Anaïs Van",['Prof.dr. K.J. Cwiertka'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale (ETAT) and the Setouchi Triennale (ST), two of the largest and best-known Art Triennale in (and outside) Japan, and considers how these art festivals intend to provide a solution to the continuing ageing population and declining birthrate in Japanese rural areas. Japan contains the largest proportion of elderly people in the world and its population continues to decline since 2004. Yet, this decrease is especially severe in rural areas because the majority of the population consist of elderly people. The Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale (ETAT) and the Setouchi Triennale (ST), have been established as strategies to tackle Japan’s increasingly ageing population. The former was established by Kitagawa Fram (1946-present) whereas the latter was co-founded in 2010 by Kitagawa Fram and Fukutake Sōichirō (1945/46-present). The common aim of the ETAT and ST initially seems to be the restoration of these economically declining rural areas through contemporary art projects. Yet, this thesis claims that Kitagawa’s and Fukutake’s idealistic views about the countryside and ‘traditional’ countryside lifestyles resulted into their attempt to reshape Japanese society by reidentifying neglected rural areas through contemporary art. This is because both men’s strong partnership and their active involvement in both Triennale shape these art festivals according to their own convictions and objectives. Therefore, this thesis demonstrates that the ETAT and ST’s purpose exceeds rural revitalization and is actually about the creation of a ‘new’ society which is brought together by the art festivals.","['Japan', 'art festivals', 'rural revitalization', 'Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale', 'Setouchi Triennale', 'satoyama', 'furusato', 'reshaping of society']"

How Solutions in The Built Environment Can Mitigate the Urban Heat Island Effect in Dense Cities: Examining Nature-Inclusive and Technical Urban Design Options for The Hague,"Westhoff, Fleur","['Visser, M.D.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Cities are expanding and becoming denser resulting in an imbalance of radiation, heat, water, and vegetation present in cities causing a typical urban climate that is warmer than its surrounding areas – also known as the Urban Heat Island Effect. The increase in temperature causes the human body to experience thermal discomfort. Heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems minimise the impact of thermal stresses indoors, however, these kinds of systems cause a significant rise in energy consumption and anthropogenic waste heat, resulting in even more pressure on the human body and increasingly rising temperatures in the city. Solutions to mitigate the UHI phenomenon often include large-scale implementation of green-blue structures, however, in dense cities, this is not always possible. Smaller-scaled nature-inclusive and technical solutions that can be implemented at the dimension of individual buildings will be investigated such as cool roofs, green roofs, and underground thermal energy storage. Green, vegetated, roofs appear to be an excellent small-scale solution. The physiological equivalent temperature (PET) of the ten hottest and ten coolest neighbourhoods in The Hague are analysed for the presence of green roofs and roof surface area. Moreover, additional neighbourhood characteristics such as the presence of vegetation in the surroundings and income levels are collected to investigate the suitability of green roof implementation. Based on a statistical analysis there can be concluded that the neighbourhoods experiencing the highest heat stress are the neighbourhoods with the lowest level of green roof coverage while having the highest amount of roof surface area at their disposal. Considering the lower levels of vegetation present and the relatively lower average income in these neighbourhoods, the implementation of green roofs seems an excellent strategy to mitigate the UHI effect in The Hague and dense city neighbourhoods with similar characteristics.","['built-environment, urban heat island, mitigation measures, nature-inclusive design, surface energy budget']"

Does musical expertise facilitate mastering L2 prosody? A study with Dutch L2 speakers of English,"Voevodina, Veronika","['Witteman, J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The present study attempted at answering the research question whether musical expertise facilitates acquisition of L2 prosodic features, since the effect of transfer from musical to linguistic auditory processing skills was claimed by several studies. The study examined the productions of a small text by 134 L1 English and Dutch L2 English speakers with different amounts of musical experience. Multilevel regression analyses were performed to investigate the effect of musicality on the native speaker ratings, and distance between the L1 and L2 F0 range and speaking rate. Native speaker ratings proved to be unreliable, and there was a trend for higher musicality scores to predict larger F0 range distances from the native mean, contrary to the hypotheses. Based on the obtained results it was impossible to claim a positive correlation between musical expertise and more nativelike L2 prosody production. The paper concludes by discussing the methodological limitations and suggesting other prosodic features to measure in the future studies.","['L2 prosody, musical expertise']"
Hostile Reader Effect? Een onderzoek naar de invloed van het Hostile Media Effect op de werkwijze van factcheckers.,"Vocking, Valerie",['Michaël Opgenhaffen'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie wordt de impact van het Hostile Media Effect (HME) op de werkwijze van factcheckers onderzocht, en daarmee ook het bestaan van het Hostile Reader Effect (HRE) aangetoond. Het HME staat voor de neiging onder sommige lezers om ‘de (massa)media’ als vijandig en bevooroordeeld te bestempelen, en vanuit die visie kritiek of haat te uiten op mediakanalen. De wijze waarop factcheckers rekening houden met HME-gerelateerde uitingen in hun werkwijze wordt in deze scriptie uitgelegd als het Hostile Reader Effect. Dit onderzoek bestaat uit een literatuurstudie en diepte-interviews met factcheckers. Elf factcheckers werkzaam voor zeven verschillende organisaties actief in Nederland en Vlaanderen hebben meegewerkt. Om een totaalbeeld te krijgen van de impact van het HME op hun werkwijze, is gekozen voor een focus op drie grote onderdelen van hun werk: het selecteren van factcheckwaardige onderwerpen, de formulering van factchecks en de verspreiding van de factchecks op sociale media. Bij elk van deze onderdelen is gevraagd naar de soorten reacties die factcheckers daarop krijgen, en hoe zij daarmee omgaan. Op deze manier wordt een brug geslagen tussen het HME en het HRE.","['factchecking', 'journalistiek']"

Finding the Foxes: An Analysis of Cognitive Styles used by Experts in International Relations,"Holthaus, Arthur","['Milveski, L']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The field of International Relations (IR) is dominated by experts whose source of authority is opaque to the public. However, in 2005 Tetlock’s Expert Political Judgement revealed the inaccuracies in expert predictions. As prediction is a defining feature of a maturing discipline, these results undermine the authority of IR experts. Tetlock found that accurate predictors “are moderates who factor conflicting considerations—in a flexible, weighted-averaging fashion—into their final judgments.” Six traits distinguish the cognitive style of these ‘foxes’ from their opposite, the ‘hedgehogs.’ This thesis converts these traits into a signal-analysis that can be used to determine the cognitive style of a piece of writing. This analysis is applied to a selection of six essays from the same source. The results generally corroborate Tetlock’s findings. Foxes make more modest predictions and avoid the pitfalls of overconfidence while hedgehogs make bolder claims which decreases their accuracy. It is also discovered that there is rigidity in the application of IR theory. Parsimonious applications of theory are favoured, which causes IR foxes to distance themselves from theory altogether. To restore experts’ IR authority, new theories need to be crafted which can integrate dissonant theories.","['International Relations, Expertise, Forecasting, Prediction, Tetlock, Berlin, Foxes, Hedgehogs']"

“Wie is de schuldige?”: Een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse naar de framing van Leidse zedenzaken in rechtbankverslagen van het Leidsch Nieuwsblad in de perioden 1980-1989 en 2010-2019,"Schipper, Julia","['Burger, J.P.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het aantal zedenzaken in Nederland neemt toe. De manier waarop rechtbankverslaggevers verslag doen van deze zaken verandert door de tijd. Er is echter nog weinig onderzoek gedaan naar framing in rechtbankverslagen. Het doel van deze masterscriptie is om te analyseren op welke manier rechtszaken geframed worden, en dan specifiek hoe zedenzaken geframed worden. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: “Hoe worden Leidse zedenzaken geframed in het Leidsch Dagblad tussen 1980-1989 en 2010-2019?” Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd met behulp van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse, gefocust op framing. Deze analyse toont aan dat in de periode van 1980-1989 het ‘onschuldige dader-frame’ en het ‘machtsverhoudingen-frame’ overheersen. Dat betekent dat de artikelen uit dit eerste tijdvak enerzijds het beeld scheppen dat er verzachtende omstandigheden zijn waaronder de dader een zedenmisdrijf heeft gepleegd. Anderzijds bevatten de artikelen uit deze periode elementen waardoor wordt benadrukt dat er een machtsverschil is tussen de dader en het slachtoffer. De tweede onderzochte periode is recenter, namelijk 2010-2019. Een analyse van deze periode laat zien dat het ‘perfecte plaatje-frame’ dominant is. Dit frame houdt in dat er in de berichtgeving van de onderzochte rechtbankverslagen een beeld wordt gecreëerd dat er een ideale dader en een ideaal slachtoffer bestaat. De drie dominante frames kunnen gelinkt worden aan verkrachtingsmythen, dat zijn stereotype gedachten rondom seksueel geweld. Dit onderzoek heeft zich alleen gefocust op rechtbankverslagen uit een Leidse krant. Vervolgonderzoek naar het onderwerp van framing in zedenzaken zou kunnen focussen op een grotere scope, bijvoorbeeld rechtbankverslagen uit Nederlandse kranten. Daardoor is de kans groter dat de uitkomsten generaliseerbaar zijn.","['verkrachtingsmythen, framing, zedenzaken']"

Current Strategies for the Digital Curation of NFT Art: Museums as Marketplaces and Metaverse Platforms,"Brownlie, Philippa Jane","['de Wild, Karin']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Despite their recent, steep rise in prominence and value, non-fungible tokens - abbreviated to NFTs - remain a still under-researched form of digital art. Beyond this thesis, no studies have been conducted which address curatorial strategies for their museum exhibition. Such institutions are reputedly technology-averse - a notion reflected in their broadly slow, hesitant uptake and exploration of the NFT medium. Accordingly, this thesis aims to furnish the museum sector with awareness, inspiration, and confidence regarding NFT art, leading to and influencing its future display. It ascertains the extent to which current strategies for NFTs’ digital display reflect the works’ medium-specific attributes as well as that to which they subvert entrenched museum hierarchies between artist, curator, and visitor. To do so, three digital NFT exhibitions and platforms are focalised: Katsushika Hokusai on La Collection, Ethereal Aether in the Celestial Hermitage, and the eponymous Victor Castillo on Decentraland. Each is distinct in its mode of NFT curation and is analysed individually prior to comparatively. Curated by the British Museum and State Hermitage respectively, the initial two platforms stand amongst the largest scale museum engagements with NFT to date. Decentraland is no museum but a user-owned metaverse world within which NFTs are displayed. Its decentralised nature mirrors the form of NFTs themselves, yet whether its mode of exhibition ought to be replicated within the museum sector remains debatable owing to financial and technological barriers. Here, no ideal framework is proposed. Instead, aspects of each platform should both caution and inspire.","['NFT', 'NFT art', 'digital curation', 'museums', 'British Museum', 'Decentraland', 'State Hermitage', 'Celestial Hermitage', 'metaverse', 'digital art']"

This correlation is examined through an analysis of the Messy Realities project, held between 2018 and 2022 at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford; qualitative data provided by the project team is reviewed and compared to similar initiatives based in the United Kingdom. This research has found that the Messy Realities project had positive outcomes on the health and wellbeing of the project’s community participants: these outcomes were found to be related to role enactment practices, object handling activities, and to the museum as a collaborative environment. Nevertheless, further research based on quantitative evidence is recommended to unequivocally demonstrate a positive correlation between collaborative museum projects and the enhancement of health and wellbeing.","['museums', 'health', 'well-being']"

Factchecken in een tijdperk van mis- en desinformatie: een les in verticaal en lateraal lezen. Een kwalitatief en kwantitatief onderzoek naar online verifiëring door Nederlandse journalistiekstudenten en factcheckers om de betrouwbaarheid van webinformatie vast te stellen.,"Wijzenbroek, Xanthe -","['Burger, J.P.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"We bevinden ons midden in een informatierevolutie waarin we steeds meer leren over de wereld via ons computerscherm in plaats van de papieren krant. Hoewel het internet de toegang tot informatie heeft gedemocratiseerd hebben mis- en desinformatie zich kunnen wortelen in de maalstroom aan informatie. Dit legt een grote verantwoordelijkheid bij het publiek om informatie op betrouwbaarheid te beoordelen. Deze replicatiestudie van het onderzoek van Wineburg en McGrew (2017) heeft als doel om diegenen te onderzoeken die ervaring hebben in het evalueren en verifiëren van online informatie om te begrijpen welke strategieën zij gebruiken. Een steekproef is getrokken van twintig personen: tien factcheckers en tien journalistiekstudenten. Deze groepen worden geobserveerd terwijl zij digitale bronnen over sociale en politieke kwesties verifiëren. Onderzocht wordt: welke researchstrategie – vertical reading en/of lateral reading – hanteren Nederlandse factcheckers en journalistiekstudenten om de betrouwbaarheid van webinformatie te beoordelen? Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat journalistiekstudenten en factcheckers een mengvorm van vertical en lateral reading toepassen wanneer zij webinformatie verifiëren. Ze beginnen verticaal en bekijken de kenmerken van een website. Vervolgens verlaten ze de website om in nieuwe tabbladen de betrouwbaarheid van de oorspronkelijke bron te beoordelen. Factcheckers leggen in hun zoektocht de nadruk op lateral reading, waardoor ze in kortere tijd tot meer gegronde conclusies komen dan studenten die vaker vertical reading gebruiken. Desondanks illustreren de bevindingen dat zowel factcheckers als journalistiekstudenten voldoende voorbereid zijn om zich te navigeren in het digitale landschap.

Der Furchtbarste Krieg: The search for a negotiated peace by the German Empire in the First World War,"Scholma, Dylan","['Dassen, P.G.C.', 'Tazelaar, R.S.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Germany went into the war in the belief that the war would be intense, but that it would be comparatively short and manageable. This way of thinking was not particularly driven by well thought out theories, instead it was a product of necessity. Because there was no substitute for the Schlieffen plan, in combination with the slow descent of the conflict in into a static bloodbath, German politicians and military leaders tried to find another way out of the catastrophe that the war had devolved into. These factors would eventually result in increasing pressure for the conclusion of the war through a peace initiative. This research paper set out to outline three major arguments. Firstly, that the main German peace offers were sincere in trying to conclude a negotiated peace. Secondly, that there was significant support for peace initiatives both in the general populace and in the military and political elite, although it did vary greatly per initiative. And finally, that the war dragged on because the minimum terms of both sides were deemed unacceptable by the governments and populations which put significant pressure on governments. This view directly contradicts the long-held argumentation along the lines of the Fischer-these and its later iterations which state that the peace initiatives were mainly a ruse and that the sole goal of the German government was the domination of Europe through extensive annexations and creating a network of puppet states. Especially the 1916 general peace offer is a strong piece of evidence that there were significant elements surrounding Bethmann-Hollweg and the Kaiser in the German state that were ready to conclude a peace without these extensive demands. Furthermore, the plethora of enthusiastic newspaper articles in combination with the support of mass-parties like the SPD and Zentrum for some of the proposals indicate that at least some of these peace initiatives could count on significant support from the German population.","['First World War', 'Diplomacy', 'Germany', 'Peace negotiations']"
"The Master’s Tools: an inquiry into the work of James Marion Sims, Gender, Race, Class and Ability","van der Pol, Coos","['Pargas, D.A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"James Marion Sims (1813-1883) is known as the ‘godfather of gynaecology.’ This American doctor had a career spanning Alabama, New York City and even undertook a European tour. He founded the United States’ first Woman’s Hospital, but one of his first major contributions to medicine was finding a cure for vesico-vaginal fistula: the tearing of the vaginal wall due to trauma. This launched his career in medicine. However, he found this cure by performing medical experiments on enslaved Black women in his private clinic. In the Woman’s Hospital his patients were predominantly Irish immigrant women from the working classes of the city. This research explores what made it possible for a White man such as Sims to perform these unethical experiments on these women, who were racialised as Black. Through Foucault’s concept of the medical gaze and Kimberlé Crenshaw’s intersectional feminist critique, this thesis explores the professionalisation of medicine in the nineteenth century, scientific racism, the genesis of gynaecology, racial formation, medical experimentation and how Sims fits into these structures. The focus is the identity formation of Sims himself and his patients, who were intersectionally marginalised. Considering their race, class, ability and gender, one can reconstruct how they fit into the fabric of American society, and why exactly Sims and his colleagues were allowed to experiment on enslaved, working class, ill women when they never considered treating more privileged women (or men) in such a manner.","['James Marion Sims', 'Slavery', 'Irish Diaspora', 'Indigent Women', 'Gynaecology', 'Gynecology', 'Reproductive Healthcare', 'Women’s History', 'Woman’s Hospital', 'New York City', 'Medical Racism', 'Medical Experimentation', 'Intersectionality', 'Intersectional Feminism', 'Feminism', 'Reproductive Justice', 'Bodily Autonomy', 'Childbirth', 'American History', 'Subaltern History', 'Working Class History']"
Vriend of vijand: Een onderzoek naar de manier waarop journalisten medisch experts bevragen in talkshows ten tijde van de coronacrisis,"Harreman, Elodie","['Pleijter, A.R.J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Journalisten oefenen een grote invloed uit op de manier waarop het publiek de sociale werkelijkheid interpreteert en hiernaar handelt. Helemaal ten tijde van crisissituaties, zoals tijdens de uitbraak van een virus, is het daarom belangrijk dat journalisten het publiek van relevante en accurate informatie voorzien. Journalisten maken hierbij graag gebruik van expertbronnen, omdat experts in het huidige medialandschap een inherente betrouwbaarheid en geloofwaardigheid krijgen toebedeeld. Echter, uit eerder onderzoek blijkt dat journalisten niet altijd even nauwkeurig met experts omgaan, waardoor het publiek overdreven of foutief wordt geïnformeerd. Daarnaast worden journalisten er dikwijls van beschuldigd te veel gericht te zijn op conflict, spanning en drama, voornamelijk op televisie en in talkshows. In dit licht is het de vraag op welke manier journalisten medisch experts bevragen in Nederlandse talkshows tijdens de coronacrisis; de vraag die in dit onderzoek centraal stond. Om een zo nauwkeurig mogelijk beeld van de daadwerkelijke praktijk van journalistiek brongebruik te geven, lag in dit onderzoek de focus op de vragen en reacties van journalisten. Hiermee zou in tegenstelling tot eerder onderzoek ook de invloed van journalisten op de berichtgeving van bronnen meegenomen kunnen worden. Het nieuwsinterview was het genre dat voor dit onderzoek het meest geschikt werd geacht. Echter, antwoord op de vraag hoe journalisten specifiek medisch experts in Nederlandse talkshows bevragen, bleek niet in bestaande theorieën van dit genre gevonden te kunnen worden. Zo richtte eerder onderzoek naar nieuwsinterviews zich voornamelijk op de Anglo-Amerikaanse context, politici als geïnterviewden en persconferenties als contextuele setting. Daarnaast ontbrak het in de wetenschappelijke literatuur aan een analysemodel waarmee de vragen en reacties van journalisten systematisch in kaart gebracht konden worden. Uitbreiding van het onderzoeksveld van nieuwsinterviews was voor bovenstaande onderzoeksvraag dus nodig; hetgeen dit onderzoek middels het ontwikkelen van een categorisering en een nieuw analysemodel van mogelijke vragen en reacties van journalisten heeft gedaan. Met dit nieuwe analysemodel is het namelijk niet alleen mogelijk om meer systematisch inzicht te geven in de manier waarop journalisten met (in dit geval specifiek) medisch experts tijdens de coronacrisis omgaan; ook wordt in het nieuwe analysemodel de (indirecte) invloed van journalisten op de antwoorden van de geinterviewden en dus op de totstandkoming van het nieuws meegenomen. In het nieuwe analysemodel wordt namelijk een onderscheid gemaakt tussen neutralistische en sturende categorieën, waarbij de tweede categorie inzicht geeft in de invloed van de journalist op de geïnterviewde. Hiermee geeft verdere toepassing van het nieuwe analysemodel nauwkeuriger inzicht in de manier waarop berichtgeving tot stand komt en in de manier waarop journalisten met hun bronnen omgaan.","['journalistiek', 'brongebruik', 'expertbronnen', 'talkshows', 'coronacrisis', 'vragen']"

O'Malley""]",2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"For many years the African continent was seen and framed as non-participant in international politics: the recipient of aid; the victim of wars and structural adjustment; and ruined by ethnic conflicts and corruption. This discourse is dominated by neo-realism, neo-liberalism, and the dependency theory. Growing Sino-Africa relations, since the 1990s, were immediately seen by Western academics, politicians, and journalists within the narrative of this discourse. China was accused of neo-colonialism, challenging Western efforts to promote development, democracy, and peace on the continent. In research to Sino-Africa relations, the competition between China and the West takes centre stage, but African perspectives are often overlooked. The question to why Africans engage with the Chinese is answered through the lens of neo-realism, neo-liberalism, or the dependency theory. In 2007, the DRC and a Chinese consortium signed the Sicomines agreement. This agreement is an RFI-deal. In short, the Chinese invest in infrastructure projects and will be repaid in the future from a resource extraction project (the Chinese partners received mining rights to cobalt and copper). In this relationship the Chinese stressed mutual benefits. The agreement was immediately criticized by Western actors, politicians, OECD, academics, IMF, and WB, and eventually led to a renegotiated deal. However, Western criticism that the agreement is skewed in favour of the Chinese is still present (today). So far, no research has been conducted whether the agreement was really skewed in favour of the Chinese, but this question also implied that the Congolese, as a weaker party, had nothing to say in drafting and implementing the agreement. Was there no ability for the Congolese to exercise agency? In this thesis, Congolese agency within Sicomines is the starting point. Therefore, it researches to what extent the Congolese were able to exercise agency in the agreement. Agency is understood as a space to act for an actor within the structure it is embedded, therefore this thesis aims to take a decolonial approach in which the focus is centred on the agency subjects have within these structures. Traditional accounts of African agency, in which they are not more than passive recipient or victim, are challenged. The timeframe for this research is 2007-2018. In 2007 the agreement was drafted, but the research also takes implementation into account. In 2018, the president under who the deal was drafted and signed lost the elections and the future of Sicomines between 2018 and 2021 remain unsure. For this reason, 2007-2018 was chosen. The research paper reveals that the Congolese were able to exercise agency and that it is not clear that the agreement is skewed in favour of the Chinese.","['Sicomines Agreement, Democratic Republic of the Congo, bilateral development cooperation, agency']"

An Inventive Copy or an Authentic Reproduction? The Creative Freedom of the Painter Paul Tétar van Elven in his Copies of Raphael’s Sistine Madonna,"Fransen, Jessie","['Bussels, S.P.M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Copying other artists' paintings was an essential practice in the nineteenth century and has a rich culture. For art students, copying and that way learning from the old masters was seen as a vital element of their education. Also for artists it was essential to control the techniques of great artists to develop their inventiveness. The Sistine Madonna altarpiece by Raphael (1483-1520) was famous among students and artists who wanted to copy Raphael’s painting skills, sell a copy on the art market, or keep it in their possession. This painting also caught the attention of Paul Tétar van Elven (1823-1896), a Dutch artist who made nine painted (partial) copies of the Sistine Madonna next to some drawings. However, some of Tétar's copies are not faithfully copied, but instead, he has managed to add his own touches. This research investigates the copying culture and creative freedom of copyists in the nineteenth century, treating the copies of the Sistine Madonna by Paul Tétar van Elven after Raphael as a case study. The research question of this thesis therefore addresses the context in which the nineteenth-century Dutch artist Paul Tétar van Elven added his own touches to his (partial) copies of the Sistine Madonna after Raphael.","['Paul Tétar van Elven', 'Raphael', 'The Sistine Madonna', 'nineteenth century', 'copying', 'copies', 'painting', 'drawing']"

Sentiment Analysis of Naver comments: How Chinese Sanctions Affected Korean Public Opinion,"Poederooijen, Lenthe van","['Yang, S.Y.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2015, the Sino-ROK bilateral relations were the strongest they had been since the establishment of full diplomatic relations in 1992. Due to increasing North Korean nuclear provocations in the following year, the United States and South Korea decided to deploy THAAD, a US missile defense system. China felt that the presence of THAAD on the Korean peninsula infringed on Chinese national security and decided to impose informal sanctions on South Korea. The sanctions damaged the Sino-ROK ties, and Korean people’s opinion on China worsened drastically. This thesis examines the change in sentiment during the THAAD conflict and analyzes whether sentiments have improved since the normalization of the Sino-ROK relations since October of 2017 by performing a comment sentiment analysis on responses to newspaper articles that were published on South Korean online platform Naver during key events in the THAAD dispute. After the evaluation, sentiment analysis proved itself to be a good substitute of survey-based research methods as the results reflected existing polling data. Furthermore, this thesis finds that South Korean commenters’ sentiments in regard to China worsened steadily during the conflict and did not improve in the following years due to new issues and disputes arising between the two countries. The increase in anti-Chinese sentiment in the Korean population could make it more difficult to conduct diplomacy with China in the future.","['South Korea', 'China', 'THAAD', 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Sanctions', 'IR']"

Het onderzoek geeft verklaringen voor het vormen van een vertrekintentie en het uiteindelijke besluit om te vertrekken. Dit wordt gedaan door allereerst naar de politieke, sociaal-economische en sociaal-culturele factoren te kijken die trigger vormen voor het ontwikkelen van vertrekintentie. Vervolgens wordt het gehele proces dat doorlopen wordt door een kennismigrant behandeld. Daarbij wordt eerst ingegaan op het onderwijssysteem, vervolgens de arbeidsmarkt en arbeidsparticipatie en uiteindelijk kennismigratie. Als laatste in Hoofdstuk 3 wordt dieper ingezoomd op de genderdimensie in kennismigratie. Naast een vragenlijst gericht naar zowel mannen als vrouwen die gemigreerd naar Nederland zijn, zijn diepte-interviews gehouden met hoogopgeleide gemigreerde vrouwen die werkzaam zijn bij een groot internationaal bank. De resultaten van dit onderzoek laten zien dat verschillende thema’s zoals onderwijs, niet hebben van een vooruitzicht en de economische ondergang of voorspellingen van economische ondergang als belangrijkste triggers worden geformuleerd door de geïnterviewden. Een nieuw thema geïntroduceerd als resultaat in de interviews is de internationale mindset en directe omgeving met voorbeelden van vertrek. Dit is gedeeltelijk te herleiden naar de westerse manier van onderwijzen, de privé-universiteiten die in de jaren 1980 geopend werden die meer georiënteerd zijn naar het westen en de sociale omgeving. Een verklaring die vrouwen geven voor vrouwen die vertrekken is de globale mindset, onderwijs en sociale omgeving die meer openheid en lef biedt aan vrouwen. Verder onderzoek is nodig om verschillen tussen kennismigranten in verschillende periodes van tijd te onderzoeken, omdat dit onderzoek geen onderscheid maakt in specifiekere periodes van kennismigratie. Dit zou voor de laatste vijf jaar (na de couppoging en de hyperinflatie) anders kunnen zijn dan de migratie daarvoor.","['Kennismigratie', 'Turkije', 'vrouwen in Turkije', 'Turkse kennismigratie', 'Brain drain', 'Brain drain in Turkey']"

Research into the concept of religious coping provides insight into how Catholics and Protestants use their religious beliefs to deal with these types of situations. This thesis focuses on the use and efficacy of religious coping by Protestants and Catholics in the West experiencing a serious medical condition. This is an important topic because studying the relationship between religious coping and distress also shows what beliefs can be helpful or harmful during these situations. It also provides insight into the ways that these religious traditions influence the behavior of individuals whilst experiencing negative life events. The goal of this thesis is to identify the similarities and differences between the use of religious coping among Protestants and Catholics in the West experiencing a serious medical condition. In order to do this the thesis compares three studies on religious coping among Protestants and Catholics in the West. The results of this comparison suggest there are more similarities than differences in the use of religious coping between both groups. However, the efficacy of religious coping appears to differ between the groups. By looking at the core beliefs of the religious traditions this thesis offers possible explanations for these findings. This thesis revealed that the focus of Protestantism on faith as opposed to the Catholic focus on confession could be the reason why Protestants experience more benefits from religious coping in uncontrollable stressful situations. These findings should inspire future researchers to investigate the relations between religious coping and specific religious traditions.","['Religious coping', 'Protestant', 'Catholic', 'Illness']"

The nominal domain in Dutch-English code-switching: insights from acceptability judgments,"Heide, Tessa van der","['Parafita Couto, M.C.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Objectives/research questions: This thesis looks at Dutch-English determiner-noun code-switches and investigates whether there is a preference for the language of the determiner, whether the position of the switched nominal construction and language dominance affect these preferences; and whether these preferences support the predictions of the Minimalist Program (MP), which predicts that the languages with more phi features provides the determiner, or the Matrix Language Frame Model (MLF), which predicts that the determiner will come from the Matrix Language (ML). This thesis also investigates how grammatical gender assignment is resolved in a code-switch involving a Dutch determiner followed by an English noun, and how language dominance affects this. Methodology: The participants (N = 68, aged between 20 – 77) were split into a Dutch-dominant group, an English-dominant group, and a balanced Dutch-English bilingual group, based on their dominance score, which was calculated from their global language score as measured by the Bilingual Language Profile questionnaire. Participants completed two two-alternative forced-choice acceptability tasks (2AFC); one where they evaluated the acceptability of sentences with code-switches between the determiner and the noun that reflected the predictions of the MP, the MLF, of both, or none. The second task tested which Dutch grammatical gender the participant assigned to an English noun. Data and analysis: Results from the first 2AFC were analysed using Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgment, while the results of the second 2AFC task were used to create a frequency distribution of Dutch grammatical gender marking. Results: A general preference for an English determiner followed by a Dutch noun was found, though this preference is influenced by the matrix language of the sentence, the position of the code-switch in the sentence, as well as language dominance of the bilingual. The first task provided evidence supporting both the predictions of the MLF and the MP, as participants preferred a Dutch determiner followed by an English noun in pre-verbal position, which is what the MLF predicts, but participants preferred an English determiner followed by a Dutch noun in post-verbal position, which is what the MP predicts. Results from the second task suggest the common determiner de is preferred for English nouns by all participants, regardless of language dominance and regardless of the grammatical gender of the translation equivalent. Originality: Following Parafita Couto and Stadthagen-González’s methodology (2019), this study is one of the first studies to use the 2AFC acceptability judgment task analysed using Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgment to directly contrast the predictions of the MP and MLF, and is the first study to do so while controlling for language dominance. Furthermore, this study investigates a language pair that has yet to be researched extensively, in addition to investigating how grammatical gender assignment is resolved. Implications: Results provide evidence for a default gender assignment strategy, as well as evidence for a difference in code-switching preferences depending on language dominance. Furthermore, the results support Parafita Couto and Stadthagen-González’s (2019) suggestion that a theory that combines both the MLF and MP would be more useful to explain Dutch-English code-switches than either framework separately.","['Code-switching, Dutch, English, Matrix Language Framework, Minimalist Program, grammatical gender assignment strategy, Determiner, Comparative Judgments']"

W.J. (Ward) Berenschot'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This present study provides a historical correction to a common misinformation on the nature of the Second Kongsi War in West Borneo, between 1850 and 1854. The Chinese settlement of West Borneo were recruited under the authority of Malay sultans to the mining sector in the mid-eighteenth century. Thereafter these immigrants established themselves in the island by building their communities, based on lineages and brotherhood in the vicinity of the mining fields. Gradually, they became independent economically, militarily, and culturally. Within the near one-hundred-and-thirty-year settlement, internal conflicts between the Chinese communities frequently turned into violent and bloody battles. Since the interests of everyone in the region of West Borneo were interrelated, those internal disputes between the Chinese communities, the Chinese and other groups, developed into regional conflicts, involving every party, from Malay sultans and Dayak tribesmen to Europeans and other Chinese counterparts who attempted to remain neutral during the wars. This study specifically centres on the Chinese experience of the Second Kongsi War, between 1850 and 1854, during which different ethnic and political parties in West Borneo were engaged. By employing a bulk of Chinese letters stored at Leiden University Library, I sorted out four strategies used by the Chinese kongsis in West Borneo to win the inter-Chinese war. As a result of these strategies, militarily and diplomatically, the inter-Chinese disputes developed into a regional conflict, with the Dutch colonialists, which were however not beneficial for the kongsis. The wars unfortunately, resulted in serious defeats of the Chinese in 1854, and hence, the decline of the Chinese political institutions of West Borneo by the turn of the mid-nineteenth century.",

This includes shaping the image of countries by including them on the silver screen. Through a case study of five Hollywood films from the 1970s and 2010s, this thesis takes a diachronic in exploring how the Netherlands is represented in American cinema. The concept of verisimilitude is used to determine how well the images of the Netherlands in the movies correspond to the perception of the country from a Dutch person’s perspective. The main points of focus in the analysis are the environment and people. In these sections, it is evident that the inclusion of traditional clothing and landmarks such as windmills is better contextualised in the older films than in the newer ones. In general, when comparing the results between the films from the different decades, it can be concluded that the degree of verisimilitude is relatively higher in the 1970s. In other words, the representation of the Netherlands in American film has become more stereotypical in recent years.","['Film', 'Cultural representation', 'Stereotypes', 'The Netherlands', 'Hollywood']"

In this thesis, ‘perception’ refers to the way that American culture is viewed, and ‘resonance’ indicates the experienced affinity with American culture. This thesis statement is confirmed through the employment of a survey targeted at Dutch youth aged 16-25, in which the Dutch attitudes towards American culture are measured according to the reaction of the Dutch youth to the characterization of American culture as described by Wright and Rogers. They constitute five American values; ‘Freedom’, ‘Prosperity’, ‘Efficiency’, ‘Democracy’ and ‘Fairness’; and some features: ‘Individualism’, and ‘Cultural Pluralism and Tolerance’, which are present in Modern Family. The key finding of the quantitative research is that higher exposure to American popular culture through TV leads to a higher level of normalization of American values. The analysis of exposure levels to American popular culture and its relation to Dutch attitudes towards American culture is performed by comparing the watch histories of respondents: 81% have watched Modern Family whereas 19% have not. Expanding on the concept of ‘Perception’, this thesis demonstrates that the more one is exposed to American popular culture (like the viewers of Modern Family), the more one has normalized the American values, which impacts the Dutch perception of American culture. ‘Resonance’ builds upon this and finds that this normalization of American values among viewers of Modern Family has reached such high extents that they have become incorporated into Dutch culture. American popular culture has boosted the omnipresence and normalization of American values, which has, in turn, impacted the way Dutch youth resonate with American culture.","['popular culture', 'television', 'americanization', 'dutch youth', 'modern family', 'american values']"

Comparing the Attitudes of Specific groups of Dutch Secondary School Students towards English Accents,"Stralen, Nine Loïs van","['Jeffery, J.V']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Despite the fact that the American accent is the most frequently heard variety of English in Dutch media, Gerritsen et al. (2016) concluded from a small-scale poll that the British accent is considered to be the norm among Dutch people. In Dutch education this tendency is also visible as the British accent is used as the standard teaching accent (Edwards, 2016; Trudgill & Hannah, 2008). Since research shows that language attitudes are learnt and that educators play a role in the formation of those attitudes, it is important to stay up to date about the preferences and ideas of students (Lasagabaster & Huguet, 2007). The last time, however, that Dutch students were specifically asked about their attitudes towards different English accents was in 1998 by Van der Haagen. The results of the matched-guise test used in this study showed that the language attitudes from students of different levels of education can differ. Research conducted by Heining-Boyton and Heitema (2007) suggested that age can also influence language attitudes. With the help of an online questionnaire, the current study therefore tried to investigate how the attitudes towards different English accents compare between different groups of students. The results suggest that the asked groups of students had different attitudes towards English accents. These findings can help teachers meet the needs of specific groups of students by adapting teaching methods to the study results.","['Language attitudes', 'English accents', 'EFL secondary school students']"

Urban design & urban heat islands: Fostering social inequality in the Hague,"Silva Ribeiro, Cátia da",['Marco Visser'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Urban Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Cities are becoming increasingly hot places to live. This reality is promoted by climate change as well as by Urban Heat Island effects, which in turn promote higher levels of heat stress in urban areas. Yet how these heat stress levels are felt across the city is not uniform due to the unequal distribution of public space, vegetation, and coping mechanisms through the city fabric, consequently promoting social vulnerability. Based on the literature and examples from North American cities, the purpose of this thesis is to establish if an unequal distribution of heat stress and consequent social vulnerability occurs in the city of The Hague. To do so, a linear regression was used to establish a relation between income and temperature levels, followed by a mixed methodology approach based on the framework of Harlan et al. (2006) where social conditions, thermal environment and coping mechanisms are analysed. The findings of this research show that in the neighbourhoods of The Hague there is a correlation between income levels and temperatures. Furthermore, low temperatures neighbourhoods follow a trend of high income, high vegetation levels, high coping mechanisms in the public space, and low levels of impervious surface. On the other hand, high-temperature neighbourhoods show lower income levels, low vegetation levels, low coping mechanisms and high levels of impervious surfaces. This scenario shines a light on the social inequality of public spaces through The Hague and draws parallels to the Environmental Justice issues of vulnerability found in the North American Cities. These findings are important for policymaking and the promotion of more integrated approaches between urban planning, urban design, climate mitigation strategies, health officials and the Municipality when proposing interventions at the local level.","['urban design', 'urban heat islands', 'social inequality', 'environmental justice', 'climate adaptation strategies']"

An Identity Dilemma: A Study on the Post-2011 Tense Turkey-EU Relations,"Işık, Ersin",['Dr. Kayhan Valadbaygi'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The long-standing relationship between Turkey and the EU has cooled considerably over the past decade. Due to its geopolitical importance in various areas – including the fields of security, migration, and trade – the developments of the Turkey-EU relations are closely followed by experts. This thesis aims to determine what factors have contributed to post-2011 Turkey-EU tensions. It is convinced that relying upon events alone is not sufficient to understand the key dynamics of Turkey-EU tensions and to answer the research question. Specifically, it investigates how the notion of identity – as an angle within constructivism theory - played a role in the rise of right-wing populism and Islamophobia in Western Europe, the rise of political Islam in Turkey, the EU accession process, and it also scrutinizes the role of identity independently. To answer the research question, secondary data was collected through qualitative and quantitative research methods. Primary data was collected through one-on-one interviews with both Turkish and European participants. Responses were analyzed using critical discourse analysis (CDA). The results show a strong correlation between ‘‘Self’’ vs. ‘‘Other’’ sentiments - as prevalent in Turkey-EU tensions - and identity. On this basis, both Turkey and the EU seem to find themselves in an identity crisis that they both reflect upon the ‘‘Other’’ to safeguard their own identity. These results suggest that developments such as the rise of right-wing populism and Islamophobia in Western Europe and the rise of political Islam in Turkey, each contributing to mutual tensions, are products of a contemporary identity dilemma.","['Identity', 'International Relations', 'Constructivism Theory', 'Turkey', 'European Union (EU)']"

In the past few decades, Indonesia has grown into one of the major global cultivators of this good and became the world’s first producer and exporter in 2008. While this achievement has generated considerable revenue from export earnings and thus contributes to the national economy, the country’s rapid expansion of oil palm plantations and the production of this good has come at a high environmental cost. In fact, the growth of the palm oil sector has several negative impacts on the environment, such as largescale deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions and the disruption of important ecosystem services. This thesis puts the expansion of the palm oil industry in Indonesia under the lens of the commodification of nature, discussing the environmental implications of unsustainable production methods of the world’s most consumed vegetable oil, how expansionary projects have been facilitated by neoliberal government views and economic growth as a determinant factor in the growth and development of the palm oil sector.","['Indonesia, Deforestation, Palm Oil, Economic Growth, Environmental Degradation']"

VERTAALBAARHEID VAN DE KLANK VAN DE QUR’ĀN IN HET NEDERLANDS,"Lucas, Suzan","['Bruning, J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Abstract There is only a small number of rhyming translations of the Qur’ān in European languages, while there are none at all in Dutch. Because of that in this thesis I research the possibility of translating the Qur’ān into rhyming rhythmic Dutch prose, considering the sound-meaning conflation, meaning that the meaning of Arabic words in the Holy Book can be intensified by the sound of that word, and besides that, repeating a certain sound can contribute to the atmosphere and message of a sura. Maybe a rhyming rhytmic translation of the Qur’ān that is a pleasant reading and that touches the heart as well is useful for many Muslims that don’t speak the Arabic language. An attempt is made to answer this research question by means of studying literature on the Islamic debate on inimitability and translatability of the Qur’ān and the occurence of saj‘ in it, and the conditions saj‘ must meet, as well as the theories on translating the sound of the Qur’ān of Shawkat Toorawa and Waleed Bleyhesh al-Amri, and above that by a case study on translating six suras: Q. 93, Q 97, Q. 100, Q. 112, Q,113 and Q. 114. The research has shown that it is possible to translate these sura’s from Arabic into rhyming rhythmic Dutch prose, considering the sound-meaning conflation, with exegetic notes helping to clarify uncertainties, and to justify translation choices. Subsequently not much meaning was lost compared to other translations. Note, however, that a translation will never be equal to the original, whether it is related to problems of translation in general or the impossibility of translating the word of God. And because the rhyme was my first concern, it was not always possible to find special words for hapaxes, or to find words with the same sound as in Arabic. Perhaps more time will be required to accomplish this or perhaps a bilingual researcher will be able to do so. Sometimes I had to deviate from more common interpretations of the meaning because the rhyme was my first concern.","['i‘jāz al- Qur’ān', 'onnavolgbaarheid van de Qur’ān', 'saj‛', 'rijmend ritmisch proza', 'onvertaalbaarheid van de Qur’ān', 'Shawkat Toorawa', 'fonetische component van de Qur’ān', 'de klank van Arabische woorden vertaalbaarheid van de Qur’ān', 'esthetische kwaliteit van een vertaling', 'casestudies', 'relatie tussen vertaalbaarheid en onnavolgbaarheid', 'noodzaak van vertalen van de Qur’ān versus de onmogelijkheid', 'de orale aard van de Qur’ān', 'parallellisme', 'hapaxen', 'taalkundige echo’s', 'taṭābuq al-ṣawt wa l-ma‘nā', 'de vermenging van klank en betekenis', 'oppervlakkige en diepe betekenis van de Qur’ān', 'exegetische voetnoten', 'zes Mekkaanse soera’s vertaald in Nederlands rijmend ritmisch proza', 'Nederlandse vertaling van sūrat aḍ-ḍuḥā', 'Nederlandse vertaling van sūrat al-qadr', 'Nederlandse vertaling van sūrat al- ‘ādiyāt', 'Nederlandse vertaling van sūrat al-’ikhlāṣ', 'Nederlandse vertaling van sūrat al-falaq', 'Nederlandse vertaling van sūrat an-nās', ""werkwijze vertalen soera's"", 'cadans']"
Pipeline Politics and Cash in the Pipeline: An analysis of Russian official rhetoric on the Nord Stream 2 and Power of Siberia gas pipelines,"Vellekoop, Sander","['Bader, M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Especially in the last decade, pipelines transporting Russian natural gas abroad have come under much attention in academic studies. The academic debate surrounding these pipelines is characterized by a wide variety of different viewpoints, which can be broadly classified into studies ascribing geopolitical and economic motives to Russian energy policymakers. This thesis adds to the literature on Russian gas pipelines by examining Russian official rhetoric on the Nord Stream 2 and Power of Siberia pipelines, the largest pipelines from Russia to Europe and China, respectively, planned in the last decade. In particular, it questions the dichotomy between geopolitical and economic ways of looking at pipelines by examining how Russian officials use narratives of both kinds in justifying the construction of these pipelines. In analyzing statements from various Russian officials, this thesis used qualitative content analysis, meaning that the narratives discussed are the result of a close reading and interpretation of the statements, instead of identifying and counting the use of key words. The results of this research show that Russian officials have regularly made use of both geopolitical and economic narratives to justify both pipelines – with economic narratives slightly more prevalent – , but the nature of these narratives and the frequency of their use differs widely between the cases. This calls into question the strong focus on either economic or geopolitical factors that can be seen in the literature.","['Russian Energy Policy', 'Gas Pipelines', 'Nord Stream 2', 'Power of Siberia']"

Christie wrote her detective stories during a time in which English society also experienced the first and second wave of feminism. This thesis will investigate to what extent the first and second wave of feminism influenced Christie’s depiction of her well-known female detective Miss Marple and her views on women’s roles and identities in British society. This analysis will focus on the following three Miss Marple novels: The Murder at the Vicarage (1930), A Murder is Announced (1950), and Nemesis (1971). Eventually, this thesis will show that the feminist thought and activism key to the first and second wave of feminism have had a significant influence on Christie’s depiction of Miss Marple. Throughout these years, Christie has gradually increased Miss Marple’s agency, prominence and engagement with feminist thought expressed in her time. Even so, the exploration of feminist thought concerning same-sex relationships presents to be a boundary for Christie.","['Feminism', 'Agatha Christie', 'Detective Fiction', 'British Detective Fiction', '20th Century British Literature']"
Is The Ambiguous Taiwan Policy Of Japan Chancing?,"Breemen, Wies van","['Chang, V.K.L.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis is an exploratory research that analysis Japan’s current Taiwan position. This was done by examining four themes: 1. The evolving place of Taiwan in Japan’s security policy and political discourse. 2. The development of Japan’s security policy and the turn towards a more sovereign security policy of Japan. 3. The development and strengthening of the U.S.-Japan alliance. And, 4. the introduction of the FOIP strategy. These themes were extracted from the literature. However, the literature in this field is quickly outdated. Besides no author in the literature did examine the four themes together with regard to Japan’s Taiwan position. Research was done through text analysis and comparative analysis. All themes show that Japan increasingly promotes values like: democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law, and a capitalist economy, which it shares with the U.S. and Taiwan. Although, by now, Japan more openly supports Taiwan as a democracy, no costly signalling towards Taiwan was done since no explicit cost was attached to the signals. Instead, I argued that Japan did send a costly signal to the U.S. by explicitly stating that the alliance is unwavering and that Japan and the U.S. together are increasingly promoting their shared (universal) values. The value politics that Japan and the U.S. envision can be seen in a broader spectrum of countries and alliances promoting values. China, for example, promotes its own values. Values that clash with the shared values that the U.S. and Japan promote. Since value’s legitimize actions to protect those value and two different value systems vie for their influence on Taiwan and both see the other as an infringement on their own value system, the Taiwan issue is cause for serious concern.","['Japan', 'Taiwan', 'International Relations', 'Free Open Indo Pacific']"

Especially the cabinet of curiosity is frequently reintroduced, cited and reappropriated, with underlying concepts and visual tactics resurfacing. It will be determined to what extent visual or conceptual phenomena are reinterpreted or referenced by discussing the work of Steffen Dam, Damien Hirst, Marc Dion, and Marc Quinn. In their art, there is a revival of the traditions of collecting, classifying, categorising, ordering and displaying the natural world. Furthermore, the interrelationship between art and science forms a prominent factor. This study aims to identify the main influences, strategies and connections to the curiosity cabinet and explore to what extent these are reflected in work by these artists. Various case studies will be discussed using visual analysis. Primary and secondary sources will be used to support this visual analysis to uncover possible connections and gain insight into the artists' sources of inspiration and intent. It will be considered how far their methods are tied to curiosity collections. The goal is to determine the collective characteristics present in those case studies. This will add to the comprehension of the main historical influences on these artists and the interconnection between their artistic practices.","['cabinet of curiosity', 'contemporary art', 'historical influences', 'nature', 'science', 'sculpture', 'installation work']"

A Many-Headed Nomos: Athena's Body and the Monstrous Aegis,"Bickers, Lily","['Halbertsma, R.', 'Jonge, C. de']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Athena's aegis, her characteristic magical garment, often features a scaly texture, a fringe of snakes, or the head of the gorgon Medusa. These attributes sometimes make Athena look like a hybrid monster in ancient Greek art and literature. This thesis explores the scope of literary and artistic representations of Athena in which her aegis constructs her body as a monstrous, boundary-crossing hybrid. I explore four contexts or themes in which Athena’s body interacts with the monstrous through the medium of the aegis: gender, costume, monster battles, and image ontologies. In each context, the monstrous aegis places Athena’s body in multiple categories simultaneously: masculine and feminine, hybrid and humanoid, god and monster, image and moving body. It is an agent of transformation. I argue that this polymorphism grants Athena a similar fantastical or unrealistic body to a hybrid monster. She is an excellent vector for artistic and literary explorations of the nature, limits, and transgression of cultural and ontological taxonomies. Rather than only signifying dominion over the monstrous, as is conventionally argued, the hybridity of the aegis allows Athena to function in a similar fashion to a monster.","['Athena', 'aegis', 'Ancient Greek art history', 'Ancient Greek literature', 'vase painting', 'monsters', 'monstrosity', 'iconography', 'gender']"

Philo, however, does not only use the concept for reasons of epistemology, but also to reflect about a personal experience that some scholars have labelled as a ""mystic experience"" and which had a tremendous impact on later neo-Platonic and Christian literature. The thesis explores several aspects of the passage, comparing its epistemological relevance by looking at its Platonic base, while a striking Ciceronian parallel allows reflection on the human aspects and a philosopher's duty between otium and negotium. The main question of this thesis’ ""close reading"" of the selected texts is ""how does Philo as Jewish-Hellenistic thinker evaluate the role of God and human beings regarding seeing God?"". In sum, this thesis presents an extensive contextualising discussion of Philo of Alexandria’s claim about heavenly ascent. By putting an emphasis on the distinct Philonian preoccupations and motivation, this thesis attempts to arrive at a novel way of understanding Spec. 3.1-6","['Philo of Alexandria', 'De Specialibus Legibus', 'Hellenistic Judaism', 'Heavenly ascent', 'Plato', 'Cicero', 'Epicurus', 'Plutarch']"

M-Agri Services amongst Dairy Farmers in Western Nigeria: Is the Time Ripe?,"Seumeren, Robin van","['Uche, C.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Nigerian dairy imports lead to an annual cash outflow of 1.3 billion USD. To mitigate this harmful effect, the Nigerian government urges dairy corporations to source milk locally. FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria PLC (FCW), a subsidiary of the Dutch multinational Royal Friesland Campina N.V. (FC), is the market leader in Nigeria and launched the mDairy pilot with the goal of enhancing the local sourcing of milk. The two primary functions of mDairy are milk tracing and e-extension on innovative dairy practices. To investigate whether m-Agri services can bring significant contributions to the Nigerian dairy sector, I employed a case study on mDairy where I compared it with m-Agri services that Dutch dairy farmers successfully use. I conducted nineteen interviews on eleven different stakeholders and conclude that there are two obstacles that need to be overcome before mDairy can be used on a nation-wide scale. Firstly, Nigerian farmers need to undergo an ideological and behavioural change as they need to be more aware of and better understand innovative dairy practices. One-on-one contact, potentially with Dutch farmers, can foster this. Secondly, I argue from world-systems theory (WST) that a fundamental change is required as Nigerian farmers compete with their fresh whole milk against the imported fat-filled milk powder (FFMP). These are two different products and the latter is less nutritious. Importing FFMP is cheaper than sourcing milk locally because FFMP is primarily made from a by-products which can be sold at a very low price. I find that sourcing whole milk locally may be cheaper than importing whole milk or whole milk powder. Nigeria finds itself in a difficult position since it does not have the machinery to produce FFMP itself and it has limited power to make demands on dairy corporations since it is dependent on these corporations for the country’s dairy supply.","['m-Agri services', 'digital agriculture', 'import substitution', 'FrieslandCampina', 'dairy', 'Nigeria']"

"New Needs, New Methods: A Review of Sustainable Transport and Mobility Planning in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire","Cazemier, Mathijs",['Dr. Rahmane Idrissa'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Africa’s urban population is expanding, and the mobility of many city dwellers across the continent is in jeopardy. In recent years, growing social, economic and environmental pressures in African cities have precipitated investment in transport infrastructure and new forms of public transportation deemed more “sustainable”. This trend is particularly felt in the city of Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire), where this new approach to transport planning is currently redefining the mobility of the local population, the “Abidjanais”. This thesis sets out to understand whether transport planning in Abidjan is supporting, or would support in the near future, sustainable forms of mobility for local city dwellers. Through a qualitative and quantitative assessment of various transport policies and projects, it is argued that inadequate transport planning in Abidjan is exacerbating unequal access to public transport and socio-economic opportunities, and is failing to meet the context-specific needs of local city-dwellers.",
Interjections in interactional discourse: The case of Avatime,"Punselie, Stella","['Ameka, F.K.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Interjections such as 'wow', 'mhm' or 'oh boy', can be defined as conventionalized lingui,stic items that typically constitute a non-elliptical utterance of their own and express a speaker’s attitude towards a situation. Many studies have debated about topics like the extent of the interjection class, or the semantics of different types of interjections. However, the context of conversation is needed to truly grasp the way interjections are used in spoken language. This study investigates the interjections of Avatime, a Kwa language of Ghana, focusing specifically on how they are used in interactional discourse. I construct an inventory of the interjections used in a collection of Avatime conversations.I then analyze the functions, positions and multimodal properties of these interjections. The great majority of attested interjections are phatic in function (e.g., backchanneling or expressing agreement), while there is relatively little room for interjections expressing emotions. Most interjections occur on their own (as is part of their definition) or turn-initially. Avatime speakers also regularly communicate in sequences that consist of only interjections. Furthermore, conversation is not unimodal, and neither are interjections. A quarter of the Avatime interjections occur with a gesture (with hand, head or other body parts), although facial expressions are rarely involved in producing gestures. Furthermore, there seems to be great areal convergence of interjections in Avatime and surrounding languages, which are all influenced by the regional lingua franca Ewe. To better understand these areal patterns, and to place interjections in a wider typological perspective, more empirical studies like the present one are needed. Only with comparable data from diverse languages can we understand the use of interjections in conversations around the world, which ultimately is fundamental to understanding human interaction.","['interjections', 'discourse', 'interaction', 'Avatime']"
An analysis of covert contrast in Dutch,"Broeke, Lotte ten","['Levelt, C.C.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In previous research, covert contrast in child language has mainly been found in English-speaking and non-typically developing children. Since Dutch, like English, contrasts voiced and voiceless plosives, it is likely that Dutch speaking children also produce a covert contrast when learning to differentiate between these different plosives. In order to test this hypothesis a data sample from a Dutch child was used to measure and compare the voice onset time (VOT) of bilabial plosives, which were all transcribed as [p], but for which the target form was either voiced (/b/) or voiceless (/p/). A single-sample T-test with bootstrapping was performed to test the difference between the VOT means. Although the mean VOT for voiceless plosives which had a voiced target form was shorter than for plosives with a voiceless target, the difference was not significant, indicating that no covert contrast in VOT was present in this data. However, as the sample size was quite small, with only one subject and 74 utterances, no large-scale conclusions can be drawn for the Dutch population yet.","['Language acquisition', 'covert contrast', 'child speech', 'voice onset time']"
Testing and Evaluating Tools for Facilitating Gesture Annotation,"Voorbraak, Gaby","['Nyst, V.A.S.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Gesture annotation is a fundamental process in all types of gesture research. However, it is usually performed manually, making it a time- and resource-consuming process. Recent progress in automatic human motion tracking has sparked the development of tools that partly automate gesture annotation, such as the tools by Ripperda et al. (2020) and Ienaga et al. (2022). Although aimed at annotating signs, the tool by Fragkiadakis et al. (2021) could also be useful for gesture research. As the tools are only recently developed, it is not yet confirmed whether they can facilitate the annotation process. In this thesis, the extent to which the tools can be made operable is tested through User Acceptance Testing, and their performance and usability are evaluated based on criteria sets. It was observed that the tools by Ripperda et al. (2020) and Ienaga et al. (2022) still contained fatal errors and failed to generate annotations, whereas the tool by Fragkiadakis et al. (2021) was easily made operable. However, the accuracy of the produced annotations was low and robustness could be improved, for example by training a new model. Overall, the results indicate that the tools by Ripperda et al. (2020) and Ienaga et al. (2022) still require development, and that the sign language-based tool by Fragkiadakis et al. (2021) could potentially be used for facilitating gesture annotation.","['automatic gesture annotation, user acceptance testing, usability evaluation']"

THE IMPACT OF THE DIGITAL YUAN ON CHINA'S MONETARY SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY OF FINANCIAL DATA,"Krzywulicz, Krzysztof",['Jue Wang'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since opening up in the 1980’s China became a major player in the global economy. Despite its size, the country plays a marginal role in the global financial system and relies heavily on the USD to facilitate its international trade. This heavy reliance on the US-led system is a source of strategic vulnerability. PRC authorities tried tackling this problem through the internationalization of RMB, yet failed due to domestic opposition. This paper critically assesses the mechanism of dependence ingrained in the International Monetary System and explores the potential of state cryptocurrency, the Digital RMB, to achieve Chinese strategic policy objectives. So far cryptocurrencies have not been analyzed in the geopolitical context. This article closes that gap and contributes to the important debate on the impact of emerging cryptographic technologies on the global financial system. The overall analysis suggests that utilizing Digital RMB could help the country reassert its monetary sovereignty and ensure the security of domestic financial data.","['Digital yuan', 'monetary sovereignty', 'crossborder paymentsy', 'swift', 'e-CNY']"

Ueda Kazutoshi stood at the forefront of this movement, advocating for the conceptualisation of kokugo, the national language, and in turn educational reforms which would implement this national language for the improvement and modernisation of the Japanese empire. In the book, Kokugo no tame, he goes into further detail on how to achieve this. This thesis looks at how idealistic and influenced by nationalism Ueda’s Kokugo no tame is by reading, interpreting and finally reflecting on his writings found in the book, as there is discourse on its abstract nature and its achievability. This thesis finds that Ueda’s writings were heavily influenced by the new social context of Meiji Japan and its recent victory in the First Sino-Japanese War, and that with the limitations that nationalism and racialisation bring, it also put limits on the feasibility of Ueda’s envisioned kokugo. While achievable in some ways with concrete ideas on how to implement kokugo, and indeed Ueda’s writings did set up the foundation of language standardisation, it is also the caveats made by Ueda on how kokugo should be educated under nationalist terms which made it more difficult to bring it to fruition according to Ueda’s ways.","['Ueda Kazutoshi', 'kokugo', 'nationalism', 'language']"

In the literature, the paintings were multiple times described as ethnographic portraits. However, it was in doubt if these life-size portraits can be identified as ethnographic portraits as this genre of the ethnographic portrait developed ages later when photography was invented. This research aimed to answer what position Eckhout’s life-size portraits of the Tapuya people in Brazil of the seventeenth century occupy in relation to Abraham de Bruyn’s costume book of 1581 and the portraits of the Navaho people made by Edward S. Curtis in his photo book The North American Indian. Based on art historical analysis, and visual analysis it can be concluded that Eckhout’s life-size portraits can be placed in a transitional space between the national type of the sixteenth-century book costumes based on attributes and costumes and the ethnographic portraits of the nineteenth century.","['Eckhout, etnographic portrait']"

"Attracting AI Talent in 2022: A Study of Three Chinese Tech Giants; Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent","Johnson, Kayley","['Creemers, R.J.E.H.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Purpose – This paper argues that education alone will not solve China’s AI talent shortage crisis. To successfully attract top international and domestic talent, China needs to reposition itself in modern and people-centered ways. AI talent must be valued by companies (like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) and the government. Design/methodology/approach – This research adopts a two-part qualitative analysis. The policy document analysis utilizes the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (NGAIDP) to identify a central framework. The secondary content analysis is an analysis of job advertisements and company websites of Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. Findings – Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, are not equal in how they appeal to prospective employees. The consequence of this is the impact on the AI talent shortage crisis; without being able to attract the best talent in the world – China faces the disadvantage of not becoming the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. Research limitations/implications –The study has several unaccounted variables, including the recruiter and the impact of COVID on employee value proposition. Furthermore, this study assumes that EVP is cross-cultural. Practical implications – The Chinese government places much value on the artificial intelligence training of youth rather than the importance of talent retention and attraction. It is evident via the NGAIDP that companies are responsible for following the values of the Chinese Communist Party. However, there is little to be said about the human value of employees and the necessity for China’s tech giants to find practical solutions. In addition, the criticism from Western scholars toward China’s AI national ecosystem is based on fear and assumption – without realizing that China’s tech companies face the challenge of appealing to a highly educated generation of AI talent. Originality/value – This paper takes a different approach to investigating the NGAIDP and combining it with research outside the traditional Chinese-studies scholarship. The combination of Chinese scholarship with Human Resources scholarship adds depth to the discussion of employee value in China and how companies should be moving forward in the future.

It uses concepts, theories, and methods of analysis developed by feminist art and museum scholars. Furthermore, the research focuses on the history of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, shedding light on Guggenheim’s unequal interest for men’s and women’s art of her time. Thus, the thesis examines the role Peggy Guggenheim played in shaping postwar modernism by promoting largely men artists. Moreover, the sociocultural position of women at that time is investigated, illustrating that other factors beyond Guggenheim’s bias explain the small number of women represented in the collection. Lastly, the study confronts possibilities of transforming a male dominated collection into a more gender-balanced one in order to emphasize women’s contribution to modernism in the museum narrative.","['Feminist pedagogy, The Feminist Hack, The Peggy Guggenheim Collection Venice, inclusivity, museology, modern art']"

Myth and merit in popular culture: Remembering Yun Tongju,"Konings, Vince","['de Ceuster, K']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Yun Tongju can be considered the most popularly read poet in Korea and therefore has been the subject of much analysis and interpretation. Furthermore he has also been used in several works of popular culture, such as novels, tv-shows, musicals and a movie. From some of the very first interpretations Yun’s work has been connected with the independence movement, which has set the tone for many further interpretations grounded in this early created narrative. Under the influence of factors such as public education, tainted by political interest and governmental intervention, museums, and popular culture, the narrative that was created by these interpretations entered public memory. When it comes to the feature of Yun in works of popular culture an evolution throughout the years can be identified. While earlier works tend to keep to the narrative of independence activism, newer works aim for the poetic awakening of Yun as a character, hereby inciting empathy, as well as attempt to challenge existing narratives within public memory. This is done by either critiquing or by nuancing and weaving together elements from different narratives. The works analyzed in this thesis are the novel The Investigation (별을 스치는 바람) by Lee J.M. and the movie Dongju: Portrait of a Poet (동주).","['Public memory, Yun Tongju, popular culture, literature, cinema, poetry']"

"Book-Learning Rickyisms: Strategies for Translating Malapropisms, Eggcorns, and Linguistic Slip-ups in the Subtitles of Trailer Park Boys","Bruin, Kimberly de","['Dorst, A.G.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"There exists a significant amount of research on translation strategies regarding the subtitling of humour and wordplay. However, the translation of eggcorns, malapropisms, and other types of linguistic blunders have been largely ignored. This thesis attempts to fill this research gap by investigating the translation strategies used for linguistic blunders, or ‘Rickyisms’, in the Dutch subtitles of the Netflix mockumentary Trailer Park Boys. The strategies omission, literal translation, and retention, which occur in taxonomies of existing research were identified. A high rate of omission (64.4%) indicates a significant loss of Rickyisms and humour for the following reasons: no suitable Dutch equivalent (21.5%), temporal/spatial restrictions (15.4%), and grammatical errors (33.8%). Additionally, an overlap between temporal/spatial restrictions and grammatical errors (13.8%) and some omissions which are unjustified (15.4%) were identified. A new two-phase model for the strategies where the Rickyism is retained has been developed. Phase one pertains to the translation of the phrase as if it were correct and phase two pertains to the translation of the error. This resulted in the categories Literal-Literal (58.3%), Literal-Substitution (13.9%), and Substitution-Substitution (27.8%). This first strategy seems to be the preferred one when the linguistic properties of the source and target language permit it. Substitution in phase two includes numerous different shifts in terms of type of error.","['Subtitling', 'Malapropism', 'Eggcorn', 'Trailer Park Boys', 'Translation', 'Translation Strategies', 'Omission']"

Flower of Carnage: Kaji Meiko as the image and voice of the vengeful female action heroine in 1970's Japan,"Sevindik, Beste","['Giolai, A.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores the ways in which the Japanese actress and singer Kaji Meiko embodies the image and the voice of the female action heroine through her roles as Matsushima Nami in ""Female Prisoner 701: Scorpion"" (1972) and Kashima Yuki in ""Lady Snowblood"" (1973). Chapter 1 offers a narrative analysis of both films by examining various story elements and how they reinforce, critique, or comment on social and political issues at the time they were released. This includes questions of gender and sexuality brought to the fore by Kaji's portrayals. Chapter 2 presents an analysis of the lyrics of the two theme songs Urami Bushi and Shura no hana, performed by Kaji Meiko herself, through the lens of Frith's 'song as a speech act' approach. Kaji's unique delivery can be considered “yakusha no uta”, an extension of her acting. Her performance of the songs contributes to deepening the film’s narrative and adds a layer to her characters' complexity. What sets Kaji apart from her contemporary actors is that her characters represent more complex representations of women in action films. Kaji's artistic involvement during the design process of her characters and her versatile acting brought both the characters of Matsushima Nami and Kashima Yuki to life as unconventional women who were strong and resilient, carrying the actress to stardom.","[""Kaji Meiko, female action heroine, Japanese film, 1970's, yakusha no uta, Female Prisoner 701: Scorpion, Lady Snowblood""]"

Saudi Arabia's land grabs: self-sufficiency by proxy or failed strategy? An assessment of the initative for Saudi Agricultural Investments Abroad,"Lee, Loïs van der",['C.J.V. Henderson'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The world food crisis of 2007–2008 reaffirmed the volatility of international commodity markets and led many countries questioning their reliance on food imports. In a quest for new strategies to ensure food supplies in the future, many richer countries resorted to the large-scale acquisition of foreign land, often referred to as land grabs, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In this thesis, I examine the Saudi Agricultural Investments Abroad initiative and attempt to identify what role this initiative plays within the Kingdom’s larger food security policy. Moreover, against the backdrop of the global climate crisis and the importance of moving towards a sustainable global food system, this thesis examines the sustainability of this strategy in the long term. The research question formulated for this is: What role do Saudi Arabia’s large-scale land investments abroad play in their food security strategy and how sustainable is this strategy? Building on an alternative definition of food security that adopts a food systems approach, this thesis proposes that the use of large-scale land investments as a food security strategy does not fit the sustainable path that is so needed.","['land acquisitions, agro-investments, food security, food systems, Saudi Agricultural Investments Abroad']"

For the purpose of this research, I will be analyzing case studies of deifications concerning divine as well as heroic cults in order to determine what the criteria are for a divine cult and successfully becoming a god. What I deem successful is that the deified person in question is not viewed “as if a god” or on “godlike status” but is viewed as an actual god. For the purpose of this, the research question 'why are some deifications of living mortals succesful, while others are not?’ has been formulated. To find an answer to this question, the following sub-questions have been drawn up: first, what are cults and what is deification? Second, what are the criteria for deified, living mortals to receive divine cult?

The Politics of Water Scarcity: An Analysis of the Israeli-Jordanian Hydropolitical Relationship,"Deceuninck, Fauke","['Henderson, C.J.V.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research seeks to analyze the current hydropolitical relationship between Israel and Jordan in the light of the Declaration of Intent, agreed upon in November 2021. The agreement entails a collaboration between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the State of Israel and the United Arab Emirates on water and energy issues. While the literature on hydropolitics has mainly focused on the connection between water scarcity on the one hand, and conflict or cooperation, on the other, this study moves beyond this dichotomy by applying a mixed method of environmental peacebuilding and hydro-hegemony to the case-study. Built on theoretical analysis and including historical aspects, the international, regional and domestic context as well as the concept of asymmetrical power and discursive power, the research looks beyond elite interests and traditional theories of international relations. While the analysis identifies the envisaged cooperation from the water-for-energy deal as a form of technical environmental cooperation, the findings also stress the ambiguity in Jordan’s behavior and the underlying dynamics of power asymmetry, reinforced by the role of external actors and the use of dominant discourses.","['Hydropolitics', 'hydro-hegemony', 'power asymmetry', 'Israel', 'Jordan']"

This thesis analyzes the Kurdish representations in Kurdish films set during the Iran-Iraq War. In particular, it focuses on the Kurdish female representations. The aim is to further develop academic research on Kurdish cinema, provide an overview of cultural expressions through visual arts throughout space and time and emphasize the gap between the male and female gender in Kurdish representations. The analysis proposes that Kurdish cinematic expressions of the Iran-Iraq War have two overarching themes that can roughly be classified under the heading of cultural memory and collective trauma and the heading of geo-linguistic homeland in which different representations between Kurds in general and female Kurds can be observed.","['Kurdish Cinema, Iran-Iraq War, Accented Cinema, Female Cinematic Representations, Kurdish Cinematic Representations']"
When your source country is in conflict: How the Taliban's return affects Afghan-Dutch citizens' sense of belonging,"Teeuwen, Annefleur",['Gabrielle van den Berg'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research explores the impact of the return of the Taliban in August 2021 to the sense of belonging of Afghan-Dutch citizens. When refugees or migrants enter their host country, they must develop a balance between the sense of belonging to their host country and their source country. The perception of belonging can be influenced by a multitude of things such as immigration rhetoric in the host country, changes in social-economic circumstances, and conflict in the source country. This research has found that the effects of these conflicts on the sense of belonging for Afghan-Dutch citizens in the Netherlands varies greatly. Some of the Afghan-Dutch population felt a stronger sense of belonging to Afghanistan, as all their memories and connections to the country received extra attention. For others, the sense of belonging to Afghanistan declined, as the return of the Taliban emphasized traumas and the country’s history of conflict. Finally, for some, the feeling of belonging remained unchanged entirely. Furthermore, though the feelings of belonging to the Netherlands were not the main focus in this research, it was noticeable that those feelings did not really change for the Netherlands in general, more in the direction of the Afghan-Dutch diaspora.","['(political and cultural) belonging, host country, country of origin/source country, immigrants, refugees, conflict, Taliban, Afghanistan, the Netherlands, integration']"

The Political Economy of Egypt’s Pharmaceutical Industry: Medicine Access and Dreams of Self-Sufficiency,"Pieters, Emma",['Dr. Kayhan Valadbaghi'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Under the governance of President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi (2014-present), Egypt has witnessed severe medicine shortages. As a way to mitigate those shortages, the government is increasing its domestic production of pharmaceutical products. This policy is grounded in a rhetoric of ‘self-sufficiency’, the aspiration for Egypt to provide in its own medicine needs, thereby reducing its dependency on the imports for medicine supply. National initiatives such as the establishment of the pharmaceutical production hub Gypto Pharma demonstrate concrete attempts to realize this ambition. This raises the question of how the political economy of Egypt’s pharmaceutical industry has developed under the current regime. While the ‘self-sufficiency’ rhetoric suggests that Egypt has taken a direction of economic de-globalization, further inquiry shows that this narrative does not tell the whole truth. Through the use of interviews and the analysis of formal documents and newspaper items, this research uncovers the political and economic aspects of Egypt’s contemporary pharmaceutical industry. Following its recent trail, it becomes evident that even if Egypt is limiting the import of finished pharmaceutical products, it is still very much dependent on the import of raw materials for its domestic production. Likewise, because Egypt lacks capital to invest in its local pharmaceutical industry, it relies on the input of foreign direct investment. Furthermore, another motivation for increasing its domestic manufacturing of medicine is also to become a regional production hub. Adopting the role of medicine supplier in turn creates new dependencies on the global value chain. Finally, coming back to the matter of medicine shortages, this research shows that the notion that the intensification of domestic production will improve the medicine supply, and thereby better medicine access is false. It takes further political action to ensure the affordability and availability of medicine.","['Pharma Industry, Egypt, De-globalization, GVC, self-sufficiency']"
Conceptual Engineering and the Royal Society Corpus,"Haket, Nina","['Fonteyn, L. and Connor, J.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Conceptual Engineering is the practice of improving the concepts we use for a specific purpose. However, despite involving words and their meanings, this practice has not been looked at from the perspective of linguistics. This paper takes a small, niche scientific community, namely the Royal Society, and investigates to what extent Newton’s proposed distinction between mass and weight, which can be thought of as an instance of Conceptual Engineering, was consistently used in scientific journal articles between 1700 and 1920. Before Newton’s Principia, the lemma weight referred to both the amount of matter that makes up an object and the force of gravity acting on the matter. In 1687, Newton proposed that the former concept should be referred to as mass, and the latter as weight. Success, for this project, is differentiation based on sense and not on any other extra-linguistic factors. To discover whether the project was successful, 1500 tokens of mass and weight from the Royal Society Corpus were annotated for their lemma, ‘sense’, ‘object’, ‘subfield’, ‘author’, ‘year’, ‘type’, ‘plurality’, and part-of-speech. This data was analysed by looking at the frequencies of the respective senses over time, along with Ctrees and Random Forests to identify annotations that were the most important in predicting the lemma, and Principal Component Analysis to visually inspect clustering and patterns over time. The results showed that sense was not an effective predictor of the lemma, but that the extra-linguistic factors of ‘object’, ‘author’ and ‘subfield’ had great predictive power. Furthermore, the Principal Component Analysis confirmed clustering based on ‘object’, ‘author’ and ‘subfield’ rather than based on ‘sense’. It was concluded that Newton’s Conceptual Engineering of mass and weight was unsuccessful. From the perspective of Conceptual Engineering more generally, this work showed future research on more diverse communities with less coherent language ideologies is necessary when investigating cases of Conceptual Engineering, and also that linguists can be important contributors to Conceptual Engineering research in the future.","['Conceptual Engineering', 'Scientific Language', 'Semantic Change']"

Irredentism and the Construction of National Identity: Morocco and the Western Sahara,"Hooghwinkel, Jasper","['Englert, Sai P.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Despite being one of the most protracted and ongoing territorial disputes, as a case of irredentism the Western Sahara conflict has only incidentally enjoyed international attention. The opportunity to step into the vacuum of international news coverage and information provision about this disputed territory, however, has recently been seized. The media platform of the state-sponsored ‘Council of the Moroccan Community living abroad’, as the name suggests, has targeted the Moroccan diaspora with online content about the Western Sahara in recent years. While studies of irredentism have focused on the importance of nationalism in arousing support for irredentism among the nation, the role of irredentism in the construction of national identity has received little attention. Through the empirical analysis of this media content, this paper unravels the argumentation behind the Moroccan state’s irredentist claims in its communication to the diaspora and demonstrates that they are rooted in a state-informed national identity construct, a construct to which the Western Sahara as irredentist project in turn plays a contributing role. On the basis of this construct, I point out that in addition to being of interest as potential support base for advancing the Moroccan state’s irredentist cause in the Western Sahara, it is likely that the Moroccan diaspora is also reached out to in this regard for the purpose of bolstering the idea of a monarch(y)-centred national identity.","['Irredentism', 'National identity construct', 'Diaspora', 'Morocco', 'Western Sahara', 'Legitimacy', 'Kin-state politics']"

Distancing from Israel? An Inquiry of British and French Young Jews Self-Identification Process with the Jewish State,"Van Den Bossche, Reinette",['Dr. Sai Englert'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"For 20 years, studies have been underlining a decrease in the attachment of young diaspora Jews with the State of Israel. While a broad majority of young Jews supports the existence of a Jewish state in Palestine, an increasing minority develops an opposition to Israeli policies, especially concerning the occupation of Palestinian Territories. As Jewish organisations advocating for Palestinian rights flourish in the Western world, where the Jewish diaspora is in majority located, the process according to which young Jews are increasingly distancing themselves from an Israeli- centred Jewish identity seems important to inquire. Indeed, growing diaspora support for a just political solution to the Middle East conflict might have empiric repercussions on the Israeli government. Therefore, this thesis seeks to inquire the identification process of young progressive Jews in France and Britain relating to the Zionist project, and aims at answering the following question: What drives critical French and British Jewish youth’s identification choices in the construction of a non-Israel centric identity? This paper argues that young Jews self-identify in a nexus between the Jewish community, overwhelmingly Zionist, and external norms and values of human rights and social justice, which creates conflicting dynamics. When left-wing values out-weight the community’s narrative, it creates or strengthens a feeling of alienation among progressive Jewish youth, that is slowly turning into criticism and distancing from the State of Israel. This youth, therefore, seeks to navigate new spaces of identification and revive a Jewish identity able to reconcile this internal struggle. To demonstrate so, this thesis will firstly conceptualise identity and discuss historical debates on Jewish identity. It will then analyse the distancing hypothesis, and the debates it created among scholars about its accuracy and potential factors. In the last two chapters, it will study the self- identification process of four young British and French Jews advocating for Palestinian rights. Through life-long interviews dealing with their attitudes towards a Zionist Jewish identity, this paper underlines the dynamics characterising their progressive alienation from the State of Israel: a primary discomfort, followed by a de-Zionification process, creating important fractures with friends, families, and their Jewishness, and finally the identification with a revived diasporic identity, able to reconcile Jewishness and anti-Zionism.","['jewish identity', 'Israel', 'identity']"
Part of the Solution or Part of the Problem? UNRWA’s representations in the digital public sphere,"Kijowski-Tran, Jérémie",['Noa Schonmann'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The relief of Palestinian refugees has been handled by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) since the 1950s to our days. Over seven decades of existence, the agency has been under various criticisms for its unconditional commitment to Palestinian refugees on the one hand, and for its failures to address the refugees’ issue on the other. As a result, the agency is often represented as an obstacle to the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by some and as an essential part of the solution by others. The aim of the present study is therefore to investigate the discourses employed by influential stakeholders to participate in the construction of a public discourse on UNRWA’s activities. Moreover, building on the public sphere conceptualized by Habermas, many have argued that the emergence of new technologies and globalized communications revolutionized the public debate, making it transnational. In this sense, social networking platforms like Twitter constitute actual parts of the digital public sphere where “social-influencers” compete to impose their interpretation of the public debate and to strengthen existing narratives. Using qualitative discourse analysis, this paper describes the diversity of strategies employed by certified users to participate in reputation narratives as well as the type discourse associated with their position in the public sphere.","['UNRWA', 'Twitter', 'Public Sphere', 'Digital Spaces', 'Influential Stakeholders']"

Dit onderzoek beoogt uit te wijzen welke kritiek critici op de NOS hebben en wat hun drijfveren voor deze kritiek zijn. Middels diepte-interviews met NOS-critici is dit onderzocht. In de interviews zijn verschillende aspecten van de NOS besproken, onder andere haar betrouwbaarheid, de nieuwswaardigheid van het nieuws van de NOS en de manier waarop critici de kritiek uiten. Uit deze interviews zijn verschillende thema’s af te leiden. Als eerste blijkt dat critici het nieuws van de NOS incompleet vinden. Dit uit zich op vier fronten: informatie wordt uit de context gehaald, de informatie biedt weinig diepgang, nieuws wordt maar vanuit een perspectief belicht en samenstelling van de redactie kent te weinig diversiteit. Ten tweede vinden critici de NOS gekleurd, wat zich uit op drie vlakken: critici vinden de NOS te links, subjectief en ze vinden het taalgebruik gekleurd. Als derde kritiekpunt vinden critici de NOS te commercieel. Ze zijn van mening dat de NOS te veel gebruik maakt van clickbait en dat zij zich te veel richten op het behalen van hoge kijkcijfers door middel van sensatie zoeken. Het laatste kritiekpunt dat critici op de NOS hebben is dat zij redactionele zwaktes vertonen. Het nieuws is vaak te laat, de website is onoverzichtelijk en het nieuws is te negatief. Verschillende critici zijn van mening dat de onkunde van de NOS bewust gebeurt om het publiek te beïnvloeden. Critici die zich hier niet bij aansluiten delen hun kritiek op de NOS om deze reden ook niet publiekelijk, maar alleen in persoonlijke kringen. Critici hebben twee drijfveren voor deze kritiek. Ten eerste omdat dat de NOS een publieke omroep is die betaald wordt van belastinggeld. De tweede drijfveer voor kritiek ontstaat als het wereldbeeld dat de NOS toont niet aansluit bij het wereldbeeld van de criticus. Concluderend zijn er onder NOS-critici twee hoofdstromingen te onderscheiden: ofwel critici die van mening zijn dat de NOS hogere kwaliteit moet leveren omdat zij een publieke omroep zijn, ofwel critici die de NOS niet vertrouwen vanwege hun relatie met de Nederlandse overheid. De eerste groep critici vindt de NOS vooral te oppervlakkig, commercieel en bekritiseert de redactionele vaardigheden van de omroep. De tweede groep critici vindt de NOS juist te links, is van mening dat de omroep informatie uit de context haalt en zijn van mening dat zij hiermee het Nederlandse publiek proberen te beïnvloeden.","['NOS, fake news, anti mainstream media']"
Memory-Making Through Chinese Historical War Films: A Cinematic Analysis on Guan Hu’s ‘The Eight Hundred’,"Pilaar, Lian",['Dr.mr. V.K.L. Chang'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research finds itself in the literature on the collective historical memory in China, a field within Sino-Japanese relations. Current scholarship in this sub-field has also discussed China’s national identity (e.g., Suzuki 2007), official historical narratives (e.g., Vickers 2013), and the space for alternative narratives (e.g., Wang and Chew 2021). Recent studies have identified changes in China’s official history discourse, most notably the transition from a victimhood narrative to one of triumph (e.g., Mitter 2020). Based on these existing papers, it appears that the space for alternative narratives is an unsaturated topic compared to identity politics and official historical discourse, despite its potential for researching a wide variety of niche case studies. Authors that have already explored this topic, like Denton (2014) and Wang and Chew (2021), suggest that, besides the party-state, other factors like the market, popular culture, and the internet also influence this space for alternative narratives. This research explores the medium of cinema to learn how the production of a historical war drama comes about and what that says about the environment for memory-making in China. In particular, I analyze the Chinese war film ‘The Eight Hundred’ in the context of alternative historical memory. Uncovering the construction process of historical memory in China will provide insight into the practices of non-state actors. As such, the research question of this thesis is: How are the state and market currently involved in the process of memory-making through the production of historical war films in China?","['China', 'Second Sino-Japanese War', 'historical memory, alternative memory-making', 'historical war film']"

The existing research further points to a great deal of disagreement on the nature of this construction. The aim of my research was to conduct a diachronic study of the CC construction, using a corpus-based approach, in order to show that the construction has remained largely the same from its earliest attestation in Old English through to the Middle English period. Five hypotheses are explored in this work: (1) there are two terms which express the same construction; (2) CC constructions are hypotactic, not paratactic; (3) the date given for the lexical change of swa to the is earlier than previously proposed; (4) the current syntactic structure can be explained by a process (micle-deletion) that took place in the Old English period, and lastly (5) that the Latin CC construction influenced the syntax of the OE construction. The results from this analysis show that hypotheses (1), (2) and (4) are true, while (3) remains unclear and (5) proves false.","['comparative correlative, diachronic, Old English, Middle English, historical syntax']"

Handling Museum Objects: Encouraging Touch in Cultural Heritage Institutions in the Netherlands,"Salter, Amy (AJ)","['Keblusek, M.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Touch and interactivity is becoming increasingly popular in museums countering decades of traditional museum styles and creating new ways to experience culture. This paper examines five cultural heritage institutions in the Netherlands and specifically focuses on the use of handling and interactivity with collection and display objects for the general public. Niel Kotler's 2004 article ""New ways of experiencing culture: the role of museums and marketing"" provides the basis for the ideas on where museums fit into a cultural framework and the importance of experience for education. By exploring this idea this paper answers questions about what modern museums and collections are doing to meet the growing public demand and general necessity of increased accessibility to and understanding of objects with importance to cultural heritage. How these methods for allowing touch and interactivity contribute to the learning and understanding of participants about the objects and their cultural importance is one of the main focuses. Each institution is discussed thoroughly under a division of themes between how handling is introduced through an educational lens and an exhibition lens. The paper concludes that museums are far more open to interactivity with collection objects than is often assumed by both museum studies and by the public. A positive outlook is concluded on behalf of the efforts which provides an understanding of the importance of the work being done to increase public knowledge and understanding of historical and cultural objects through the ability to handle and closely interact with objects. These efforts will be essential for the continued preservation of objects as well as technqiues, stories, cultures, and histories for years to come.","['Museums', 'collections', 'handling', 'touch', 'touch in museums', 'handling in museums', 'netherlands', 'dutch', 'textiles', 'tactile', 'museology', 'museum theory', 'museum practice', 'interaction', 'interactivity', 'interactive']"

"Political Participation among the Youth of Kerala, India","Förrer, Benthe","['Wickramasinghe, N.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Academics are concerned about declining political participation among the youth in established democracies and for a good reason. In recent years, declining voter turnout of citizens under the age of 29 has demonstrated the youth's indifference towards politics. There are several contradicting theories on why this phenomenon takes place. However, we can roughly distinguish two views: On the one side, academics condemn youth for having no political interest or knowledge and thus label the youth as 'apathetic.' Alternatively, some scholars agree that growing levels of education and income have resulted in young people acquiring more political understanding. As a result, the youth has managed to apply this newfound knowledge and employ alternative ways of political participation. Similar theories about youth participation and apathy exist in the world's largest existing democracy, India. However, considerably less research has been conducted on alternative trends of youth participation in this 'non-Western' region. To raise awareness of this issue, this thesis will contribute to the existing literature by establishing a pattern of youth political participation in the Indian state of Kerala. This research will show that a unique combination of exceptional socio-economic standards and traditional Indian values has produced a unique pattern of political participation, invalidating the theory of youth apathy.","['Political Participation, Voter Turnout, Youth ‘Apathy,’ Unconventional Political Participation, ‘Kerala Model of Development.’']"

Keblusek'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the work of Francis Cleyn (1582–1658) as a designer of book illustrations through an analysis of the stylistic influences on, visual models and motifs used in, and contemporary political resonances contained in, three designs for the Aeneid for the full-length book illustrations in John Ogilby’s English translation of The Works of Publius Virgilius Maro Translated, adorn’d with Sculpture, and illustrated with Annotations (1654). This was the first complete English translation of Virgil and the first luxury illustrated book produced in Britain. The designs analysed are The Sack of Troy: Pyrrhus killing Priam (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), Dido and Aeneas sheltering in a cave from Fama (Yale Centre for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut), and The Funeral of Misenus (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). Through a detailed discussion of Cleyn’s oeuvre, the book publishing world of the seventeenth century, the political world of the British Civil Wars (1642–1651), the Interregnum (1649–1660), and the Restoration (1660), and the textual contents with which the designs form a synchronic relationship, the author arrives at a fresh understanding of the artistic and political significance of the designs, of an artist whose work as a designer of book illustrations – indeed as the leading designer of book illustrations in Britain at that time - remains unduly neglected and often misunderstood in the art-historical literature.","['Francis Cleyn, John Ogilby, draughtsman, designs, book publishing, illustrated book, folio edition, engravings, mannerism, Virgil, Aeneid, classical epic, Virgilian-Augustan, royalism, Civil Wars']"

Ukrainian folklore ornamentations and cultural trauma: how an ornamented with folk patterns casque remains an active carrier of cultural trauma in Ukrainian society,"Lohvynova, Daria","['Crucq, A.K.C.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis discusses a casque ornamented with folklore patterns using theory on cultural trauma and anthropology of art in order to understand the significance of a casque within the formation and communication of cultural trauma in Ukrainian society. The cultural trauma theory, implemented by Jeffrey C. Alexander, suggests that people construct traumas intentionally through the framework of culture. While acknowledging the importance of cultural objects in establishing and communicating traumatic processes, the approach seems to disregard the existing agency of artefacts, resulting in the premise that cultural traumas always fade away. This research aims to add another perspective to the cultural trauma theory by considering the power of artefacts through the anthropological theory of art, coined by Alfred Gell. By implying that ornamented casque has a levelled agency, the research argues that consideration of active agency makes the cultural trauma remain or be experienced again after its turn into museum objects of commemoration.","['cultural trauma, agency of art, folklore art, visual art, ornamentation.']"

The Movement-Delete Approach for Gapping in Dutch,"Mulder, Maureen","['Lipták, A. K.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Merchant’s (2004) work on fragment answers has been groundbreaking in how clausal ellipsis is discussed today. In the article, Merchant defends the notion that in fragmented utterances, an interpretable syntactic structure is present but elided on the surface; a view that has been much contended with (see e.g. van Riemsdijk 1978; Hausser and Zaefferer 1978; Ginzburg and Sag 2000; Jackendoff 2002; Barton 1990; Stainton 1995, 1997, 1998; Jackendoff and Culicover 2005). His main argument boils down to the fact that fragments in fragment answers are part of a generated structure, and are proven to undergo movement (p. 664). Ever since, movement has been a crucial element in the discussion on ellipsis. Consequently, Ott and Struckmeier (2017) published an article on why the theory by Merchant is false, using gapping, a type of clausal ellipsis, in German for their prime examples. This thesis aims to further tackle Merchant’s approach using gapping in Dutch and showing that particles in gapping propose significant problems for Merchant’s theory.","['Gapping', 'Dutch', 'Syntax', 'Linguistics', 'Ellipsis', 'Clausal Ellipsis']"
"Smell, touch and hear visual art: The influence of multi-sensory exhibitions techniques on the perception and reception of art in van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven","van Rijn, Evi",['Ali Shobeiri'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis researches how multi-sensory design techniques, such as touchable replicas, scent and soundscapes, influence the perception and reception of art in the museum. To create a more limited scope, the new permanent collection display Dwarsverbanden in the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, is used as a case study. The interest in the use of multiple senses has been a point of discussion over the last decade, or so. However, not many Dutch exhibitions or institutions have been discussed in this field. Furthermore, the focus of these resources is never on the educational and experiential aspects of a museum visit. This thesis is divided into three topics: the material, the invisible and the experience. The material focuses on the perception of the objects themselves and their reproductions, therefore the sense of touch is the centre of discussion. The invisible focuses on the communication of the more abstract senses smelling and hearing. The experience aims to research the influence of multi-sensory design techniques on the educational value and how a visitor's attention is divided in the museum context. This research shows that the multi-sensory design tools used in this exhibition are translations of the two-dimensional artwork, which can be used as an aid. The senses each have a different approach to interpreting the artwork and evoke a different response. The use of a replica can gain a different perspective and open a sensory world, normally not present in the museum. The senses of smell and hearing communicate meaning and emotion and connect the visitor to the artwork. Research on visitor experience shows that multi-sensory design tools create an active student and fight boredom.","['multi-sensory museum', 'experience', 'senses', 'visitor']"

Familiar/Foreign: Collecting and Exhibiting the Orient in Early-Modern Europe. An Anthropological Analysis Supported by Visual and Historical Sources.,"Montuori, Francesco",['Prof. dr. Pieter J. ter Keurs'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The topic I discuss in this work is that of the practices of collecting and exhibiting of Orientalia at the turn of the Early-Modern period in Europe. In particular, I focus on the setting up of rooms dedicated to the showcasing of goods coming from the Orient and analyse how the exhibiting practices altered the perception of the Orient in the European societies of that period. The main research question upon which this whole work is hinged is: how did the collecting and exhibiting practices of Orientalia change in Western society during the Early-Modern period, to what degree can the evolution of these practices be seen as a way for Westerners to familiarise with the Orient, and with what consequences for the understanding of the Orient in European Early-Modern society? In order to find an answer to this question, the analysis I propose here is devoted to the study of several objects, spaces and practices, not only from a historical but also theoretical perspective. The central case study of this work is the Rijksmuseum Lacquer Room (assembled in Leeuwarden at the end of the 17th century). However, this study takes its steps from an analysis of the way Orientalia were treated during the Middle Age and Late Renaissance and surveys the shift which took place during the Early-Modern period and the reasons behind it. Such a historical analysis takes place in the first two chapters of this work, where I first focus on Europe in general and then specifically to the case of the Early-Modern Netherlands. The last two chapters of this work are instead dedicated to a discussion linked to the theoretical aspects regarding the collections of Orientalia and their showcasing in Oriental-style Rooms. In particular, I focus on the concepts of domestication and on the agency of objects, and later on issues related to Orientalism and that of collecting as a gendered practice. Starting from this analysis I propose further insights on the conception of the Orient in the context of Early-Modern Netherlands and suggest new prompts for future research.","['Orientalia', 'Oriental-style Rooms', 'Early-Modern Netherlands']"

Kijken door de klimaatbril: Rolpercepties en objectiviteitsopvattingen van Nederlandse klimaatjournalisten,"Bakker, Kim",['Alexander Pleijter'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Hoe doen journalisten verslag van misschien wel het grootste verhaal van onze tijd? Klimaatverandering is ingewikkeld, politiek, gepolariseerd en voldoet niet bepaald aan de belangrijkste nieuwswaarden. Pas als er concrete aanleidingen zijn, zoals een natuurramp, klimaattop of net verschenen klimaatrapport, is er een nieuwshaakje. Het is tevens lastig af te bakenen: klimaatverandering speelt binnen én buiten landsgrenzen en raakt alle dimensies: politiek, wetenschappelijk, maatschappelijk en economisch. Daarnaast is klimaatverandering een abstract langetermijnproces dat je zelf niet letterlijk kunt meemaken, terwijl journalisten juist gewend zijn concrete verhalen over het ‘hier en nu’ te maken. Het bestaat vooral virtueel, in tientallen jaren aan datasets. Het is aan de journalistiek om er voor het grote publiek chocola van te maken. In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht wat de rolpercepties en objectiviteitsopvattingen zijn van Nederlandse journalisten die berichten over klimaatverandering. Eerdere wetenschappelijke studies bieden aanwijzingen dat klimaatjournalisten anders zijn gaan denken over zowel hun journalistieke rol in de maatschappij als over journalistieke objectiviteit. Sommige klimaatjournalisten, met name zij die al lang met het klimaatdossier bezig zijn, neigen steeds meer naar de rol van pleitbezorger in plaats van alleen een informerende en analyserende rol. Feitelijkheid is voor hen niet langer het belangrijkste aspect van journalistieke objectiviteit; ze staan juist minder normatief tegenover het journalistieke objectiviteitsprincipe. Voor deze scriptie zijn tien Nederlandse journalisten geïnterviewden die over klimaatverandering berichten. Uit het kwalitatieve onderzoek blijkt dat zij zichzelf vooral zien als analyticus-analysator, al neigt een aantal ook enigszins naar de rol van pleitbezorger: zij pleiten indirect voor klimaatactie. Diezelfde journalisten geven aan in hun werk te worden gedreven door klimaatverandering, meer dan door journalistiek en zichzelf te zien als klimaatjournalist. Verder geven de meeste respondenten aan dat feitelijkheid voor hen het belangrijkste aspect van journalistieke objectiviteit is. Voor drie respondenten is dat transparantie. Zij geven ook alle drie aan gedreven te worden door klimaatverandering. Dat maakt dat er naar aanleiding van dit kwalitatieve onderzoek kan worden geconcludeerd dat er grofweg drie typen klimaatjournalisten zijn in Nederland: de transparante klimaatjournalist, de feitelijke klimaatjournalist en de feitelijke journalist die over klimaat bericht. Deze driedeling kan dienen als uitgangspunt voor vervolgonderzoek. Lezen?

Dutch Infants’ Sensitivity to Lexical Pitch-Accent: A Behavioural Discrimination Task Pilot,"Moor, Caitlin","['Levelt, C.C.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis covers a pilot study that examines whether Dutch infants can distinguish lexical tonal patterns in pseudowords. It is inspired by Sato et al.’s 'Development of Hemispheric Specialization for Lexical Pitch–Accent in Japanese Infants' (2010). Sato et al. found that Japanese infants can distinguish lexical tonal patterns in Japanese disyllabic words, and that they start processing these stimuli mostly in the left hemisphere (rather than bilaterally) as they get older in their first year of life, suggesting that Japanese infants perceive lexical pitch-accent as a lexical acoustic cue. Since Dutch does not use pitch-accent as a lexical cue, we would not expect Dutch infants to start processing tonal patterns in the left hemisphere as they get older within their first year. The first step to examining this expectation is carrying out a behavioural discrimination task to establish whether Dutch infants can distinguish lexical tonal patterns in pseudowords in the first place. Only then does it become fruitful to carry out a NIRS experiment like Sato et al. to investigate in what parts of the brain Dutch infants process lexical tonal patterns, and whether this differs as they get older. We found that Dutch infants do seem to be able to distinguish lexical tonal patterns in pseudowords. Though the sample size of this pilot is small, the effect that we found is of such significance that we expect to find it in the larger sample size of the official study as well, showing that Dutch infants can distinguish words on the basis of their tonal pattern. We therefore expect that performing a NIRS study like Sato et al. (2010) will be feasible.","['lexical pitch-accent', 'infants', 'sensitivity', 'pitch', 'accent', 'stress', 'dutch', 'japanese', 'hemispheric specialisation']"

Expectations on Translation Products: Differences Between Dutch Translators and Reviewers,"Kennis, Wouter","['Reus, T']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study uses the study by Valdez & Vandepitte (2020) as a framework to answer the research question: To what extent are the differences in attitude and expectation of translators and reviewers on the Dutch translation market similar to the situation on the Portuguese biomedical translation market, as described in Valdez & Vandepitte (2020)? This is done by distributing a questionnaire to a group of translators and reviewers, who are active on the Dutch translation market with the language combination English and Dutch. Their answers reveal that the situation on the Dutch translation market is very similar to the situation on the Portuguese biomedical translation market: Translators and reviewers agree on the important aspects of translations (fluency and grammatical correctness) and on the degree to which reviewers should make changes to translations (only if actual mistakes are found, while ignoring personal preference). However, translators and reviewers on both the Dutch and Portuguese translation markets are somewhat unsatisfied with the work of their colleagues, because they appear to not follow the standards that they agree on. This dissatisfaction could be resolved by better communication between translators and reviewers, which is another point of dissatisfaction for translators and reviewers. The findings of this study support the recommendation made by Valdez & Vandepitte (2020) to focus more on communication during translator training.","['Translation', 'Expectation']"
Iraans vrouwenactivisme in de moderne media anno 2022,"Erkelens, Valerie van",['Jelle Bruning'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"The status of women in Iran has been extensively discussed in academic literature. This paper focused on how women in Iran are being portrayed by the media in historiography, classical literature and novels, newspapers, television, films and drama serials. This literature overview demonstrates that women in Iran are underrepresented and invariably displayed within the framework of ignorant housewives, caring mothers and sex slaves or entertainers (of their husband). This perception contradicts with the actual representativeness of women within the Iranian media culture with regard to what they themselves strive for: exposing and combating gender inequality. Since the 19th century women in Iran have started to develop and organize women's organizations to fight for women’s rights by participating in political demonstrations and institutions. With the advent of the internet, Iranian women could communicate online about women-related topics. The increased influence of social media apps, such as Facebook and Instagram, enabled Iranian women's activism to develop to the fullest. Masih Alinejad's contributions on Facebook and Instagram are an example of this. Her successful My Stealthy Freedom- movement has raised awareness about the position of the Iranian woman in general and specifically about the mandatory hijab rule. This paper conducted a qualitative content analysis on forty of Masih Alinejad’s Instagram-posts in May 2022 to demonstrate how she contributes to the social debate on the position of women in Iranian society. The research demonstrated that Alinejad informs her Instagram followers with personal journalistic stories and then tries to stir up the moral consciousness of her followers. Thereafter, Alinejad motives her followers to take action to improve women’s status in Iran and the rest of the world. Alinejad’s online activism has not (yet) induced governmental policy changes in Iran, however her movement has contributed to the advancement of Iranian women's rights movement in size and reach.","['Iran, feminism, Masih Alinejad, Instagram, women']"
Revisiting Minority Alliances in Turkey: The Case of Diyarbakir as a Fertile Ground for Solidarity,"Sarkisian, Lianna",['Tsolin Nalbantian'],2022,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study examines the solidarity alliances of the Armenian, Assyrian and Kurdish communities in Diyarbakir, Turkey. Additionally, it poses the question, whether these alliances challenge a more exclusive national identity that is established in the official Turkish discourse. The alliances that are touched upon are the political environment of Diyarbakir; the celebration of Newroz; the commemoration of murder of Hrant Dink; and Armenian and Assyrian Genocide commemorations. I argue that the main manifestation of most of these solidarities is creation of more openness about the Genocides, in especially Kurdish discourse. The alliances depicted in this paper are each different and each form a different degree of challenge to the Turkish national identity. I conclude that the political environment of Diyarbakir forms the greatest threat, which can be perceived in the state’s crackdown of its established institutions and initiatives of cultural practices, as it does not fit the homogenous identity that the Turkish State ascribes to itself.","[': Diyarbakir', 'Armenian', 'Assyrian', 'Kurdish', 'Solidarity', 'Alliances', 'Minorities', 'Turkey']"

De Italiaanse smaak op de Nederlandse markt: Bialetti en de Nederlandse koffiecultuur in de twintigste eeuw,"Driel, Annika van","['Dencher, A.R.']",2022,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In 1661 werd koffie in Nederland geïntroduceerd. Zowel thuis als in koffiehuizen werd koffie geschonken, echter was dit door de hoge prijzen eerst voorbehouden aan de hogere sociale standen. Koffie dringt in de achttiende en negentiende eeuw langzaam door in het dagelijks leven. De twintigste eeuw brengt twee nieuwe soorten koffie: espresso en filterkoffie. In 1933 ontwerpt Alfonso Bialetti de Moka Express, een eenvoudige koffiezetter die destijdse espresso nabootst. De Nederlandse markt wordt in de twintigste eeuw gedomineerd door de merken Douwe Egberts, Melitta en Van Nelle. Door het bestuderen van literatuur, illustraties en advertenties wordt de vraag “In hoeverre heeft de Moka Express de Nederlandse koffiecultuur van de twintigste eeuw beïnvloed” beantwoord. Hieruit blijkt dat Bialetti weinig mogelijkheid had om met zijn uitvinding het Nederlandse huishouden te veroveren, omdat de Italiaanse smaak nog te nieuw was voor de gemiddelde Nederlander. Toch is ook hier de Moka Express een stijl-icoon geworden en heeft het een vaste plek veroverd onder koffieliefhebbers.","['koffiecultuur', 'Bialetti', 'Moka Express', 'espresso', 'Van Nelle']"
