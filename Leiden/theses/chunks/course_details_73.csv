"Greater Involvement of Women in Paramilitary Organisations, Greater Inclusion of Women’s Issues in Politics? The Case of Republicanism and Loyalism in Northern Ireland During the Troubles","Mathijssen, Milou","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Troubles in Northern Ireland from 1968 until 1998 meant changing situations for women in Northern Irish society. Nonetheless, for many women the extent of change depended on which community they were part of. Women in nationalist/republican communities were more involved in all levels of society than their unionist/loyalist counterparts. This also manifested itself in the paramilitaries. The republican paramilitaries included more women and these women were active in a greater variety of roles than the women active in loyalist paramilitaries. The main reason given for this in academia is that republicanism is a more inclusive ideology with wider social goals than loyalism. This thesis analysed, using discourse analysis, party manifestos and conferences of the main unionist/loyalist and nationalist/republican parties in Northern Ireland during the Troubles to investigate whether this argument also extends to politics. In short, to analyse whether the republican/nationalist parties were more inclusive of women's issues than unionist/loyalist parties. The research found that unionist/loyalist parties generally tended to be less inclusive of women's issues than nationalist/republican ones, but there was one outlier: the loyalist Progressive Unionist Party, which included a wide variety of women's issues, more so than all nationalist/republican parties. Thus, this thesis concludes that the argument of republicanism as a more inclusive ideology extends to politics to some extent.","['Northern Ireland', ""Women's Issues"", 'Poltical Parties', 'Paramilitaries']"
ITALIAN MUSEUMS AND THE CHALLENGE OF ENGAGING A YOUNGER AUDIENCE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA: A CASE-STUDY OF MUSEI CIVICI VENEZIANI,"Notarpietro, Giulia","['Lammes, Sybille']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Social media holds promise for museums to enhance visitor participation, engagement with potential visitors via participatory communication and in building an online community to which to refer to. However, the integration of social media within museums practices, particularly in Italy, has been a rather cautious transition as museums are concerned with the ways social media may deteriorate traditional organizational forms of authority that cultural institutions have held. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the extent to which Italian museums can use social media to engage with a younger audience. In doing so, this study has conducted a case study analysis of Musei Civici Veneziani, by interviewing the web-content manager of the institution. Findings demonstrate that Musei Civici Veneziani continues to use a one-to-one communication model, whereby social media platforms are used solely to inform users about practical matters. The use of a one-to-one communication model, rather than a many-to-many one by Musei Civici Veneziani is due to fear of jeopardizing their role as a cultural authority. However, the present paper aims to showcase the opportunities of adopting a peer-to-peer participatory communication model as a way to effectively engage with younger audiences which allows them to become active members within the museum.","['Museums', 'Museum Studies', 'Social Media', 'Communication']"
Let Immortals Govern: the Power Structure in the Construction of Daoist Sacred Geography,"Xu, Yunlong","['Felbur, Rafal']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The word Xian仙, by its graphic form recorded in Shuowen Jiezi (说文解字, the earliest Chinese Dictionary), is glossed as “man in mountain”. Another form of this word in Shuowen Jiezi is 僊, which is glossed as “long-lived and ascended”. It implicitly signifies a picture on which a recluse is meditating by a mountain cave. In the theory of religious Daoism, such transcendental recluses are often named as “True-man”(Zhenren真人) or “Immortal” (Xian Ren仙人), who are Daoist practitioners having attained the Dao. Mountains, as the places where immortals attain the Dao and achieve their transcendence, are one of the most significant natural beings for Daoists and are positioned in the core of Daoist practices. It is through the practices of Daoists in mountain caves that Daoists gradually constructed their sacred geography centering on mountains. As Daoist sacred mountains are the locus of transcendence and sanctity for Daoists, the Daoist sacred geography--- in other words, the narrative of the way to perceive their sacred landscapes, can shed light on the contour of the Daoist history in early medieval China. In this regard, a theory explaining the historical process of the construction of the Daoist sacred geography has been put forward by Ge Zhaoguang葛兆光, to generalize the Daoist history as a history of Daoist surrendering to the imperial power. In his book A History of Surrender: A Study on the Thoughts of Religious Daoism in the Six Dynasties and Sui-Tang period (222-907 AD), he proposed that the Daoist thoughts, knowledge, and rituals were “purified” by a long-term self-reform to attain the orthodoxy approval from the state regimes; Daoist lineages were denigrated to be “the others” by the official ideology (mostly Confucianism); the legitimacy of Daoist narratives is constructed by the discourse of power. From the sense of Michel Foucault, the history of religious Daoism is a fabulous illustration of the theory of power structure. It is mainly from the three aspects that Ge Zhaoguang argues his theory. The first one is that the socio-militarized structure of twenty-four dioceses was transformed as imagined geography of cavern heavens and blessed lands, which means Daoists lost their socio-military power in the secular world. The second one is that many significant rites and ceremonies, such as “the rites of passage”(Guodu Yi過度儀) and “charcoal-painting ceremonies” (Tutan Zhai塗炭齋), were removed by Daoists themselves to get away from the moral criticism from Confucianists and Buddhists. In addition, the ritualistic knowledge and magics of Daoism were shadowed by the prevailed metaphysical teachings and mysterious philosophies in order to cater to the tastes of Confucian intellectuals and other imperial cultural elites. Ge Zhaoguang concludes that religious Daoism acknowledged its allegiance to the imperial power by castrating some of its most featured knowledge and skills. Although there have been commentary articles on his theory, no one has ever responded to it by a study on the construction of the Daoist sacred geography. In this thesis, I will examine his theory by responding to the three aspects.","['Daoism', 'Sacred Mountains', 'Power Structure']"

"Informatie en negotiatie, het gezantschap van Hiëronymus van Beverningk naar Spanje, 1670-1671. Een bronstudie naar de diplomatieke praktijken van de Republiek","Langerak, Jonas","['Ebben, M.A.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,nl,"This thesis investigates the modus operandi of an early modern Dutch ambassador from the perspectives of New Diplomatic History. The States-General appointed Hiëronymus van Beverningk (1614-1690) as their ambassador to the Spanish court between 1670 and 1671. Van Beverningk had a difficult task: he was instructed to persuade the Spanish to accept the humiliating stipulations of the Treaty of Aachen (1668), but avoid overtures to negotiate a defensive alliance. That would antagonize France and spark a war under disadvantageous circumstances for the Dutch Republic. How did the ambassador conduct negotiations and represent the Dutch state? Where did he obtain information and what language and discourse did he use in communication with the Spanish ministers? Analysis of the correspondence between Van Beverningk and the home front reveals that the ambassador – formally the envoy of the States-General – served a variety of masters: notably John de Witt, but also the Burgemeesters of Amsterdam. The latter were involved because of the significant Dutch commercial interests in the Spanish Empire and their ties to the extensive consular network in Spain. During his stay in Madrid Van Beverningk served as the focal point of this network: the consuls provided him with information and complaints of Dutch merchants, which the ambassador structured and presented to the Spanish authorities.","['Hiëronymus van Beverningk (1614-1690)', 'Spanish-Dutch relations', 'New Diplomatic History', 'Seventeenth century', 'Dutch diplomatic service']"

Demarcating the Omani Yemeni Border: A Border Perspective on Shifting State-Society Relations in the Sultanate of Oman,"Bruijne, Emma de","['Strava, Christiana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores from a theoretical border studies perspective the political dynamics of the construction of a fence along the Omani Yemeni border initiated in 2013. Drawing on the concept of the nation as an imagined community, I argue that the construction of a border fence reveals the increased identity politics the Omani state, embodied by Sultan Qabus, engages in since the uprisings in 2011-2012 that marked a shift in Omani state-society relations. These relations are unpacked through exploring Qabus’ pre-2011 state- and nationbuilding efforts and two Omanization channels characterizing the post-2011 period. Through reinforcing the symbolic and physical boundaries of the nation and the territory it is associated with, Qabus enforces a fixed set of characteristics on his subjects, promoted in a national identity narrative, in order to instill loyalty to his authority. This thesis thus sheds light on the issue of increased oppression within the Sultanate, which has gone largely unnoticed among academics and the international community due to the strongly promoted Omani reputation of a stable beacon within a volatile region. This research is conducted from a political-anthropological angle, exploring the political dynamics embedded in the sociocultural context of Oman. It draws on existing literature from political science, history and the anthropological discipline, popular media reports and official government websites, documents and NGO reports.","['Identity politics', 'identity narrative', 'Omanization', 'state-society relations']"

In the Name of My Idol: Gifts and Donations in Korean Fan Culture,"Morri, Rachel Catharina","['Veldkamp, Elmer']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The last two decades, the popularity and accessibility of K-Pop have transcended Korean and Asian borders, reaching new audiences and gaining new fans, with K-Pop groups becoming not solely dependent on having a fanbase in Korea for their continuation. Not only have the music and visuals gone international, but also fan culture, having been adapted by international fans as well. But what makes Korean fandom culture stand out in comparison to other fan cultures? Regarding K-Pop and fans, what has been mostly covered in scholarship and media is the spread of Korean entertainment products as drama series and music, the phenomenon Hallyu, and fans as consumers of these products. The practice of fans making donations in the name of their idols is placed within the framework of gift exchange practices and parasocial relationships. This research looks at what this phenomenon could tell us of the role and position that fans and fandoms have within the Korean entertainment industry in regard to their favourite idols and the changing approach to and dependencies of their fans.","['Hallyu', 'Fans (Persons)', 'Exchange', 'parasocial relationships']"
"INSTRUMENTS OF WAR: The Political Significance of Public Concerts at Trg Republike, Belgrade During the NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia","Disselkoen, Felix","['Ieven, Bram']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"There is a decisively limited amount of attention paid in English scholarship towards the lived experience of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia by the citizens of Belgrade. Even more so, there is a very little amount of scholarly examination of the series of concerts held by the city council of Belgrade in response to the bombings, titled “Song Has Kept Us” (Pesma Nas Je Održala), and the intriguing manner in which they contributed to the political landscape of Yugoslavia under the Milošević era. This thesis aims to address this gap in the literature to highlight the value of cultural production to Slobodan Milošević’s regime by uncovering the fascinating way in which stylistic and sonic choices regarding the concerts and the historical context in which the concerts took shape helped produce a desired political meaning and identity that benefited the state. I will argue that these concerts were organized in such a way to promote unity and nationalism amongst the Yugoslavian people, cultivate resistance against NATO forces, and advance a historical narrative that depicted Yugoslavia (or Serbs) as the innocent and just victims of aggression despite strong (Western) criticism of military and police violence in Kosovo and, previously, the Yugoslav wars. It appears convincing that the political outcomes of the concerts were meant to directly or indirectly contribute to upholding state hegemony in Yugoslavia. The series of concerts are discussed within the context of Belgrade as an arena of sonic warfare, wherein the concerts counteracted NATO sonic booms that were meant to weaken morale and induce fear. Although the relationship of music to politics is traditionally recognized for music’s utility as a method of resistance against the political status quo, the series of concerts illustrate how these same qualities can be utilized by the state to maintain support whilst uplifting the people. The case will hence illustrate how state-organized concerts can act as a powerful political weapon amid international conflict.","['NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia', 'State-Sponsored Concerts', 'Milošević', 'Cultural Production', 'Hegemony', 'Politics and Music', 'Bourdieu']"

"Public health in Southeast Asia, no smoke without a fire","Neve, Joren De","['Henley, David']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The World Health Organisation has estimated that smoking kills approximately 7 million people per year worldwide (WHO, 2017: 70). The relationship between smoking tobacco and death has been proven, and widely accepted for decades. Notwithstanding the detrimental effects on public health, this unhealthy habit may also have some positive effects: oiling social contacts, easing the nerves, and heighten concentration (Knol in Colombijn et al., 2001: 49). However, whereas concentration and relaxation may be obtained through other means, a cure for death is yet to be found. As such, it is clear that we shall approach the act of smoking in this thesis as unwanted behaviour. Thankfully, owning to big scale awareness campaigns, and an ongoing global increase in taxation rates, daily smoking rates in most OECD countries have significantly decreased over the past few decades, with currently an average rate of 18% of daily smokers, compared to 26% daily smokers in 2000 (OECD, 2017). In some parts of Asia however, smoking remains a growth market and big transnational tobacco corporations (TTCs) still seems to have their claws firmly set in a number of nations (Parkinson, 2015). In terms of male smoking prevalence, Indonesia is by far the world’s worst performer with a national male smoking prevalence of 76.2%, leaving other bad examples, like Russia (59.0%), and China (47.6%) far behind (WHO, 2015). When accounting for the significantly lower female smoking rates (3.6%) Indonesia’s average smoking prevalence is still one of the highest in the world, preceded only by Russia, and a mere handful of countries in the Balkan region and the Pacific Ocean (Ibid.). This apparent vulnerability to the unhealthy habbit has not gone unnoticed by big tobacco, illustrated by the recent takeovers of Indonesian tobacco companies by global market leaders like Philip Morris International (PMI) and the British American Tobacco Company (BAT). Another factor contributing to the alarming severity of Indonesia’s smoking addiction are its demographic projections. Indonesia is currently sitting on a large demographic dividend, and the population is projected to grow with another 70 million by 2050 (Kohler, Behrman & Arianto, 2015: 4). Seeing that most beginner smokers are children or young adolescents, it is paramount that this surplus of human capital is protected in a country were smoking regulations are still below par (Parkinson, 2015). An alarming study found that between 2001 and 2010, the number of children (10-14) who smoked, rose by 80 percent and the number of children (5-9), who started smoking, quadrupled (Rosser, 2015: 69). A more recent study, by the Indonesian Ministry of Health, showed that between 2013 and 2018, smoking prevalence among children (10-18) increased from 7.2% to 9.1% (Ministry of Health, 2018: 72), and the 2015 Global School-based Student Health Survey calculated an even more alarming number for the age group 13-17 at 13.60% smoking prevalence (WHO, 2015: 5). A slightly less pronounced, though, still alarming increase in young smokers. In order to explain the uphill battle which Indonesia seems to be fighting in the face of such a major public health crisis, I will compare Indonesia’s performance with one of its Southeast Asian neighbours boasting far lower numbers in terms of smoking prevalence, namely Thailand. In 2018, Thailand solidified its position as the leader in tobacco restrictions, when it became the first Asian country to require a standardized packaging for all cigarettes. The new legislation requires all cigarette products to be sold in drab brown coloured packs, free of any logos or brand images, with 85 percent pictorial health warnings on both sides of the pack (Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance, 2018). It has been suggested by Thai specialists, like Duncan McCargo, that Thailand’s successes in tobacco control could serve as a case study for other developing nations (Chantornvong & McCargo, 2001: 48; Parkinson, 2015: 3). And indeed, in contrast to Indonesia, were men still puff away freely in almost any given location whether it be in a restaurant, air-conditioned coffeehouse, or school, Thailand seems well able to keep smoking outside of most public places, with heavy fines (a penalty fee for smoking in prohibited areas amounts to THB 5.000, although at the time of writing, the previous fee of THB 2000 is still in use), a number of awareness campaigns, and a national ban on advertisement. Don’t walk and smoke It is already past 2:00 a.m. when we exit the big 24/7 supermarket with a new drab coloured pack of cigarettes. Bangkok, the city that never sleeps, seems to have fallen into a bit of a slumber around the usually bustling street of Ekkamai. Located close to Sukkumvit road, most of the activity in this part of one of the richer districts in Bangkok seems to shut its eye’s around 1:00 a.m. The party continues further north up the street, where Soi Ekkamai meets Thong Lor on a small strip that forms a bridge between Bangkok’s wealthy sons and daughters of media tycoons, business moguls, and the handful of foreign tourists who dared venture outside the backpackers capital that is Khaosan road. Sand, who I regard as an example of emancipated female Bangkokians, looks at the fresh merchandise in my hand. We both light one up. As I am about to head into the direction of my apartment she stops me. “Ee, mai dai! (cannot)” She says. I ask her what seems to be the problem. “It’s just not polite”. She looks at the few people still hanging around the supermarket. Seconds after we light the cigarettes two people exiting the supermarket cross our path, making Sand throw an apologetic look into their direction.","['Smoking', 'Indonesia', 'Thailand']"

Firstly, it is analysed how Vespucci by means of classical reception in the design and attitude of his letter, aims to meet the taste of his humanist patron Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco. This is done in chapter one. Secondly, it is examined how Vespucci used the frameworks of classical cosmology, geography and natural sciences in order to describe and introduce his new discoveries. The ideas of Ptolemy, Herodotus, Pliny, Vergil and Lucretius, among others, are reviewed. This is done in the following chapter. Furthermore, it should be noted that the framing of the """"other"""" and its communication to a wider audience, as in Vespucci's Mundus Novus, go hand in hand with a sense of European hierarchal superiority towards America. Therefore, in addition, both chapters analyse how the classical reception in Vespucci's frameworks may reflect on a world in which colonisation by European powers began to take shape as a result of transatlantic voyages and explorations.","['Classical Reception', 'Renaissance', 'Ethnography', 'Geography']"
The world is run by those willing to sit until the end of meetings How Japan’s Prime Minister Abe’s visit to China improved Sino-Japanese relations,"Gerritsen, Oriana Zara","[""d'Hooghe, I.M.A.""]",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the beginning of 2018, The United States under President Trump started a trade war with China. At the same time Japan-United States relations experienced similar tensions due to a trade deficit. This paper will investigate Japan’s changed diplomacy towards China amidst the ongoing China-United States trade war. The study focuses on a recent official visit by Japan’s Prime Minister Abe to China that took place from the 25th to the 27th of October 2018. The visit was to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China. In order to portray Japan’s changed diplomacy primary sources of the visit will be used, as well as secondary sources from Chinese and Japanese media (such as the Japan Times and South China Morning Post). To further answer this question, economic diplomacy is used as a theoretical framework. This thesis finds that Sino-Japanese relations have stabilized due to tensions from the United States and both parties seek to improve economic relations. The visit also paved a way for future visits and thus a continued strengthening of Sino-Japanese relations and building of trust. However, bilateral historical and territorial issues remain unresolved.","['China', 'Japan', 'Trade war', 'US', 'Official visit']"

Stroke order for Dutch secondary school students,"SUN, Hui","['Sybesma, Rint']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Strokes and stroke order are compulsory elements in order to write Chinese characters by hand in the conventional way. In Chinese education, strokes and stroke order are still very important learning objectives. However, there has never been any consensus about stroke orders. Perhaps more importantly, for daily communication in this digital era, stroke and stroke orders seldom plays any active role in digital input methods. As a reaction to this, in Chinese society there is a fear of “character amnesia”, which means being afraid of losing the ability to write Chinese characters. Observers that are worried about this phenomenon base their worries on the idea that Chinese characters carry a political, historical and cultural “baggage” that the Chinese people should pass on to future generations. As for Dutch students, the necessity for Dutch students to handwrite Chinese characters is even less prominent than for native Chinese speakers. It is always possible for Dutch students to use Pinyin input to type/write Chinese characters on a computer and phone. Furthermore, from the cultural perspective, the role of strokes and stroke order connected to national identity via Chinese characters do not apply to Dutch students. The final level for Dutch secondary school students is A1 or A2, which is quite humble. Character writing is difficult enough, let alone the stroke order, especially since there is still discussion about certain stroke orders in Chinese academic fields. There is limited instruction time for Chinese and it does not provide enough time for Dutch students to master strokes and stroke order. Pragmatically, it is not worth the time to learn it.","['stroke order', 'Teaching Chinese as a second language', 'Teaching Chinese in Dutch secondary schools', 'writing Chinese characters for a second language learner']"

In particular, this thesis will focus on the Maronite Christians of the Ottoman Province (Sanjak) of Mount-Lebanon, and the crimes perpetrated against them, as part and parcel of the better known Ottoman policies against the Armenians, the Assyrians, and the Pontus Greeks during the Great War period. This thesis will stress the importance of studying and remembering history, including the minorities’ perspective and experience of it, admitting it into “official” histories, and explaining how official histories may have consequences in unresolved and recurring issues of memory and identity in modern Lebanon. This thesis will bring to bear recent scholarship and recently released archival sources relative to Ottoman Lebanon, in order to help illuminate a time period that is still shrouded in obscurity. I rely on numerous primary and secondary sources such as memoirs, biographies, histories, historiographies, and lyrical accounts. These sources are varied in perspective as some are written by Eastern Christians themselves, other Ottoman subjects, and both local and foreign bystanders privy to the events on Mount-Lebanon between 1914 and 1918. This thesis will be organized into three chapters, which will attempt to shed light on the historiographical debate, the Christian memories of the Great Famine of Mount-Lebanon, the Christian perspective of an Ottoman genocidal policy vis-à-vis Mount-Lebanon; attempt to explain the reason for the silenced history, and the consequences faced today, in a modern (Greater) Lebanon that is in many ways the outcome of the events of 1914-1918.","['Lebanon', 'Christians', 'Famine']"

Hamas: The Politics of War and Peace,"Taha, Zahra","['Berger, Maurits']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Hamas has changed considerably over the past 30 years. The movement that arose in 1987 as a military resistance originated as a charity organisation and nowadays participates in Palestinian politics. Hamas entered Palestinian politics in 2005 when the Palestinians conducted the first free elections for the Palestinian National Authority (PA). Few expected Hamas to win the elections and Western diplomats had assessed Hamas as a radical Islamic organisation preferring violence over political participation to pursue its goals. However, Hamas won the elections and ended Fatah’ domination of the PA. After this victory, Hamas underwent a complex process to assert authority and control over the Gaza Strip in 2007. This complex process coincided with the transformation of Hamas from a resistance movement to a political party. This thesis focusses on this transition and aims to generate a better understanding of Hamas’ performance as a political party and what has been called a ‘rebel government’. This study explores whether the movement can function as a partner in dialogue for peace talks in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. To this end, this thesis aims to answer the following research question: To what extent is it possible for Hamas to become a legitimate partner in the dialogue regarding the peace process in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict?","['Hamas', 'Peacebuilding', 'Conflict Resolution']"

A thematic analysis of #MeToo movement related WeChat posts on sexual harassment in China,"Tyukhtina, Anastasiia","['Kharchenkova, Svetlana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Sexual harassment is a worldwide problem. Its importance has been emphasized beyond scholarly discussion by global public initiatives, such as the #MeToo movement. This campaign came to China in January 2018 and encouraged thousands of women and men to use social networks as a channel to speak out about their experiences. Now, their WeChat posts bear testimony to the scope of the issue in China. This study aims to analyze these posts and answer the following research question: How do Chinese WeChat users discuss sexual misconduct, such as harassment or abuse, in #MeToo movement related posts, and what are the main topics they raise? Thematic analysis revealed that the most often mentioned themes included: the definition of sexual harassment, the causes of sexual harassment in Chinese society, as well as different types of offenders. In particular, this study identified that WeChat users acknowledge that sexual harassment may go far beyond physical harassment and also includes verbal harassment or gender harassment. Second, the analysis reveals that users tend to view a broad range of specifically Chinese societal and cultural reasons including gender inequality, patriarchy, traditional cultural norms, and wrong parenting educating patterns as contributing factors to the existence of sexual harassment in Chinese society. Finally, from the WeChat users' perspective, gender inequality and patriarchy are supported by traditional cultural norms which might be transmitted in the society via wrong educating patterns at home or school.","['sexual harassment', '#MeToo movement', 'China']"
Slachtoffers van de natie: de impact van nationalisme op de herdenking van Koreaanse “troostmeisjes”,"Gessel, Brechtje Sanne van","['Breuker, Remco']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie beantwoord ik de vraag “Wat is de invloed van nationalisme op de herdenking van Koreaanse slachtoffers van seksuele slavernij door het Japans Keizerlijk leger in Zuid-Korea?” Bij de beantwoording van deze vraag zal ik het herdenkingsmonument de sonyŏsang als belangrijkste voorbeeld gebruiken. Hoewel ik het wel over het activisme rondom de slachtoffers ga hebben, heb ik toch gekozen voor het woord “herdenking”. Een groot deel van de literatuur over dit onderwerp gaat over de ontkenning van de gebeurtenissen door de Japanse staat en de protesten voor erkenning door Zuid-Koreanen. Omdat de gebeurtenissen nog steeds door de Japanse staat ontkend en gebagatelliseerd worden, is op dit moment herdenking per definitie een vorm van protest. Omgekeerd is dit ook het geval. Omdat de protesten, naast monetaire compensatie, vooral om erkenning gaan, is actievoeren een onlosmakelijk onderdeel van de herdenking. Herdenken en actievoeren zijn dus op dit moment niet makkelijk van elkaar te scheiden. De reden dat ik specifiek voor het woord herdenken heb gekozen, en niet actievoeren, is dat ik mij in deze scriptie zal focussen op de invloed die nationalisme heeft op de herdenking binnen Zuid-Korea zelf, en niet op Japan of op de relatie van Zuid-Korea met Japan.","['Zuid-Korea', 'Troostmeisjes', 'Nationalisme']"

Transnationalism in women magazines,"Root, Jolle Rinto","['Bruijn, Petra de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,The phenomenon of transnationalism is seen in history for multiple decades. The magazine Azeema focusses on women of colour who have a bilateral background and are most of the time from the Middle Eastern North Africa region (MENA-region). Azeema and a couple of other initiatives are precursors in the sense that they focus on a group of people who formerly did not see representation of themselves in the media landscape. Via interviews and online content a context description is set up which explains how the editors of the magazine found Azeema. Due to the lack of representation and the desire to present a more nuanced picture of women from the region chief editor Jameela Elfaki started the magazine.Based in London the five-headed team started writing articles and accepting guest writers for the magazine. By means of a qualitative content analysis underlying themes and patterns of data are drafted. Five returning categories are founded when analyzing the data of Azeema’s publications. Besides these categories Azeema’s visual material is also considered during this analysation. The researched showed how the five categories were all adding to a ‘new’ wave of transnationalism that come about by bottom-up organizations.,"['Transnationalism', 'globalisation', 'womanhood']"

Changing views and depictions of Westerners in Japan focusing on Yokohama-e prints,"Huisintveld, Isabel","['Müller, Doreen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"When the ports opened in Yokohama a new type of ukiyo-e print was made. The Japanese people were fascinated by the new residents and the foreigners were an interesting subject for woodblock prints. The appearance of the foreigners on these prints changed a lot in comparison to earlier depictions of foreigners, for example the Nanban screens or tojin pictures. The different depictions of foreigners could be a marker for all kind of social and economic changes. Also the views that the Japanese people had of foreigners were changing and this was apparent because of the more Japanese looking foreigners on the prints. The times were shifting from the feudalistic Edo period into the more modern Meiji period. This meant that a lot of new people, culture, and technology was introduced. Not only did this affect the subject matter of prints but also the attitude the Japanese people had towards foreigners. Curiosity, hostility, and also fascination were felt during the time the ports were just opened and foreigners were let in, but these feelings were not always conveyed through the prints. In this thesis I will do a visual analysis on how the depictions of foreigners changed. Also through visual analysis I will discuss the social changes and attitudes of the Japanese people and the function of the prints.","['Yokohama-e', 'ukiyo-e', 'foreigners', 'others', 'Westerners', 'visual analysis']"

First, it looks at their distribution and variation throughout the Kejia dialects and their possible origin. This enables research into the function of Kejia possessive pronouns and their usage in possessive constructions, which forms the latter part of the thesis. While earlier research on the topic focused on separate Kejia dialects, in this thesis, all the available data from scholarly literature have been collected, compared, and enhanced with a small informant consultation. The thesis finds that: Kejia possessive pronouns are found in all dialects looked at; they feature some variation but most seem to be constructed out of the personal pronouns with /-a/ as coda vowel; of the three origin theories compared, the one that proposes contraction of the personal pronoun and the /a-/ common before kinship terms is the most plausible; in some dialects, the usage is limited to kinship terms, while in other dialects the usage has broadened to all semantic categories of possession, and throughout the Kejia dialects much variation exists in this respect; in some dialects, the subdivision of possessive constructions does not follow the traditional subdivision in semantic categories.","['Kejia Chinese', 'Hakka', 'possessive pronouns', 'language variation', 'Chinese dialectology', 'Sinitic languages']"

As China consistently portrays the BRI as mutual beneficial and a ""win-win"" situation for all participants, I was keen on verifying this statement and identify if this proclamation matches reality. For this purpose, the “Special Economic Zone” of Khorgos, which is located in Kazakhstan, was chosen. It is a project along the BRI, at the border of Kazakhstan and China. The project itself has not seen much media coverage and hence turned out to be an insightful research project. The general purpose of Khorgos is to boost the amount of traded goods as well as attract investment into the area. The chosen method of research aimed at analyzing speeches given by officials of both countries regarding the BRI as well as Khorgos specifically and from that derive a possible contrast with reality. The result of the research was, that, as the project came only recently into being, it disclosed several negative aspects such as the lack of information, clarity and entry barrier for third parties outside of China and Kazakhstan. Moreover, it turned out that the business advantages prevail heavily on the Chinese side. Khorgos is furthermore not as fruitful as initially anticipated by both parties. Additionally, it is likely that China will remain the main investor in the region and continue to seek to explore new trade corridors. along the BRI, at the border between Kazakhstan and China, which has not seen much coverage and hence turned out to be an insightful research project.","['Kazakhstan', 'China', 'BRI', 'Khorgos', 'Special Economic Zone', 'SEZ', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'One Belt One Road', 'OBOR']"

Veiling in Public Space in the Netherlands: A Frame Analysis of the Headscarf and the Burqa in Political Debates,"Baghou, Hanae","['Berger, Maurits']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis provides an analysis of claims about veiling in parliamentary debates between 2007 and 2019. In my research, I have further build on Saharso and Lettinga’s work, who have analyzed public debates about veiling (1999-2006). Developments of the past fourteen years called for a comprehensive analysis of the use of frames in political debates with an updated framework to see if these developments signify new (clusters of) frames. I have defined five clusters of frames: (1) state-church frames, (2) integration frames, (3) discrimination frames, (4) gender frames, and (5) security frames. Based on a content analysis of parliamentary debates, I conclude that there have been developments in debates about veiling, which signify either new frames or new clusters of frames. Research showed that the use of security frames indeed signifies a new cluster of frames, particularly resonant in burqa debates. Another observation is that the integration, discrimination and gender frames are part of larger debates and, in contrast to the state-church and security frames, cannot be linked to particular debates or specific public realms, neither can they be organized in time. While the discrimination frames seem to be a separate cluster in relation to the integration frames, this does not mean that the integration frames have become less relevant in debates about veiling. Another outcome is that the Judeo-Christian heritage frame is incidentally used in parliamentary debates and does not represent a certain trend or development. Lastly, the state-church frames are still relevant in debates about veiling, particularly in debates about accommodation of headscarves in the police force.","['Headscarf', 'Burqa', 'Framing', 'Political debates', 'Public space', 'The Netherlands']"

Deze twee periodes (1099-1187 en 1967-heden) zijn uniek doordat het de langstdurende periodes zijn waarbij Jeruzalem buiten islamitische heerschappij viel, sinds de verovering van de stad door de kalief ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb in 637. Gedurende beide periodes speelde poëzie een centrale rol in de Arabische wereld. Het diende als literair medium om uiting te geven aan het verlangen tot een herovering en terugkeer naar de stad, waarbij dichters uitvoerig gebruik maakten van religieuze symboliek om dit verlangen kracht bij te zetten. In het kort kan gesteld worden dat dichters uit beide periodes zich op grofweg dezelfde islamitische symboliek beriepen, maar dat er significante verschillen bestaan wat betreft het gebruik van niet-islamitische religieuze symboliek. Het gebruik van dergelijke veelal christelijke maar ook joodse symboliek, hing sterk af van de politieke context waarbinnen gedichten geschreven werden. Waar de ene dichter dergelijke symboliek aanhaalde om religieuze verschillen te overstijgen, gebruikte de ander niet-islamitische symboliek om een islamitisch-religieuze agenda te promoten. Ondanks deze verschillen kan zonder meer gesteld worden dat alle dichters eenzelfde liefde en verlangen uitten voor Jeruzalem.","['Jeruzalem', 'Arabische poëzie', 'Kruistochten', 'Arabisch-Israëlisch conflict', 'Religieuze symboliek']"

Developments in both adoption policies and single-parent policies are analysed in order to see how these affect childrearing behaviour amongst single-mothers in South Korea. Secondary and governmental data on overseas and domestic adoption is collected in order to form coherent tables that are used to analyse the effects of the policy amendments. Past policy amendments are discussed and the effects of secondary factors such as fluctuating birth-rates and economic crises are considered in the analysis. In general South Korea’s welfare system is lacking behind its economic growth, which especially affects single-mother households. The social support offered by companies that compensates for the weak public welfare system does not apply to these households, as single-mothers often have no choice but to opt for part-time jobs due to their dual responsibilities. As a result these households have to turn to their family for social support, but often have difficulty receiving this due to the inflexibility of older generations in accepting alternative family structures. All causing single-mothers to be especially reliant on public welfare. Nevertheless, the current system only offers limited social support for these households. Despite increased willingness of child-rearing amongst single-mothers, the support system is not yet optimal and should be improved to accommodate these households.","['South Korea', 'Adoption laws', 'Single Motherhood', 'Overseas adoption policies', 'Domestic adoption policies', 'Single Parent Support System']"
Al naargelang: Een semantische en syntactische analyse van het Mandarijnse dou,"Eikenaar, Wesley","['Wiedenhof, J.M.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie bespreekt een syntactisch facet van het gesproken Mandarijn. De aanleiding voor dit onderzoek was de volgende zin die ik tegenkwam tijdens het kijken van een Chinees televisieprogramma: Wǒmen méi you shuǐ hē dou. ‘We hebben niks te drinken’ gevolgd door een onbekend woordje dou. Deze wordt in de ondertiteling geschreven als 都, hetzelfde karakter als die van het bijwoord dōu ‘alle’, dat ik wel in mijn eerste studiejaar geleerd heb. Deze dou verschilt echter van dōu in toon, en staat aan het einde van de zin, in plaats van de typische plaats van bijwoorden in het Mandarijn. Daarnaast heeft het karakter 都 ook de mogelijke leesuitspraak dū. Mijn waarneming wordt met de volgende onderzoeksvragen benaderd: (1) Wat betekent deze dou aan het einde van de zin? (2) Is dou aan het einde van de zin – ook buiten het schrift om – gerelateerd aan het bijwoord dōu ‘alle’, en zo ja, hoe? (3) Wat is de historische ontwikkeling van de betekenissen en uitspraken van het karakter 都? Allereerst vindt er een literatuuronderzoek plaats naar de uitspraak en betekenissen van het karakter 都 en het bijwoord ‘alle’ in woordenboeken, grammatica’s en lesboeken vanaf het einde van de negentiende eeuw tot nu. Een interessante ontdekking hieruit is dat de leesuitspraak dū na 1948 vrijwel niet meer voor ‘alle’ gedocumenteerd is. Daarna worden de syntaxis en betekenissen van het bijwoord dōu en de status van dou in kaart gebracht, en wordt er nagedacht over de semantische relaties tussen deze betekenissen. De analyses worden geïllustreerd met eigen gevonden voorbeelden uit de Mandarijnse spreektaal. Hierbij wordt een belangrijk onderscheid gemaakt tussen betekenis en interpretatie. De laatste paragraaf bespreekt vorm en betekenis van de dou uit mijn waarneming. Het lijkt te gaan om het bijwoord dōu dat naar achteren geplaatst is als nagedachte en een afwijkend prosodisch patroon heeft. Deze scriptie pleit tevens voor taalkundige analyse dat gebaseerd is op de spreektaal. Hoewel prosodie een integraal deel is van de gesproken taal, is daar nagenoeg niets van terug te vinden in de geschreven taal.","['Mandarijn', 'syntaxis', 'semantiek', 'interpretatie', 'dōu', 'spreektaal', 'achterplaatsing', 'prosodie']"

It is argued that through this latest trade agreement with Russia, Germany has indirectly become an important factor in managing European stability. This thesis provides more insight into these German-Russian bilateral energy relations and its implications, by analyzing existing and new empirical data, and tracing the causal relations between Nord Stream 2, Germany’s national interests, and the political stability of the European Union.

To do so, corporate identity, output and CSR reporting were compared for three case study firms: BMW Group (Western MNC), Brilliance China Automotive Holdings (Chinese firm), and BMW-Brilliance (a joint venture between the other two firms). The joint venture was included, because of certain ownership restrictions in the PRC in the automotive industry and the Western firm as a sole entity could not be examined in the PRC. The results showed that the Western MNC outperformed the other cases on all three categories, the joint venture came in at a close second, and the Chinese firm lacked far behind on all three categories. Comparing the results between the Western MNC and the joint venture seemed to indicate that the joint venture is merely used as a vessel for the Western MNC to sell/produce vehicles in the PRC due to the ownership restrictions. The context of the PRC did not seem to matter significantly, as BBA and BMW showed strikingly similar results. Results did show that certain theories surrounding CSR practicing in the PRC can be applied to Western MNCs in the PRC as well.","['Sustainable Development', ""People's Republic of China"", 'Europe', 'Automotive Industry', 'BMW-Brilliance', 'Greenwashing', 'Corporate Sustainability', 'Corporate Identity']"

European and Chinese Mutual Open Innovation,"Kuijper, Martin","['Wang, Jue']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"China desires to gain knowledge that is required to sophisticate its economy. This primarily involves investments in strategic sectors in Europe, which is increasingly received with anxiety and scepticism by European leaders. Therefore, an alternative for China to attain significant technological insights is open innovation. This research argues that this is a useful way of obtaining mutually profitable research and development. However, such a partnership requires confidence that is currently lacking. Therefore, this research answers the question: To what extent does the EU’s perception of China impede the Sino-EU cooperation on innovation? This dissertation examines this issue by analysing how the EU view on China influences trust towards this partner, and what this entails for open innovation. It is found that present preconceived negative notions on China lead to distrust. On certain issues, control mechanisms compensate for this lack of trust. However, more trust or control remains to be needed in order for future open innovation in this bilateral relationship to blossom.","['China', 'Innovation', 'Europe', 'Competition', 'Open innovation', 'cooperation', 'Trust', 'Trade', 'Perception', 'research and development']"
An examination of the high excess cash reserves of Japanese firms,"Wit, Ties de","['Shibata, Saori']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to explain why the cash reserves of Japanese firms have almost tripled in the years between 2013 and 2019, during a time where neoliberal policy reform should have encouraged spending excess cash on extra investing. By combining a study of already existing literature on how these policy changes should have affected firms and a case study on how Japanese firms have actually reacted to the reforms, it becomes clear that they did not have the expected results. Investments are down and cash reserves keep going up. With the use of the theory of path dependency, this phenomenon can be explained. Traditional Japanese firms have a tendency to be more conservative and tend to be focussed on long term growth. While the business environment has significantly changed, the structure and institutions of the firms have stayed the same. Easier access to financial capital and lower interest rates have increased profits, but they have not changed the firm’s investment strategies. Instead the new earned profits have been assigned to the cash reserves for later use.","['Cash reserves', 'Abenomics', 'Neoliberalism', 'Cash flow sensitivity', 'Agency theory']"

Online Nationalism in China: Weibo reactions to the detention of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou,"Bogerd, Erik","['Creemers, R.J.E.H.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the topic of nationalism in Weibo posts that discuss the detention of Meng Wanzhou, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Huawei. After the arrest, Weibo users quickly connected this case with broader nationalist topics, resulting in different types of nationalist reactions. This study describes how these reactions reflect, create or shape a nationalist discourse. This was done in three parts: first of all, I examined how the countries of Canada, the US and China are described. The analysis reveals that the comments describe the US as the active culprit and Canada as a more passive, docile country. Secondly, the question was formulated as to how Meng was described, as a person, as CFO of Huawei, and as a Chinese, in order to gain more insight into how these different layers of her identity coincide or contrast. This part concludes that most commenters express their support for Meng, but that her wealth and unclarity regarding her citizenship can result in a decrease of support. Finally, I investigated the ways in which nationalism can be converted into action. It became clear how consumption and nationalism can be linked: many Weibo users suggested to initiate a boycott, mainly against Apple. Simultaneously, others also reflected on the efficacy of such measures.","['nationalism', 'social media', 'national identity', 'weibo']"

Conversion to Judaism: a Historical Analysis on How Stringencies Arose and Why,"Barrios, Zane","['Goldstein-Sabbah, S.R.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Theology and Religious Studies (Master),Master thesis,en,"Conversion to Judaism is a very important topic when discussing the modern state of Israel. The Chief Rabbinate of the State of Israel decides who is recognized as a Jew within the State of Israel and, because of this, decides how conversions should take place. The conversion procedures the Chief Rabbinate of the State of Israel supports is extremely stringent, and the Chief Rabbinate also annuls conversions they deem too lenient. This is a stark contrast to what was practiced with regards to conversion a few decades ago. Throughout Jewish history, conversion procedures were never as stringent as they are today, and annulments of conversions were unheard of. This paper seeks to explain why the stringent approach to conversion in place today arose. To do this, there will be an examination of Jewish history, religious texts, and the politics of the religious sphere of the modern state of Israel. In answering this question, this paper wants to push a two-fold theory that can be used in examining other religions. This two-fold theory examines the way religions interact with other religions, as well as how religions will interact with other cultures. The two-fold theory, thus, can be used to explain culture as being inherently intertwined with religion.","['Judaism', 'Conversion', 'Proselytism', 'Religion', 'Modernity', 'Hebrew Bible']"

The deep-rooted gender inequality: Prime Minister Abe’s power discourse in the “comfort women” issue and womenomics policy,"Trijssenaar, Amber","['Black, L.O.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In December 2012, Abe Shinzo was again elected as Prime Minister of Japan and is now in office for almost six years. In those six years, he promised economic growth for Japan, through his policy Abenomics including womenomics. Likewise, with the Japan-Korea 2015 Agreement, he showed his desire to settle the “comfort women” issue with South Korea. However, both plans have not been accomplished, with the Japanese economy still stagnating, and the “comfort women” still being an issue after the 2015 agreement failed. With womenomics, the goal was to increase the number of working women and increase the number of women in leadership positions. However, with Abe being a supporter of the patriarchal system, it is hard to reach this goal. After analysing the policy womenomics and Abe’s promotion regarding the issue, it can be seen that through Abe’s choice of words, he creates a power discourse, which deepens the gender inequality in society. Abe’s power discourse on womenomics portraits women as helpless beings who need a man’s help to become successful, deepening gender inequality. Similarly, Abe’s revisionist stance caused the agreement to fail, and the “comfort women” to remain an issue. An analysis of Abe’s statement regarding the “comfort women” issue shows his refusal in seeing the “comfort women” as sex slaves, even depicting them as workers for the Japanese Imperial Army during the war. Due to Abe diminishing the victims’ stories and feelings, and portraying them as workers, he aggravates the gender inequality in society. So, Abe’s power discourse of womenomics and the “comfort women issue” makes gender inequality more deep-rooted in society.","['Abe Shinzo', 'Womenomics', 'Comfort women', 'gender inequality']"

Diﬀering much from the stress accent found in most Indo-European languages, even learners well into the advanced stage struggle to utter sentences in a fully native-like manner. Therefore, in this thesis, I tackle the issue of What teaching methods are best suited for pitch accent acquisition (PAA) in the long-term for adult foreign learners of Japanese? I discuss several methods for acquiring pitch accent, and directly compare two of them: Practising with audio-visual stimuli and explaining the rules governing pitch accent. I examined 3 groups of foreign Japanese language learners (n=9) and gave each of them a diﬀerent set of instructions (or no instruction, in case of thecontrolgroup).Inapretest, posttest, anddelayedposttest, theyweremadeto judge the pitch accent pattern of, and reproduce semi-randomly chosen, common Japanese words. The results suggest that explaining the rules is just as viable an option as compared to traditional training, and that textbook producers and teachers should not be afraid to expose students to the details pitch accent, even in the early stages of their learning. Further study is needed to support these conclusions, and explain what causes some students to respond better to one method over the other.","['Linguistics', 'Pitch accent', 'Japanese', 'Pronunciation']"

Historical marginalization and disempowering processes have not rarely threatened the biological and cultural existence of indigenous groups, which includes ancient cultural forms of identification. In an attempt to unravel Yawanawá-specific intergroup dynamics in threat situations, the thesis at hand seeks to contribute to the study of indigenous survival strategies by employing an innovative approach. This approach draws on psycho-social theories (notably Collective Angst Theory) in order to better understand the responses of the indigenous Yawanawá group to realistic and symbolic challenges affecting biological and cultural group vitality.","['Social Psychology', 'Collective Angst Theory', 'intergroup dynamics', 'indigenous survival strategy', 'the Yawanawá', 'Brazil', 'Acre Province']"

Exploring Extraordinary Identities: Analyzing Hosoda Mamoru's Films Through the Theory of Magical Realism,"Mouallem, Babette","['Crandol, Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores how the recurring theme of identity in director Hosoda Mamoru’s animated films can be analyzed through the theory of magical realism. Magical realism, in short, can be defined as a style of fiction that primarily depicts a realistic world view, but organically introduces elements of magic and the supernatural into this world that blur the lines between the ordinary and the extraordinary. These extraordinary elements are accepted as being natural to the otherwise realistic setting and its characters. The innately human issues and themes addressed in Hosoda’s films makes for incredibly engaging stories. However, Hosoda seems to always utilize elements of magic or otherworldliness that are lingering in the background. It is argued that these elements are being employed to urge his young characters to see the world from a new perspective, helping them grow into themselves and further define their identity. In order to analyze magical realist elements in Hosoda’s work, it is first argued that magical realism is applicable to film and anime. After discussing the literary origins of the magical realism, a set of attributes by which magical realism can be defined is assembled on accord of various scholarly interpretations of the term. Apart from globally acknowledged definitions of the term, it is also explored how the notion of identity manifests itself in specifically Japanese magical realist literature, since Japanese animation is being discussed. Having done this, a model of magical realist attributes applicable to film and anime is formed, through which finally, two films of Hosoda Mamoru’s are analyzed.","['Magical Realism', 'Mamoru Hosoda', 'Chanady', 'Napier', 'Faris', 'Bowers', 'Wolf Children', 'Mirai']"

Sowing seeds of reconciliation in deeply divided soil: The role of local CSOs in reconciling post-war Lebanon,"Berntsen, Nissa","['Ennis, Crystal']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Recently, scholarly debate on peacebuilding and reconciliation is making a “local-turn”, pointing towards local actors, such as civil society organizations, to achieve inclusive and locally grounded peace and reconciliation. Despite this interest, little studies have examined if, and how, these local actors make a contribution to these goals. Such a case is Lebanon, characterized by protracted, sectarian conflict, but where a group of CSOs is active within this contentious nexus between conflict and peace. How does the work of these CSOs fit in the paradigm of reconciliation? Can they contribute to reconciliation in Lebanon? Following these questions, this research suggests that these CSOs can be understood through the framework of political reconciliation of Schaap (2005). Furthermore, they exhibit various functions to a reconciliation process: They advocate new narratives on identity, conflict and history, and the rights of victims. It arises that participatory and grassroot approaches are most conducive to successes of the CSOs. At the same time, the strategy and goals of the CSOs are negotiated by constraining factors. In what I call a ‘negotiated reconciliation process’ sectarian and corrupt structures on the one hand, and resource-based problems and international donor wishes on the other, mitigate the level of success of the CSOs.","['reconciliation', 'Lebanon', 'civil society organizations', 'sectariansim', 'conflict']"

Portrayal of the Sino-Cambodian relationship in English-language Cambodian newspapers,"Akkersdijk, Matthijs","['Henley, David']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the run up to the 2018 general elections in Cambodia, prime minister Hun Sen increasingly controlled the media in the country. Additionally, Hun Sen becomes increasingly dependent on China for financial aid. On the one hand, Chinese influence is associated with economic development in the country. On the other hand, this influence is associated with violations of human rights and sustainable negligence. Therefore, this paper answers the question, ‘’why do English-language Cambodian newspapers differ in expressing their views towards the Sino-Cambodian relationship?’’. As such, this paper demonstrates the interplay between the Cambodian political economy, media ownership and the portrayal of the Sino-Cambodian relationship in English-language Cambodian newspapers. This paper examines articles from three different newspapers and deploys a discourse analysis as a tool for understanding. Linking the findings to the context, this study demonstrates how a critical tone and a lack of emphasis on Cambodian reciprocity in the Sino-Cambodian relationship can affect ownership of a newspaper and how this has consequences for the portrayal of the Sino-Cambodian relationship in the articles published.","['Cambodia', 'Hun Sen', 'CPP', 'China', 'Media', 'Free Press', 'Cambodia Daily', 'Phnom Penh Post', 'Khmer Times', 'Discourse']"

Fire is a landmark film, a radical change and challenge to depictions of queer individuals in film, bringing queer visibility into mainstream cinema. The films analysed in the thesis include Bollywood cinema, new Indian Indies and documentaries. I conduct a film analysis, exploring how specific sexual and gender identities and the queer community are represented in films and how these films reflect Indian society at their time of release. By examining the story structure, overall image of queer protagonists and cinematography, I argue that queer identity in Indian films after Fire has generally become more diverse and complicated. While Indian cinema tends to portray middle-class queer life, documentaries focus on the queer individuals who are further marginalised in society. Portrayals of queer subjectivity can vary according to the type of film and the nature of the target audience.","['Indian films', 'queer representation', 'film analysis']"

By looking at the Employment Permit System, the policies that are effective under it, activist groups, the realities of (Filipino) migrants and their situation in their home country, a picture is painted of the current consequences and challenges that the EPS poses. It became clear through this research that the EPS was lacking in labour and human rights for migrants and granted a lot of power for the employer. The policy was brought on as the Ministry of Justice wanted the migrant workers to leave the country after 3 years to preserve the South Korean social cohesion, increasing the discrimination. The case of the Filipino worker is a particular dire one as the Filipino government sends many of their citizens to work abroad, to the extent of a large monetary dependency on remittances. This urgency further skirted the migrants’ rights for economic gain, leaving them vulnerable for exploitation. It is thus important to not only look at the migrant policy of one country (in this case South Korea), but also the home country’s situation to pose effective solutions against the discrimination and exploitation of migrant workers.","['migration policy', 'Employment Permit System', 'labour law', 'overseas Filipino workers']"

The Political Dimensions of Russia-China Meat Trade,"Matlock, Nicholas Hugh","['Wang, Jue']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Agriculture in Russia became a sector of great focus for the government as a consequence of the Crimean Crisis of 2014. Tit for tat sanctions resulted in a partial ban on agricultural imports into Russia from the EU and the US, which forced the government to look for internally sourced replacements for food that had earlier been imported. The resultant policies of import substitution appear to have been successful. China is an obvious additional potential market for Russian agribusiness, which has benefited from the barriers set up during the “Sanctions Wars” that began in 2014. The same factors that cleared the domestic market for Russian producers (namely, political and trade disputes with the United States and European Union) are likely to help them ramp up exports to China. The timing has been fortuitous for Russia. They had years to “prepare” their internal response before China began to get hit with some of the same policies Russia has faced for over half a decade. As China often uses access to its market as a source of political leverage, it is important to investigate the potential risks involved in organizing production of meat for export in the Far East to the East Asian region and China in particular.","['Russia-China Meat', 'Agriculture', 'Foreign policy']"

Framing in the US media: China's presence in the Amazon,"Dłuska, Aleksandra Ewa","['Gonzalez Vicente, Ruben']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis engages in the debate on framing China in the US media, by analyzing the coverage of Chinese investments in the New York Times and the Washington Post. The aim of this research is to explore dominating frames in the US elite newspaper with regard to China, Latin American countries and the Amazon rainforest. Moreover, the paper examines whether framing in the US newspapers reflected the state of the US-China relations, as well as the US government official rhetoric towards China during 2009-2019. The findings of the thesis suggest prevalence of the following frames: The US-China geopolitical rivalry, Unscrupulous China and Vulnerable Latin America. The results indicate that in the spotlight was the damaging activity of Chinese ventures lacking in adequate contextualization of their activities in the history of foreign companies operations in the same industries in the Amazon. The tendencies indentified in the media coverage correspond with the arguments previously presented in the literature on the US media framing over a predominant negative focus on domestic struggles of the Global South. Furthermore, the perceptions of ‘rise of China’ and Latin America as the ‘US’s backyard’ were discerned as subsequent news tropes.","['China', 'Latin America', 'The United States', 'Media', 'Framing', 'The Amazon rainforest', 'South-South cooperation']"

For this, I used qualitative data to support my thesis statement. This qualitative data is secondary data, meaning I extracted information that was collected by other researchers from their research papers, as opposed to new, primary data. In order to gain a better insight in the workings of both the comfort women issue and the #MeToo movement, I discuss events connected to both the comfort women issue and the #MeToo movement that emerged before, during and after the issues became known in Korean society. By comparing, I have found that there are a significant amount of similarities between the two issues. First, i found that both issues were not completely new to the public, and were just not spoken about often. Adding to this, in both situations, the women who spoke up first had been quiet about theit abuse for a long time. Lastly, it is seen that support for the victims in both cases was built from grassroots organizations, and these organizations pressured the government into taking action. By analyzing how both the comfort women issue and the #MeToo movement have progressed over the years, I can confirm the theory that at its core, the comfort women could very well be considered the forerunners of the #MeToo movement.","['MeToo movement', 'Comfort women', 'Feminism']"

Van Olympus naar de Rocky Mountains: De opbouw en reconstructieprincipes van het Hellenismos in Amerika,"Stigt Thans, van Isabella","['Davidsen, Markus A.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Religiewetenschappen (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,The purpose of this study is to investigate how Hellenic reconstructionist in America construct their religion and what their reconstruction principles are. This study is done on the basis of two primary sources. This study is a literature study. The two primary sources used in this study were: A Beginner’s Guide to Hellenismos written by Timothy Jay Alexander and Hellenismos: Practicing Greek Polytheism today written by Tony Mierzwicki. An important secondary source which was used in this study is a thesis written by Tao Thykier Makeeff named Do Satyrs Wear Sneakers? Hellenic Polytheism and the reception of Antiquity in Contemporary Greece – a Study in Serious Play. The results show that primary and secondary sources are the most important sources on which Hellenic reconstructionist base their religion. In America UPG (Unverified Personal Gnosis) is also very important for the Hellenic reconstructionist to shape the religion. The results also show there are differences and similarities between the two primary sources and a secondary source about Hellenic reconstructionism in Greece.,"['Hellenismos', 'UPG', 'America', 'Paganism']"
Representation of the Territory: The Role of the Puerto Rican Resident Commissioner in US Congress,"Blommestein, Lindy","['Thakur, Vineet']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper analyses the role and influence of the Puerto Rican resident commissioner in the US House of Representatives. Puerto Rico is a US territory; therefore, their representatives face limitations such as restricted voting rights. This lack of authority has caused many scholars to dismiss the resident commissioner as simply powerless. This research recognizes the constitutional limitations of the resident commissioner and inequality established by the Constitution between the US mainland and Puerto Rico. However, I will argue that the two resident commissioners analyzed in this research, Aníbal Acevedo-Vilá (2001-2004) and Luis Fortuño (2005-2009), have employed rhetorical tactics to exercise power within this unequal framework. One important rhetorical strategy relies on emphasizing the American nature of Puerto Rico, by referencing US citizenship and military contributions of Puerto Ricans. However, there is still little prospect for structural change to the island. One cause identified by this research is intra-Puerto Rican hostility and political dividedness on the island, that cause the resident commissioners to be unable to fully represent the whole Puerto Rican constituency.","['US Congress', 'Puerto Rico', 'Resident Commissioner', 'Territory', 'Delegate']"
Why oppose the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games? Framing Fukushima through the Reconstruction Olympics,"Karsseboom, Cherelle","['Giolai, Andrea']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The hypothesis of this thesis posits that the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games framed the moral idea of reconstruction to downplay the gravity of Japan’s reality under the eyes of an international audience. The legacy that the JOC has composed surrounding the reconstruction and recovery of Fukushima is in conflict with the views of Japanese anti-Olympic organizations. Through Erving Goffman’s 1974’s Framing Theory, “Reconstruction Olympics” seem to fit the concept of fabrication. The observations and experiences regarding the recovery of Fukushima by evacuees do not align with the fabricated framework by the JOC and the Japanese government, resulting in resistance to the Olympic Games by protest groups. The framing of the Games has played a fundamental role in the formation of its official narrative. Three groups Hangorin no Kai, Okotowari Link and Friends of the Earth Japan will be analyzed through their blog posts, which together seem to be in agreement on the topic of Fukushima’s recovery. Their discourse presents a clear counter-narrative to the discourse presented by the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Reconstruction in the narrative of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games should show results, however, due to fabrication the state of Fukushima is discredited by the JOC and the Japanese government.","['Olympic Games', 'Fukushima', 'Reconstruction Olympics', 'Tokyo 2020', 'Mega-event', 'Legacy', 'Framing Theory', 'Goffman', 'Tōhoku disaster', 'Hangorin no Kai', 'Okotowari Link', 'Friend of the Earth Japan', 'Anti-Olympic Movement', 'Counter-narratives']"
Dreams of Development,"Bartlett, Aneeka","['Ennis, Crystal']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Dreams, development, destiny. Every nation has a fantasy for itself, a part of which is infrastructure development. Research has shown that these visions are affected by historical visionary themes and shifts in spatial boundaries. This study aims to uncover how these visions are manifested regionally and globally. These visions have been challenged by certain realities of infrastructure development. The angle of labour recruitment brings to light how the fantasy of enhanced employment rates and economic success has been disempowered through the exclusion of unskilled labour communities. Building on existing work on social exclusion I ask the question : How has labour recruitment within port structures impacted the developmental and geopolitical imaginations of state actors that are co-developing with the Chinese BRI? This thesis critically engages with debates surrounding labour recruitment and Foreign Direct Investment through two case studies - the UAE and Pakistan. It uses port development as a conceptual space in which these labour recruitment challenges visibly undermine national visions. The study concludes that geopolitical imaginations create ideal mirages of economic development enabling accessibility through infrastructure networks while overlooking the exclusion of unskilled minority labour communities which has the potential to threaten national security.","['New Silk Road', 'labour recruitment', 'geopolitical imagination', 'social exclusion', 'infrastructure development']"

The Creation of Justi’s Vergleichungen and the Role that China Played in it,"Prins, Ilona Laura","['Weerdt, Hilde de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines different aspects of Vergleichungen der Europäischen mit den Asiatischen und andern vermeintlich Barbarischen Regierungen, with special attention to the role that China plays in this book and the author's theory. Vergleichungen is written by J.H.G. Justi and published in 1762. Justi was a German political and economic thinker who had a significant influence in this area, especially in Germany and Austria. Many of his books were very important in the economic and political debate of that time, but Vergleichungen did not attract much attention. However, I am of the opinion that Vergleichungen is a very original and interesting book since it is a fundamental critique of Eurocentrism, written at a time when Eurocentrism was on the rise in Europe. In Vergleichungen, Justi gives extensive examples of the state institutions, characteristics, etc. of non-European countries, compares them to the state institutions, characteristics, etc. in Europe, and then concludes that the institutions, characteristics, etc. of non-European countries function better than their counterparts in Europe, and that it would, therefore, be beneficial for European countries if they would introduce these institutions, characteristics, etc. in Europe. Of these non-European countries, Justi was especially interested in China as an example for Europe. This thesis will examine the different aspects that have been important for the creation of Vergleichungen, and will discuss whether Vergleichungen is unique or not. The different aspects will include Justi’s own opinion, the structure of Vergleichungen, from whom and which works Justi obtained his information about China and by whom he was influenced to write Vergleichungen, what Justi wanted to achieve with it and what he achieved, and why his other books attracted more attention.","['von Justi', 'Eurocentrism', 'Vergleichungen', 'China']"
China’s Foreign Investment Law: reform to rebrand foreign trade and investment,"Steur, Annemiek","['Creemers, R.J.E.H.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"On January 1st 2020 China will enact a new Foreign Investment Law. Even before its enactment, this law is already a hot topic of debate: it is the first time in 40 years since the Foreign Investment Laws were fundamentally updated, it is an attempt to ease trade and diplomatic relations with the U.S. and it is supposed to ease market access and improve the business environment, the latter elements being a source of friction between China and other countries. Because China’s previous economic and foreign investment policies have allowed it to become a major player in global trade, this change in legislature can be seen as both a natural extension of its current policies to adjust to its changing domestic economy as well as a pivoting point in its competition for dominance in the global trade market. While this law has not been enacted yet, it is interesting to put it in context of everchanging legislature in China and its process of “opening up”. That was one of the slogans of the great reforms in 1978, but appears to still be a major theme today. Foreign investment is a matter of relations of China with other countries, and the most recent and compelling tensions involve China-U.S. trade relations. This law therefore has the potential to reshape relations between two major powers. China changing its foreign policy undoubtedly has effects on global trade, and while it is difficult to measure its real effects, global actors are already responding. This thesis will look into the relation between China and the U.S. in particular. The central friction between China and the U.S. has not changed since President Trump took office in 2016, but the issues between China and the U.S. have taken on new forms with the imposed tariffs that marked the beginning of a trade dispute in 2018. Other issues that the U.S. has with China are the licensing process, as a business start-up has to be approved by the government and businesses have to give a lot of information, which is feared to increase Chinese competition and China’s “negative investment list”, which describes some industries that are not open for investment, and forced technology transfer. In addition, the U.S. has accused China before of undervaluing the RMB (the Chinese currency) and has complained about an uneven trade surplus for China, while the U.S. is left with a trade deficit. On the other hand, there are differences since President Trump took office in the White House. A very straightforward difference is that President Trump uses twitter to announce and change his mind on policies towards China in terms of trade, making China-U.S. relations unstable. Also, placing tariffs on Chinese goods is a measure not easily resorted to by previous presidents of the U.S. Still, this measure is an extension of the already present displeasure of the trade deficit between the U.S. and China. For the sake of the scope and conciseness, this thesis will limit itself to the period of the Trump administration (from 2016 onward). Usually, analyses are made of how economics, or rather economic development, influences International Relations, but in this thesis, since the mutual influence of IR and economics is considered self-evident and the law is meant to send a message to the international community, I will look at the language aspect of law, how the newly adopted Foreign Investment Law is interpreted in China and the U.S. and how it translates itself to China-U.S. relations. This thesis therefore will try to answer the following question: What does China try to communicate with the new Foreign Investment Law and how is it received in the United States? In the attempt to answer this question I will discuss the new Foreign Investment Law, compare it with the three existing ones, look at statements and speeches from the U.S. government on China’s new Foreign Investment Law, comments on the draft and final versions and other files that are representative of the situation and view of the U.S. government on China’s Foreign Investment Law. This will be put under the framework of expressive and communicative functions of law, as it helps us understand why a law and this specific law has relevance: it does not exist on its own, but tells a story of what China hopes to achieve with the alteration and how a global actor like the U.S. reacts. In addition, Beijing and Washington consensus will be briefly discussed, as to give some background to help understand from which the root of differences and similarities in statements from China and the U.S. about each other originates in an economic sense, since they are commenting on foreign investment.","['China', 'Foreign Investment Law', 'Foreign Investment', 'Law', 'China-US trade']"

Urban Planning in the Neoliberal City: Slum Eradication and Population Displacement in Casablanca,"Soler Tomé, María del Rosario","['Strava, Cristiana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores urban dynamics in Morocco. Specifically, it examines whether the geographies of urban population displacement and poverty concentration in Casablanca have changed due to slum eradication since the implementation of the Cities Without Slums Programme in 2004, and if so, how. Moreover, it explores the different political and socioeconomic consequences of this displacement for slum-dwellers. My contribution to the field is an exhaustive search of displacement patterns throughout the Casablanca prefecture and the creation of a dichotomy of soft vs. hard displacement, which differentiates extents of displacement in the region. The theoretical framework that guides the research is a combination of Henri Lefebvre’s theory of the production of space and an analysis of the neoliberal forces at work. This is done through an analysis of Moroccan news media and official policy documents published by different Moroccan state departments that discuss operations of resettlement and rehousing. The research concludes that slum dwellers have indeed been displaced from different areas of Casablanca since the launch of the programme. In some cases, they have been displaced to the periphery, this is to say, to the different provinces and prefectures adjacent to Casablanca. However, in other cases, displacement has taken place within the same area. These different degrees of displacement have had ambiguous political and socioeconomic effects on the affected populations.","['Casablanca', 'Urban planning', 'Cities Without Slums', 'Displacement', 'Neoliberalism']"

Within lhamo a number of conventions exist, one of which is the convention of percussion patterns. The musical accompaniment of lhamo is done by two musicians, one of whom plays a drum (rnga) and another who plays cymbals (rol mo). The drummer is the ""master of ceremonies"". By means of drum pattern variations, he indicates and controls which character(s) go on and off stage and when and how they move on stage. For that the drummer has a number of drum patterns at his disposal, that can be played singly or in various combinations and at various speeds. The cymbals player merely follows the dummer's lead. During my fieldwork in Boudhanath near Kathmandu with the Nepal Tibetan Lhamo Association (NTLA), I made an inventarisation of the lhamo drum patterns, which are described in this paper. The drum patterns are all recorded and come as appendix as sound files. Attention is given to organology of the instruments and lineage of drum pattern traditions. It appears that the traditional teaching method of oral transmission from teacher to student is not the only method used by NTLA. Often multiple instructors teach simultaneously. By teaching with multiple instructors, it is possible to learn a complete lhamo play in three or four rehearsals. A chapter is devoted to rhythm in Tibetan music. This is the first published inventarisation of lhamo patterns.","['Tibetan Opera', 'drum patterns', 'rhythm instruments in Tibetan music']"

In order to provide an answer to the main research question, the researcher has analyzed historical primary sources from both the Chinese and the Western perspective and has conducted an interview with Maritime Silk Road expert Frans-Paul van der Putten. The analysis of these sources indicates that there is growing tension between the presentation of the intentions of the Chinese government concerning MSR in the Indian Ocean and the Western perception of those intentions. From China’s perspective, the Chinese government presents its intentions concerning MSR as economically motivated, the goal being to create shared prosperity and connections by win-win cooperation with other countries. From the Western perspective, the perception is that the Chinese government has not only economic but also geopolitical intentions with its MSR-initiative. The conclusion is that this discrepancy will exacerbate tensions between China and the West and, eventually, may result in a confrontation.",
The Reinvention of Reality: An Analysis of Russian Online Disinformation and the Democratic Potential of the Internet,"Verheij, Jelle","['Skalamera, Morena']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper aims to analyse the democratic potential of the internet and the ways in which the Russian pro-government disinformation campaign is used to limit this potential by conducting exploratory research on Russia as a single case study. Firstly, Russia’s disinformation campaign is analysed on its own. Secondly, the paper causally connects this disinformation campaign to the internet’s potential to consolidate democracy, primarily as a new free medium for information. In doing so, the paper makes use of two theories, inoculation theory and network theory, as underlying mechanisms for its analysis. It is argued that a negative relation can be observed between the internet’s potential to consolidate democratic developments through free and truthful information and Russia’s disinformation campaign. As this paper remains primarily theoretical in its analysis, further research is advised to determine how this relation has manifested in Russian society and what practical implications can be observed.","['Russia', 'Disinformation', 'Politics', 'Media', 'Internet']"
"The Business of Learning: Critical Race Theory, Neoliberalism, and the American Charter School Movement","Nelkin, Benjamin G.","['Rieger, Bernhard']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The United States is currently in the process of replacing many of its traditional public schools with semi-private institutions called charter schools. Though this process only became widespread within the last few decades, its origins are rooted in the political turmoil that occurred during the American Civil Rights movement more than 50 years ago. By implementing critical race theory, this study investigates the relationship between long standing racism and the push to privatize U.S. public schools by using the New Orleans public school system as a focal point. Court documents, historical accounts, interviews, era specific newspaper articles and prior research into the field are all used to accomplish this aim. Analyzing these materials illustrates how current arguments in favor of privatization were born out of white resistance to racially integrated public schools in the mid-20th century, and still echo the talking points used during the Civil Rights era to challenge forced integration. Based on these analyses, this study concludes that the American charter school movement is poorly regulated, racially biased, and creates classroom inequality in New Orleans, and throughout the United States.","['neoliberalism', 'race', 'critical race theory', 'education', 'civil rights', 'charter schools', 'new orleans', 'education system']"

#Twitterjournalistiek. Een onderzoek naar de manier waarop journalisten die berichten over migratie omgaan met reacties op Twitter.,"Hofman, Flóri","['Pleijter, Alexander']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De opkomst van het internet en specifiek sociale media hebben voor veranderingen gezorgd binnen de journalistiek. Door middel van het internet kan het publiek steeds makkelijker in contact komen met journalisten. Ook ieders mogelijkheid om vrijelijk op het internet te kunnen publiceren heeft het journalistieke werk veranderd. Bovendien hebben de journalist en diens organisatie niet langer een monopolie op de verspreiding van het nieuws. Als gevolg van deze veranderingen is de networked journalist ontstaan. De traditionele journalistieke structuur maakte plaats voor openheid en interactiviteit die het internet biedt, hoewel de kernkarakteristieken van de journalistiek – waaronder haar maatschappelijke functie en het analyseren en filteren van nieuws – bleven bestaan. Journalist en burger werken toenemend samen aan het journalistieke product. Het sociale mediaplatform Twitter is een voorbeeld van hoe dit networked journalism zich kan manifesteren. Het platform biedt de mogelijkheid voor journalist en publiek om makkelijk in contact te komen en meningen uit te wisselen. Maatschappelijke thema’s worden op Twitter vaak besproken en bediscussieerd. Het thema ‘migratie’ is vanaf de zomer van 2015 sterk vertegenwoordigd op de publieke en nieuwsagenda, en roept ook op Twitter veel reacties van gebruikers op. Voor dit onderzoek zijn de tweets van elf Nederlandse journalisten die berichten over migratie geanalyseerd, evenals de reacties die zij krijgen op Twitter. Vervolgens zijn deze elf journalisten geïnterviewd over hoe zij omgaan met de verschillende soorten reacties, of de journalisten deze tweets nuttig achten en of de tweets gebruikt worden voor het journalistieke werk. Dit verkennende onderzoek brengt daarmee twee zaken in kaart: enerzijds categoriseert het de soort reacties die journalisten die berichten over migratie krijgen op Twitter, anderzijds categoriseert dit onderzoek de manier waarop deze journalisten omgaan met Twitterreacties.","['Twitter', 'journalistiek', 'migratie', 'journalisten', 'interviews', 'inhoudsanalyse']"

Flawed Economic Planning in Sub-Saharan Africa and its Consequences. A Political-Economic History of World Bank Policies in Malawi.,"Kuipers, Stijn","['Bellucci, S. (Stefano)']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Throughout the 2000s, the World Bank seems to have undergone a paradigm shift from a neoliberal, market-oriented agenda to a more state-centric approach with increased attention to national particularities in policy design. However, in contrast to the recent enthusiasm by a variety of authors does this thesis argue that the increased attention to the role of institutions and politics in socio-economic development has merely been discursive. The here presented historical analysis of Malawi’s political economy since 1979 shows that there have been little actual changes to the Bank’s policies over the years, to the detriment of equitable socio-economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa. A continued focus on neoclassical economic theory and a lack of attention to national political economy are largely to blame. This thesis holds that to improve socio-economic development, development in practice needs to be transformed by moving beyond overtly theoretical and technocratic approaches and recognizing the inherent political nature of economies, instead of viewing the socio-political order underlying market relationships as an isolated given.","['Development economics', 'African development', 'World Bank', 'Political Economy', 'Malawi', 'Washington Consensus', 'Market Fundamentalism', 'Neoliberalism', 'Political economy of development', 'Neoclassical economics']"

The framing of Russia’s 2018 pension reform in state-controlled news broadcasting,"Kirpestein, Johannes","['Bader, Max']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The main finding of this master thesis is that Russian state-controlled media communicated Russia’s 2018 pension reform through a pattern of media frames aimed to explain the reform as the only reasonable solution to a problem. This thesis has used three framing analysis theories that highlight from different perspectives how the 2018 pension reform was framed on Perviy Kanal, the largest Russian news channel. The first chapter of this thesis is a literature review of (media) framing research. Framing research is a popular and multifaceted topic in the field of (political) communication. A preliminary concept of framing could refer to how media uses selection and salience to influence human consciousness and shape public opinion (Entman, 1993, 2004). The second chapter elaborates on the contemporary mass media environment in Russia and specifically focusses on framing in Russian mass media. The last chapter discusses the results of this thesis’ empirical research based on the concept of media framing and against the background of earlier research about how mass media is employed in Russia. The primary research discusses Russian news broadcasting reports that cover topics on, or related to, the pension reform in Russia from 14 June 2018 until 14 January 2019.","['Framing', 'Russia', 'Pension reform', 'news broadcasting', '2018']"

Using an adaptation of Daniel Flemes’ conceptualisation of regional power, this thesis analyses Saudi leadership in the first four and a half years of the Yemen Civil War (March 2015 – August 2019). The case study was performed using an overarching causal-process tracing approach. Three variables that are fundamental for Saudi regional leadership in Yemen have been distinguished; claim to leadership, material methods of self-assertion and acceptance of leadership. As these variables are different in nature, they have been analysed using different methodologies. The findings of these analyses suggest that it is easy to ascribe a regional leading role to Saudi Arabia, as its claim to leadership and growing regional assertiveness are evident, but that real leadership over countries in the region is missing. Ultimately, this thesis illustrates that case study research is essential in the process of classifying a country as ‘regional power’.","['Saudi Arabia', 'Regional Power', 'Yemen', 'International Relations', 'Conflict Studies', 'Yemen Civil War']"
Synergies under Scrutiny: the Impact of Societal Responses on the Success of Cross-Border Joint Ventures in China,"Mud, Tobias","['Landsberger, Stefan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis is about the study of the impact of responses from (civil) society, the economic market and the national political sphere on the success of cross-border joint ventures in China. Through this study, it will be established that responses from the aforementioned sectors do indeed impact the realization of cross-border joint ventures in China. The origin and role of these responses in facilitating international corporate interaction will also be assessed. Because of the lack of research on cross-border Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) in China, literature has been selected from a variety of perspectives and disciplines. The societal responses have been grouped in three different foci through which the research has been done: (1) external risks inherent to joint ventures and M&A in general, that in the context of the Chinese market are extra compromising; (2) the controlling practices and narrative of the economic nationalist agenda of the Chinese government; (3) (media) discourses and practices that code the consumption of foreign products and/or services through the lens of consumer nationalism. Leading from these foci and the establishment of the existence of an impact, the research question has been tackled from different angles through e.g. case studies, sub-questions and a counterargument. The intended purpose of this enquiry is to contribute to an underdeveloped research field and also aid practitioners’ understanding of Chinese M&A so they can better anticipate and design their cross-border joint ventures in China.","['Joint Ventures in China', 'Mergers & Acquisitions Theory', 'Economic Nationalism', 'Consumer Nationalism', 'Chinese Foreign Direct Investment', 'Corporate Public Relations']"

This is done through considerations of the work of Annie Cattrell and Helen Chadwick. In order to identify the added value of art, first an analysis is made of the current neuroscientific stance and its influence in society. Secondly, the thesis minutely demarcates the limits of the neuroscientific method. Here it is laid bare why its objective nature is inherently inadequate for a full understanding of consciousness, that is subjective per definition. The third chapter offers a concise introduction to neuro art. In the subsequent two chapters, the confrontation with the two artworks takes place. Through a reflection on how the artists employ their artistic means to conduct their research on the subject, insights on the construction of consciousness are deduced. The thesis is ended with a reflection on the position of art regarding science is present-day society. Art that engages itself with science enriches the ideas about the construction of consciousness.","['neuro art', 'consciousness', 'mind-body problem', 'first-person perspective', 'neuroscience', 'Helen Chadwick', 'Susan Aldworth']"

Artemisia Gentileschi's horrorschiderij: barokke visuele strategieën vergeleken met moderne horrorfilmtechnieken,"Blokzijl, Milena Damaris","['Boers-Goosens, Marion']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Artemisia Gentileschi's ""Judith en Holofernes"" (1620) is eerder onderzocht vanuit historisch, kunsthistorisch en psychologisch oogpunt. Het schilderij valt binnen de stijl van de Caravaggisten. Geweldadige, bloederige onderwerpen zoals ""Judith en Holofernes"" waren bij deze schilders zeer geliefd. Als we kijken naar de visuele strategieën die door Gentileschi en haar collega's werden toegepast, zien we een opvallende gelijkenis met filmtechnieken in hedendaagse horrorfilms. Om dit te illustreren wordt het schilderij vergeleken met een shot van een onthoofding in de film ""Sweeney Todd"" (2007). In horrorfilms worden cinematografische technieken gecombineerd met mise-en-scene om emotionele reacties bij de kijker op te roepen. Veel van deze visuele strategieën lijken ook al in de zeventiende eeuw te zijn toegepast, wat te zien is aan de kleding van de figuren in het werk en aan het gebruik van clair-obscur om spanning en dramatiek te creëren. De observatie van overeenkomsten tussen de wijze waarop horrorfilms en zeventiende-eeuwse schilders emoties proberen op te wekken bij de toeschouwer voegt een extra dimensie toe aan het onderzoek aangaande de voorkeur van zeventiende-eeuwse schilders voor 'bloederige' onderwerpen.","['Artemisia Gentileschi', 'Schilderkunst', 'Visuele strategieën', 'Horrorfilm', 'Filmtechnieken', 'Cinematografie', 'Barok', 'Caravaggisme']"
Resistance and Social Media Activism by the Standing Rock Sioux Nation Against the Dakota Access Pipeline,"Sardari Nia, Parya","['Burgos Martinez, Elena']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis attempts to explore why the Native American community, Standing Rock Sioux community, has been denied its right to partake in the decision-making process surrounding the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. This specific project resulted in various confrontations between the tribe, the extractive industry and public and private investors. One of the main reasons behind these protests was that the tribe wanted to protect Lake Oahe and the Mississippi River from any potential oil spills. As such, this thesis analyses the resistance movements and the social media activism that ensued through Facebook and internet-memes that were used to protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. This thesis argues that social media activism empowered the protestors to raise awareness about the negative impact that the pipeline’s construction would have on the environment. It additionally critically analyses the concepts of civic environmentalism, Free, Prior to Informed Consent (FPIC) and social media activism.","['Standing Rock Sioux Tribe', 'Resistance', 'Confrontations', 'Social Media Activism', 'Internet-memes']"

Fashionable Fascism :The Female Image in Greek women’s magazines during the Junta (1967-1974),"Mavrogenis, Giannis","['Storm, Eric']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The present thesis looks through popular women’s magazines published during the period of the Greek Junta (1967-1974) in order to answer the following question: ""To what extent did popular women's magazines during the Greek Junta reflect the regime's ideology on gender roles?"". The analysis is divided into three chapters regarding representations of the female body and sexuality, work and marriage, and politics respectively. The thesis also highlights the underlying tension between modernity and tradition in far-right ideologies and the way it is mirrored through women's representations in the magazines.Through the analysis, the thesis concludes that these magazines promoted a considerably more liberal view of womanhood than that expected and desired by the Junta for Greek women. It also points out that this liberal image of women was not necessarily opposed by the regime since it too promoted itself as liberal. Finally, the thesis demonstrates that this particular inconsistency between presentation and expectation reveals a gendered facet of the tension between traditionalism and modernization documented in the magazine pages of the Greek Junta.","['Women', 'Image', 'Magazines', 'Popular Culture', 'Fasicsm']"
Wantrouwen in de Media: Een Discoursanalyse van Mediascepticisme en Complotconstructies in de Context van de MH17-ramp,"Van Alphen, Kasper","['Burger, Peter']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek staat centraal hoe in 2017 op Twitter de ongeloofwaardigheid van de media, in de context van de MH17-ramp, discursief werd geconstrueerd. Daarbij is gebruik gemaakt van Luhmanns theorie over ver- en wantrouwen als middel om de complexiteit van de wereld te verminderen. De onderzoeksvraag is beantwoord middels een op Foucault geïnspireerde discoursanalyse waarbij gebruik is gemaakt van 415 tweets die uitingen van wantrouwen en mediascepticisme bevatten. Data is verzameld via Obi4Wan. Uit de 415 tweets zijn drie discursieve thema’s gedistilleerd, waarvan het dominante thema ‘mainstream media als propaganda-instrument’ nader is onderzocht. De perceptie van accounts is dat media ingezet wordt, of zichzelf inzetten, als propaganda-instrument voor de overheid. Media zouden niet geloofwaardig zijn omdat zij niet onafhankelijk zijn; zij misbruiken hun macht om de publieke opinie te sturen met misleidende informatie. Door alternatieve media te vertrouwen en gevestigde media te wantrouwen, wordt regulier nieuws door accounts afgestoten. Dit afstoten is een actieve keuze en zorgt voor complexiteitsreductie omdat andere keuzes en opties worden ontweken. De hoofdvraag laat zich niet kort en bondig beantwoorden omdat de ongeloofwaardigheid van de media in de context van de MH17-ramp op meerdere manieren discursief wordt geconstrueerd. Via discours wordt gedistantieerd van de ‘leugens’ van de media waardoor de accounts dichterbij hun eigen ervaren werkelijkheid blijven. Mogelijkheden voor vervolgonderzoek worden genoemd. ","['wantrouwen', 'complotconstructies', 'discoursanalyse', 'propaganda']"

Reconstructing the separatist narrative of the DPR: A framing analysis of the state-run online media outlet DNR-News,"Baglin, Zoé","['Frear, Matthew']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis set out to determine the way in which the state-controlled media of the separatist-held territory of Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine have framed the separatist narrative. This is done through a framing analysis of a selection of articles that were chosen and sampled according four different time-frames over the years 2017 and 2018. These periods correspond to events that led to heightened tensions in the conflict between Ukraine and DPR, namely: ‘the battle of Avdiivka’, ‘the economic blockade’, ‘the death of Zakharchenko’ and the ‘Kerch Strait incident’. Six frames were inductively reconstructed and grouped into three categories according to their relation with Ukraine, DPR and Russia. With regards to Ukraine the following frames were found: Ukraine as an aggressor’; ‘Ukraine as a disruptor’; ‘weakness and incompetence of Ukraine’. Frames related to DPR consisted in ‘legitimacy of DPR’ and ‘DPR citizens as victims’. Lastly, the frame that emerged in relation with Russia was ‘Russia as a mediator’. The findings of this study suggest state-controlled DNR-News has framed the separatist narrative with the help of two dominant approaches. One that is inclusive of Russia by representing it as an actor primarily responsible for ensuring DPR’s continuous existence and the success of its separatist ambitions. In a different approach, DPR’s independence is marked as a significant goal even though Russia has not yet recognised its independence and it does so by claiming the right to self-determination. There is thus an attempt at finding a right balance between the two and in turn, render the fight for the separatist cause more plausible.","['Separatism', 'DPR', 'Framing analysis', 'DNR-News', 'Ukraine', 'Russia']"

European Neoliberalism and its economic and political shortcomings,"Bartolini, Alessandro","['Fynn-Paul, Jeffrey']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"At the time of writing (June 2019), the European Union officially hosts another “sick man”. The European Commission has in fact recently encouraged Italy to reconsider its economic policy in the light of a forecasted unsustainable (according to the European Commission) rise in the country’s budgetary deficit. Italy has so far been relatively used to politically challenging the European Commission when it comes to its choices in the field of macroeconomic policy. Nevertheless, the ease and the degree with which Neoliberalism (here meant as a Washington Consensus-based disciplinary ideology aiming at limiting the degree of politicization of the economic realm and the choices of states when it comes to their macroeconomic policies ) remains dominant at the EU level poses a question: Is the European Union inherently neoliberal or demand-led growth models are still possible? The reasons why finding an answer to this question is in our interest is grounded in the proliferation of radical political responses in several European countries (including Italy, Greece and - to a lesser degree - France) partly coming as a consequence of their stagnating (whilst not declining) economies. On one hand the European Union’s economy in the last few years has been keeping up to its self-set standards, on the other hand some countries appear to be far from catching up with the top-performers despite having structurally adjusted their economies to the taste of the neoliberal narrative. More importantly, the implementation of neoliberal policies has mostly been done at the expense of the existing welfare states, organized labor and national economic independence. Although the aforementioned growth of populist parties has yet to translate into those states actually taking real steps towards exiting the EU, the macroeconomic powerlessness of these countries seems doomed to persist, and so does the growth of radical parties and/or ideas. In this thesis I am going to argue that the EU is not an inherently neoliberal project of economic integration but it will be argued that the European political economy under the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) entails a clear neoliberal bias which prevents the EU and its member states from pursuing alternative paths. Furthermore, it will be argued that as it is currently structured, the EMU constitutes an hinderance to growth and employment in the continent as it systematically prevents the formation of adequate levels of aggregate demand.","['Neoliberalism', 'EU', 'Political Economy']"

The participants were thirty dialect speakers who are born, raised and still residential in one of the three studied towns. Interviews were held with these participants in which they were asked about their views on and knowledge about their own dialect and that of the two other towns. From these interviews it has become clear that, although Roosendaals, Oudenbosch and Rucphens have similarities, they do differ from each other on a lexical and a phonetic level. Most importantly, the results suggest that one’s level of sociophonetic awareness of their dialect relates to what degree they are capable of speaking Standard Dutch.","['Dialectology', 'Perceptual Dialectology', 'Sociolinguistics', 'Sociophonetics', 'Sociophonetic Awareness', 'Noord-Brabant', 'Roosendaal', 'Oudenbosch', 'Rucphen']"

Enactivisme: een onderzoek naar de voorwaarden voor de integratie van de fenomenologie en cognitiewetenschappen,"Kroes, Sophie","['McAllister, James']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,nl,"Het enactivisme is een benadering binnen de cognitiewetenschappen, waarvan aanhangers cognitieve processen beschouwen als lichamelijke processen die ontstaan door de wederkerige interactie tussen het organisme en de omgeving. Enactivisten doen een poging om de cognitie- en neurowetenschappen te verreiken met ideeën uit de traditionele filosofie van de fenomenologie. In mijn onderzoek laat ik zien dat ze met deze poging in een spanningsveld terechtkomen, een spanningsveld tussen de subjectieve ervaring en objectieve meting van lichamelijke processen. Om verdieping en inzicht in het spanningsveld te bieden, onderzoek ik de verschillende epistemische waarden van beide stromingen. Zo beschouw ik dat binnen de cognitie- en neurowetenschappen het geven van causale verklaringen een belangrijke waarde is, om te kunnen interveniëren in processen. Daarnaast beschrijf ik dat binnen de fenomenologie betekenisvolle ervaring centraal staat, om terug te keren naar de dingen zelf. Ik beargumenteer dat enactivisten in staat zijn om de cognitie- en neurowetenschappen te integreren met ideeën uit de fenomenologie, op voorwaarde dat ervaring de gemeenschappelijke grond blijft waaruit onderzoek ontspringt en causale verbanden worden gezien als de stabiele eenheid van meerdere ervaringen.","['enactivisme', 'cognitiewetenschappen', 'neurowetenschappen', 'fenomenologie', 'embodiment', 'ervaring', 'betekenis', 'intersubjectiviteit', 'causale verklaringen']"

How a newspaper constructs a national identity: 'the Ugandan' vs. 'the refugee',"Weijer, Donna Clara de","['Bruijn, Mirjam de']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Several studies have shown that media play a huge role in constructing national identities. These studies are often carried out in the context of ‘othering’, since a collective dissociation of ‘the other’ in many cases strengthens the feeling of nationalism. Studies on how African media play a role in the formation of national identities are scarce, however. A regularly used example of ‘the other’ is the refugee and one of the largest refugee-hosting countries world-wide is Uganda. This thesis therefore studies how the New Vision, one of the biggest Ugandan newspapers, covers news on refugees and how the New Vision then contributes to the construction of a national identity in Uganda. Three methods were used: a participatory research in the form of an internship, a discourse analysis of text and finally a discourse analysis of pictures. The results show that the New Vision focuses on the idea that the government does everything in its power to help refugees and portrays ‘the Ugandan’ as very welcoming towards refugees.","['Uganda', 'Discourse analysis', 'othering', 'national identity', 'refugees']"

Views from the Arctic: Broadening International Relations beyond its prevailing assumptions,"Mitchell, Robyn","['Smith, Karen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Arctic is often perceived to be a vast empty space, the world’s inhospitable and politically unimportant hinterland. Increasingly at the forefront of the global climate change precipice, the attention the Arctic receives predominantly reflects a passive region that serves as a dire warning of the environmental degradation to come. In reality however, the Arctic is home to over 500,000 indigenous peoples whose heritages reflect thousands of years of subsistence living and adaption to the region’s environment. The political agency of indigenous peoples in the Arctic is integral to the innovative and collaborative space. As a result, indigenous knowledge is an important component for understanding Arctic international relations and developments. However, the narrow framework of mainstream International Relations is unequipped to sufficiently address this reality. This thesis asks: How do Arctic indigenous peoples’ knowledge and perspectives pose a challenge to prevailing International Relations assumptions? With a focus on the challenges and new perspectives that indigenous knowledge offers to the assumptions of state-centrism, agency, cooperation, territoriality, sovereignty and modernity, this thesis endeavours to include indigenous views in a more inclusive and globally representative International Relations. Is it sufficient to analyse the indigenous political role in environmental protection and sustainable development as one of a non-state influence, pressuring states to make environmentally conscious decisions in their policies? Are indigenous political and social arrangements in the Arctic merely an anomaly formation of significant authority within the regular framework of state interactions? This thesis argues that the variety of indigenous beliefs, worldviews, and knowledge provide more discerning and apt frameworks for International Relations theory to understand indigenous peoples’ involvement in Arctic politics.","['Indigenous Knowledge', 'Arctic', 'Climate Change', 'Non-Western Perspectives', 'Indigenous Peoples', 'International Relations', 'International Relations Theory', 'Environmental Protection', 'Arctic Council', 'Inuit']"

The role of the British Empire in the Attlee governments' social democratic success,"Rhatigan, Liam","['Fynn Paul, Jeff']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Orthodox accounts of the British Labour governments in power between 1945 and 1951 are mistaken in presenting the government’s management of the sterling crises as having been apolitical and pragmatic. This thesis compares the effects of Britain’s sterling area policies on Britain and the British Empire more widely, in order to evaluate the consequences of their domestic social democratic reforms and the reconstruction of the wider British economy beyond the British experience. Contra orthodox historians of the period, the Attlee governments’ economic policy was deeply political in its design, implementation and consequences, subordinating the needs of colonial peoples to those of Britain in both design and practice. The British government relied on political control over the sterling area to obtain finance from the colonies at non-market rates. Without these loans, the Attlee governments may have had to have cut domestic expenditure or make greater political concessions to the USA in return for more American aid. Policies were implemented to mobilise colonial resources whose export would have a positive effect on the balance of payments crises. Although in some colonies this export drive laid the groundwork for economic development, in colonies where development projects were poorly implemented, particularly in West Africa, the benefits were not mutual. Furthermore, the Attlee governments effectively “outsourced” austerity to the colonies, resulting in shortages of goods and capital drain. This was achieved through their political control over the terms of trade in the sterling area. The negative effects of their policies on colonial living standards were known and contested, and ran counter to the Labour Party’s espoused socialist principles. However, ideological beliefs about race and the role of Britain in the world order may have influenced government decisions to protect British people at the expense of dependent colonies, and the Empire’s undemocratic political structure permitted it. That austerity measures in the colonies bear the hallmarks of measures for economic discipline traditionally employed in the 1920s and 1930s suggests that Attlee’s brand of social democracy did not transform the nature of capitalism to the extent that it may have appeared from a British perspective.","['Social democracy', 'Attlee', 'British Empire', 'Monetary policy']"
Van probleem naar oplossing. Het effect van de overgang naar constructieve journalistiek op het publiek van Omroep West.,"Smid, Maaike Simone","['Koetsenruijter, A.W.M.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Deze masterscriptie is geschreven tijdens de master Journalistiek en Nieuwe Media aan de Universiteit Leiden in opdracht van Omroep West. De effecten van constructieve journalistiek op de waardering van de nieuwsvoorziening van Omroep West staan hierbij centraal. Door middel van kwantitatief onderzoek wordt antwoord gegeven op de onderzoeksvraag: ‘Welk effect heeft de overgang naar constructieve journalistiek op de perceptie van het publiek van Omroep West?’. Voordat de stroming van constructieve journalistiek werd opgenomen in het beleid van Omroep West is er een survey verspreid onder het publiek van de omroep. Bijna 500 respondenten hebben deze survey ingevuld die in 2017 is verspreid. Na een periode van meer dan een jaar is dezelfde survey wederom verspreid onder de respondenten (N= 116). Na het analyseren van de verkregen data van de surveys in SPSS wijst dit onderzoek uit welk effect de overgang naar constructieve journalistiek op het publiek van Omroep West heeft gehad. Constructieve journalistiek kan een mogelijke verfrissing zijn tussen de bestaande negatieve berichtgeving en een bijdrage leveren om het ‘news gap’ te verkleinen. Deze nieuwe vorm van journalistiek draait om oplossingsgerichtheid en het bieden van context. De theorie over constructieve journalistiek toont aan dat een juiste toepassing van de elementen van deze stroming een positief effect heeft op nieuwsconsumenten. Dit onderzoek toont aan dat, in tegenstelling tot de theorie, de overgang naar constructieve journalistiek geen positief effect heeft gehad op de perceptie van de berichtgeving door het publiek van Omroep West. Hier zijn een aantal mogelijke oorzaken voor. Bijvoorbeeld dat constructieve journalistiek in te kleine mate is toegepast op de berichtgeving om waarneembaar en/of doorslaggevend te zijn bij de waardering van de stellingen door het publiek. Daarnaast kan het ook onvolledig zijn toegepast of merken de respondenten de veranderingen die teweeg zijn gebracht door constructieve journalistiek niet genoeg op. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek kan wenselijk zijn om verdere verduidelijking te krijgen over de invloed van deze mogelijke oorzaken.","['constructieve journalistiek', 'regionale journalistiek', 'lokale journalistiek']"

Bung Tomo: War criminal or Hero,"Pagee, Marjolein van","['Mark, Ethan']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the role of the Indonesian propagandist Sutomo (or Bung Tomo) during the Indonesian revolution in Surabaya, 1945, questioning the Dutch and Indonesian different perspectives and memory. Nowadays in Indonesia Sutomo is remembered as a hero, yet in the Dutch historiography he is often portrayed as a war criminal, responsible for inciting the masses to kill Dutch, Eurasians and other minorities. One Dutch testimony in particular holds him accountable for the brutal massacre in the Simpang Club. This case-study analyses the different views on Indonesian anti-colonial violence during the so-called ""Bersiap-period"" and how Bung Tomo became the personification of these brutalities for the Dutch memory in particular. How does the latter relate to the Indonesian positive memory of him? As such, the topic of this thesis also relates to the growing academic attention to the Bersiap, in which terminology (should we call it a genocide) and the possible trigger (why did it happen) are the main topics of discussion. The first section provides a brief historical outline from the pre-war colonial situation to the Japanese occupation and finally the capitulation on August 15th, 1945. To give a clear understanding of the variety of social and political factors that led to the violent outburst of the Bersiap. The second section traces the basic history of Sutomo and his place in Surabaya and the first two months of the revolution in September and October 1945. This includes an analysis of the horrible events inside the Simpang Club. The third section pays attention to the period after he established his organization BPRI, when he became internationally known as radio-maker, actively countering Dutch propaganda. This section aims to explore the possibility of a Dutch slander campaign against him and the subsequent impact of that on the later historiography and memory. The conclusion returns to the main question on how to make sense of the conflicting memories of Bung Tomo. The conclusion also touches upon the larger question regarding the responsibility for the Bersiap and whether the term genocide is appropriate in this case.","['Indonesian Independence War', 'Bersiap', 'Sutomo', 'Bung Tomo', 'Historiography', 'Anti-colonial Violence', 'National Memory', 'Propaganda', 'Dutch Colonialism', 'Simpang Club']"

"De popster is dood, lang leve de popster! Een retorische analyse van sagen over de (in scene gezette) dood van popsterren in nieuwsmedia en op het vernaculaire web","Boshuijer, N.J.","['Koetsenruijter, J.P.', 'Koetsenruijter, A.W.M.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Deze masterthesis onderzoekt de manier waarop sagen over het vermeend in leven zijn van doodverklaarde popsterren retorisch worden geconstrueerd in traditionele nieuwsmedia en op het vernaculaire web. Allereerst wordt een wetenschappelijk fundament gegeven voor het ontstaan van dit soort sagen. Met daarbij de conclusie dat populaire muziekcultuur in onze hedendaagse consumptiemaatschappij een prominente, haast religieuze rol heeft. Fans creëren een cultic milieu rondom een artiest, waardoor zij niet kunnen geloven dat een artiest sterfelijk is. Ter afbakening bestaat dit onderzoek uit case studies: sagen over de dood van Elvis Presley, Tupac en Kurt Cobain. Onderzocht wordt de manier waarop journalisten en forumdeelnemers op Nederlandstalige websites dit soort sagen wel of niet geloven. Daarbij zijn 44 nieuwsartikelen en 28 forumdiscussies onderwerp van onderzoek. Eerder onderzoek van Donovan (2004) en Burger (2014) gaven vier stijlen van (on)geloof: fervent geloof, instrumenteel geloof, debunking en ervaringsgeloof. Uit deze scriptie blijkt dat op het vernaculaire web al deze vormen van geloof ook naar voren komen. In het journalistieke discours komen fervent geloof en instrumenteel geloof niet voor. Wel blijkt dat journalisten middels distancing het oordeel van de (on)waarheid van een sage bij de lezer leggen. Zij geloven intrinsiek niet in een sage, maar vinden hem wel vermakelijk. Hiermee kan een vijfde geloofsvorm worden toegevoegd aan het model van Donovan en Burger: ludiek geloof. Hiernaast worden de argumenten van forumdeelnemers en journalisten onder de loep genomen. Aangetoond wordt dat de argumenten die op het vernaculaire web naar voren komen veel rijker en diverser zijn dan in nieuwsmedia. Het is aannemelijk dat journalisten vanwege hun journalistieke autoriteit het niet nodig achten om veel en diverse argumenten te gebruiken. Terwijl forumdeelnemers in een veel vrijer vernaculair discours de ruimte hebben om vrijer te spreken. Daarbij worden ook ethostechnieken onderzocht. En hieruit blijkt dat journalisten zeer gering ethos-technieken toepassen om de (on)waarheid van een sage aan te tonen. Ze variëren vooral de afstand tot de bron van een verhaal, om duidelijk te maken dat zij zelf niet achter het ontstaan van een sage zitten. Op fora worden er veel en verschillende ethos-technieken gebruikt. Gebruikers maken elkaar veelvuldig zwart of beroepen zich bijvoorbeeld op autoriteiten.","['vernaculaire web', 'nieuwsmedia', 'sagen', 'cultic milieu', 'ethos', 'logos', 'populair muziekcultuur', 'retorica']"

Future Literature: Reading Skills in the Age of Digital Media,"Oskam, Suzanne","['Alphen, Ernst van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"A theoretical debate between three thinkers on the future of literature in the age of new media shows there is dissent regarding whether literature’s narrative and new media’s database forms can productively coexist or that the latter will supplant the former. To make sense of these different views, this thesis will consider the question of how reading skills change on the basis of interrelations between literature and new media. The case-study, David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest, seems to have a proto-database form while being essentially narrative. It may, therefore, be considered a hybrid between old and new media as well as a reflection of media-literature evolution itself. The novel builds a signification structure into the text that directs the reading direction nonlinearly, allowing for a plurality of voices and ways of looking at the world. Interpreted nonlinearly, Infinite Jest offers an allegory not for reading but precisely for the impossibility thereof. It self-consciously reflects on postmodernism and, specifically, its central thematic of illegibility: it is a novel self-aware of its own impossibility. Infinite Jest diagnoses the illegibility of texts in the age of postmodernism, where one can no longer rely on clear-cut strategies for reading but must employ a creativity in learning how to read as a production rather than a discovery of meaning. Novels like Infinite Jest, it appears, serve as mental practice for new media reading, which requires the reader to switch between reading strategies, or what I coin the modulation proposal, to deal with the phenomenon of ‘information overload.’ Infinite Jest shows that hybridization of narrative and database, or of literature and new media, is a viable – and, hopefully, long-term – possibility for the literature of the future. Literature is right now in the process of adapting itself by borrowing elements from new, digital media, and, re-inventing itself as a form of art that transcends the medium of the book, i.e., literature becomes transmedial. To stay relevant in the age of digital media, literature needs to reinvent itself time and again.","['Reading skills', 'New media', 'Database and Narrative', 'Nonlinearity', 'David Foster Wallace', 'The future of literature', 'Spatial form']"

Regionale nieuwsmedia: het verbindende element in de regio,"Peij, Romy van","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Door de komst van het internet dat vol staat met gratis nieuws en forse bezuinigingen op nieuwsredacties staat de regionale journalistiek onder druk. Daarmee staat ook een belangrijke functie van de regionale journalistiek onder druk, namelijk het bevorderen van de sociale cohesie. Maar ondanks dat het steunen van de regionale journalistiek door middel van journalistieke fondsen veelal wordt gelegitimeerd met een beroep op die sociale cohesie is het vooralsnog onduidelijk hoe dit abstractie concept vorm krijgt in nieuwsartikelen. Vanwege de onduidelijkheid die hierover bestaat, wordt in dit onderzoek antwoord gegeven op de vraag: ‘Hoe wordt sociale cohesie gerepresenteerd in de berichtgeving van Limburgse nieuwsmedia?’ De regionale nieuwswebsite 1Limburg en de regionale krant De Limburger vormen de casestudy in dit onderzoek, aangezien Limburgers zich sterk verbonden lijken te voelen met de provincie waarin ze wonen. Om de onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden is een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse uitgevoerd aan de hand van het model van de negen dimensies van sociale cohesie, ontwikkeld door Leupold, Klinger & Jarren (2016). Deze onderzoekers hebben het abstracte concept vertaald naar negen concrete categorieën van sociale cohesie, die het vertrekpunt vormen voor de analyse. Er zijn ongeveer 150 nieuwsartikelen van 1Limburg en De Limburger gecodeerd om na te gaan aan de hand van welke nieuwsonderwerpen sociale cohesie wordt gerepresenteerd. Dit houdt in dat bij elke dimensie van sociale cohesie is nagegaan op welke manier deze precies tot uiting komt in nieuwsartikelen. Om te onderzoeken of het model van de negen dimensies van sociale cohesie ook kwantitatief te operationaliseren is, is er vervolgens nog een beperkte kwantitatieve analyse uitgevoerd. Zo hebben twee getrainde codeurs een kwantitatieve analyse uitgevoerd op een corpus van 30 nieuwsartikelen en gecodeerd welke dimensie voorkomt per artikel. Vervolgens is aan de hand van Krippendorff’s Alpha berekend in welke mate de antwoorden overeenstemmen. Uit de kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse blijkt dat een aantal dimensies, zoals de dimensies sociale netwerken, identificatie en respect voor sociale regels, vooral tot uiting komen aan de hand van zachte nieuwsonderwerpen. Dit zijn bijvoorbeeld artikelen over criminaliteit of over het belang van gezelschapsverenigingen, Limburgse tradities en regionale gebruiken. Opvallend daarbij is dat Limburgse media zich als het gaat om de invulling van zachte nieuwsonderwerpen erg onderscheiden door te verwijzen naar zaken die deel uitmaken van de Limburgse identiteit, zoals drugscriminaliteit, schutterijen, de mijngeschiedenis en het dialect. In de berichtgeving van De Limburger en 1Limburg komen zachte nieuwsonderwerpen dus tot uiting aan de hand van verwijzingen naar regionale waarden, die typerend zijn voor Limburg. 5 Als het daarentegen gaat om de representatie van harde nieuwsonderwerpen is het tegenovergestelde waarneembaar. Zo komen de dimensies vertrouwen in openbare instellingen en burgerlijke participatie met name tot uiting in harde nieuwsonderwerpen, zoals verkiezingsopkomst en het functioneren van politieke en openbare instellingen. Uit de geanalyseerde nieuwsartikelen komt naar voren dat Limburgse media – als het gaat om de invulling van harde nieuwsonderwerpen – niet onderscheidend zijn. Als regionale krant en nieuwswebsite brengen zij enkel nieuws over het functioneren van openbare instellingen, zoals de brandweer die een brandje heeft geblust, en de verkiezingsopkomst in een bepaalde gemeente en zijn er geen specifieke Limburgse onderwerpen waarneembaar. De manier waarop harde nieuwsonderwerpen tot uiting komen in artikelen van De Limburger en 1Limburg zijn dus niet typerend voor Limburg. Uit de beperkte kwantitatieve analyse blijkt tot slot dat het model van de negen dimensies van sociale cohesie van Leupold et al. (2016), dat in deze scriptie is gehanteerd, ook kwantitatief te operationaliseren is. Aan de hand van Krippendorff’s Alpha is namelijk berekend dat er een hoge mate van overeenstemming bestaat tussen de antwoorden die beide codeurs hebben gegeven. Slechts in een aantal gevallen gaven beide codeurs een verschillend antwoord en was het niet precies duidelijk welke dimensie in een bepaald artikel werd gerepresenteerd. Een aantal dimensies zouden daarom wat aanscherping behoeven.",

Science and Critique in Nietzsche and Max Weber,"Kastritis, Dimitris","['Siemens, Herman']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis I argue that Nietzsche and Weber have common points, or to put it precisely, that in Max Weber’s thought Nietzsche’s presence can be detected. Specifically, and in light of the passage from Science as a Vocation, my focus will be on the critique of science they both articulated. My thesis is that Weber’s attitude towards science bears similarities to Nietzsche’s despite the grave differences separating their thought. I will argue that both rejected the idea of scientific objectivity as well as the belief in science’s capacity to generate ultimate values. The reasons for this rejection lie in fact that in their accounts science stands as the main force which carried forward the Death of God and the process of disenchantment (Entzauberung) in modernity. However, for both science still retains its instrumental importance and hence neither Nietzsche nor Weber relapse into positions that disregard science as such. In effect, I argue, Nietzsche and Weber affirm science although they do not ascribe to it anything more than its instrumental value. However, the heterogeneity of their critiques as regards to science and philosophy in general arises from Nietzsche’s commitment to a contestation of values aiming at the enhancement and affirmation of life itself, whereas Weber insists on the character of vocation (Beruf).","['Nietzsche', 'Weber', 'Philosophy']"

Controverse rond het oeuvre van Rembrandt is niets nieuws; er heerst altijd spanning op het raakvlak tussen de commercie en de wetenschap. Het is dus opvallend dat juist Van de Wetering zijn naam verbonden heeft aan wat feitelijk een commerciële onderneming is. Dat kunsthistorici dit doen en dat dit grote problemen met zich meebrengt is bekend. Wie hier al bijna een eeuw geleden over publiceerde was John C. Van Dyke (1856-1932) in Rembrandt and his School (1923).

A study of American Nationalism in the late 1970s through Jimmy Carter’s election,"Ock, Sangcheol","['Schmidli, William Michael']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The present thesis is an attempt to investigate the role of American nationalism in American history by focusing on the 1976 election of Jimmy Carter. I will make two main claims in the present thesis. First of all, that American nationalism helped to motivate Southern Baptists to support Jimmy Carter, despite suspicions regarding Carter’s religiosity. To be specific, the Baptists voted for Carter because of their desire to defend the United States of America as a Christian nation and not simply due to Carter’s public confession of faith as a ‘born-again’ Christian. Second, nationalist words and stories can be found in Carter’s rhetoric. His inclusion of this nationalistic content was intended to maintain support for Jimmy Carter among American evangelicals. Meanwhile, publications of the Southern Baptists such as the Southern Baptist News Press disseminated nationalistic expressions and connected them to support for Jimmy Carter. In other words, this thesis will provide an alternative answer by arguing that the election of Jimmy Carter was possible thanks to American nationalism, which was permeated with religion.","['American nationalism', 'Nationalism', 'Jimmy Carter', 'U.S. history', 'U.S. politics', 'Election Campaign', 'Presidential Election', 'Southern Baptists']"

It asks specifically how men and women were represented or omitted within this imagining and why. It is argued that in the context of colonial labour, Orde Browne imagined the ideal colonial labourer as male and hereby excluded women from the realm of wage labour opportunities, instead discursively assigning them to the sphere of domesticity and recommending policies that limited female wage labour opportunities and reified a colonial idealization of wife-hood and motherhood. This exclusion was based on assumptions of women as especially traditional and conservative, a sexualization and associated demoralization of the independent presence of women in the compounds, and women being deemed inferior labourers. Men, on the other hand, were represented as objects of exploitation, whose bodies and minds were to be controlled through colonial policies with the aim of making labour migration as efficient and profitable as possible. Women within this structure were visualized as dependents who could either hinder said effective exploitation through the spread of disease and immorality, or could enable even more efficient and stable exploitation and ensure the reproduction of a future generation of workers.","['colonial labour', 'gender', 'British Empire', 'Africa', 'imperial networks', 'race', 'discourse analysis']"
Game of Swarms - An artistic practice about networks,"Nishijima, Paula Kaori","['Zwijnenberg, R.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"The present environmental crisis has put the public war between current right-wing authoritarian governs and whoever in the world is concerned about the environment in the international spotlight. Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, on June 1, 2017 and the recent refusal of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro to stop the exploitation of Amazon illustrate the emergence of a situation in which the notions of territory and nation-state no longer sustain the reality of our shared planet. The more climate change, global warming and the environmental degradation haunt the Earth’s inhabitants, the more it seems that we break apart the world as if boundaries of exclusion could prevent what is inside from perishing. In this thesis, I argue that, in the core of this issue, dwell precisely our ‘notions’ and ‘concepts’—enclosed in the huge monolith of Western modern thinking. To confront the planetary crisis, one needs a new strategy to access these problems—that would not consist in simply applying a dialectical method of discussion, but instead deploying a multidimensional approach, capable of penetrating that Western bloc from all sides. By taking on the notion of networks—whether informatic, political and biological—I critically analyse this concept and introduce the framework of the ‘swarm’ that I used in my own artistic practice as a way to allow a multiplicity of viewpoints. The art project Game of Swarms, which explores mainly the fact that the individuals of swarms work together without a locus of control, provokes the audience to rethink our current political structures and use the narrative of the game to imagine new forms of making politics and a new way to think our relation to the world. The biological self-organised model of swarms comes as a tool to create new narratives to face today’s planetary crisis and foster a more sustainable way of thinking.","['network', 'contemporary art', 'swarm', 'self-organization', 'self-regulation', 'climate change', 'environmental crisis', 'modern thinking', 'participatory art']"
Charlotte Brontё’s linguistic involvement in her personal correspondence,"Krokhina, Ekaterina","['Tieken-Boon van Ostade, Ingrid']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The principal idea of this thesis is to study a particular aspect of language practice, namely involvement. Charlotte Brontё’s private language use in her letters by focusing on linguistic involvement is analysed in the present work. In order to examine the degree of Charlotte Brontё’s involvement exhibited in her personal letters, the following topics have been addressed: the language of correspondence of Charlotte Brontё with regard to the actual usage of the English language of the Late Modern English period based on the information of the language during that time provided in the Cambridge History of the English Language, Volume IV: 1776–1997 (ed. Romaine 1999), the nature of the relationships of Charlotte Brontё with her private interlocutors and the notion of involvement with respect to letter-writing activity. The main hypothesis of this thesis is strongly based on Sairio (2005: 24–25) and suggests that the level of linguistic involvement, as examined by her, differs between different addressees and can be revealed by analyzing the use of evidential adverbs, degree adverbs and first- and second-person singular pronouns.",['Charlotte Brontё']

Marlowe and the Foundation of Power,"Gardien, Max","['Dijkhuizen, Jan Frans van']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Machiavelli’s theory as described in The Prince has been a great influence on the theories of acquiring political power. Because Machiavelli’s name is connected with deceit and immorality, especially in early modern England, many Elizabethan playwrights engaged with his doctrine to excite their audiences. This thesis argues that Marlowe engages with Machiavelli in two distinct manners. On the one hand there is the simplified, misinterpreted Machiavellian. These characters may appear to follow Machiavelli’s doctrine. However, because their actions go against Machiavelli’s doctrine, they are not able to achieve their goals. On the other hand there are the true Machiavellian characters, who are able to show the power of the individual by following Machiavellian doctrine. These characters can overcome their troubles and achieve actual political power. An analysis of The Jew of Malta and Tamburlaine the Great makes this distinction clear. Although Barabas is introduced as a Machiavellian by Machevill himself, his actions continuously go against his doctrine. The secondary, Christian character Ferneze does use his tactical planning skills to turn unpredictable situations to his advantage. Tamburlaine uses these same Machiavellian tactics on an epic skill. Although Tamburlaine’s cruelty is extreme, Machiavelli would approve as they are essential to his reputation and conquest. In Doctor Faustus, although often overlooked in this discussion, Marlowe depicts the importance of focus and knowledge in the acquirement of political power. Lucifer and Mephistopheles use Machiavelli’s doctrine to victory. In Doctor Faustus, Machiavellianism truly is the devil’s doctrine.","['Marlowe', 'Machiavelli', 'Faustus', 'Tamburlaine', 'Jew', 'Malta']"
Who is the Other: Competing Discourses on Ukraine in the Dutch Foreing Policy Debate,"Fekkes, Eline","['David, Maxine']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Language has the capacity to make politics, create narratives and impact policy making (Hajer, 2006). In the study of foreign policy, discourses define the issues at stake, create a sense of shared ‘common knowledge’ and legitimize foreign policies as necessary and plausible (Hansen, 2013, 2016). When the Ukrainian crisis breaks out in 2014, Europe is confronted with one of the most complex situations for decades. The sense of urgency increases for one member state in particular when flight MH17 is shot down above Ukraine. Losing almost 200 citizens in the crash, the Netherlands suddenly becomes a central actor in this conflict. The literature, however, pays little attention to the domestic political debates regarding Ukraine. Moreover, the role of parliaments and oppositional political parties in foreign policy is under-accounted for. Therefore, this thesis analyses whether and how discourses are reflected in the Dutch foreign policy debate since the Ukrainian crisis and what role the parliament and political parties play in Dutch foreign policy. A discourse analysis is conducted to see what discourses are reflected in the parliamentary debates. This studies shows that identity-policy constructions – articulated through discourses – are crucial for defining and legitimizing Dutch foreign policies. Furthermore, it finds that the Government’s official foreign policy discourse is influenced and constrained by oppositional discourses that stress the normative and geopolitical aspects of Dutch foreign policy. Hence, this study provides new insight into the role of discourse in the wider political debate in the Netherlands. Though this thesis establishes that the parliament and political parties matter in this specific case, more research is needed on the role of parliaments and political parties to make generalizable conclusions for foreign policy more broadly.","['Discourses', 'Dutch Foreign Policy', 'Ukraine', 'Ukrainian crisis']"

Reassessing Rogerius’s Hinduism,"Leathley, Ben","['Gommans, Jos']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The Open Deure, published in 1651 in Leiden, is well-known for its detailed account of the society and religious practices of the Brahmins in Pulicat, near modern Chennai. An important element has however been ignored by scholarship: the extensive annotations written by an unknown antiquarian scholar, identified only as A.W. in the preface to the main text. In the annotations A.W. contextualises and ‘translates’ Rogerius’s account into something relevant for a European scholarly audience; this gave the contemporary reader a framework with which to judge Rogerius's descriptions, lacking from the latter's dry and factual observations. The annotations argue for a monistic Neoplatonic understanding of the Brahmins' religious practices which A.W. readily states to bear the same basic truths that can be found in Christianity. On the other hand, his comparative model elevates the Brahmins' religion to a modern understanding of the term. A.W.’s footnotes showcase the larger discourses in Europe and the seventeenth century’s transformation of the concept of ‘religion’ - as well as the birth of comparative religion which accompanied it. The annotations of the Open Deure thus turn out to be integral to the contemporary understanding of Rogerius’s text and should be considered next to the main narrative.","['early modern history', 'global intellectual history', 'history of religion', 'hinduism', 'comparative religion', 'footnotes', 'monism', 'perennial philosophy', 'philology', 'travel literature']"
Fam dan Biz. The empowerment of women entrepreneurs in Mauritius,"Geboers, Lotte","['Dekker, Marleen']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research examines how entrepreneurship can influence Mauritian women entrepreneurs’ sense of empowerment. It seeks to shed light on the empowerment of women entrepreneurs in a fast-developing, ethnically diverse country. A critical approach was adopted, in which an analysis was made on the different areas in life (dimensions) in which women feel (more) empowered by their business or not. Furthermore, it recognized women as a heterogeneous group and researches how personal and entrepreneurial background influence sense of empowerment. During a fieldwork period of six months in Mauritius, data was collected. A mixed-methods approach was adopted and two datasets were created in order to both demonstrate (quantitative data) and explain (qualitative data) differences in empowerment. A main conclusion that can be drawn is that women generally do feel empowered by their business. However, entrepreneurship affects women’s areas of life in different ways, which can partly be explained by the woman’s background. Also, it was found that a sense of community and collective groups of women entrepreneur contributed enormously to women’s sense of empowerment in multiple ways. This research thus contributes to discussions about women’s empowerment through entrepreneurship by emphasizing that empowerment is an inherent individual process and that women have different backgrounds and entrepreneurial experiences, which in turn influences the way they feel empowered by their own business.","['Mauritius', 'women entrepreneurs', 'female entrepreneurship', 'women empowerment']"

Interestingly, they do this more when the vowel /e/ occurs in the first syllable of a word. That is why we investigated in the current study if coarticulation with neighboring sounds plays a role in the diphthongization of the French vowel /e/ in Dutch learners of French. Furthermore, we didn't only focus on production, but we also investigated whether Dutch learners of French can perceive the difference between the French monophthong /e/ and the Dutch diphthong [ei] and whether neighboring sounds influence this perception in an AXB task. Finally, we examined whether the perception of the participants was correlated with their production. We found that the neighboring sounds indeed seem to influence both the production and the perception of the diphthongization of the French vowel /e/; when the /e/ was followed by the dental sound /t/, it was significantly more diphthongized than when it was followed by the labial sound /p/. Interestingly, although the /t/ gives rise to more diphthongization in production, the participants perceived the least diphthongs in a /t/ context in the perception task, which could be explained as a compensation effect for coarticulation. It was less clear whether the participants were able to distinguish between the monophthong /e/ and the diphthong [ei] in the perception task. Finally, we didn't find a correlation between the production and perception of the diphthongization of the French vowel /e/ in Dutch learners of French.","['Coarticulation', 'Diphthongization', 'Second language acquisition', 'L2 perception', 'L2 production']"

Feminism and Japanese Media: A Case Study of Shoujo and Josei Manga,"Céline, Régibeau","['Nan, Choi']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Even though the Weinstein scandal and the #metoo movement opened the debate about feminism across societies, it seemed that the debate did not happen in Japan. After doing some research, one can see that mass media in Japan do not echo any feminist ideas. Throughout the years, the mass media have neglected feminist debates and even generated negative discourse on feminism. However, if one looks into more alternative media sources, it becomes obvious that the feminist debate is actually well established in Japan. There are media sources such as feminist journals that open discussions on topics like gender roles and sexual liberation. Feminist publications have existed in Japan since the beginning of the 20th century. However, as those journals challenge Japanese societal norms, they are categorized as niche media with quite a small readership. On the other hand, manga is another type of alternative media with a large readership that highlights a feminist debate. Within manga literature, there are specific genres that target a female readership from teenagers (shoujo) to adults (josei). I argue that among manga, shoujo and josei manga genres are the most read outlets of feminist ideas within Japanese media.","['Japan', 'Feminism', 'Media', 'Manga', 'Gender', 'Sexual liberation']"

These studies indicate a link between austerity measures and gender effects. In line with these contributions, this research will present a study on Spain as an exemplary case for the interrelatedness of gender and austerity measures in the period 2008-2014. By analysing whether gender perspectives were taken into account in austerity measures on both the labour market and welfare policies, it is shown that gender perspective were rarely included. Additionally, the second part of the analysis focusses on the actual status of gender to see the effect of this lack of a gender perspective in the austerity measures. This gives a dual answer, whereby gender differences are not visible for all used labour market indicators. In general, this research shows the complexity of the austerity measures situation from a feminist GPE perspective, which results in an advise of incorporating gender perspectives on a regular basis as policy-makers, in order to be able to take gender and gender effects better into account in future economic policy-making.","['Gender', 'Austerity', 'Austerity Measures', 'Spain']"

Despite the many changes and interpretations romance fiction has seen, the idea persists that romantic comedies promote fantasies rather than reflect real life. However, a genre must draw from related cultural phenomena in order to persist. As our romantic values and our experiences change, so do the ways these stories are told. Romantic comedy engages with our discourse on romance and relationships and though they may be packaged differently today, they are essentially what they have always been: stories about relationships, about intimacy, about the human experience of connecting, intimately, with another. Modern works such as Sex Education, Wanderlust and Grace and Frankie demonstrate how the genre of romantic comedy has redefined itself. These television shows reveal an awareness of the genre’s conventions, the scepticism, the struggle and yet the wish persists to believe in the happily-ever after.","['Romantic Comedy', 'Romance', 'Romantic conventions', 'Leger Grindon', 'Sex Education', 'Wanderlust', 'Grace and Frankie', 'Modern Love', 'Modern Romance', 'Television']"

Many scholars have wondered why, but without looking at the formative years of the Dutch Passion tradition: the interwar period between 1919 and 1939, when, as a result of economic distress, fear for moral breakdown and social fragmentation, the Dutch rediscovered an inward sense of nationality. First of all, this thesis shows that the tradition of yearly Passion performances, established by the conductor Willem Mengelberg, became a ritual through which citizens could profess this nationality. Subsequently, it analyses how a diverse group of intellectuals imbued Bach’s masterpiece with sublime properties. Finally, it turns its attention to peripheral regions, where locals took the initiative to organize their own Passion performances, enabling large swathes of the population to share and participate in a national musical culture. This thesis thus moves beyond musical, textual and dramaturgical aspects and integrates Dutch interwar Passion performance within its historical, social and cultural context. It regards Passion performances as civic rituals fostering emotional identification among both the active and passive participants. This approach aims to do justice to the ideological, religious and socio-economical heterogeneity of Dutch interwar society, as reflected in the vast array of primary sources under scrutiny. By investigating the origins of the Dutch passion for the Passion, this thesis seeks to elucidate the relations between music and national identity.","['Bach', 'St Matthew Passion', 'National identity', 'Interbellum', 'Reception history', 'Civic ritual', 'Music', 'Mengelberg', 'National culture', 'Netherlands']"

Gouverneurs zijn de gezichten van de regio’s, een van de redenen dat zij op sociale media soms gevolgd worden door wel honderdduizenden mediagebruikers.

(Marlou)']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis delves into the relation between crisis and policy change in a historical context by exploring the Dutch emigration policies concerning South Africa before and after the Sharpeville massacre (1960). Most literature discussing the Sharpeville massacre and its aftermath take the decline in emigration in the years following the massacre as an evident consequence of the changing perceptions of South Africa, and place it in a holistic hypothesis of general denunciation. By analysing this from a policy perspective, the decline in emigration is better explained by a multitude of factors, then by a single event (i.e. Sharpeville) alone. It is undeniable that Sharpeville had an impact on how South Africa was being perceived in the Netherlands. And evidently, this must have discouraged people to emigrate there. However, this thesis argues that the structures, policies and practices of the Dutch emigration system have been overlooked in this context. The emigration apparatus played such an important role on Dutch emigration as a whole, that it had a crucial impact on the emigration to South Africa. Despite the obsevation that there was not a clear policy change after Sharpeville, their power as an institution to orchestrate the Dutch emigration proved to be an important factor when trying to explain the decline of Dutch emigration to South Africa.","['Governance', 'Migration', 'History', 'South-Africa', 'Policy change']"

This thesis fills an important research gap, because no previous research has been done on Russia’s national identity within the OSCE. A comprehensive understanding of a state’s national identity in its foreign policy is relevant, as it provides insights into the ideological factors that drive how a state defines and pursues its national interests and subsequently foreign policy. A poststructuralist discourse analysis is conducted of the Russian statements delivered at the yearly OSCE Ministerial Council Meetings in the period 2008-2018. The discourse analysis provided insights into how Russia perceives and would like to promote itself within the OSCE. It demonstrated that Russia presents itself within the OSCE as a redeemer of OSCE unilateral actions and an advocate of multilateralism, as a leading, responsible and moral actor that wants to be perceived and treated as a great power, and lastly as a guardian of traditional values and the Russian Orthodox Church.","['Russia', 'national identity', 'foreign policy', 'Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)', 'national identity-foreign policy nexus', 'post-structualism', 'discourse analysis']"

How does one represent the unrepresentable? This tricky territory of trauma and representation will be explored by this thesis within the context of the medium of photography by focussing on aftermath landscape photography. This thesis intends to answer the question: How does the landscape within aftermath photography position itself in relation to the historical traumatic atrocities it aspires to capture? A comparative theoretical analysis of two aftermath landscape photographs by Chloe Dewe Mathews, from the aftermath photography project Shot at Dawn (2014), guide the chapters which address the concept of place, the presence of absence and the concept of time. Three interrelated overarching understandings of the landscape’s position, in relation to the trauma the aftermath photographs aspire to capture, have emerged through the analysis. These can be summarized as landscape as a keepsake box, landscape as contradiction, and landscape as perception.","['Aftermath Photography', 'Landscape Photography', 'Traumatic Memory', 'Trauma Representation']"

According to the famous physicist Niels Bohr, (our knowledge of) the quantum object cannot be meaningfully separated from the instruments used to interrogate and represent the quantum object. The instrument intervenes into the quantum universe in a way that allows for comprehensible knowledge of the quantum object. In turn, Bohr presents a conception of scientific objectivity that acknowledges and incorporates this meaningful intervention. In my thesis, I present a detailed analysis of Bohr’s interpretation of quantum mechanics, connecting his insights to the issue of subjectivity in history and historiography. I present an interpretative framework, inspired by quantum-philosophical perspectives, which integrates the subjective processes of observing, constructing and writing history into a new conception of historical realism. Like Bohr’s quantum philosophy, this historical realism considers the instruments for observation and representation as inseparable from yet meaningfully constitutive of the historical object.",

Fiction and Lying: The Case of Fargo's Title Card,"Esrail, Ali","['Pilgram, Roosmaryn']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study explores the nature of lying and its relationship to fiction. The purpose of this study is to challenge Meibauer’s (2015:158-182) claim that fiction cannot lie because authors do not present their fiction as true. In doing so, this study will provide a compare-and-contrast analysis of the opening title cards of Joel and Ethan Coen’s film Fargo (1996) and Spike Lee’s film BlacKkKlansman (2018). Whereas the opening title card of the latter film appears to justly claim that it is based on a true story, the former appears to falsely assert this. This suggests that fiction may possess the capacity of lying. To determine this, the first chapter of this study establishes a pragmatic definition of lying, which, in essence, entails a speaker (S) asserting a proposition (p) which he/she does not believe in. Since this study focuses on fiction, the second chapter endeavors to establish a definition of fictional communication, which, in essence, entails an author (U) performing assertive illocutionary acts through fictive utterances and an audience (H) who ought to make believe the propositions (P) put forward in these utterances. The analysis and results of this study, which applies the theory provided in the first two chapters to the title cards of Fargo (1996) and BlacKkKlansman (2018), indicate that a speaker may well lie by means of a work of fiction.","['lying', 'assertions', 'fictional communication', 'illocutionary acts', 'Fargo', 'implicatures', 'make-believe']"

The main objective of this thesis is to identify and illustrate the effects of China’s financial support and investments in Kenya’s economy. China’s rhetoric of mutually beneficial cooperation reflects, at least theoretically, its benevolence and underlying focus on development. China’s underlying economic and diplomatic motivations will be discussed, followed by expounding on the presence of Chinese businesses in Kenya, the Chinese One Belt, One Road initiative, and Kenya’s Vision 2030. The Kenyan government should be careful to keep the economic growth in its own hands by not relying too much on Chinese credit loans and investments, but focus at generating its own capital.","['Kenya', 'China', 'Wallerstein', 'Alden', 'Nurkse', 'Development', 'Credit Loans', 'Vision 2030', 'One Belt One Road', 'Infrastructure']"

Acceptability Judgments: Categorical vs. Gradient Approaches,"Tapia, Ruth","['Botma, Bert']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to elucidate which approach is the most advantageous in the analysis of acceptability judgments of native speakers: whether it is a categorical or a gradient approach. Acceptability judgments have often been recognized as a relevant source of language knowledge (Chomsky, 1965; Sorace & Keller, 2005; Schütze & Schütze, 2011). Judgment elicitation procedures consist of asking speakers directly about their opinion on linguistic elements, such as sounds, words and sentences. However, interrogating participants directly about their language knowledge is not as simple as it seems. Several confounding factors, such as the order of presentation of the stimuli, and the repetition of instructions (Sprouse, 2007; Schütze, 2016) can interfere with such judgments, casting doubt on the reliability of the data. This thesis discusses some theories and methods involved in judgment elicitation procedures, in order to be able to examine whether categorical or gradient procedures are more successful in tapping into speakers’ knowledge while circumventing potentially confounding factors. Additionally, two empirical studies are discussed in detail, as examples of categorical and gradient approaches in the analysis of speakers’ innate language knowledge; one on syntax (Sprouse, 2007) and one on phonology (Turton, 2017).","['acceptability judgments', 'language intuitions', 'first language', 'gradient and categorical approaches']"

Deinstitutionalization of OVC In Ghana’s Central Region Factors That Impact Alternative Care In Bawjiase And Surroundings,"Beugre, Anita Princia W.","['Akinyoade, Akinyinka']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the 2006 Care Reform Initiative (CRI), Ghana’s Department of Social Welfare (DSW) called for the deinstitutionalization of Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) and sought to move vulnerable children towards a range of integrated family and community-based care services. The initiative is currently on its third five-year road map for 2017 to 2021 with specific targets and yet still children are in orphanages. Over a decade after the official launch of the initiative a myriad of challenges persist, especially the uncertainty over whether families are prepared to welcome OVC into their homes. Set in Central Region Ghana, using Country-Side Children’s Welfare Home (CCWH) as the main case study, this thesis investigates the underlying factors that are preventing families in the Bawjiase and surroundings from opening their homes and hearts to vulnerable children. Qualitative data was obtained through forty interviews; people interviewed included community leaders, men and women with an active profession in education, banking and informal trading sectors. The views of teenagers from two RHC were also examined through focus group discussion. The study shows that although financial means are often cited as a deterrent for adoption and fostering, the sluggishness in emptying orphanages in Ghana is often due to the lack of training of would-be foster parents and the complicated system of legal adoption. On top of that, the idea of being moved to a family triggers different attitudes among the children involved. The predisposition of OVC towards the idea of reintegration into family life is often conditioned by their memories of their initial experience of family life, or lack thereof. Most of them display a lackadaisical attitude because of their negative experiences of family life, whereas a small number are driven by the prospect of earning a living and being independent even when they are not necessarily looking forward to being integrated into families. This study brings to light the agency of children under care and shows the importance of the psychological and emotional state of OVC involved in deinstitutionalization which could be an influencing factor to be taken into account when taking measures to reintegrated children into a family or community.","['OVC', 'Orphanages', 'RHC', 'Residential Homes for Children', 'Bawjiase', 'CRI', 'Care Reform Initiative', 'LEAP', 'Faith Based Organizations', 'Alternative Care', 'socio-cultural', 'superstitions', 'Decentralization', 'Deinstitutionalization', 'Central Region Ghana', 'GWO', 'Ghana Without Orphans']"

Patrimonial Legacies and Social Organization: The Constraining Effect of Embedded Norms on Institutional and Economic Development in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"Lorenz, Adam","['Ennis, Crystal A.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis contributes to the body of literature that attempts to identify the reasons behind the long-standing inability of various Middle Eastern and African states to implement the international guidelines of sustainable economic development. By integrating the findings of historical sociology, rentier state theory, and political economy within the New Institutional Economics framework, it opens a path towards explaining the relative resilience of some developing autocratic regimes to social change and consolidation of impersonal markets. For this purpose, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been selected for a case study as, more clearly than others, it demonstrates the remarkable ways in which traditional social norms can be appropriated by the leadership and constrain institutional development. At the center of the historical narrative, the work puts the concept of patrimonialism as an informal system of embedded customary rules that fundamentally enhanced the chances for survival of the pre-state Arabian communities. In order to assess the extent to which it shaped the subsequent evolution of institutional matrix and its particular societal incentives until the most recent form, the author traces its institutional, organizational, and economic manifestations over a century of state building process from its tribal origins. Based on the analysis of historical sources it firstly argues that the centralized hierarchic distribution has characterized the social organization long before the discovery of oil, though it heavily depended on secondary elites due to the material shortage at that time. While the oil-related fiscal surpluses enabled expansion of the allocation state and diminished the influence of elites on policymaking, the pre-state governance structures were instrumentalized for personal interests of the autocratic ruler and gradually emerged as the cornerstone of modern institutional environment. This allowed for neopatrimonial strategies of co-option and domination that helped to enlarge the social hierarchy during the fiscal surplus and sustain it over crises. Accordingly, the following process tracing analysis demonstrates this correlation by analyzing the significant legislative decisions and personnel shifts of the Council of Ministers between 1953-2018, and compares them to the macroeconomic developments. Although there are occasional disruptions caused by exceptional external or internal events on one side and, increasingly, authoritarian learning on the other, an apparent pro-cyclical pattern stands out throughout the study, in which the weakness of distributional networks leads to greater institutional and organizational concessions that in turn facilitate decentralization and socio-economic development. Thereby, the author urges for an alternative approach to economic reforms in the Gulf, pointing out the significance of institutional reform for an actual change towards an effective, market-based and sustainable development, and warning from socio-economic impacts of further centralization.",

Benefits from this World: Genze Riyaku and the Moral Support from Ritual Institutions,"Gonzato, Martina","['Veere, H. (Henny) van der']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In Japan, the concept of genze riyaku, which literally means ‘this-worldly benefits’, implies the sphere of this life in which most prayers, requests and needs of the Japanese towards the supposed power of the other world (takai) and its occupants (such as kami, Buddhas and ancestors) are directed. The notion, aside from its materialistic ethic, may be aimed at the attainment of peace of mind and emotional solace; inside this framework, it is usually possible to distinguish four different categories: prevention from disasters, wish for success in life and career, a prosperous love life, and the quelling of demons. First of all, it will be important to establish the limits of the concept ‘religious’ that so often we find in the literature about this topic, which “takes for granted an essentialist (and basically Christocentric) definition of religion” [Josephson, 2011]. After laying the foundations of the Japanese ‘religious’ situation, I will return to the main topic of genze riyaku, better describing the elements that it comprises and that are related to it, such as kudoku (merit). Further, I shall explain how the support from shrines and temples can be provided in different ways, such as through specific rituals, prayers from priests, the personal worship of statues or other sacred objects, and so on. Nonetheless, another option that enable the granting of benefits is the purchase of talismans and amulets, known as ema, omamori and ofuda: altogether, it is possible to affirm that what is embedded in these ritual institutions is a role of crisis management. Since the presence of genze riyaku dates back to before the introduction of the Western concept of religion in Japan, how should we actually label it? Is it a social, cultural, religious concept? What is its relationship with the ritual institutions, and does the genze riyaku help in stressing this sort of “Japanese religiousness”? Lastly, what can the economic aspect around the selling of talismans and amulets or paid rites tell us about the notion of genze riyaku?","['genze riyaku', 'Japan', 'religions', 'cultural practices', 'ritual institutions', 'merit']"

It starts with negative views, widely considered the most characteristic, and lists the spiritual, emotional and even social reasons given in the early texts for the avoidance of musical art forms. The rest of the work addresses less known, wholesome uses of music: ‘devotional’ compositions, apparently as old as the oldest strata of the Pāli Canon (according to the texts themselves, many eons older), and a handful of episodes where advanced practitioners are led to Nirvana by the lyrics of peasant songs. The last chapter is dedicated to two meditational states that seem to involve perceptions of beauty, the ‘beautiful-liberation’ (subha-vimokkha) and the samādhi of divine sounds of the Mahāli Sutta. The conclusion argues that a more balanced image of the early Buddhist approach to art is needed to make sense of modern Buddhism and its embrace of a perhaps not so foreign ‘Romantic’ aestheticism.","['Buddhism', 'music', 'dance', 'Theravada', 'aesthetics', 'meditation', 'Pali']"

Gender Normativity in Historical Fusion Drama: the case of Moon Lovers.,"Kies, Lauren","['Ceuster, Koen de']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Korean society has made great strides forward in gender representation in the last decade, yet mainstream media often encourages stereotypes and binary gender roles. However, the genre conventions of historical fusion and fantasy combine elements of imagination and otherness that can engage in discussion on gender and represent gender in an alternative, more open, way. It addresses a contemporary issue yet is not bounded by the restrictions of today’s society. To analyze the potential positive representation of the genres, this thesis analyzes the Korean historical fantasy fusion drama Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo (hereafter Moon Lovers) (2016). In order to study the alternative representations within mainstream media, this thesis looks at how the series’ representation of gender is in line with gender normativity. The leading research question is: Does Moon Lovers break gender normativity? The study was conducted through film analysis and guided by gender theory. In conclusion, Moon Lovers does not break with gender normativity. However, the potential of the genres to represent gender in an alternative way still require further study.","['Gender', 'Genre', 'Television', 'Imagination', 'Representation']"
Proselytization and Persecution: fumi-e in the encounter between Christianity and Japan,"Raat, Marjolein de","['Paramore, Kiri']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the early Edo period (17th century), Christianity was persecuted in Japan after about a century of missionary activities by European priests. The Japanese persecution used fumi-e, ‘trample images’, to force converts to apostatize. This thesis analyses an extant fumi-e from the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, and aims to answer how this fumi-e can be used as an illustration of the process of mutual exchange and adaptation, also called transculturation, that occured before and during the persecution. Using Panofsky’s iconological analysis, the image on the fumi-e can be identified as a depiction of the Madonna of the Rosary. Art featuring this motif was brought to Japan by European missionaries. The fumi-e shows stylistic influences from non-European artistic traditions. These are reminiscent of the art made by Japanese students of the Jesuits, Japanese Buddhist art, the yamato-e style, and nanban art. These influences can be explained by placing the object in the context of the persecution. The Volkenkunde fumi-e was specifically made for the persecution, as a replacement of the worn-out initial fumi-e that consisted of paintings and other fragile items. Using other extant fumi-e featuring the same motif, the development and gradual change of the ‘Madonna of the Rosary’ image can be seen. This change can be explained by the lack of European examples due to the ongoing persecution, and the process of transculturation that had already begun with the first missionaries. This process of transculturation can be seen in other aspects of the persecution as well. The government systematized three major ways of persecution, which can be seen as methods of surveillance and population control. These methods were social control in the form of the goningumi system and offering rewards to informants, monitoring in the form of obligatory registration at Buddhist temples and the compilation of population registers, and tests of faith using the fumi-e. These methods did not only impact Christians, but became part of the fabric of Japanese society, and affected the shape of Japanese Buddhism as well. Furthermore, they asserted the authority of the Tokugawa government. The persecution also helped shape a narrative about identity, in which Christians served as the ‘Other’ against which ‘Japaneseness’ could be contrasted. Echos of this narrative can be seen throughout the Edo period extending into early Meiji, and even in contemporary attitudes towards (Western) foreigners. The Volkenkunde fumi-e illustrates all these points. Its visual qualities show the artistic exchange in the ‘Christian Century’, while its purpose and use demonstrate how the subsequent persecution transformed society by providing methods for population control, assertion of authority for the Tokugawa bakufu, and creating a narrative about identity. It is therefore both a product and an illustration of the transcultural process that occured in the encounter between Japan and Christianity.","['japan', 'christianity', 'kirishitan', 'jesuit art', 'fumi-e', 'edo period', 'transculturalism', 'cultural exchange']"

It analyses respectively the purpose of the actors involved (China and the EU); the (perceived) necessity of EU protection of key technologies from Chinese FDI; and the risks related to the protection of key technologies in the EU. In doing so, it provides an overview of the different discourses, building on theoretical insights from a wide range of literature: including on strategic thinking in the EU, and the drivers behind Chinese FDI for both firms and polities.","['Investment', 'FDI', 'China', 'European Union', 'Key Technologies']"

Cooperativismo femenino como herramienta para el empoderamiento de las mujeres: la cooperativa Mujeres Pescadoras del Manglar en la costa de Oaxaca,"Sartini, Ilaria","['Aguiar, José Carlos']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Master thesis,es,"La igualdad de género sigue siendo un reto para el mundo, especialmente en aquellas regiones donde las prácticas socio-culturales machistas intersecan con la pobreza y la discriminación racial institucionalizada. En este articulo quiero señalar la relación directa y positiva entre cooperativismo bottom-up femenino y empoderamiento de las mujeres. Voy a tomar como estudio de caso la cooperativa Mujeres Pescadoras del Manglar de la costa de Oaxaca en México. Esta cooperativa constituye un ejemplo interesante donde emergen varias temáticas de México contemporáneo con dinámicas cuyas orígenes remontan hasta la conquista y la colonia. El contexto en que se desarrolla la cooperativa es un pueblado cuya población está compuesta por indígenas (chatinos y mixtecos) y afrodescendientes, lo cual es un factor importante no solo desde un punto de vista cultural, sino histórico y social también. De hecho, desde la conquista los indígenas y los africanos traídos desde Africa para el comercio de esclavos y sus descendientes, han sido y son objeto de opresión y discriminación por parte de las élites y de las instituciones, lo que ha comportado su actual posición marginalizada en la sociedad con las tasas de educación, empleo y salud más bajas del paìs. Asimismo, la cooperativa Mujeres Pescadoras del Manglar es un ejemplo del fenómeno nacional de incremento de empleo femenino en el sector pesquero, lo cual es en aumento gracias al creciente número de cooperativas femeninas a través de las cuales las mujeres pueden acceder al mercado laboral, feminizar nuevos espacios y lograr un pleno empoderamiento frente a ellas mismas, sus familias y a la sociedad en que viven. La creación de espacios seguros y feminizados donde las mujeres pueden expresarse y convivir libremente es fundamental para la toma de consciencia de su posición en cuanto personas y para no pensarse únicamente como madres, esposas o hermanas de un hombre. Tomar consciencia de una misma es la primera pauta hacia el cambio y sobre todo para el empoderamiento individual y colectivo.","['empoderamiento', 'mujeres', 'afromexicanas', 'indìgenas', 'cooperativismo feminino', 'machismo', 'equidad de género']"

Gucci for Grandma's Ghost: Tracing Recent Changes in Ancestral Offering Practices in China through a Comparative Study of Tang Dynasty Grave Goods and Contemporary Paper Offerings,"Trimborn, Jana Denise","['Cwiertka, K.J.', 'Paskaleva, E.G.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Providing for deceased ancestors in the afterlife through offerings is a millennia-old custom in China. In recent years have the elaborate paper effigies of worldly goods that are burned for this purpose however received heavy criticism in Chinese and international media as the inclusion of modern luxury and brand items into the repertory of paper offering goods is seen as a deviation from long-standing traditions. The comparative study conducted in this thesis puts side by side ancient burial goods, the predecessors of the current paper offerings, and contemporary paper effigies in an attempt to answer the question whether luxury and brand items in the ancestral offering context constitute as claimed a break with tradition. The study has shown that throughout history, luxury items have been a constant feature of ancestral offerings. The expensive goods are not only a sign of the wealth and status of the bereaved family members in the hereafter, but also help the deceased to gain prestige and a high position in the social hierarchy of the afterlife. While in earlier times, the value of an offering was primarily determined by the value of the material it was made from, symbolism became the main indicator of value as offerings began to be commonly made from cheap materials like clay and nowadays paper. The replicas of contemporary luxury and brand items with their associated value are a modern take on the ancient practice of assigning value to otherwise valueless offerings through symbolic power.","['china', 'ancestor worship', 'burial goods', 'paper offerings', 'funerary practices', 'death', 'afterlife', 'joss paper']"

De ontwikkeling van de Maqāṣid-theorie door de eeuwen heen,"Zerdoua, Ahmed","['Kaptein, Nico J.G.']",2019,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De term “maqāṣid al-sharīʿah” verwijst naar de (hogere en onderliggende) doelstellingen waar het hele corpus van de Islamitische Wet aanvankelijk voor werd opgesteld om deze te bewerkstelligen, ten behoeve van de mensheid. Zo’n omschrijving verondersteld dat de Sharīʿa niet slechts een collectie is van voorschriften die irrationeel of ondoorgrondelijk zijn. Dientengevolge, zij die beweren dat de Sharīʿa over doelstellingen (maqāṣid) beschikt maken de impliciete statement over het rationele karakter van de Sharīʿa, namelijk dat God intentioneel – uit Zijn oneindige Wijsheid en Barmhartigheid – een aantal zaken wil bewerkstelligen door het instellen van bepaalde wetten. Het standpunt dat de Sharīʿa wel degelijk over doelstellingen beschikt wordt beaamd door de meeste (sunnītische) theoretici op basis van de volgende premisse, namelijk het bevorderen van de maṣlaḥah of ‘het algemeen belang’. Zo heeft deze scriptie tot doel om de totstandkoming van de maqāṣid-theorie nader te beschrijven alsook hoe bepaalde prominente moslimgeleerden hierover heden ten dage denken.","['Kulliyyāt al-khams', 'Maṣāliḥ al-mursala', 'Maqāṣid al-Sharīʿa', 'Qiyās', 'Taʿlīl', 'Uṣūl al-Fiqh.']"
