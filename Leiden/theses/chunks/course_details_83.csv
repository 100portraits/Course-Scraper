Translating swear words: a fucking difficult task. An analysis of Sam Garrett's American English translation of Turks Fruit,"Bruin, Margriet de","['Bovelander, Maud']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Jan Wolkers’ Turks Fruit (1969) was and remains a sensational novel, famous for its explicit sex scenes and use of crude language. March 2017 saw the publication of the first American English translation of the novel, titled Turkish Delight. So far, no scholar has analysed this new translation by Sam Garrett and even though many articles have been written about swearing in translation, e.g. Crisafulli (1997) and Santaemilia (2008 and 2013), little to no research has been done into the Dutch and English language pair. The main question that I have addressed in this thesis is this: “What was Sam Garrett’s translation strategy while translating Turks Fruit (1969) with regard to taboo language and swearing?” In answer to this question, taboo language in the ST and the TT has been analysed in this research using Pinker’s (2008) pragmatic categories of swear words and the translation procedures used in the TT, Turkish Delight, have been analysed using Vinay & Darbelnet’s (1958) theory on translation strategies. Greenall’s (2008) theory has been used to determine a difference in swearing constraint between the Dutch and American cultures. The analysis ascertains three main points. Firstly, Garrett stays fairly faithful to the ST; he has mostly used a direct translation strategy (66%) and never changes the type of swearing used in the ST. Secondly, the most striking exception to this direct translation strategy is that he has added taboo language and swear words to the TT that were not present in the ST. Thirdly, this irregularity can be explained by a difference in strength of the swearing constraint between the ST readership and the TT readership. Sam Garrett’s translation strategy with regard to taboo language and swearing in Turks Fruit (1969) seems to have been to create a translation with an equivalent attention-getting effect.","['Translation', 'Swearing', 'Turks Fruit', 'Taboo language', 'Sam Garrett', 'Jan Wolkers', 'Turkish Delight', 'Greenall', 'Pinker']"

Translating the Information-to-Persuasion Ratio,"Best, Irene de","['Bovelander, Maud']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The effectiveness of advertising texts largely depends on the way they are written. Torresi’s information-to-persuasion ratio is a way of defining the stylistic traits of advertising texts in terms of their informativeness and persuasiveness. This ratio can be used to determine the way an advertising text should be translated, so that the translated advertising text is effective. The purpose of this thesis was to experiment with Torresi’s theory by examining the effects different information-to-persuasion ratios have on readers, and to determine the potential this ratio holds for sales optimisation, using three translations of one English advertising text that have different information-to-persuasion ratios. One translation had the same ratio as the source text, one translation was more informative, and one was more persuasive. The results, gathered through a survey, did not always concur with Torresi’s theory. The results showed that translating texts in a more informative or persuasive manner may have a few benefits. For instance, it may provide readers with a better understanding of the product being sold. In addition, the general information about the product was considered more credible in the informative TT compared to the neutral TT. However, it appeared that changing the ratio may also have several negative effects that override the benefits. For example, it may lengthen the text to such an extent that the reader finds it more difficult to focus on the text. Moreover, the readers of the neutral TT found the product the most relevant for them. Overall, the neutral translation was the most effective translation. In other words, experimenting with the information-to-persuasion ratio did not improve advertising effectiveness in this case, and may therefore hold little to no potential for sales optimisation.","['Translation', 'Persuasion', 'Toressi', 'Commercial', 'Advertising']"

Inequidad en el acceso a la educación superior: Análisis del Programa Propedéutico en la Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Blok, Lieneke","['Silva, Patricio']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,es,"En Chile, el sistema actual de acceso a la educación superior es determinado principalmente por los resultados de la PSU, lo cual es un sistema calificado por muchos como segregador y ya que reproduciría las desigualdades sociales. Por esta razón la USACH empezó a implementar el Programa Propedéutico que pretende que los estudiantes en contextos vulnerables que se destacan por sus méritos académicos (5%-10% superior en ranking durante la educación media) ingresen a la universidad sin considerar el puntaje de la PSU. Los objetivos de este estudio son visibilizar la situación actual, analizar la capacidad y la durabilidad del Propedéutico para reducir brechas sociales en el acceso a la educación superior y conocer la percepción al respecto de los participantes del programa. La investigación es de carácter cualitativo y analítico y se hizo a través de encuestas: por un lado a un grupo de estudiantes que recién ingresó al Propedéutico y y por otro lado un grupo que recién egresó del programa. Además, se realizaron entrevistas con individuos de dichos grupos y con varios académicos a cargo del programa. Los resultados indican que el programa es exitoso en mejorar la equidad en el acceso, en una escala moderada, para aquellos alumnos académicamente talentosos, independientemente de su condición socioeconómica.","['Inclusión social', 'Inequidad educacional', 'Acceso inclusivo', 'Educación superior', 'Programa Propedéutico']"

"Socks, Socks, Socks: The Influence of Variety and Lexical Knowledge on Visual Rule Learning by 12- to 14-Month-Old Infants","Wijnmalen, Joyce","['Levelt, Claartje']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the abstract rule learning mechanism as proposed by Marcus et al. (1999). While Marcus et al. (1999) indicated that 7-month-old infants can recognize and generalize rule-like patterns (i.e., ABA or ABB patterns) in linguistic input, Saffran et al. (2007) showed that infants can also learn rules from visual input. This thesis aims to investigate whether visual rule learning is still connected to language in the form of lexical knowledge, as rule learning could be facilitated by familiarity with the label pertaining to a visual object. To explore this notion, Saffran et al. (2007) is replicated with 12- to 14-month-old infants, using socks with different colour schemes as the stimuli, since the word sock should be familiar to the participants. Furthermore, the role of within-stimulus variety between A and B items is explored by comparing the results from the current study to Van Leeuwen (2016), who used entirely different objects as A and B items in a similar experiment.","['abstract rule learning', 'visual rule learning', 'lexical knowledge', 'infants']"

De staat van de lokale waakhond,"Montijn, Cato","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De lokale journalistiek is van belang voor het informeren van burgers over hun leefomgeving en om hen betrokken te houden bij hun gemeenschap. Ook heeft de journalistiek een waakhondfunctie, ze is een controlerende macht ten opzichte van de overheid. Door digitalisering en marktwerking lijkt de democratische waarde van de journalistiek, vooral op lokaal niveau, echter in het nauw te raken. Eerder onderzoek van het Stimuleringsfonds voor de Journalistiek wees uit dat de lokale politiek in kleine Nederlandse gemeenten nauwelijks op journalistieke aandacht kan rekenen. Ook de diepgang van nieuwsberichten in lokale media blijkt te wensen over te laten. In 2016 start het Stimuleringsfonds een nieuw onderzoek, ditmaal naar de nieuwsecologie in grotere gemeenten, te weten Amsterdam, Utrecht, Den Haag en Rotterdam. Doel van dit onderzoek is het in kaart brengen van de belangrijkste nieuwsmedia en de manier waarop een nieuwsgebeurtenis zich in die media manifesteert. Dit scriptieonderzoek bouwt voort op het onderzoek van het Stimuleringsfonds. Op grond van de datasets van nieuwsberichten die in de week van 12 tot en met 18 september verschenen in de lokale media van Amsterdam, Utrecht en Den Haag kan de kwaliteit van de berichtgeving worden geanalyseerd. De vraag die in dit onderzoek centraal staat, luidt: Hoe vervult de lokale journalistiek in Amsterdam, Utrecht en Den Haag zijn democratische functies, hoe kan de kwaliteit hiervan worden beoordeeld en hoe is die beoordeling te vergelijken met de democratische kwaliteit van lokale journalistiek in Zweden? Om het begrip ‘kwaliteit’ te operationaliseren, is eerst een kwaliteitsbegrip opgesteld en is vervolgens een instrument ontwikkeld waarmee de kwaliteit van berichten kan worden vastgesteld. Het kwaliteitsbegrip richt zich op de vraag of de lokale journalistiek zijn democratische functies vervult. De criteria, aan de hand waarvan de minimaal beoogde kwaliteit van de berichtgeving in de drie grote steden kan worden geanalyseerd, zijn: - Berichten moeten over lokaal beleid gaan. - Berichten moeten origineel zijn. - Berichten moeten lang genoeg zijn om voldoende diepgang te kunnen bieden en voldoende neutraal zijn. - Berichten moeten twee of meer bronnen bevatten. Gemiddeld ging in de onderzochte week in september bijna een kwart van de berichtgeving over lokaal beleid. Na het toepassen van alle kwaliteitscriteria blijven van de 3.464 geanalyseerde berichten echter slechts 202 berichten over die aan alle eisen voldoen. Dat is 5,8% van de berichtgeving. De lokale journalistiek in de steden Amsterdam, Utrecht en Den Haag vervult zijn democratische functie dus maar minimaal. Om een benchmark voor het onderzoek in Nederland te creëren, zijn de resultaten afgezet tegen soortgelijk onderzoek uit Zweden. Uit die vergelijking blijkt dat de Zweedse lokale journalistiek zijn democratische functies beter vervult dan die in Nederland – in Zweden gaan meer berichten over lokaal beleid. Ook op het gebied van originele berichtgeving en brongebruik lopen Zweedse gemeenten op Nederland voor. De lokale journalistiek in Nederland verdient aandacht. Het zou goed zijn om in vervolgonderzoek de kwaliteit van de berichtgeving ook inhoudelijk te analyseren en te zoeken naar oplossingen waarmee de democratische waarde van de journalistiek kan worden verbeterd.","['Lokale nieuwsmedia', 'Democratische waarde', 'Kwaliteit', 'Kwaliteitsinstrument']"

Representing Space: an Inquiry into the Renaissance understanding of art,"Been, Lars Niklas","['Bussel, Stijn']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In this thesis I aim to get a grip on ‘how’ a narrative is being told to a beholder of a Renaissance painting. I describe the condition in which a painting presents a story to a beholder. The condition is the representation of pictorial space. The representation of pictorial space has been characterized as naturalistic. Renaissance naturalism has to be interpreted through a theological lens, which helps us to understand the rhetoric behind Renaissance naturalism. A theological framework can explain the evaluation of the perceptions of natural sense experience and explains the function of composition, that is, to transform the beholder’s consciousness into a religious consciousness. Specific rules of composition contribute to ‘how’ a narrative is being told to a beholder of Renaissance art. By inquiring these rules we get a better understanding of how the Renaissance artist represents space; how the Renaissance beholder relates to the depiction of space; and how the modern viewer relates differently to the Renaissance painting.",

Traditionele honden bewaken de stadsdemocratie,"Nieuwstraten, Marieke","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Wie op de hoogte wil blijven van de actualiteit, slaat ’s ochtends de krant open of scrolt door een nieuws-app. Tijdens dit ochtendritueel staat men er niet altijd bij stil, maar nieuws is geen objectieve beschrijving van wat er is gebeurd of staat te gebeuren. Er zijn verschillende actoren die onze actualiteit en, in een later stadium, onze sociale werkelijkheid bepalen. Politieke en publieke actoren spelen een rol tijdens agendabuilding en bepalen deels de nieuwsagenda, maar onderwerpen die in de media verschijnen, vullen ook de politieke en publieke agenda. Binnen onze huidige democratische samenleving kunnen media dan ook een waardevolle taak vervullen. Media kunnen namelijk een informatieve, een expressieve en een kritische of controlerende functie hebben. Op grond van die laatste functie worden journalisten daarom dikwijls de waakhonden van de democratie genoemd. Vooral in kleine gemeenten worden deze waakhonden met uitsterven bedreigd, wat een gemis is voor de lokale democratie in deze gemeenten. En omdat Nederlandse gemeenten taken omtrent zorg en werkgelegenheid hebben overgenomen van het Rijk, zijn goedfunctionerende lokale media steeds belangrijker. Om te onderzoeken op welke manier de lokale en regionale media hun democratische functie in een grote stad vervullen, is in deze masterscriptie de berichtgeving van twee grote Nederlandse steden onderzocht. De drie deelfuncties – de informatieve, de expressieve en de kritische of controlerende functie – zijn bij de analyse van de data leidend in dit onderzoek. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de lokale democratische mediafuncties in beide nieuwsecosystemen niet het belangrijkste aandachtspunt zijn. Het overgrote deel van het nieuws betreft immers überhaupt geen lokaal beleid. Dit wil niet zeggen dat de media hun democratische functie helemaal niet waarmaken. Bepaalde mediatypen hebben hier echter een groter aandeel in dan andere. Zo komt de informatieve en expressieve functie het meest tot zijn recht in een aantal traditionele offline media, zoals de papieren krant en de radio, maar de Utrechtse online hyperlocal – een zelfstandige nieuwssite - mag ook niet vergeten worden. Bovendien spelen online kanalen ook een rol bij het waarmaken van de controlerende of kritische functie. Dit zijn wel online kanalen van klassiekere afzenders: de lokale en regionale omroep en het dagblad. Hoewel dus vooral traditionele mediatypen en nieuwsorganisaties een belangrijke democratische functie hebben binnen de nieuwsecosystemen, blijkt dat juist deze groep het economisch zwaar te verduren heeft en zelfs uit veel gemeenten verdwijnt. Nieuwe online kanalen en initiatieven nemen deze rol binnen de stadsdemocratie nog niet genoeg over.","['lokale media', 'democratische functie', 'brongebruik', 'regionale media', 'informatieve functie', 'expressieve functie', 'controlerende functie', 'lokale journalistiek', 'waakhond', 'lokaal beleid']"
Minority Rights in Turkey: EU Smart Power and the Aramean Property Issue,"Bakir, Sarah","['Schonmann, Noa']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the last several years, Turkey’s relationship with the EU has strongly deteriorated over the country’s equally deteriorating human rights conditions. However, there was a time when Turkey was dedicated to its reform process for the purpose of EU accession. As the EU views itself as a normative power, and it had been relatively successful in advancing minority rights in the CEECs, why had it not been able to do the same in Turkey? This thesis researched: why was the EU unable to advance the Aramean property cases during the height of Turkey’s accession negotiations (2005-2011)? It tested this question based on Nye’s (2008) use of smart power, wherein public diplomacy plays a central role. Additionally, it tested Schimmelfennig & Sedelmeier’s (2004) application of carrots and sticks in the case of EU accession. It found that, with regard to Turkey in the Aramean property case, the EU failed to engage in public diplomacy and lacked credibility to effectively apply its carrots and sticks against Turkey.","['minority rights', 'property rights', 'smart power', 'public diplomacy', 'Arameans', 'Turkey', 'EU']"

"The digital panopticon: media, state, and cultural hegemony in the case of the revelations made by Edward Snowden","Mamritsova, Dilyana","['Regilme, Salvador']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Nowadays the internet domain has become indispensable in modern society. As technology is accelerating and developing, cyber culture is becoming ever-more dominant in the field of politics. As such, various actors’ ability to upend the global political order by electronic means is increasing, as well as states are able to exert power in a less coercive way. With this in mind, this paper seeks to examine the revelations made by Edward Snowden with regard to US surveillance practices. The disclosures by Snowden have generated a large discussion around surveillance with regard to the digital panopticon and the imperialistic nature of the US. This paper examines the role of US media in their effort to continue to be globally dominant. The study employs a qualitative method and critical interpretive approach to answer the research question, by applying the theory of cultural hegemony to explain how the American media co-opts the US state by using framing. As such, this is achieved by normalizing surveillance practices by focusing the attention towards Snowden and the fear of another 9/11.","['media framing', 'digital panopticon', 'Snowden', 'US surveillance', 'cultural hegemony']"

South Korea-Japan Relations and Historical Disputes : U.S. Pressure behind the 2015 Comfort Women Agreement,"Jeong, Ji Won","['Black, L.O.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Despite the vast research done the comfort women issue and its impact on the South KoreaJapan relations, little attention has been paid to its political significance in connection to the U.S. security interest. During the Obama administration, due to the increasing fluidity in the geopolitical situations in Northeast Asia, the United States diverted from its traditional ‘avoidance’ strategy. As such, it attempted to actively interfere in the historical disputes between its two most important allies to foster the U.S.-South Korea-Japan trilateral security alliance. The 2015 comfort women agreement is a case where such efforts materialized. Thus, by examining the case of the 2015 agreement, this article argues that the United States influenced South Korea and Japan to strike the historic agreement for the sake of its security interests. Through combining three different methodologies used for measuring influence, this article will first identify the U.S.’ security preferences related to the agreement.

Stuck In Denial versus Moving With Science: Climate Change Discourses and the Influence of the Denial Machine on Left and Right News Media,"Zegers, Luuk Ferenc Leonard","['Bilt, Eduard van de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Fossil fuel industry giants in the United States like ExxonMobil sponsor contrarian science to distort the public image of the (virtually non-existing) debate on whether anthropogenic global warming exists. The efforts of this so-called ―Denial Machine‖ seem to bear fruit: despite scientific consensus, Americans remain divided on the issue of anthropogenic climate change. Liberal Democrats are more likely to follow the consensus view (79% believes the planet is warming mostly due to human activity), whereas only 15% of the Conservative Republicans supposes this to be the case. Dunlap and McCright argue that conservative media outlets function as an echo chamber for the contrarian voices of this Denial Machine. Liisa Antilla argues that the conservative media is not the only side responsible for this echoing—in their quest for ―journalistic balance,‖ mainstream and progressive news outlets (including the New York Times) have also presented contrarian voices as ―experts‖ in the past. With these insights in mind, this study maps the climate change discourses and source-use of two opposing poles in the U.S. media landscape in the months prior to Trump‘s election: the New York Times on the Liberal Democrat side; news weblog Breitbart on the Conservative Republican side. The results show that these opposing poles conduct their climate change reporting on completely different levels: while the conservative Breitbart seems stuck in denial, hence condemned to the debate-level, the liberal Times has passed this level by accepting consensus and focusing its reporting on the consequences of climate change. In addition, this study also concludes that the Times no longer functions as an echo chamber for contrarian voices for the sake of journalistic balance, while Breitbart, by giving pseudo scientists space to directly publish on their platform regularly, not only functions as echo chamber, but also as the vocal cords of contrarian voices.","['journalism', 'climate', 'climate change', 'global warming', 'denial machine', 'discourse', 'sources']"

The Construction of Race and the Politics of Memory in American Anti- and Pro-Slavery Fiction from Harriet Beecher Stowe to Thomas Nelson Page,"Borst, Brian","['Kardux, Johanna C.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The American slavery debate, raging from the early nineteenth century up until the Civil War, almost destroyed the Union through its increasing political, economical and social anxiety. Southerners argued against any federal interference of their institution of slavery and abolitionists, especially those who were more radical, vehemently opposed any continuation of the institution. In this tumult, several writers took up the pen to argue against or specifically in favor of slavery, which they did in sentimental novels intended to sway their readers. I argue that each of the authors of the works discussed in this thesis reframe the African American plight in order to portray what the authors feel is the idealized version of African Americans, regardless of whether it had any bearing on reality. In this way, white superiority remained intact. Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin, while advocating for the abolition of slavery, treats her enslaved characters as childlike and simplistic. Eastman’s Aunt Phillis’s Cabin portrays her enslaved characters as utterly devotional to the white families they work for, going even as far as to argue for removing their own autonomy so to better serve their masters. And Page’s In Ole Virginia, written during the post-Reconstruction period, portrays free African Americans as witnesses to the better times experienced while in servitude.","['America', 'Slavery', 'Antebellum', 'Reconstruction Era', 'Literature', 'pro-slavery', 'abolitionism']"

De macht en invloed van de Representanten van de Eerste Edele in Zeeland.,"Vos, Thijs Johannes","['Ebben, M.A.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Gedurende de vroege zeventiende eeuw werd de Zeeuwse gewestelijke politiek gedomineerd door de representant van de Eerste Edele. In dit BA-Eindwerkstuk wordt onderzocht wat de rol en machtsbasis van de representant was. Het bestaan van de functie van representant was het gevolg van de sterke positie van de Oranjes in Zeeland: zij waren stadhouder, Eerste Edele en markies van Veere en Vlissingen. Hieruit vloeiden de formele en informele bevoegdheden van de representant voort. De rol van de representant was tweeledig: zij traden op als zaakwaarnemers van de Oranjes in de Zeeuwse bestuursorganen en waren de makelaars in hun Zeeuwse patronagenetwerk. Aan de hand van Johan de Knuyt en Hendrick Thibaut is de persoonlijke invulling van het representantschap en de invloed van hun verhoudingen met de Oranjes op hun positie onderzocht. Terwijl De Knuyt veel meer een man van de Oranjes was en voor zijn posities afhankelijk van hen was, was Thibaut juist sterk verbonden met de Middelburgse migrantenfactie en had daardoor veel meer een lokale machtsbasis. Door de goede verstandhouding van De Knuyt met Frederik Hendrik en Amalia en van Thibaut met Willem II hadden beide representanten zeer grote invloed op de Zeeuwse magistraatsbestelling en – mede daardoor – greep op het Zeeuwse bestuur.","['Representant van de Eerste Edele', 'Eerste Edele', 'Representant', 'Zeeland', 'Staten van Zeeland', 'Hendrick Thibaut', 'Johan de Knuyt', 'Zeventiende Eeuw', 'Oranjes', 'Amalia van Solms']"

This text came with the only linguistic study available at the moment, the grammar sketch by Rassadin (2010). Besides the text, a minidictionary was also published together with the grammar sketch. This dictionary was the source for the translation of the text, which was subsequently parsed and glossed. This work was published in order to revive the Soyot language which went extinct sometime between the 1970s and 1990s. However, a lot of this language has not yet been studied. The analyzed text provided new data and it was the basis for the description of the functions of participles and gerunds. The text also shows how predicative possession is constructed. On the other hand, the mini-dictionary helped to define the sound inventory of Soyot. With the help of literature on other languages, such as related Turkic languages or Mongolic languages which have influenced Soyot, a hypothetical IPA orthography could be contructed and the syntax of subordinate clauses and predicative possessive could be compared.","['Soyot', 'Russian minority', 'language description', 'language preservation', 'text analysis', 'Siberian languages', 'Turkic languages']"

Nationalism and Identity in Mexico - Analysis of the impact of anti-American sentiment on bilateral relations,"Pfeiffer, Lukas","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"National Identity and Nationalism play a growing role in our globalized world. Being globalized stands for a shrinking world, which has an effect upon every sphere of life – from economic condition, to personal freedom, to cultural customs. Bilateralism, or bilateral relationships such as the one between Mexico and the United States bring countries closer together and enable success and growth. Nevertheless, such a relationship also impacts on both countries through cultural convergence and economic dependence. Therefore, this study examines how the Mexico – United States bilateral relation impacts on Mexico´s national identity. It directly addresses the level of anti-American sentiment in Mexico City. Furthermore, it assesses how an increased antiAmerican sentiment and a growing Mexican nationalism impact on Mexico´s foreign policy towards the United States of America. Finally, it evaluates in how far this affects the construction of the Mexican identity itself. The author shows in this study that there exists a connection between a growing anti-American sentiment in the Mexican society and the current stage of the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States of America. This study concludes that currently the seemingly volatile relationship between Mexico and the United States of America is also an opportunity or possibility for Mexico to gain next to economic independence, also to reorient the construction of the Mexican national identity distinguished from its neighbouring country.","['National Identity', 'Nationalism', 'Foreign Politics and Bilateralism']"

This structure of North-South cooperation was translated into the Clean Development Mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol. My thesis analyzes the implementation of this mechanism in Colombia and Peru and answers whether its goals of emission reduction, sustainable development and technology transfer have been achieved. Through a case study of two Clean Development Mechanism projects this dissertation shows the success of current climate change mitigation mechanisms in the context of two Latin American countries. Finally, I will study the equivalent of the “Clean Development Mechanism” in the Paris Agreement to answer whether problems encountered in the Clean Development Mechanism have been addressed in the Paris Agreement.","['Kyoto', 'Clean Development Mechanism', 'Climate Change', 'Carbon Markets', 'Paris Agreement', 'Sustainable Development', 'Technology Transfer']"

Als men kijkt naar de gebeurtenissen in de periferie van het Russische Rijk ten tijde van de Revolutie blijkt echt dat de deelname van moslims sterker naar voren komt dan eerder gedacht. Het moslimreformisme in combinatie met pan-Turkistische ideeën leidden tot een nieuwe samenwerking tussen enerzijds de sovjets en anderzijds de moslimbevolking van Centraal-Azië. Het moslimcommunisme, oftewel sultangalievisme, is een alternatief voor het bolsjewisme in het centrum van het nieuwe Sovjetrijk. Het moslimcommunisme plaatst het bolsjewisme in een nationalistisch kader waarbinnen een ‘lokale’ revolutie moest plaatsvinden zodat zij zich vrij konden vechten van de imperiale mogendheden. Deze ideologie manifesteert zich voornamelijk rond de persoon Mirsaïd Sultan-Galiev die zich inzet om een nieuwe samenwerking te vestigen tussen Islam (groen) en de sovjets (rood). De participatie van de moslims van Centraal-Azië en hun houding ten opzichte van de bolsjewisten was actief te noemen, wat tegen de historiografie ingaat.

The need for a new epistemic perception is therefore required in order to overcome the boundaries that shaped the anthropocentrism.Through the methodology of the artwork and philosophical analysis this thesis will strive to address the issues on how the traditional anthropocentric thinking has limited the ways we have established our relationship with animals, plants and nature in general. Why art is considered as an exceedingly needed aspect in overcoming the anthropocentric thinking will be explained in four consecutive chapters, each explaining and giving the reader an apprehensible understanding on how art is able to challenge the anthropocentric conundrum that has ubiquitously remained in the way we ‘other’ animals and plants.","['posthumanism', 'bioart', 'anthropocentrism', 'metaphysics', 'Other']"

Gedurende de eerste helft van de 17de eeuw ontwikkelde de zogenaamde ‘Hollandse’ tegel zich tot een kwalitatief hoogstaand product, dat ook buiten de grenzen van de Republiek aanzien genoot en zich daar begon te verspreiden. Over het gebruik van ‘Hollandse’ tegels in Duitstalig gebied, in het bijzonder in de deelstaten van de voormalige Duitse Democratische Republiek, is nog weinig geschreven. Voorliggend onderzoek beoogt meer bekendheid te geven aan de verspreiding van de ‘Hollandse’ tegel in het gebied dat nu de deelstaten Brandenburg en Saksen-Anhalt omvat. Het onderzoek is toegespitst op vier case studies: slot Oranienbaum (Dessau-Wörlitz, Saksen-Anhalt), slot Caputh en jachtslot Stern (beiden nabij Potsdam, Brandenburg), en slot Reinharz (nabij Dessau-Wörlitz, Saksen-Anhalt). Wanneer gekeken wordt naar de verspreiding van de ‘Hollandse’ tegel in de betreffende Duitstalige gebieden, spreken we eigenlijk over de verspreiding van ‘cultuurelementen’ en komen daarmee in het vakgebied van de cultural transfer studies. In dit onderzoek wordt geprobeerd te beantwoorden in hoeverre bij de verspreiding van ‘Hollandse’ faiencetegels vanaf het einde van de 17de eeuw tot het midden van de 18de eeuw in Brandenburg en Saksen-Anhalt gesproken kan worden van een vorm van cultural transfer. Daartoe zal eerst uiteen worden gezet op welke wijze de ‘Hollandse’ faiencetegels zich in die periode in en naar Brandenburg en Saksen-Anhalt hebben verspreid. Daarna zal de vraag worden gesteld of er bij die verspreiding sprake is van overname van ‘Hollandse’ cultuurelementen door de lokale bevolking in Brandenburg en Saksen-Anhalt, zoals het geval bij cultural transfer.","[""Hollandse' tegels - Brandenburg en Saksen-Anhalt - cultural transfer""]"

The Frequency and Function of Figurative Language Use by Courts from a Criminal-Law and Tort-Law Perspective in Dutch and English Supreme Court Rulings,"Duyff, Femme","['Foster, Tony A.A.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this study was to analyse the use of metaphor in judicial decisions from a criminal-law and a tort-law perspective, and discuss differences between these two law areas as well as between the Dutch and the English rulings. This paper only took into account judicial decisions formulated by the Dutch Hoge Raad (the Dutch Supreme Court) and the English Supreme Court. This is because it is at this level that the use of metaphor promised to be the most interesting, as these courts deal with abstraction and are able to use language and content more freely than lower courts. The function and perspective of tort and criminal law, the role of the judiciary, and the justification of decisions are all factors that determine how metaphors are used in judicial decisions. Many different circumstances allow for the use of different metaphors: there is the unlawful behaviour itself; there are people involved that have to judge this behaviour, people involved that assist those that performed the behaviour etcetera; all conditioning the use of metaphor. The legal culture determines the metaphors we live by. This paper will aim to provide an answer to the following two research questions: 1. Does the difference in function and perspective between tort and criminal law give rise to a difference in metaphor use between the two law areas, and also in the key source domains used? 2. Does a difference in the role of the judiciary and the justification of decisions between the Dutch and the English Supreme Court become apparent in language, thus showing a difference in metaphor use between the Dutch and English rulings?","['Figurative Language', 'Courts', 'Criminal Law and Tort Law']"

The Ultimate Contact Zone: Addressing Shared Human Concerns in Modern Art Museums and Biennials Curatorial Practice,"Battaglia, Giulia","['Leigh, Nana']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"The age of globalisation has determined the shrinking of geographical distances and the emergence of mass mobility. People from diverse cultures now cohabit the same geographical areas which often leads to conflicts stemming from fear of cultural diversity. In this respect, the role of modern art museums and biennials concerning the staging of intercultural encounters leading to mutual understanding is key. In this research, Pratt's and Clifford's theories on the contact zone will be combined with Bennett's notion of the exhibitionary complex and Witcomb's theories on the importance of addressing shared human concerns in current curatorial practice to instill empathic responses in the audiences face the realisation that despite cultural diversities, humans worldwide also share similar traits. Curatorial practice focussed on equally highlighting cultural similarities and differences and being more inclusive of the world’s artistic production, it is argued, can lead to the establishment of what can be defined the ultimate contact zone - a space of fruitful intercultural encounters in which diverse communities meet on equal power relations, discover each other, and ultimately re-shape their preconceptions around the surrounding world and the people inhabiting it. Specifically, the ultimate contact zone theory will be here applied to the famous exhibition The Family of Man, held at the MoMA in 1955 and now permanently installed at Clervaux Castle in Luxembourg, and the more recent Self-Portrait as the Billy Goat and The End of Love, held at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. The discussion will then move to biennial curatorial practice with a focus on the 1989 3rd Havana Bienal Tradition and Contemporaneity and the 57th Venice Biennale Viva Arte Viva.","['contact zone', 'modern art museums', 'contemporary art', 'Venice Biennale', 'Habana Bienal', 'globalisation', 'multiculturalism', 'curatorial practice', 'shared human concerns', 'empathy', 'exhibitionary complex']"

#One big lie,"Meinema, Beitske","['Bellucci, Stefano']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The year 2010 marks the beginning of a series of protests and uprisings in North Africa, which sparked a revolution that Western media would soon refer to as “The Arab Spring Uprisings”. The protests are mostly conducted by the youth of the MENA region who are discontent with the government. This generation realizes that due to unemployment, high inflation, poverty, human rights abuses and corruption they are caught in a vacuum, with no bright future with progress and evolution of their country and blame this on the Arab dictators. Tunisia and Morocco both experienced the Arab Spring differently in terms of violence by the state, but in both countries the protests are effective and big changes are promised. In Tunisia the Ben Ali Presidency is overthrown, while in Morocco King Mohammed VI remains king. Also, in both countries the desired democracy is established and democratic elections take place. However, the circumstances do not really change the civil lives. Unemployment remains a problem, police violence still occurs, the freedom and human rights are still violated and the rule of law does not change the situation in favour of the community. The frustrated youth seeks new ways to clear the void in their lives. In the same time period, the Islamic State is upcoming and recruits these frustrated youngsters. Especially Tunisian youngsters are susceptible for the promises of the Islamic State, as they are promised a future, with money, women and weapons. The official count of Tunisian foreign fighters is 6.000, while Morocco remains at the bottom of the list of foreign fighters, supplying officially 1.200 foreign fighters. The question is why there is such a big difference in number of supplied foreign fighters between these two countries. Trying to find an answer to this question this thesis inquires if the Arab Spring is the underlying cause. Therefore, this thesis’ research question is How have the results of the Arab Spring caused the extreme flow of frustrated Tunisian youth to the Islamic State, while a similar country as Morocco remains at the bottom of the list of Islamic State’s foreign fighters? The frustration-aggression theory of John Dollard and Robert E. Miller and colleagues is applied to explain the incentive of young Tunisians and Moroccans to go the Islamic State. By analysing the contemporary situation in Tunisia and Morocco in terms of unemployment, state repression and the influence of Saudi Arabia, this thesis concludes that the Arab Spring is the driver for the frustration amongst the youth, leading up to expression of aggression, wherefore the Islamic State provides space to utter it. Tunisia’s institutional failure created by the Arab Spring drives Tunisian youngsters frustrated and they are now either planning new uprisings, or are leaving for the Islamic State. The government is still dealing with the collapse of the institutions, therefore is not able to handle the frustrated youth. Morocco is not left in institutional chaos and can now focus on the terrorist threat, with a strong security system. It can brace the country against the Islamic State. According to this thesis, this is what makes the difference between the foreign fighters’ amount of Tunisia and Morocco.","['Foreign Fighters', 'Islamic State', 'Tunisia', 'Morocco', 'Arab Spring', 'Frustration-Aggression Theory']"
"""Unconquered still"": the continuation and dissemination of Malcolm X’s story through artistic appropriation in Ayman Yossri’s Subtitles series","Tromp, Kasper","['Westgeest, Helen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the appropriative strategy of the Saudi Arabian artist Ayman Yossri, as he takes print screens from Spike Lee's film Malcolm X (1992). The resulting prints depict frozen cinematic images overlaid by Arabic subtitles which, taken out of the linear narrative of the film, produce meaning in alternative ways, depending on the new cultural contexts in which they are placed, and the interpretive mind of the viewer. Recognizing the ability of appropriations to temporally continue existing narratives, and to spatially disseminate them across cultures, this thesis examines what current significance Yossri's work establishes for the historical personality Malcolm X, and the intercultural implications of his story traveling from the Unites States to Saudi Arabia. The first question is explored through the theoretical lenses of art and agency (Alfred Gell) and art as counter-hegemonic intervention (Chantal Mouffe), in order to recontextualize Malcolm X's legacy of political activism in the contemporary world, and to examine how it uses this legacy in order to critique current political orders. The second question approaches Yossri's works as artefacts created from intercultural processes, and exhibited in multicultural contexts.

The Perception and Expression of Vietnamese Cultural Heritage by French Viet Kieu Visual Artists in Saigon,"Patoux, Charlotte","['Paskaleva, Elena']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The main theme of the research consists in finding how multicultural identities of diasporic return migrants are actualized and expressed. Acknowledging the discursive nature of heritage, we can understand story-telling as a means to define one’s cultural identity. However, as language is tied to culture, we might consider a more universal form of expression that transcends cultural categorization to cease the multi-faceted and fluid identity of returnees. The following research attempts to establish art and visual representation as individual conscious or unconscious means of expression of cultural identity. This was illustrated on the hand of a case-study focused on a specific group of diasporic return migrants in Vietnam: the French Vietnamese returnee artists of Saigon . It was based on the analysis of the works of four French Vietnamese artists, locally defined as French “Viet Kieu” (“Overseas Vietnamese” in English): Sandrine Llouquet, Bao Vuong, Mai-Loan Tu and Florian Nguyen. In the first instance, the research process drew a contextual framework of Vietnamese society in parallel with the development of the Saigonese contemporary art scene to understand the experiences of the artists reported in their biographies in order to underline their relationship to Vietnamese heritage. In the second instance, ethnographic methods combined with their interpretive biographies informed an iconological study of their artistic production that identified potential expressions of their Vietnamese heritage in their work. Finally, the two approaches were combined in a synthetic exercise that helped drawing conclusions on the transmission of Vietnamese heritage and the general definition of the artists’ cultural heritage and identity.","['Cultural heritage', 'Viet Kieu', 'Cultural identity', 'French Vietnamese contemporary artists', 'Contemporary art in Saigon', 'French Viet Kieu artists', 'diasporic return migrants', 'returnees', 'Vietnam']"

Recent exhibition makings around the world have attempted to go beyond this gender norm and coincide with the latest LGBTIQ social rights movements. This thesis asks how LGBTIQ-theme exhibitions can challenge the normalized gender and sexuality in the museum. It addresses this question by proposing a theoretical framework of queer curating based on Judith Butler’s performativity theory and aims to rethink ways of exhibition display. Bringing queer theory into curatorial practice, the thesis explores the critical intervention of the Schwules Museum*(the Gay Museum* in Berlin) and examines how the curators reflect on displaying approaches in exhibition space. To rethink human sexualities in a more nuanced way, critical exhibition makings not only display diverse sexualities but also reveal the institutional neglect of non-conforming gender subjects and open up possibilities of performing diverse sexualities in museums.","['Queer Curating', 'Performativity', 'Institutional Critique', 'Gender and Sexuality in Museum', 'Homosexuality_ies', 'Odarodle', 'Schwules Museum*']"

This research explores and explains why the private sector participates in crisis response data collaboratives. Through secondary literature analysis, and primary survey and interview analysis of three case studies, this research provides new insights into data collaborative objectives, the private sector’s activities, the incentives and risks these collaboratives present for the private sector, and how it mitigates such risks. The research concludes that the private sector enters crisis response data collaboratives to help the public sector address one or more of its obstacles to creating data-driven solutions to societal problems, and occasionally to achieve additional objectives for the public good. Although the private sector is motivated by various incentives, sufficient mitigation of presented risks, especially risks to data subjects’ privacy and security, is a precondition to joining a crisis response data collaborative.","['private', 'public', 'organisations', 'crisis response', 'data collaborative', 'incentives', 'risks', 'data', 'humanitarian', 'emergencies']"

The territorial claims concerning South China Sea by four ASEAN countries (Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Philippines and Viet Nam) against China remains the most pressing challenge for the region up to the present day. While ASEAN has taken up the issue under its multilateral framework in which ASEAN and China have been working towards a code of conduct in South China Sea, it is found that ASEAN itself is inconsistent in its position when it comes to South China Sea as evident in its political stance through its annual statement and communique. Such inconsistency is in line with various critics on ASEAN’s informal and weak institutionalisation due to its lack of sense of regional belonging. As ASEAN itself has repeatedly emphasises the need of ASEAN centrality in regional and international set up, the foresaid issue is inarguably a testament to ASEAN centrality. Taking into account that the conduct of ASEAN depends very much on its annually rotated chairmanship, in which the chair has the responsibility to ensure ASEAN centrality, this thesis aims to investigate how a country’s national identity affect its regional identity under ASEAN’s regionalism with regard to the South China Sea issue through ASEAN chairmanship. To this end, this thesis investigates how Myanmar, Malaysia and Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), as ASEAN chairs in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, led ASEAN in achieving a common position on South China Sea and how prominent are their national identities in their undertakings.","['ASEAN', 'centrality', 'chairmanship', 'Lao PDR', 'Malaysia', 'Myanmar', 'South China Sea']"

The Anti-Corruption Discourse on State Media: Legitimating the CCP,"Reid, Saki","['Creemers, Rogier']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since January 2013, Xi Jinping has launched a sustained high profile anti-corruption campaign that has targeted Tigers (senior officials) and Flies (rank and file cadres). The thesis uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to look at the ways in which corruption is defined and explained in state media discourse. As the anti-corruption drive is aimed at Party members, the media on corruption is directly involved in the process of delegitimation of a portion of its members. Within this process, the Party launched a public relations campaign in order to counter the impact of the exposure of corruption cases at all levels of the Party and the government body, in order to re-legitimise the political authority of the Party. The thesis analyses a total of 145 corruption articles on Xinhua News from the years 2013-2016. It shows how the Party legitimises itself in four stages: the first and second, legitimating Xi Jinping as the moral authority and the CDIC as the “enforcer” of legitimate behaviour; the third stage, delegitimizing a portion of the Party as immoral through interlacing corruption narratives with discourses on moral values and public welfare; and the fourth, legitimation of the Party and the political system, through a comparison with corruption in other countries.","['Anti-Corruption', 'Legitimation', 'Discourse']"
"The Dark Classroom: An Analysis of Gothic and Supernatural Elements as Educational Tools in The Picture of Dorian Gray, Macbeth, and The Scarlet Letter","Kosten, Natasja","['Leeuwen, Evert Jan van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2017 Noordhoff Uitgeverij BV published a set of “Blackbird Classics” for the following academic year which included Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), William Shakespeare’s Macbeth (1606), and Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter (1850). What is so telling about this set is that all three of these works are associated with the Gothic genre through similar tropes and themes. While finding Shakespeare in this set might raise a few questions, Desmet and Williams explain that to fully understand the Gothic it is important to recognise the genre’s “Shakespearean Origins” (2). Intrigued, I looked further into the publishing history of the Blackbirds and found many instances of Gothic and supernatural novels being published for high-school students. The list included many editions of The Picture of Dorian Gray, several books by Susan Hill, who wrote The Woman in Black (1983), and many other modern Gothics, and a simplified version of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde adapted to be understandable for a younger reading audience. This discovery led me to ask the question what the appeal is of such works for the high-school classroom. Why does the main publisher of educational material for Dutch high schools persistently turn to Gothic classics and other dark supernatural fictions as teaching texts? What follows is a critical examination of what the genre of the Gothic, and specifically the three texts published for 2017 by Noordhoff, have to offer literary education in Dutch high-schools.","['Gothic fiction', 'teaching', 'Hawthorne', 'Shakespeare', 'Wilde', 'supernatural']"

Spanish “Recovery of Historical Memory” Organizations As “Pressure Groups”,"IJsenbrand, Birger Eerke Wessel","['Steen, Bart van der']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines how contemporary Spanish “Recovery of Historical Memory” have acted as “pressure groups” in their quest to gain recognition for approximately 30.000 Republicans that died of Francoist violence and who are buried in hundreds of mass graves throughout Spain until today. In order to do so, this work performs a case study analysis of two Spanish “Recovery of Historical Memory” organizations, ARMH and Foro, and examines what activities these associations have carried out between their emergence in 2000 and 2007, when Spain implemented a Historical Memory law. The information in this thesis is based on secondary literature, primary sources, Spanish blogposts by members of both ARMH and Foro on their official websites respectively and interviews that the author has conducted with association members from ARMH in Spanish. The main argument that will be put forth, is that there have been four ways through which the associations have acted as “pressure groups” and have tried to gain public recognition for the Republican dead: (1) via the use of media campaigns, (2) by organizing protests, (3) by means of popular participation in national politics and (4) via collaboration with international organizations. In addition to this, this thesis argues that ARMH has been the most successful in influencing the Spanish government, by pressuring Madrid through their collaboration with international organizations. Moreover, this thesis contributes to two main bodies of scholarly literature: “pressure groups” and “Recovery of Historical Memory” literature since it provides new insights in how “Recovery of Historical Memory” organizations act as “pressure groups”, and it diversifies the existing scholarship that deals with these “Recovery of Historical Memory” organizations by considering both ARMH and Foro.","['Spain', 'Collective Memory', 'Spanish Civil War', 'Recovery of Historical Memory', 'Exhumation Organizations', 'Franco', 'Pressure Groups', 'Political Science']"

European Defense Integration and Member-State Neutrality after the Ukraine Crisis,"Mehrer, Reyndert","['Viceré, Maria Giulia']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"While NATO has served as Europe’s main security provider for decades, the European Union is developing its own role as an international security actor. This role of the EU has become especially relevant after the Ukraine Crisis, which increased tensions between the EU and Russia. Sweden and Finland, two member-states of the EU, fear for additional Russian hostilities; they seek more security after the Ukraine Crisis. However, due to their neutrality policies, they are not members of NATO. While Sweden and Finland now have a higher demand for security, they cannot turn to NATO in order to attain it. This research aims to find out whether Sweden and Finland therefore look more to the EU for their security by approaching the following question: to what extent have Sweden and Finland become more in favor of European defense integration after the Ukraine Crisis? Sweden and Finland will be analyzed separately. To find out what their preferences towards EU defense integration are, the following variables will be studied: government reports ; statements made by government officials ; expenditure on common EU defense capabilities ; and total defense expenditure. The findings before the Ukraine Crisis will be compared to the findings after the Ukraine Crisis, so that a comparison can be made. In this way, conclusions can be drawn as to whether or not the countries became more in favor of EU defense integration after the Ukraine Crisis. To explain the findings, a cost-benefit analysis will be made based on the theory of rational choice institutionalism.","['European Defense Integration', 'Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP)', 'Ukraine Crisis', 'Neutrality', 'Swedish security', 'Finnish security']"
Democratization and Minority Rights Protection: The Case of the Rohingya Minority in Myanmar,"Jong, Kelly de","['Shidiq, R.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Democratization of previously closed states is often lauded; however, it is an unstable process at the same time. This is also the case for Myanmar, especially for the Rohingya minority group that reside in the Northern Rakhine state. In the fall of 2017, they were the victims of the biggest persecution of a minority group in the world in which 700.000 people fled over the border to Bangladesh, and an unknown number became internally displaced. This heavy persecution interferes with the period of democratization, something that is striking considering the emphasize on values such as freedom and equality in democracy. In my thesis, the research question will be: Does democratization help in protecting minority rights in Myanmar? It is argued that the absence of power sharing arrangements in Myanmar politics led to the persecution of the Rohingya minority. After the research, it could be concluded that the power sharing arrangements are not completely missing, yet, even the arrangements that are in place are not applicable to the Rohingya. The Rohingya minority became victim of persecution because there were no power sharing arrangements for them in specific that could give them a voice in politics and a political identity in order to mitigate the ethnic tensions.","['Minority', 'Rohingya', 'Myanmar', 'Democratization']"

The Arctic in Contemporary Russian Politics: How the Putin Regime Uses the Arctic to Support its Fragile Legitimacy and Strengthen Russia’s National Identity,"Keller, Jan","['Wilbrink, Hans']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines what role the Arctic plays in contemporary Russian politics. For this purpose, a thorough analysis of the Russian domestic discourse on the Arctic region is conducted. The discourse analysis covers the period 2007-2018 and focuses on a few key figures who have arguably a significant impact on the Arctic discourse due to their centrality in Russian politics. The analysis shows that the individual narratives on the Arctic strengthen Russian national identity by promoting notions of foreign encirclement and the country’s exceptionalism and great power identity. Moreover, the discourse on the Arctic is provided with a temporal and overall coherence by selectively manipulating historical memory and drawing on a wide range of symbolic actions. In the second part of the paper the findings from the analysis are placed within the wider Russian political context. Thereby, it is shown that the Arctic discourse is not an isolated phenomenon, but that it is representative of a general shift towards an increasingly nationalist and patriotic rhetoric during Putin’s third term in office. It is argued that by creating a coherent and compelling national identity, the Putin regime seeks to buttress its fragile legitimacy. These findings imply that foreign observers and representatives need to be aware of Russian domestic political developments in order to properly assess Russia’s actions and interests in the Arctic region.","['Russia', 'Arctic', 'national identity', 'legitimacy', 'Putin regime', 'discourse analysis', 'patriotism']"

Prohibited to conduct offensive operations, the SDF has developed an image which portrays it not as a fighting force but rather as a supportive one, with disaster relief being one of its main roles. Some scholars question whether the SDF does or does not violate the ‘war potential’ prohibition. Even though there has been research on the legitimacy issue, there has yet to be a study on the emphasis of the disaster relief function of the SDF by the government. In this thesis, I argue that the disaster relief in Defence White Papers has been emphasized through a content analysis. Public opinion polls show that, contrary to popular believe, there has not been an increase in the willingness of the Japanese public to let the SDF play a bigger role in military operations. One way to interpret these outcomes is that the government is putting emphasis on the disaster relief function of the SDF in order to legitimize the SDF’s existence and gradually prepare the Japanese public for a more offensive role. However, this has not yet helped convince the public that the SDF should get more involved in military operations, which becomes clear when examining public opinion on the SDF Iraq dispatch.",['SDF and Legitimacy']
Buen Vivir vs. The Paris Agreement: A comparative analysis in Ecuador's development towards sustainability,"Sarijoen, Justin","['Valdivia Rivera, S.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The rise of awareness on environmental issues has led to a shift from traditional development towards sustainable development, which includes environmentalism. Sustainable development has been highly debated among countries at several UN conferences dating back to the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) in 1992. The most recent global agreement is embodied in the Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, which is a climate agreement within the framework of sustainable development. However, the main problem of global treaties is that it is hard to satisfy all parties. The Paris Agreement includes developed and developing countries, which both have different concerns and ideas on development in general. Consequently, developing countries have come up with their own local alternatives towards sustainable development for instance Buen Vivir in Ecuador. Buen Vivir, often translated as ‘Good Life’ in English, is an Ecuadorian form of eco-politics included in Ecuador’s constitution in 2008, based on the indigenous concept of Sumak Kawsay. This paper will make a comparative analysis between the global approach (the Paris Agreement) and the local approach (Buen Vivir) in order to examine which of the two alternatives form a more feasible way for Ecuador towards sustainable development. The paper concludes that even though both approaches have their flaws, the local approach is more in line with the objectives of sustainable development in the case of Ecuador.","['Sustainable Development', 'Eco-politics', 'Dependency Theory', 'Ecuador', 'Paris Agreement', 'Buen Vivir']"
A Language in Danger of Extinction: Linguistic Revitalisation Efforts in the Case of Mapudungun in Chile,"Kuipers, Stijn","['Alves Vieira, Eduardo']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Mapuche are the largest indigenous community in Chile and they speak their own language, Mapudungun. Unfortunately, over the course of history, the Mapuche have experienced many hardships, especially in relation to the Chilean state. One of these hardships is the gradual loss of their language in favour of Spanish. This development can be seen through the fact that younger generations stop to speak the language and that Spanish is taking over the traditional use of Mapudungun in family affairs and ceremonial situations. Therefore, and in order to compensate for the historical debt that the Chilean state has with the Mapuche, the government implemented a Bilingual Intercultural Education Programme in 1996. Additionally, this is a good example of a method of revitalisation, which could help reverse the existing language shift. However, the programme in its current state has a lot of deficiencies, making it unsuccessful in achieving its objective. Consequently, this thesis will argue for the improvement of the programme, in order to increase its contribution in revitalising Mapudungun and to prevent the possible extinction of the language. The previous is important in the scope of the demands for rights of self-determination for which the Mapuche have struggled throughout history.","['Mapuche', 'Mapudungun', 'Language policy', 'Chile', 'Indigenous language', 'Language revitalisation', 'Indigenous rights', 'Language shift', 'Bilingual education', 'Intercultural bilingual education']"

Rethinking Integration: Lessons Learned From a Dutch Neighborhood Initiative,"Pank, Julia Friederike","['Naeff, Judith']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"With the aim of presenting a constructive criticism on the current integration discourse in the Netherlands, this thesis explores the practices and internal narratives of a neighborhood initiative in the Schilderswijk, Den Haag based on a qualitative study conducted in 2016. Neighborhood initiatives are literally and figuratively situated at the junctions of society, where intrasocietal borderlines of all sorts can meet and merge. Following an exposition of recent Dutch integration policies and a critique of the discourse underlying them, the ways in which this neighborhood initiative allows for integration to be lived and understood in confrontation with hegemonic structures are investigated, yielding impulses for rethinking notions of integration, society, and citizenship. Connecting the concepts of microemancipation and thirdspace to integration illuminates how integration is enacted in juxtaposition to dominant discursive representations and structures, and shows how a vigilant observation of bottom-up practices can re-inform and enrich the integration discourse. The inclusion of grassroots approaches is a necessary step towards the reconfiguration of thinking patterns and practices which currently impede real progression of public and policy debates about integration and societal cohesion. For this reason, the translation of grassroots approaches into theoretical conceptualizations and policy recommendations forms the central aim and contribution of this article, as it seeks to make them visible to and available for academic and political discourse.","['Integration Discourse', 'Thirdspace', 'Participation Society']"

Bush and the presidency of Barack Obama. To this end, literature has been reviewed that focused on establishing whether a discursive transformation had occurred between both presidencies. In this review, the theory of Foucault regarding discursive transformation appeared to reoccur. Thus, in the following chapter the theory of Foucault regarding discourse was discussed. Based on this theory, it was established that to analyze the presidential discourse, predicates in presidential speeches would be analyzed. The ensuing analytical chapters, consequently, focused on the reproduction of the concept terrorism through analyzing statements regarding the cause, aim and actors of terrorism and through relating these statement to statements regarding foreign policy during the presidency of George W. Bush and the presidency of Barack Obama and on comparing and contrasting the reproduction of the concept terrorism during both presidencies. Overall, the analysis appeared to indicate that while linguistically the style of the presidents varied while discussing the concept terrorism, the discursively constructed message did not change.","['Terrorism', 'Discourse', 'United States', 'George W.

Foreign relations between these two nations were of great importance, as was understanding them from their starting point until the end of the Cold War. The U.S., motivated by an 'us vs. them' dichotomy based on a great sense of mistrust and rivalry, employed various techniques to gather intelligence about their adversary, as did the Soviet Union. Espionage was one of these techniques. Despite its secretive nature, from time to time the American public found out about cases of espionage through the media. These cases oftentimes turned into scandals and impacted American society in various ways. For this thesis three cases were discussed that occurred at different times during the Cold War. The purpose of these cases of espionage is to find out how they were framed in the media and government propaganda in order for the Americans to influence foreign relations between them and the Soviets throughout the Cold War.","['Cold War', 'Espionage', 'Foreign Relations', 'United States', 'Soviet Union', 'Propaganda', 'Media']"

However, Timor Leste is up until this day, dealing with the aftermath of this cruel period and finds itself underdeveloped with a dysfunctional government. This has become evident when in 2006 new conflicts emerged between East and West Timor Leste about political and social disagreements. Coping mechanisms to deal with the traumas experienced by the Timorese people are mostly found in artistic outlets, such as martial arts, dance, music, and poetry. But especially in street art. For the younger generations of Timor Leste in particular, street art is very important, as it is a perfect way to tell their story and to show what their future hopes and aspirations are for their country. This thesis will focus and analyze the role of political street art and its significance in portraying these political and social struggles of the Timor Leste’s society after independence in 2002.","['Street Art', 'Political Art', 'Timor Leste', 'Conflict', 'Post-independence']"

Historical Revisionism in Modern Russian Cinema,"Willemsen, Tom","['David, M.E.L.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The question of historical revisionism has long been a subject of discussion especially during the Soviet period of Russian history. In recent years, after the Russian annexation of Crimea and the civil war that is raging in the eastern parts of Ukraine, the issue has gained new interest. Within the cultural domain, a reflection of the politics of the Russian government can be perceived. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the presence of historical revisionism in the cinema of modern day Russia. Film has risen to be one of the leading art forms of the last century, in terms of its influence and popularity, and has remained this position until the present day. This paper establishes the presence of historical revisionism in of two recently produced Russian films, and indicates elements of revisionism in the other. Purposeful falsification of historical facts and the reinforcements of false narratives are shown to serve the political goals of the Kremlin, and are designed to influence public opinion domestically and abroad. This sadly indicates a broader problem in the Russian film industry, a fact that may warrant the need to further study and test the narratives that are presented to us by Russian film.","['Historical revisionism', 'cinema', 'russia', 'culture', 'politics', 'identity', 'imperialism']"

What are the goals and limitations of Cool Japan and how do case studies of former occupied countries show us its ability to succeed in nation-branding?,"Boesrie, Fitrie","['Wakefield, Bryce']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Abstract In the recent years Japanese pop culture has become an essential medium in the nation-branding strategy “Cool Japan”. The government has invested in Cool Japan especially in the Asian region as there are still lingering tensions over Japan’s imperial past. This thesis explores how popular culture is used in nation-branding strategy in two countries that were occupied by Japan during the Second World War, Indonesia and South-Korea. How Japan implements nation-branding in South Korea and Indonesia and whether Japan uses a specific approach with consideration to historical memory and if a pattern can be distinguished is still under-examined, and therefore wishes to contribute to this discussion. This research uses policy analysis to assess the Cool Japan policy approach in South Korea and Indonesia. As Cool Japan is largely reliant on soft power, this study also tests Joseph S. Nye’s theory of soft power as a general theory applicable to Japan. My findings demonstrate that the ideal conditions for nation-branding strategy to work, depend on how the countries in question (South Korea and Indonesia) view the country that implements nation-branding(Japan). Therefore,Cool Japan nation-branding can only succeed in countries that have a relatively positive image of Japan.","['Nation-branding', 'Cool Japan', 'South Korea', 'Indonesia', 'Policy analysis']"

However, there remain cases of ethnic outbursts and minority oppression in contemporary Myanmar.This thesis will examine to what extent the current situation regarding minority oppression and ongoing ethnic conflict reflects its complex political climate of authoritarian rule and the new political transition, democratization. British colonial rule left the modern nation faced with challenges of creating unity within an ethnically diverse population arbitrary borders. Followed by decades of military rule, the imagining of a Burmese nation at the cost of ethnic minority identities left its mark on the current political climate. An extensive literary analysis reveals that the current situation regarding ethnic tensions and minority oppression in contemporary Myanmar is a reflection of its (post-)colonial history, complex political climate, and the democratization process. The case study of the Karen farmer suggests an economical relevance in the debate on democratization and ethnic minority issues.","['arbitrary borders', 'imagined community', 'democratization', 'authoritarian rule', 'ethnic tensions', 'ethnic violence', 'minority oppression']"

In Tactical Retreat: Assessing The Effectiveness Of The EU’s Withdrawal Of The GSP+ From Sri Lanka To Promote Human Rights,"Bartlett, Sandesh","['Steen, Bart van der']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In August 2010, The European Union (EU) withdrew its preferential trade agreement GSP+ from the island nation of Sri Lanka that was recovering from a long drawn civil war. The grounds for the withdrawal was cited to be Sri Lankan Government's poor human rights record in the latter stages of the war which had garnered international outcry. The ad hoc withdrawal of the scheme which was yoked to the Sri Lankan economy was damaging to the Sri Lankan economy and in particular its Ready-Made-Garment (RMG) industry that is central to povery alleviation in rural sectors of the country. In addition to the Sri Lankan Government was defiant of the EU's verdict and is believed to have made very little change. It is for this reason scholars argue that while the Human Rights concerns of the conflict were pressing, the objective of the EU withdrawal was unclear granted it achieved very little of its desired effect. Other writers have described it as 'democracy building' and 'economic terrorism' on the part of the EU. The objective of this research is to assess the effectiveness of the EU's withdrawal of GSP+ from the Sri Lankan economy and draw a conclusion on which side of the scholarly debate is more plausible.","['Economics', 'Sri Lanka', 'European Union', 'EU', 'GSP', 'GSP+', 'Human Rights', 'Humanitarian Intervention', 'Democracy', 'Preferential Trade Agreement']"

The role of cuteness in Japanese girl groups,"Nguyen, Huu Thong","['Mueller, Doreen']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"There seems to be an obsession with cuteness in the Japanese society as it is used to sell everything. The Japanese music industry too seems to emphasize on cuteness especially on their female idols and they are using cuteness to their advantage. The role of cuteness in the Japanese girl groups has three aspects that are all related to each other. First of all, it is entirely commercial. They use cuteness as their group's concept to establish a fan base that will support them. This means that as they get more popular they get offers to act and/or model for a certain brands. In other words, the more fans are willing to consume the girl groups, the more they will earn. Secondly, cuteness is just a group's concept which means that the group's cuteness is simply an performance of being an idol. Cuteness has always been associated with femininity and their performance of cuteness is thus them performing their socially constructed gender roles to appeal to their male fans. This is only reinforced in the way they dress, talk and sing. It is part of a marketing strategy set up by their company. Lastly, cuteness could be used to escape reality. By consuming cuteness people try to breakout from their constructed gender roles. Both the fans and the female idols share the same sentiment. Consumption of girl groups is like a hobby for many fans. They do not have to think about their duties and obligations in real life and their gender roles. The female idols too are challenging their predestined role that society have given them and take matter in their own hand as they are the one that are earning an income. Female idols are not passive or submissive, but have their own agency in the Japanese music industry.","['J-pop', 'cuteness', 'gender', 'femininity']"
Pacification program in the Brazilian favelas; the effects of ‘Mano Dura’ policy on citizen (in)security,"Tan, Julian","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The pacification program that was initiated in the city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil prior to the World Cup 2014 got global media coverage due to the high amount of violence that come with it. The goal of the program is to make the favelas of Rio de Janeiro an safer living environment, where there would be no more criminal violence and drug-related activities. These poor neighborhoods would be safe and secure living environments, under the control of local police units, instead of criminal gangs. Unfortunately, the high amount of crime and violence is still present in these favelas and the pacification program appeared to have done more damage than good. The police and military units used extremely violent measures to control these criminal gangs, which created a lot of anger towards them by the society. Thereby, it led to an increasing distrust between the citizens and governmental agencies. Thereby, citizens of all social classes joint forces in order to protest against the government and the pacification program. The results suggest that the Brazilian government took the wrong policy by choosing to solve violence with violence. With the program existing already for many years, nowadays the criminal gangs are still in control in large areas of the favelas and are willing to fight the police. The study supports the view that the government should take more peaceful methods, since these proof to be more effective and have a positive result. Whereas the more violent approach, by following the hard lined - “Mano Dura” strategy as other Latin American states did, leads to continuing violence and an failed attempt to resolve the problem.","['Mano Dura', 'insecurity', 'police']"

After Syria, it is the country with the largest amount of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the world. As recently as 2016, a Peace Agreement has been signed to end the civil war between Colombia’s government, various insurgent groups, and the paramilitaries. Therefore, effective ODA is now more vital than ever to rebuild the country and make sure everyone gets equal opportunities to improve themselves and their livelihoods.

As a result, the research aims to investigate why the German economy and its industrial sector is a strategically important investment channel for Chinese companies on the basis of four identified hypotheses. The parameters for gauging the aforesaid framework would include technological know-how, credit risk, macroeconomic synergies, and ease of conducting business over a selected sample of European case studies in juxtaposition with Germany’s.

The influence of marianismo and machismo on the position of women in society in Mexico,"Gerritsen, Jodie","['Crevels, Mily']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This Bachelor’s thesis analyzes the influence of the ideologies marianismo and machismo on society in Mexico. By analyzing the country’s past, from pre-Hispanic times until after the conquest, it is safe to say that the past continues to have a significant influence on present day Mexico. Marianismo and machismo were used by the Spaniards, as tools for controlling the indigenous people of Mexico, and this has led to the subordinate social position of women. As marianismo and machismo continue to be deeply embedded in Mexican culture, it is important to detect the main institutions that perpetuate these traditions, and cause them to live on in the present. Even though we can see the presence of marianismo and machismo throughout the whole of Mexican society, this work will focus on the economic position and political participation of women. Generally speaking, the family can be considered the main institution that keeps these ideologies alive, doing so by means of traditional norms and values. This thesis will show that, besides the impact on the family unit, marianismo and machismo also have significant effects on the labor market and the political sphere.",

Shifting Attitudes within the Chinese State-Owned Media: Who is the Real Hawk?,"Grunsven, Donna van","['Black, Lindsay']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"State-owned media serve as important propaganda tools for the Chinese Communist Party. The propaganda of today is represented through media framing and influence not only public opinion, but also promote the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. However, a worrisome trend has surfaced, namely the use of sensationalism by the state-owned media to frame political events. Even though many studies have shown interest in the media organs of the Chinese government, few studies have focused on the effect it has on Sino-Japanese relations and none have done a thorough media analysis focusing on China’s side. In addition, not much research has been conducted in examining Japanese Prime Shinzo Abe in the Chinese media. This thesis therefore examines two contrasting media reactions in response to Japanese Prime Minister Abe’s behavior, namely the exaggerated negative coverage in 2015 and the subsequent sudden positive coverage in 2017. The main method used in this thesis is the appliance of qualitative frame analysis on selected state-owned media newspaper articles. This will not only observe the framing the Chinese government does, but will also present China’s state-owned media as highly unpredictable. This thesis concludes that the negative frame of 2015 changed by the end of 2017 to a more positive frame of Abe. The Chinese public responded accordingly to this, having a worse view on Japan in 2015, but a better view by the end of 2017. The state-owned Chinese media, therefore, still serve as powerful tools of propaganda for the CCP.","['Sino-Japanese relations', 'Abe Shinzo', 'Chinese state-owned media', 'Frame analysis', 'China', 'Japan']"

Since the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002, a hot topic under debate concerns its usefulness for international individual prosecution. The jurisdiction of the ICC consists of specific offence crimes namely, the prosecution of individuals committing genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression. Supporters in favor of the debate argue that the ICC serves as a useful tool and thus is accountable for creating coherence in terms of justice, peace and stability. In contrast, challengers do not recognize the ICC as a useful institute to achieve more order and to realize effective prosecution of individuals worldwide. As one of the challengers, the United States decided not to ratify the established ICC in its current structure. The US accuses the ICC of being a bearer to disorder in international prosecution of individuals. Moreover, the legitimacy of the ICC remains questioned and therefore, its sustainability. For a significant part, the sustainability of the ICC seems dependent on consent of its support and its legitimacy.","['United States', 'Legitimacy', 'ICC', 'International Criminal Justice', 'International Law', 'Political Science']"

It looks sepcifically at the case of the Kenyan electoral violence in 2007 and early 2008 and the ways in which internally displaced persons (IDPs) were affected. To determine such effects, the thesis observes Kenya's history with the interaction between ethnicity and politics and considers how the population is mobilised based on ethnic affiliations. It analyses how specific push and pull factors for displacement fall into several theories of migration causes, while simultaneously considering the roles of both the domestic and international community and their responses to the crisis. It argues throughout how the disadvantage of IDPs is maintained through the discourse on internal displacement. In identifying the effects on IDPs as belonging to the realm of politics, culture, and economics, the thesis identifies long-standing factors such as ethnicity and land grievances as well as economic wellbeing and the discourse of displacement as the main effects on IDPs.","['Elections', 'Internal displacement', 'Theories of migration', 'Humanitarian intervention', 'Ethnicity in conflict']"

Turkey is actively contributing to the efforts to address many challenges that also effect Europe…Turkey is part and parcel of Europe and almost all European institutions. (MFA, 2018b, p. 1) In terms of the Middle East, the Turkish foreign policy summary notes Turkey’s position as part of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) as well as various ties, bilateral and collective, to countries in the Middle East. The emergence of strategic centrality as a pillar of Turkish foreign policy appears to date from the 2000 publication of Ahmet Davutoğlu’s Strategic Depth: Turkey’s International Position (Murinson, 2006). In this book, Davutoğlu, then a professor and subsequently to become both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister of Turkey, articulated what has since come to be called Neo-Ottomanism (Kraidy & Al-Ghazzi, 2013; Türkeş, 2016). The Ottoman Empire, which was formally replaced by the Republic of Turkey in 1923, possessed the “central geography” cited by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the “strategic depth” of Davutoğlu’s book. Despite the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the resulting Turkish state replicated some of the geographic and strategic dynamics of its predecessor, with its borders placed directly between the Middle East in the east and south, Russia in the north, and Greece and the Balkans in the west. The characteristics and direction of Turkish foreign policy can be examined not only by analysis of larger themes (such as Neo-Ottomanism) and documents (such as Strategic Depth), but also through a document analysis of official announcements made by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Such documents exist dating back to January, 2002, and, of the writing of this proposal, are current until January, 2018. These documents are of interest for a number of reasons. More importantly, the documents contain distinct eras in Turkish foreign policy. The documents made available on the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Website overlap with the Prime Ministerial rule of five people: Bülent Ecevit, Abdullah Gül, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Ahmet Davetoğlu, and Binali Yıldırım. Of these Prime Ministers, the latter four were connected with the Ak Party, but at different eras. Of the Ak Party-affiliated Prime Ministers of Turkey, Binali Yıldırım has the reputation of somewhat being Erdoğan’s personal assistant, whereas both Gül and Davetoğlu have reputations of being somewhat independent from Erdoğan (Cagatay, 2017). In addition, during the 16-year period covered by the Turkish documents, Turkey has had eight Foreign Ministers. Thus, an analysis of the official announcements made by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs can reveal changes in the orientation of Turkish policy over time. The objective of this empirical study is to provide such an analysis.","['EU', 'Turkey', 'Neo-Ottomanism']"
The Myth of the Black Athlete: Sports Commentary and its Influence on the Image of African Americans College Athletes.,"Quist, Dzifa","['Gageldonk, Maarten van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"College sports is a crucial element of American popular culture, and is often seen as a social institution that has transcended racial issues that are still very prevalent in American society. However, contrary to popular belief, the arena of sports still knows much racial prejudice. Stereotypical beliefs about Black Americans are reintroduced in the form of the Black athlete and through the media, these beliefs are further spread among the public. The image of the Black athlete as hyper masculine and athletically superior, while also being intellectually inferior, has its roots in historical stereotypical images of African American men that served to maintain the inferior status of African Americans in the United States. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative content analysis, the televised commentary of ten collegiate men’s basketball games was analyzed. By comparing the commentary regarding Black and White college athletes, it was found that the televised commentary made by sports announcers resembles many of the historical and stereotypical beliefs about Black men in general. Beliefs such as Black athletic superiority and White intellectual superiority are spread through these televised sporting events and display how racism is still a major issue in American sports.","['Race', 'Colorblind racism', 'College sports', 'Sports commentary', 'Racial stereotypes']"
Kurdish Identity Constructions In Iraq Since The First Gulf War (1991),"Hewitt, James","['Calculli, Marina']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis asks how Kurdish nationalist political parties in Iraqi-Kurdistan have attempted to construct and develop national identifications since 1991. It aims to show that the KDP and PUK have relegated the importance of primordial attachments in their attempts at building a “nation” and, instead, endeavoured to construct “Kurdistani” national identifications primarily founded on a sense of common history and civic rights. This thesis argues that such a construction is primarily grounded in political pragmatism. The ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq requires non-primordial identity markers to be formulated and promoted by the KDP and PUK to define their national identification and distinguish the Kurds of the KRG from “others”, thereby supporting claims for political autonomy. It is political calculations – both at the domestic and international levels – that have influenced top-down constructions of a “Kurdish nation” as distinct from two specific political “others”: i) Iraq under Baghdad’s government; and ii) Kurdish groups in Turkey, Iran and Syria. This was particularly crucial in the period following the 2003 US-led invasion, when Iraq began its transition from dictatorship to federal democracy, reinforcing KDP and PUK hegemony over the Kurdistan Region. Throughout this thesis, I highlight how KDP and PUK narratives of victimhood have underpinned the construction of Baghdad as the “unjust” and “threatening” other, whereas emphasis on civic values as allegedly embedded in the “Kurdistani identity” have distinguished them from other Kurds, in order to enhance relations with neighbouring states such as Turkey and Iran, and influential state actors such as the USA and EU members.","['Nationalism', 'Iraq', 'Kurdistan', 'Identity']"

De carrièremogelijkheden van vrouwen binnen grote Japanse bedrijven,"Lóczi, Réka","['Herber, E.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In Japan zijn er maatregelen genomen in het teken van het creëren van meer gendergelijkheid, zoals de de Equal Employment Opportunity Law (EEOL) . Ook bestaan er overheidsinitiatieven, bijvoorbeeld door het Gender Equality Bureau, om mannen te stimuleren om een actievere rol te spelen binnen het huishouden. Ondanks de wetten en initiatieven blijkt uit verschillende gendergelijkheidsindexen zoals de Gender Inequality Index door de VN en The Global Gender Gap Index door het World Economic Forum dat Japan laag scoort t.o.v. andere geïndustrialiseerde landen. Dit komt o.a. tot uiting in de verticale segregatie van mannen en vrouwen op de werkvloer, waarbij vrouwen vooral werkzaam zijn in de lagere rangen van de hiërarchie en het lage percentage vrouwen in leidinggevende functies. Tegen deze achtergrond zal ik in deze scriptie schrijven over de ongelijkheid tussen de carrièremogelijkheden van mannen en de carrièremogelijkheden van vrouwen binnen Japanse bedrijven met meer dan 300 werknemers. Er is veel eerder onderzoek naar dit onderwerp gedaan, maar dit is inmiddels verouderd, omdat dit onderzoek wat betreft de voortgang van zaken in veel gevallen is gebaseerd op oudere gegevens voor 2014. Mijn scriptie zal zich gaan richten op situaties zoals beschreven in eerder onderzoek, waarna ik op basis van gelijksoortige, meer recente enquêtes en gegevens zal onderzoeken of de carrièremogelijkheden van vrouwen binnen grote Japanse bedrijven zijn verbeterd, ja of nee, en waarom wel of niet.","['vrouwen', 'work-life-balance', 'genderongelijkheid', 'Japanse bedrijven']"

In order to maintain the status quo of the stability of their regime, the Chinese Communist Party ensures that, by issuing heavy guidelines, the online communities are unable to mobilize against the central government. In this thesis, I discussed the representation of the hashtag #十九大 by Weibo, in collaboration with the People’s Daily, during the 19th National Congress. I found the topic of this project to be of importance, since I consider online censorship in China to be necessary of researching on a case-to-case basis, to assess what instantiations of censorship practices we might find across China’s online spheres. This thesis used a comparative method, involving the hashtag page on Weibo and the storage database of censored posts on Freeweibo. I found out that not only the guidelines of the central government are to blame for the restriction of free speech, but also that the company Sina and a moral sense of self-censorship are important factors that play a role in the game.","['China', 'Censorship', 'Weibo', 'Social Media', '2017 National Congress', '十九大']"

Environment First: The relation between Latino environmental justice organizations and the Democratic Party,"Vorst, Naomi van de","['Gageldonk, Maarten van']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"For decades, poor communities of colour have been the victim of environmental inequalities such as dumped toxic waste, proximity of pollution-producing factories, and polluted drinking water. The Environmental Justice Movement resulted from these inequalities and gives coloured communities a platform to raise attention for environmental issues. One of these communities is the Latino community. Lack of communication, economic power, and language barriers, make this community one of the biggest subjects of environmental injustice. The Latino community is the fastest growing demographic group in the United States and therefore has a large impact on future national politics. Various studies show that, because of their cultural roots, Latinos perceive environmental issues as highly important. This has a significant impact on Latino voting behaviour. The 2008 presidential election was the first election where Latinos were regarded to have a big influence on the outcome, and hereby they were recognized as a separate and important part of the electorate. In this election, the majority of Latinos voted for the Democratic Party. California had a big influence on this election, as it had the highest number of Latinos, and the majority of these Latinos voted for the Democratic Party. Furthermore, in California, which has the highest number of environmental conflicts in the U.S., Latinos are actively involved in environmental justice organizations and grassroots communities. This thesis analyses whether the Environmental Justice Movement had an impact on Latino voting behaviour in California in the 2008 election. It finds that there is a historical connection between Latinos and the environment on the one hand, and Latinos and the Democratic Party on the other hand. The Democratic Party’s environmental friendly policies and attention to minority groups provide reasons for this. These theoretical findings are substantiated by the analyses of environmental justice organizations and grassroots communities in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The findings indicate that Latino environmental justice organizations were actively operating in California. Moreover, Latinos tended to vote above national average for the Democratic Party in the 2008 election. As a result, this thesis provides indications that the Environmental Justice Movement affected Latino voting behaviour towards the Democratic Party in the 2008 election.","['Latino', '2008 presidential election', 'Democratic Party', 'environment', 'Environmental Justice Movement', 'environmental justice organizations']"
How Effective is the Individual Mandate? A Mixed-Methods Policy Assessment on the Effectiveness of the Individual Mandate Under the Affordable Care Act,"Meinderts, Tom","['Regilme, Salvador']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Individual Mandate is a provision within the Affordable Care Act which makes it so, that if one does not have healthcare insurance, one would have to pay a penalty. Ever since its conception, the Individual Mandate has been a contentious and controversial topic, with many calling for a repeal. While the literature concerning the coverage expansion of the Affordable Care Act points out different problems within the act, the literature is generally positive about the increased coverage expansion caused by the act. The literature concerning the effectiveness of the Individual Mandate however, is scarce. Through both quantitative and qualitative research, this thesis examines the Individual Mandate in three ways in order to assess its effectiveness as a policy: Affordability, Health Outcomes and Insurance Customisation. Upon examining the effectiveness of the Individual Mandate in these three ways, it has become clear, that the Individual Mandate is an effective policy overall and specifically in terms of affordability and health outcomes, while its effect on insurance customisation is more contentious.","['Individual Mandate', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Obamacare', 'Health Policy', 'Policy Assessment', 'Affordability of Health Care', 'Health Outcomes', 'Insurance Customisation']"

Within this research, six propaganda posters were examined, along the lines of the importance of models for the CCP. The posters were meant to paint a positive picture on whatever the Party needed from the people, in order to mobilize them. The Party encouraged women to start working in labor fields traditionally occupied by men, because of labor forces, and propagated this as a means of achieving gender equality, while actually the opposite was achieved. The Party uses gender equality as a means to get people to do as it wanted, and this came to its climax during the Cultural Revolution, however the Party never made gender equality a real priority. Even though gender equality was never really established, propaganda posters did give women the believe that equality is a possibility.","['Cultural Revolution', 'Propaganda poster', 'Gender equality']"

The research contains a detailed description of the Saudi Arabian rentier state and the way this state is built up. The renewable energy projects that were, are and will be set up in this state are thoroughly discussed and the way these exact projects are formed is also described. A detailed overview of the parties involved in these projects is also provided. Furthermore, there is a successive part that also describes the way these renewable energy projects fit into the rentier state. Considering the foundation of the rentier state, certain difficulties, encountered with the implementation of the renewable energy projects, and their solutions are also discussed. Finally, the last chapter describes the future vision of the Saudi Arabian state, the effects the domestic developments might have on the wider region and expert vision on the developments. The study concludes by stating that there are, as assumed, effects of renewable energy on the rentier state. The renewable energy projects are, however, just like the fossil fuels in the rentier state theory, almost always completely managed by the state. In some cases directly by the state, in others indirectly via state grants and investments. The economy will be further diversified due to the renewable energy projects, but this has yet to take place. Concrete plans with foreign parties have been made but not yet executed. The focus of the current renewable energy projects is to take on the ever-growing domestic demand for energy so that the fossil fuels saved by these projects can be exported in order to sustain the rentier basis of the state. Overall, the renewable energy projects do effect the rentier state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but not necessarily threaten it.","['renewable energy', 'rentier state', 'the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia', 'GCC']"
Can Abe back out of the Discourse he created with the Abduction Issue,"Theunissen, Tommey","['Wakefield, Bryce']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"With North Korea being in the spotlight of the international community of late, the relations between North Korea and Japan could shift from antagonism to normalisation of relations. The abduction issue from the late twentieth century is one of the most influential obstacles in normalisation, but the North Korean government considers the abduction issue solved after the return of five abductees and the declaration of eight deceased abductees, whereas the Japanese government does not consider it solved. The abduction issue plays an important role in that it is a major issue Prime Minister Abe can use to portray North Korea as a threat to better achieve his own goals. The abduction issue puts a strain on the relations between North Korea and Japan and might continue to do so in the future if it is not resolved. To successfully normalise relations with the North, the abduction issue might have to be put on a lower priority, but the issue has been rooted in Japan’s North Korea policy ever since it came into the light, with Abe being one of the most influential political actors in popularizing the abductions. Thus, the research question of this thesis is: Can Abe back out of the discourse he created with the abduction issue?","['Abe', 'North Korea', 'Securitization']"
‘’That’s Fucking History’’: Chinese Masculinity and Anxiety in ​Wolf Warrior 2,"Nieuwenhuis, Erwin","['Speelman, Tabitha']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper will investigate how the masculinities depicted in Wolf Warrior 2, the Chinese movie with the highest box office earnings of all time, are new and to what phenomena in Chinese society they are related. The paper will start by examining the literature on historical masculinities in Chinese film. Afterwards, the paper will examine the way military masculinity, businessman masculinity and physical masculinity are portrayed. The paper shows that Wolf Warrior 2 brings back the figure of the military man to Chinese cinema but this time he is positioned abroad. In the section on businessman masculinity, the paper will demonstrate how Wolf Warrior 2 dethrones the character of the businessman from its position as hegemonic form of masculinity in Chinese cinema. This happens in response to the businessman's problematic position in modern Chinese society. The last part on the depiction of phyisical masculinity in Wolf Warrior 2 shows that Wolf Warrior 2 features a more physical depiction of the masculine superhero. The Chinese superhero's new physicality is closely related to orientalist discourses about the weakness of Chinese men and the Chinese government's wish of a more prominently active China. These portrayals are typical of a new film genre in which hypermasculine Chinese heroes are active abroad to defend China's interest.","['Chinese masculinity', 'film studies', 'China dream']"

Technoludic Commentative Anime and The Disintegration Of Ontological Boundaries In Kawahara Reki's Sword Art Online,"Kraan, Killian van der","['Smits, Ivo']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Over the recent years Japanese animation has seen the rise of a new form of the science fiction genre, namely technoludic anime, or anime that involves video game elements. Commentative technoludic anime, the main focus of this research, are part of a critical discourse on techno- culture and its future. This genre of anime taps into themes such as gender identity, nationalism, societies of control and the disintegration of ontological boundaries while using video game portrayal and video game play as the main focus of their narrative. It also either tends to smear or beautify video games through technophobic or technophilic themes which are supported by binary opposition such as lived experience and fantasy, and the real and the virtual. Considering the popularity of video games, it is no surprise that commentative technoludic anime have not only gained recognition in ""digitally native"" Japan, but also resonate with viewers on a global scale. Kawahara Reki's Sword Art Online has gained massive attention and can be seen as one of the icons of this commentative technoludic anime genre. Through its technophilic-tinted themes the series stimulates philosophical thinking by proposing a different understanding of virtual worlds and ontological boundaries. Throughout its story a young otaku recluse heightens the intensity of his life by moving into a new virtual exterior, finding its beauty along the way. The story's proposition, one that accentuates the merits, beauty, and realness of the virtual, is strengthened through the addition of life-like AI characters, exciting adventure, a beautiful environment and most surprisingly, death. Furthermore, even though Sword Art Online represents its virtual world as a video game, its world lacks the characteristics of play, showing that the virtual world Sword Art Online revolves around isultimately, not really a video game, but a sensational replacement for life in the real world.","['Technoludic Film', 'Science Fiction', 'Kawahara Reki', 'Virtual Reality', 'Ontological Boundaries', 'Video Game', 'Technophilia', 'Technophobia']"

In this view, it can be argued that the goal of moving up the socioeconomic ladder is highly dependent on the likelihood to which one can obtain a degree that will allow them to pursue their full potential in the workforce. Furthermore, given the tremendous increase in the number of undergraduates borrowing loans as well as the default rates on those loans, it is safe to assume that student debt is one of the critical issues for college graduates. This work aims to bridge the gap between the current research on the realization of college graduates in the United States labor force and the contemporary version of the American Dream based on data from the past ten years. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, the goal is to ultimately expose the adverse effect of student loan debt on homeownership and unemployment rates alongside average earnings for college graduates.","['American Dream', 'Student Debt', 'Education System']"

A Walk Down Memory Lane: Image of Yun Tong-ju as Resistance Poet in Contemporary South Korean Society,"Ho, Sammi","['Ceuster, Koen de']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Koreastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines how the Korean poet Yun Tong-ju (1917-1945) has been framed as a resistance poet in contemporary South Korean society through the process of collective memory and cultural production. What role does national memory and cultural production actually play in the framing of Yun Tong-ju’s image as a resistance poet in contemporary South Korean society? This thesis uses critical analysis, literature and genre analysis as research method on both Korean and English sources to examine these concepts in relation to the resistance image of Yun Tong-ju. Existing studies on Yun Tong-ju have mainly focused on the interpretations of his poetry, this thesis instead focusses on the process of memory construction and the reinforcement of it in its society. It seems that the image of Yun Tong-ju as a resistance poet can be traced back to the defensive creation of a national memory of the ‘Han minjok’ (the Korean nation). This memory was never questioned by the general public but only strengthened through the elaboration of cultural heritage and cultural productions in contemporary South Korean society.","['Korean Poetry', 'Yun Tong-ju', 'Resistance Poet', 'Collective Memory', 'Han minjok', 'Cultural Production']"

Negotiating Discursive Space: Chinese News Reporting on Singles Day,"Pieters, Lisa","['Schneider, Florian']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores how Chinese newspapers report on Singles Day, a holiday celebrated on November 11. The thesis covers the origins of Singles Day and how it has evolved from an Anti-Valentine’s Day to a Global Shopping Festival. This development, amongst others, is represented by the term “Double 11”, which has become Alibaba’s precious trademark to promote this holiday. Furthermore, a chapter illustrates how top-down and bottom-up forces constitute China’s media landscape, and also explains what methodologies have been used for the study. The main body consists of an analysis and discussion of six newspaper articles in Chinese. By analyzing articles by the People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and the Beijing News, a mainstream newspaper, the thesis compares and contrasts what discourses emerge in two newspapers in Beijing and how these newspapers differ in style and content. A qualitative discourse analysis has resulted in the main finding that the People’s Daily mainly provides positive, informative reports on how the holiday is progressing, while the Beijing News creates vivid and sensational narratives that constructively criticize the success story of Singles Day.","['Singles Day', 'Chinese newspapers', 'Chinese media', 'journalism', ""People's Daily"", 'Beijing News', 'Chinese Communist Party', 'CCP', 'discourse analysis', 'Alibaba']"

Corruption Blogging beyond Navalny,"Colijn, Johannes Christian","['David, Maxine']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The success of the Russian anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny in bringing to light the corruption of high-level government officials has reinvigorated the debate about the effectiveness of social media, and in particular blogging, to stimulate socio-political activism. This thesis looks beyond Russia’s most famous blogger to see who else is using the capabilities of (video)blogging to highlight and support the fight against corruption in the country. In particular, it analyzes blogposts by Ilya Varlamov and Erik Davidych and measures their direct effects in terms of the fight against corruption. By doing so, this research contributes to the debate of the usefulness of social media in the stimulation of socio-political activism, and reveals the possible short-term effects that blogging can have as a tool to battle corruption. The thesis concludes that despite media repression and the large scale of corruption in Russia, the short-term effects of anti-corruption blogging can be positive, while the long-term consequences are unclear.","['Corruption', 'Social Media', 'Blogging', 'Russia']"

The Debate Around Feminism in Russia: the Case of Victoria Lomasko,"Wassing, Laura","['David, M.E.L.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will look at the issue of feminism in Russia. It will answer the question of how the works of Russian artists, such as Victoria Lomasko, contribute to Russian feminism, particularly in a modern global context. This will be done in order to give a broader perspective of feminist theory, which so far is focused largely on western research and experiences. This creates an interesting point of study, as it can be seen as important for the development of feminist theory, but also to gain a wider understanding of Russian society. The thesis will seek to enlarge knowledge of both these objectives and as such by researching the Russian case it will try to gain insights on a more global applicability of the currently existing feminist theory. The case of Victoria Lomasko was chosen because her artwork shows the opinions of an individual but at the same time, because she portrays others, it also gives an indication of happenings in wider society. In order to answer the research question, a selection of Lomasko’s work will be analysed in order to gain a better understanding of the current atmosphere around feminism and gender issues in Russia. Alongside this, other material such as interviews will be used for the sake of gaining more insights than would be possible when looking just at her art. The issues on the basis of which these sources will be examined will be that of intersectionality and the exposure that feminism as a movement and idea receives. Through these two lenses, the thesis will show some of the similarities and differences between existing feminist theories and the Russian experience.","['feminism', 'Russia', 'Victoria Lomasko']"

To achieve this, I base my research around the notion of yakuwarigo ‘role language’ for stereotypical traits in fictionalised orality (Kinsui, 2003). I focus on a specific southern dialect in Japan known as the Hakata dialect. Usage of this dialect has been popularized in recent popular media, which is why I take the Japanese manga ‘comic book’ called Nisekoi ‘False Love’ (Komi, 2011-2016) as material for my case study. The manga has two existing translations, one by the official publisher VIZ Media (2014-2018), and one by several unofficial translation groups known as scanlators (2011-2016). The case study consists out of two separate comparative analyses. The first analysis is in regards to the translation procedures applied by the different translators of the manga, mainly at what kind of eye dialect was adapted throughout the whole series. The second analysis is in regards to the transference of the stereotypical traits that were present in the original Japanese version to the English versions. This analysis is done through empirical research by means of a survey; one for native and fluent Japanese speakers; one for native and fluent English speakers. Through these comparative analyses, I would like to expand on the notion of regional dialect as role language and the effects of translation thereof.","['Hakata dialect', 'role language', 'manga translation', 'localization', 'linguistic stereotypes', 'popular media', 'Southern American English']"

Using the theory of external anchoring, the process of democratization in candidate countries has been examined. The case of Turkey was used to show the EU’s democratization effects throughout the accession process. The European Union accession process does foster democratization in EU candidate countries. However, there are several reasons why the EU’s efforts are not as effective as intended. The appeal of EU membership requires consistency to be effective. But the accession process is subject to changing favoritism by EU member states. The inconsistency of the EU on demands in previous accession cases also undermines its effectiveness in more recent cases. Democratization requires both time to be anchored in a country, and incentive for the states to engage in it. For the candidate country’s decision-makers, the accession needs to be reachable in the short-term in order for it to have value. For the EU, accession is a process which requires time and certainty that the country has fulfilled all demands. A problem arises when the part of short-term benefits conflicts with the EU’s inclination for open-ended duration.","['Democracy', 'EU', 'European Union', 'Turkey', 'Policy']"

The degree of fictionality and its effect on the presence of yakuwarigo in Japanese translations of English literature: The case of hakasego,"Simic, Matej","['Uegaki, Wataru']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2003, Satoshi Kinsui published a book that would come to be the groundwork of Japanese role language, which he titled: “Baacharu nihongo yakuwarigo no nazo” (Virtual Japanese: The Mystery of Role-Language). In this book, he introduced the concept of yakuwarigo and discussed several prominent role languages that occur in Japanese manga. However, the focus of this book, along with other research into yakuwarigo, has mainly been the occurrence of yakuwarigo in literature and mass media originating from Japan exclusively. Therefore, the aim of this thesis will be to examine yakuwarigo in Japanese translations of English literature. Herein, I will try to determine when and why yakuwarigo is present in a Japanese translation, whereas it is absent in the source language. In addition to that, I am going to examine the effect of the degree of fictionality on the presence of yakuwarigo in the Japanese translations. Kinsui states that yakuwarigo is ‘virtual language’, meaning that it is a fictional language that appears in fictional works. It is by no means a realistic portrayal of how Japanese people speak, which is exactly why ‘fictionality’ will add a significant layer of information. By analyzing and contrasting literary works that pertain to different genres, fantasy fiction versus realistic fiction, I hope to find out whether the degree of fictionality affects the presence of yakuwarigo. For reasons of space, I will focus on one role language within the large inventory of yakuwarigo, which will be hakasego (learned elder’s/doctor’s language). Altogether, this thesis will address the following research question: to what extent does the degree of fictionality affect the presence of yakuwarigo in Japanese translations of English literature?","['Yakuwarigo', 'Role language', 'Hakasego', 'Fictionality']"

Democratic legitimacy undermined? Macron and Mélenchon’s criticisms of the French Fifth Republic and their effect on citizens’ support for the political system,"Padberg, Cathelijn","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"France is known for the continuous adaption of its Constitution and has lived through five successive Republics. The current Fifth Republic exists since its creation in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. However, it has been severely criticized for amongst other things: the personalization and extensive powers of the President; the unclear division of the executive; and the limited powers and unrepresentativeness of the parliament. During the 2017 presidential elections in France, centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon both extensively used these structural deficiencies in their campaigns, and promised a democratic revolution through far-going constitutional and institutional reforms. This research aims to assess whether these criticisms undermined citizens’ support for the political system, and consequently affected the democratic legitimacy of the Fifth Republic. The theoretical framework of system support as established by Pippa Norris and David Easton provides the conceptual framework, and helps to distinguish between diffuse and specific system support and its differing implications for state legitimacy. A political discourse analysis is performed on six speeches of Macron and Mélenchon in order to identify how they framed their propositions. Moreover, the effects of these speeches is determined through an analysis of the media coverage, as to interpret the potential implications for state legitimacy.","['French Fifth Republic', 'Constitution', 'system support', 'democratic legitimacy']"

The research is structured as follows. The first chapter explores the extant literature and theories regarding U.S. military involvement. From this literature review, the subsequent chapter explains the factors that influence U.S. foreign policy and creates several models to steer the research at hand. After this, the research design addresses the data collection and analysis. This produces a tool upon which three chapters will be based that describe what led to the decision to lead from behind in Libya and Syria but not in Egypt. Following this, a comparative analysis is conducted to examine the differences in U.S. decision-making in regard to the three cases and is linked further to the academic literature.

Not even teenagers are immune to its lure, as shown by the success of youth literature throughout the world. While sales figures of this young branch of literature are astounding, it is also worth delving into its contents. Shown by websites such as The Brown Bookshelf, the Children’s Book Council Diversity Initiative and the #WeNeedDiverseBooks Campaign, there is an ongoing debate on the importance of diversity and representation of minority groups in youth literature, as people wonder what it means when our classrooms are more diverse than the characters in our youth literature. What happens if we bring this debate to China? While China is almost as large as the European continent, it is easy to mistake it for a homogenous country. In truth, China has a hugely diverse population, which begs the questions: is this diversity reflected in its just as hugely popular youth literature? When discussing minority groups in China, the first to spring to mind are the 55 ethnic minority groups. Though they make up less than 10% of the total population, combined they still account for more than a hundred million people. Their representation in Chinese youth literature will be the focus of this thesis. The first chapter will examine the current state of contemporary Chinese youth literature and how it has developed. In the second chapter, I will take a closer look at the problematic nature and context of ethnic minority groups and ethnic representation in China. The third chapter will introduce the five youth literature novels that will be the focus of this research, and a thorough discussion of the ethnic representation in these five novels will be featured in the fourth and last chapter. The main research question is: how are ethnic minority groups represented in contemporary Chinese youth literature?","['Chinese literature', 'Youth literature', 'Ethnic minorities', 'Ethnic representation']"

The Changes of Representative Democracy in the “West” since the 1960s,"Qiu, Yang","['Augusteijn, Joost']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the 1960s, representative democracy in the “West” has undergone various changes, such as lower voter turnout rate, less party membership, and so on. Faced with these changes, some scholars maintain that representative democracy is failing; however, some other scholars disagree and consider it more as a transformation rather than a failure. The paper first presents some main points from both sides. Then, it argues that to comprehensively study the changes, scholars should distinguish two ways of representation, conventional one and unconventional ones. We can only be certain about the failure of representative democracy if both ways of representation are in decline. Based on this argument, the paper develops a very preliminary framework that uses quantitative approaches to study the two ways of representation. For conventional representation, voter turnout rate is a key indicator. If the turnout rate is dropping steadily, to a certain extent, conventional representation is declining. Meanwhile, it tests whether the level of ideological polarization has a significant impact on voter turnout rate. For unconventional representation, the rise of e-government deserves our attention. If e-participation is rising, to a certain extent, unconventional representation is rising. Based on the empirical evidence the paper has collected, it concludes that the future of representative democracy is still too soon to tell. Even though conventional representation is in decline, unconventional representation is developing. The changes are more likely to indicate a transformation.","['representative democracy', 'conventional representation', 'voter turnout rate', 'unconventional representation', 'e-government']"

However, non-Western women artists are still forced to face double colonization due to the application of patriarchal and Orientalist discourses in relation to the interpretation of their art, and the artists themselves. Since the 1980s, Chinese women artists have experienced increased recognition both in the mainland and internationally, however, they are still not freed from orientalism and patriarchy. This research focuses on the reality of China and—through close reading—examines the interviews with two Chinese women artists, Chen Lingyang and Lin Tianmiao which are then juxtaposed with claims of scholars, art critics, and curators. By incorporating the insights from theories of feminism, postcolonialism, and intersectionality, the presence of structural discourses can be revealed and used to identify ongoing oppression directed towards Chinese women artists. The thesis aims to contribute to the discussion about Chinese women artists and to challenge this oppressive reality which can potentially lead to an effective change in terms of avoiding patriarchal and Orientalist interpretations of these artists and their works.","['Chinese women artists', 'Chen Lingyang', 'Lin Tianmiao', 'Orientalism', 'Patriarchy', 'Feminism', 'Intersectionality', 'Close Reading']"

Follow the narrative: the political significance of Hindu narratives on Indian television,"Jongh, Cathy de","['Sunderason, Sanjukta']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to research the heightened presence of Hindu narratives on Indian television channels and how these Hindu narratives both emerge from and produce the rise of Hindu nationalist sentiments. This question is answered by analysing the Hindu narratives in multiple sets of material across websites and news portals on the Hindu televangelist channel Aastha TV and the entertainment channel Star Plus India. My analysis is based on Roland Barthes' Mythologies from 1972, which I use to distinguish three separate concepts -consumption, culture, and politics- which I argue, contribute to these televised Hindu narratives. Both Aastha TV and Star Plus India spread Hindu narratives by normalising a standardised form of Hinduism in daily life: this religious interpretation of the Indian identity creates a foundation for Hindu nationalism. Both channels also focus on the middle class as their target audience, which is both financially capable of buying products from these channels and politically significant in their support for Hindu nationalism. While the emphasis on religious and moral practice of Aastha TV allows for the explicit promotion of Hindu nationalism, the focus of Star Plus India on leisure and entertainment creates a space for the implicit presence of Hinduism in daily life. Star Plus India provides the groundwork for Hindu nationalism through its implicit emphasis on Hinduism as a foundation for Indian norms and values in “soaps”. Aastha TV explicitly promotes Hindu nationalism through its nationalist rhetoric and its focus on Hindu traditions through its use of Hinduism as moral and religious guidelines. Thus, Hindu narratives are present on Indian television channels in different forms. These narratives provide a foothold for Hindu nationalism to connect itself to leisure activities such as watching television and domestic values, and thus increase its visibility and authority over Hindu daily lives.","['India', 'Narratives', 'Hindu nationalism', 'Hindu televangelism', 'Entertainment', 'Television channels', 'Hinduism']"
Cyberwarfare as an Offensive Strategy: The Effect of Cyberwarfare Used by the US on Nuclear Tension in the North Korean Political Conflict,"Lagemaat, Eva","['Foulon, Michiel W.B.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research has shown that governments have increasingly been interested in cyberwarfare for offensive purposes, for example by investing in zero-days and by carrying out cyber operations. While the US invested in cyberwarfare, nuclear tensions in the North Korean political conflict increased. This research will examine, by using a theory building process tracing approach, how cyberwarfare used by the US between 2010 and the end of Obama’s presidency in January 2017 affected nuclear tension in the political conflict with North Korea. By using offensive realism theory, the research concludes that there have been too many limits in North Korea to successfully launch a cyber operation to limit nuclear tension. Nevertheless, the US military has shown an interest in employing cyberwarfare for offensive use. Especially left of launch techniques have been explored to limit nuclear proliferation in the international system. Although it cannot be said with certainty that norms with regards to the use of cyberwarfare are changing internationally, tension in the physic domain may lead to a reaction in the cyber domain.","['Cyberwarfare', 'North Korea', 'United States', 'Nuclear tension', 'Offensive realism']"

Yakuwarigo Lost in Translation: A Foreignising Approach to Translating Yakuwarigo,"Heerink, Dorien","['Uegaki, Wataru']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The main topic of this thesis is yakuwarigo in translation. Yakuwarigo, the Japanese word for role language, is a type of language use often used in works of fiction which evokes the image of a certain type of character, such as an old man or a young girl, by using certain first-person pronouns, copula and sentence-ending particles (Kinsui 2013). Translating yakuwarigo can be extremely challenging because the Japanese language has many opportunities for variation where English does not. For that reason, yakuwarigo is often standardised in the target text, even though this negatively impacts the uniqueness of the characters (Terada, 2015). While there is quite a bit of literature available on yakuwarigo, hardly any research has been done on the topic of yakuwarigo in translation. In this thesis, the feasibility of translating yakuwarigo from Japanese to English using a foreignising translation strategy is examined. The research question is: “To what extent is it possible to translate yakuwarigo from Japanese to English with a foreignising translation strategy?”. The answer to this question is formed by two parts: a theoretical framework and a case study. In the theoretical framework, a number of different topics are discussed, such as translation strategies, equivalence, and stereotyping. In the case study, six characters of a manga (Japanese cartoon) are analysed in the original version as well as in a fan translation. Additionally, a new translation of is proposed based on the acquired information. It was found that despite the fact that it is impossible to translate yakuwarigo to English perfectly, it is possible to translate characters in such a way that their language reflects their main personality traits. This is done by adapting the font, punctuation and lexical choices, among others, to the character’s personality as a way of compensating for the original yakuwarigo.","['Yakuwarigo', 'Role Language', 'Translation', 'Japanese', 'English', 'Manga', 'Foreignisation']"

China’s Shifting View on Climate Change Negotiations: A Comparison Case Study on China’s View on Responsibilities in Climate Change Negotiations from Copenhagen to Paris,"Luijkx, Linda","['Chang, Vincent']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Climate change is one of the most severe global problems of the 21st Century. China, as the biggest polluter in the world since 2007, undeniably needs to play an important role in the climate change negotiations to combat this worldwide problem. In 2017, the US (the second largest polluter responsible for global emissions) announced its withdrawal from the 2015 Paris climate change treaty. This made scholars wonder what China’s role in combating global climate change would be in the future. When looking at its first reaction in 2017, it seems that China’s is more willing to cooperate in combating climate change than it did before. This study shows when this changed occurred by analysing two recent climate change negotiations, the 2009 Copenhagen summit (COP15) and the 2015 Paris summit (COP 21). This study also shows how China's view has changed during these two COPs. This thesis concludes that 1) China has shifted from a realist approach to a more liberalist approach from 2009 to 2015, 2) China has recently been using the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" more as a way to protect itself from undertaking actions that are too big of a burden for the country, rather than an excuse to not have to commit to mitigation actions at all as it did before, and 3) China’s more liberal attitude seen in 2017 is already noticeable during the 2015 Paris climate change negotiations.","['China', 'Climate Change', 'Negotiations', 'Paris Agreement', 'Copenhagen Accord', 'COP 15', 'COP 21', 'CBDR', 'common but differentiated responsibilities']"

The research question of this thesis is as follows: to what extent are changing public spaces in Bangkok representative of the dynamics of economic development and urbanisation in Thailand? Through the use of theories of development – development economics and the modernisation theory – this thesis unlocks new insights into the contingent relationship between development, modernisation, and urbanisation. The final conclusion of this thesis is that sustained development has brought Thailand economic and social growth in all aspects. Economic development helped garner a state of modernity, however increased urbanisation as a cause of sustained development came at the cost of social implications in the form of friction in urban aspects of identity, modernity, and the notion of development itself. The conclusions drawn from this research provide insight into the understanding of Thai development of the previous century, as do they lay a foundation for the understanding of Thai development of the 21st century.","['Urban development', 'Street vendors', 'Bangkok', 'Public space', 'Right to the city', 'Modernisation', 'Development']"

In this thesis, I aim to place two of Indonesia's main seafaring communities, namely: the Orang Suku Laut and the Sama Bajau, in the debate surrounding this revival of tradition in Indonesian politics. In the first chapter, I analyse how the history of the Sama and the Orang Laut have positioned these communities in the Indonesian society, and whether or not stereotypes surrounding their communities have made it more difficult for them to profit from the recognition of customary rights. In chapter 2, I draw parallels between the Sama and the Orang Laut in the ways that their nomadic lifestyle has resulted in intangible forms of culture, making it harder for them to assert claims over territory. In this chapter I also show how their distinct cultural and religious identity contribute to their marginal status Indonesia. In the last chapter, I argue that Indonesia's sea nomads partial inability to participate in the reassertion of customary rights is rooted in a multitude of factors, including: the hegemony of environmental motives surrounding customary rights' advocacy groups, the difficulty of claiming ownership over land, and civil rights under the pressure of statelessness, and the difficulty of affirming sea-based and coastal territory in land disputes under the hegemony of regional developmentalism. I stress the difference between their respective territories, which presents each community with a distinct adversary in their struggle for the recognition of customary land rights.","['Sea-nomads', 'Indigenous rights', 'Adat', 'Indonesia']"

Instagram in Indonesia: online youth culture and the visual self-representation of adolescents,"Brugge, Jacklyn","['Suryadi, S.']",2018,Faculty of Humanities,South and Southeast Asian Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social media has been able to develop itself as a necessity into the lives of Indonesian users for the past decade. There are different factors that contribute to the popularity of social media usage in Indonesia. The most important motive behind remains the wide accessibility of mobile internet devices. Social media has been a main focal point for cultural exchanging and cultural expressions. It has shaped and created idealistic lifestyles, beauty perceptions, fashion trends and religious/educational resources are shared freely in a high pace. Especially on the social network application Instagram, visual representations are easily being shared using photographic posts. Along with the impact of globalization, Indonesian Instagram users are the interlinked and in direct involvement with the outer world. It cannot be denied that social media platforms strengthen the power of the active individual agent and that the social media application becomes an empowerment tool to the audience. Besides the evident benefits, social media has brought a series of negative effects to the Indonesian society as well. Ethical conflicts and moral violations of visual social media content have inflamed the debate on social media literacy education. Also, excessive monthly expenditures are a result of the problematic high consumer culture that circulates on Instagram. Especially the most dominant group users –Indonesian youngsters– seem to be the most vulnerable group for these online complications. It is therefore of the interest to highlight how the Indonesian youth approaches and practice social media applications. This paper explores cultural Indonesian youth studies further on virtual terrain, with its focus on the photo-sharing application Instagram.","['instagram', 'indonesia', 'visual', 'self-representation', 'social media', 'adolescent', 'consumer culture', 'social media literacy']"

The transition from a relative isolated China to a rising power with increasing influence on the world stage has shaped many policy agendas of various states around the world. Apart from the impact on different continents, it most of all has affected the regional affairs in China’s own sphere. The power dynamics in the region are changing and an important role in this scene is China’s growing influence in Asia. By the end of the 2000s and beginning 2010s, Beijing embraced a more aggressive position in relation to other states. The continuing disputes in the South China Sea China’s accentuate Chinas increasing military power. In line with these events, in 2011, the Obama Administration addressed their new foreign policy towards Asia. This involved a strengthening of the position of the United States in Asia. It was also largely perceived as a way of US balancing against a rising China. These events form the context in which the research of this thesis will take place. The question this thesis will try to answer is: How has the US pivot to Asia during the Obama administration affected China’s regional hegemonic aspirations in case of the South China Sea disputes?

As every social media platform has its unique dynamics, Twitters structure will be explored to see how it relates to the research questions applied to it. The process of increasing policy-orientated measures, will be described to illustrate how Twitter data is a valuable, and therefore limited accessible form of information. A number of studies is analyzed to explore potential methods and the results. Finally, a case study will be executed to demonstrate both the challenges and potential for humanities students.

Brainy is the New Sexy: Masculinity in Sherlock Holmes,"Walrecht, Ginny","['Liebregts, P.T.M.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the representation of masculinity in the Sherlock Holmes character, both in the original stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as well as in the modern BBC interpretation which first aired in 2010. It employs a Foucauldian notion of gender, which sees masculinity as a socially constructed concept and as such perceptible to change. The Sherlock Holmes stories were written over a forty-year time period. Two major historical events from this period could be said to have influenced the definition of masculinity, namely the Oscar Wilde trials and the First World War. Furthermore, Joseph Kestner has argued that Conan Doyle’s Holmes stories aimed to promote an ideal form of masculinity, which led us to consider the representation of Victorian masculinity in the Holmes character. Moreover, this thesis analyses the adaptation of Victorian Holmes in BBC’s Sherlock. Having defined Victorian and twenty-first-century masculinity, we will see that Conan Doyle’s Holmes aligns with numerous Victorian traits that were seen as masculine, and is portrayed as the ideal man. He is heroic, strong, brave, moral, rational and creative. Similarly, BBC Holmes aligns with masculine ideals of the twenty-first century but does not seem to personify the ideal man. He is strong, rational and creative, but his heroism is ambiguous, as well as his morality.","['Sherlock Holmes', 'Victorian literature', 'Arthur Conan Doyle', 'BBC Sherlock', 'masculinity']"

Het grootwinkelbedrijf in opmars. Amsterdam 1880-1920,"Geus, Sophie de","['Roding, J.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Vanaf 1880 vestigden steeds meer nieuwe winkels zich in Amsterdam, waarvan een aantal dankzij schaalvergroting tussen 1910-1920 uitgroeide tot grootwinkelbedrijven. De winkels begonnen vaak in een klein pandje in de winkelgebieden binnen het oude gedeelte van de stad (Nieuwendijk, Kalverstraat-Rokin en Dam). Een aantal daarvan, waarvan ik er drie heb besproken, breidde zich uit tot ware winkelpaleizen. Zo werd in 1912 het warenhuis Vroom en Dreesmann op de Kalverstraat-Rokin geopend en gingen in 1914 de deuren van De Bijenkorf op de hoek Dam-Damrak open. Peek & Cloppenburg ging in 1916 met haar filiaal op de Dam van start. Op basis van mijn onderzoek in het stadsarchief van Amsterdam heb ik via adresboeken, woningboeken en gezinskaarten een overzicht kunnen maken van het winkel- en woonbestand in de periode 1880-1920. Hierdoor heb ik kunnen concluderen dat op de locaties van de besproken grootwinkelbedrijven er een divers scala van kleine winkeliers zaten die door de komst van de winkelpaleizen moesten wijken. Door het van oudsher smalle stratenpatroon van Amsterdam waren geschikte locaties met vrij zicht schaars. Hierdoor kozen de grootwinkelbedrijven in Amsterdam om zich te vestigen op bestaande locaties met voldoende zichtbaarheid, zoals aan pleinen, kruisingen en brede straten. Dit had tot gevolg dat op deze locaties woonhuizen en de bestaande middenstand van kleine winkels werden verdreven. Met behulp van stadskaarten en afbeeldingen heb ik dit proces visueel kunnen maken en kunnen aangeven dat het stadsbeeld door de komst van de onderzochten grootwinkelbedrijven significant veranderd is.","['Amsterdam', 'grootwinkelbedrijf', '19e eeuw', '20e eeuw', 'Peek & Cloppenburg', 'V&D', 'De Bijenkorf', 'Stadsontwikkeling', 'Winkelstraten', 'Kalverstraat', 'Nieuwendijk', 'Dam']"

THE LISBON TREATY AND A NEW ERA OF PRESIDENCIES: REPRESENTING NATIONAL INTERESTS IN THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL,"Cloo, Jacob","['Oster, Jan']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2009 the European Union introduced the Lisbon Treaty. One of the changes this brought about was the introduction of a permanent president of the European Council. With this transformation the former EU presidency no longer exists and this thesis investigates the implications of this change. This is done by specifically looking at the national interests discussed in the European Council. Before the Lisbon Treaty Member States were able to influence the European Council by pushing their national interests, but based on the new institutional settings of the permanent presidency, this seemed after Lisbon more unlikely. An analysis of nine rotating presidencies of the Council of the European Union after Lisbon has been made and compared to the respective European Council conclusions of that period. The results show that in fact national interests have been discussed in the European Council. Nevertheless, only a third of all national interests has been discussed. On the other hand, the analyses also reveal that on average the discussed national interests in the European Council have significant similarity with the national interests of the Member States. Furthermore, the analysis brought also forward that certain national interests that seem not significant for the European Council have been discussed in the European Council, which could indicate that Member States can still push their national interests. In conclusion, national interests were discussed only to a low extent in the European Council, answering the research question of this thesis: to what extent are national interests of Member States presiding over the Council of the European Union discussed during European Council meetings?","['European Council', 'National Interests', 'Council of the European Union', 'Normative Institutionalism', 'Permanent Presidency', 'Rotating Presidency']"

FARC: Nieuwe Politieke Partij of Klassieke Guerrilla?,"Ekenhorst, G.W.J.","['Koetsenruijter, A.W.M.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In oktober 2016 sloten de Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC, NL: Gewapende Revolutionaire Strijdkrachten van Colombia) en de Colombiaanse overheid een akkoord, dat een einde moet maken aan meer dan een halve eeuw geweld tussen beide partijen. Van oudsher zijn er tegengestelde beelden van de FARC aanwezig in Colombiaanse media. Enerzijds dat van een nobele boerenguerrilla, die veelal in de jungle vechten tegen de overheid, met als doel gelijke rechten en landhervormingen. Daartegenover staat het beeld van een staatsondermijnende terreurorganisatie, die rücksichtslos mensen ontvoert en aanslagen pleegt om er zelf beter van te worden.In dit onderzoek is onderzocht hoe de FARC in Colombiaanse media gerepresenteerd wordt. Het onderzoek werd uitgevoerd aan de hand van het concept framing.Een opvallend resultaat is dat het ‘politieke-partijframe’ niet eerder gevonden werd. Het ‘boerenguerrillaframe’, dat in voorgaande onderzoeken vaak gevonden werd, was nu niet aanwezig in het corpus. Een mogelijke verklaring hiervoor is de veranderde politieke situatie in Colombia. De FARC en de regering zijn niet meer met elkaar in oorlog en etaleren andere beelden van zichzelf en elkaar in de media.",['FARC politieke partij guerrilla Colombia']
