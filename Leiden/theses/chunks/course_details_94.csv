Online game addiction among youth in China: How do different stakeholders look at online game addiction among Chinese youth?,"Kramer, Laura","['Landsberger, S.R.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the last few decades the internet has become an indispensable part of people’s lives. Especially the younger generations have a broad knowledge of how digital devices work and the advantages and conveniences of using the internet. According to Golub and Lingley, the Chinese government has always viewed the internet with ambivalence, because on the one hand it is a sign of modernity, but on the other hand it provides access to a different world view, different opinions, and additional information, which might not conform to the government’s view (2008). However, the number of internet users in mainland China has increased from 620.000 in 1998 to 649 million people at the end of 2014, it is the world’s fastest–growing online population (Stewart 2010; CNNIC 2015). About 55% of those users are below 30 years old. In the same year, China had a total of 366 million online gamers and the largest game population in the world (CNNIC 2015). Online gaming has become a popular way for children, adolescents and adults alike to spend their free or not so free hours. However, with the gaining popularity of online and offline gaming, it often replaces other more social activities, like playing sports or real-life socializing. Gaming addiction also has become a very serious issue, which has a profound impact on society. Since 2002, there have been many cases of aggression and bizarre behavior caused by gaming addiction. Golub and Lingley (2008) mention a few in their article, such as an obese man dying after a marathon gaming session, and a 13-year old jumping of a building after playing Warcraft hoping to “join the heroes of the game” (62; Xinhua News Agency 2006). Although, in a lot of countries, there is still an ongoing debate about whether gaming addiction is an addiction at all, China was one of the first to label problematic online gaming as a clinical disorder and is together with South Korea, the Netherlands, Canada and the United States, one of the few countries that has treatment centers for internet addiction, the first being opened in 2004 (CCTV International 2009). In my thesis I will discuss different stakeholders and how they look at the phenomenon of online game addiction among Chinese youth. I will use Foucault’s theory on power relations as a supporting framework for my research (Foucault 1981). I define Chinese youth as the age group between 12 and 30, but with a focus on high school and higher education students. I define online gaming as using an internet connection while gaming, often on a computer, instead of offline gaming on a console, and focus mainly on Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMO) as they are believed to be the most addictive online games and they are the most widespread in China.","['China', 'Chinese youth', 'Internet', 'Online gaming', 'Addiction']"

"To what extent do members of minority cultures in liberal states require extra protection, and if so what format should it take?","McNicholas, Frederick","['Newey, G.F.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This paper looks at whether something more than the system of individual rights is required to uphold justice for the members of immigrant minority groups in liberal democracies and states. Chapter 1 of the paper looks at whether group membership in general provides value for individuals, because if it does not then there is no need for extra protection, as it is not desirable. On the basis that groups and group membership is valuable in some way, chapter 2 examines whether any extra protection is required, and if so what forms it could exist in. The overall argument of the paper is that while group membership is on the whole valuable for individuals, no extra system of group rights is required to ensure that justice is upheld for the members of minority groups. Groups cannot make claims as separate entities, as the only entitlements they are able to claim are on behalf of their individual members. The existing system of individual rights and universal standards of justice is sufficient as it stands.","['Liberalism', 'Democracy', 'Rights', 'Minority', 'Groups']"

Toch zou hij achter de schermen een aanzienlijke rol spelen binnen het staatsbestel van Nederlands eerste koning. Deze scriptie geeft een analyse van de rol van prins Frederik in het landsbestuur en het militaire domein. De centrale vraagstelling betreft de positie en invloed van prins Frederik binnen het staatsbestel van koning Willem I in de periode 1813-1831. Hoe groot waren de daadwerkelijke rol en invloed van prins Frederik op het landsbestuur en in het bijzonder op het militaire beleid onder koning Willem I? Het uitgangspunt dat hierbij is gebruikt, is de vraag die in de titel is verwerkt. Is ‘Le Roi décide seul’ (‘De Koning alleen beslist’) een adequate verwoording om de regering van Willem I te karakteriseren? Tevens is de vraag of die vier woorden ook recht doen aan de rol en invloed van prins Frederik. Dit wordt gedaan door in te gaan op de jeugd en opleiding van prins Frederik, een kenschets die wordt gegeven van het staatsbestel van Willem I als zodanig, een gegronde analyse van de invloed en de rol van de prins in zijn bestuurlijke functies binnen het nationale militaire domein en een analyse van de prins’ carrière als commandant van tijdens de Belgische Opstand.","['Frederik', 'Willem I', 'staatsbestel', 'regering', 'commissaris-generaal', 'militair', 'Oranje-Nassau']"

Is the ‘Green Bridge’ still ‘Red’? The Politics of Heritage: Debating Problematic Issues of Socialist-Realist Monuments in Public Spaces in Post-Socialist Condition.,"Jovaraite, Gertruda","['Zijlmans, Kitty']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Looking at the Green Bridge monumental sculptures as the objects that represent a certain historical ‘truth’, there has been so much concentration on the past and how artefacts disclose and manifest the essence of that past, that it neglects important issues on how artefacts interact with a present and what they signify in present conditions. The problem of the Green Bridge is complicated precisely because of what these four monuments represent in current political and cultural situation. The issue goes way beyond a ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ memory line of reasoning as many people argue that the sculptures again (mainly because of the recent Imperialist-nature of Russian politics in Ukraine) have become the signifiers of oppression, (even after 25 years of Lithuanian independence) and are offensive to the residents of the city, devaluating ‘truthful’ Lithuanian identity and its values. Thus, this research, exploring the Socialist Realist monumental position in Post-Socialist society and concentrating on the Green Bridge sculptural ensemble in Vilnius, is divided into three ‘colourful’ chapters. The first one, entitled ‘Green.’, shortly reviews the historical background of the bridge giving an overview of its construction and development. The second, entitled ‘Red!’, examines the monuments in their relation to Lithuania’s history and complicated political aspects, indicating how there are many levels of interpretation while analysing art objects as time-factored symbols of an entire culture. This chapter contains the analysis of Socialist Realist style, symbols and iconography of the sculptures. It also reflects on possible benefits of adding a Post-colonial discourse to the subject, looks closer into Lithuanian Post-Socialist identity and traumatic collective memory while also indicating the dangers of a narrow two-sided ‘preserve vs. remove’ polemics escalated by Lithuanian media. Chapter ‘Pink?’ aims to propose a wider-raging interdisciplinary approach to political art emphasizing the importance of contemporary artistic practices and their abilities of meaning transformation in the former USSR countries. Moreover, a semiotic approach and the examples of Lithuanian artists in relation to the subject of memory give the opportunity to debate on alternative ways of dealing with the heritage of a totalitarian regime in a present day Post-socialist public spaces. Finally, the conclusion ‘Plato’s Ideal City: Political Decisions & Objectivity in Post-Soviet Vilnius’ examines the verdict made by the Department of Cultural Heritage under the Ministry of Culture and its political aspects also questioning the possibility of objectivity of the solution for the indicated problem.","['Socialist-Realism', 'monuments', 'Post-Socialism', 'Post-Socialist identity', 'heritage', 'Vilnius', 'Green Bridge.']"

The new Standard Model of Ancient History? An enquiry into the applicability of the Cognitive Science of Religion in the origin and flourishing of the Hellenistic and Roman ruler cults,"Groot, Charlotte Dieudonnée","['Naerebout, F.G.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"There is extensive discussion amongst scholars as to the origin and flourishing of the phenomenon of the living deified ruler. The so-called ruler cult quickly gains popularity in the Hellenistic era and continues long into the Roman period. Although scholars have long been trying to find an explanation for this in the source material, none have succeeded in finding one which satisfies all. It is possible that the Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR) could provide us with a new framework in which to place the already exciting evidence. Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary and scientific investigation of the mind and intelligence. Its advantages are that it focusses on general ‘laws’ of thinking that follow out of the structure of our brains. It follows then, that these are theories that should be applicable across cultures and, since the structure of our brains has not evolved since the beginning of history (ca. 3000 B.C.), they are also applicable through time. Cognitive science could therefore help in providing a framework in which the current theories on the ruler cult can function, by indicating what is even humanly possible to think based on the structure of the brain. It could perhaps, even suggest the most likely theories that can be discovered given certain tendencies the human mind has. This research examines the possibility of applying the Cognitive Science of Religion in the origin and flourishing of the Hellenistic and Roman ruler cults, as well as the study of Ancient History in general. It does this by examining the viability of the so-called Standard Model (a seven-point construct that outlines the major areas of consensus in CSR) in the primary material of the Hellenistic and Roman periods.","['Hellenistic', 'Roman', 'Religion', 'Ruler cult', 'Cognitive Science of Religion', 'Interdisciplinary', 'Standard Model']"

Behind the Keyhole: Private Letters by Women in Edith Wharton's The Touchstone and The House of Mirth,"Wijnands, Lineke","['Kardux, Johanna']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Anxieties about writing and privacy are often at the heart of Edith Wharton’s fiction. In the two works discussed in this thesis, Wharton’s early novels The Touchstone (1900) and The House of Mirth (1905), private letters written by women acting outside the domestic sphere, a woman writer and an adulterous wife, play a central role. Wharton uses these letters to explore the boundaries between the private and public spheres and to ask questions about the position of woman writers at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, whether they can function in the public realm and make themselves heard, or are destined to remain in the private sphere and be silent. The principal female characters in The Touchstone and The House of Mirth are, in a sense, both “authors” who are unable to break free from the limitations of their lives. In spite of their moral superiority, they remain subordinate to men who misread their writing, with disastrous consequences. Although Wharton criticises the male-dominated society of early twentieth-century America, she suggests that woman writers had better stayed within their domestic confinement, and, as a consequence, that private letters by women had better be burnt than published.","['Wharton', 'letters', 'woman writers', 'privacy', 'publicity', 'gender']"

Phototherapy and Therapeutic Photography: The Healing Power of Photographs,"Rutanen, Jenna","['Westgeest, Helen']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"My interest in the field of work which I will be discussing in this thesis has also been very important in my own photographic work. Before I had even been reading about phototherapy, I was using my own photographs in this kind of context. For me personally photography has been helpful in order to cope with the challenges that I have faced moving between countries for the last ten years. Thus, I began to be more intrigued in actual phototherapy and therapeutic photography. Since it seemed that there was some confusion over the terms I wanted my thesis to draw a distinction between these two. What came to be even more important in the end was to reveal how phototherapy was developed. In order to find the answer, I began to explore the 19th century paintings and medical drawings in the hope that they could reveal some connections to phototherapy. From there I explored how photography came to be invented and how its therapeutic potential came to be discovered within psychiatry. Here the influence of psychoanalysis had to be taken into account as well as the rise of feminism in 1960s-1970s. Thus chapter one is devoted to the question of how phototherapy was developed and what came to influence this development. In order to understand better the therapeutic value of photographs, I will also look at how ordinary people have used photographs in a therapeutic way which is the main focus of chapter two. Post-mortem photography will be discussed in this context as a practice which brought comfort to people who were grieving over the death of a loved one. I am also intrigued in analysing what kind of role Kodak, the company that created snapshot photography played in the construction of ideas of how people should use their cameras and how they should represent themselves. This will lead into a discussion of feminist subversion and Jo Spence who could be considered as one of the pioneers of phototherapy or more preciously re-enactment phototherapy. Analysing the therapeutic use of photographs amongst ordinary people will also add more understanding of the actual development of phototherapy which is my main focus in this thesis. The last chapter is devoted to the question of how photography has been used in a therapeutic way in arts. The American photographer Nan Goldin is my key artist here as she has found photography’s power as a medium to visually explore her own identity as well as that of others. I will be looking at her work in comparison to paintings created by Vincent Van Gogh, Frida Kahlo and Egon Schiele, much in a similar way as I was trying to find the traces of phototherapy in the 19th century paintings. In this context mirrors will also be discussed in relation to Lacan and Jung as part of explaining the human need for the search of wholeness within themselves. Furthermore I am intrigued in finding out whether Goldin has used photography only for her own personal healing or has it been also aimed to help others? Through this I will hopefully be able to find connections between her practice and that of Jo Spence’s. After carrying out this research, I am able to answer the question of how phototherapy came to develop and how the therapeutic value of photographs have been cherished previously by its different practitioners.","['Phototherapy', 'Therapeutic photography']"

Domestic and foreign issues became linked by fundamental themes as new forces of liberalism, political reform and religious pluralism challenged the old English regime. The Belgian Revolt, and its diplomatic and political aftermath, had a tremendous impact on the ideological struggle in Parliament. The opinion and interest for the Belgian case and the appropriate British response to it led to many intense parliamentary debates in the years 1830-1834. Furthermore, the Belgian question influenced discussions on other significant issues in British politics, such as parliamentary reform, repeal of the union with Ireland, collaboration with the Concert of Europe, France and the Holy Alliance. As foreign policy and domestic affairs became integrated through fundamental themes, an ideological struggle erupted and political parties presented themselves as more patriotic than their rivals. Consequently, the Belgian question became the battleground on which English intellectual, cultural and moral ideas were projected.","['Belgian Revolt 1830', 'nineteenth-century British politics', 'patriotism', 'British national identity', 'liberalism', 'parliamentary debates 1830-1834', 'British foreign policy', 'Parliamentary reform', 'Concert of Europe', 'Balance of power']"
Hate Speech in Freedom: The Japanese Government’s reluctance to legislate,"Boonen, Marte","['Wakefield, Bryce']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In 2014, the United Nations recommended to the Japanese government that it should promulgate laws against hate speech. This advice was ignored by the Japanese government, claiming such laws would interfere with the right of freedom of speech. With the racism against Zainichi Koreans (citizens in Japan of Korean ancestry) as a case study, using the New Haven School of Jurisprudence as framework, this thesis posits that “freedom of speech” is not the Japanese government’s (only) reason for refusing to promulgate laws against hate speech. By researching Diet discussions, newspaper articles, court cases and personal accounts of prominent politicians such as Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, this essay comes to the conclusion that the actual reasons differ from the official one given. The general conclusions of this thesis are that the Japanese government is reluctant to promulgate laws against hate speech because it is concerned about its independence from the United Nations, and because there is a disregard for minority issues in general.","['hate speech', 'Japan', 'zainichi koreans', 'Abe', 'government', 'legislation', 'Zaitokukai']"

Language and identity of Dutch speakers in Brussels,"Jonges, Joos","['Smakman, Dick']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The current report is an examination of language and identity in the context of Brussels. Brussels is sociolinguistically interesting as an official bilingual city with great diversity in languages and cultures. Theoretical notions of language attitude, accommodation and social identity are linked in the multilingual context of Brussels. To investigate a possible relation between language and identity, the language choice preferences of speakers of Dutch are mapped, as well as identifications they make on different levels. The link between language choice and identification is examined by investigating three small groups of speakers of Dutch in Brussels. An attitudinal online survey, expert interviews and a rapid and anonymous survey offer data that provide insights in the language, and identifications the speakers make. Qualitative analyses imply that speakers of Dutch in Brussels show a tendency to be flexible towards language switch and being addressed in another language. The Dutch language tends not to be a distinctive feature to the speakers’ identity, but multilingualism and positive traits attributed to multilingualism are part of the identity of the speakers of Dutch in Brussels.","['language', 'identity', 'multilingualism', 'globalisation', 'dutch', 'brussels', 'identification', 'accommodation', 'social identity', 'language attitude']"

For the Love of Language: Language and Gender in 1960's and 2000's Romantic Comedies,"Preez, Zuzanne du","['Smakman, D.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"It has been said to write what you know and literature has made use of this fact in no uncertain terms. Especially the film industry, and within that the romantic comedy genre, tell stories of everyday lives. Girl meets boy, they fall in love, they have a fight, they make up, they get together or get married and we laugh, or die of embarrassment at the impossible situations they get themselves into. These are scenes we all know too well. Romantic comedies have been a part of not only our modern culture but they also date back to at least the early modern English periods where Shakespeare entertained the masses. In our modern film culture, romantic comedies seem to be all the rage. Hollywood is popping out one after the other and they seem to have great success all over the world. Due to the fact that romantic comedies make use of a great amount of stereotyping (Neale & Krutnik, 1990), they make interesting cases for gender specific sociolinguist analysis. And that is what I intend to research: Language and gender in dialogue between head male and head female characters in romantic comedies. And also due to the developments that have occurred during the feminist and post feminist periods, I will compare some language features from 1960’s romantic comedies to the early 2000’s. The research will be based on a theoretical background in gender-specific sociolinguistics given by Lakoff (1995), Spender (1989), and Meyerhoff (2006). I will also consult film theoretic literature on romantic comedies given by Neale and Krutnik (1990) and Thompson and Bordwell (2010) to place my research in context. The research data will consist of evidence and examples from fifteen 1960’s romantic comedies, and fifteen of their early 2000’s counterparts.","['language', 'gender', 'romantic comedies']"
Roken is zóóó bekende Nederlanders gebruiken in je reclame Het gebruik van autoriteitsargumentatie in de gezondheidscampagne ‘Roken kan echt niet meer’,"Koning, Emma de","['Pilgram, Roosmaryn']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie wordt de volgende hoofdvraag beantwoordt: Hoe wordt er strategisch gebruik gemaakt van autoriteitsargumentatie in de gezondheidscampagne ‘Roken kan echt niet meer’? Dit wordt gedaan aan de hand van; een analyse van de campagne zelf, de doelen en doelstelling; een analyse van de gebruikte autoriteiten; een analyse van het argumentatiepatroon; en een analyse van het strategisch manoeuvreren in deze campagne. Het KWF kankerfonds wil met de campagne ‘Roken kan echt niet meer’ door middel van autoriteitsargumentatie de doelgroep van de (niet-)rokende jongere bereiken. Het doel is hierbij om de jongeren te weerhouden van roken en daarbij de jongeren die roken te laten stoppen met roken. Het KWF wil dit bereiken door verschillende autoriteiten stellingen uit te laten spreken, waar roken vergeleken wordt met iets stoms, ouderwets en/of niet-cools. De autoriteiten zijn in te delen in vier categorieën: de bekende Nederlander, de gewone mens uit alle gelaagdheden van de samenleving, kinderen en de impliciete, onbekende bron. De autoriteiten zijn allen valide, wanneer ze beoordeeld worden volgens de kritische vragen van Tindale, waarbij ‘coolheid’ het gebied van kennis is en waarbij het KWF garant staat voor de betrouwbaarheid van de impliciete, onbekende bron. De stellingen hebben een quote-vorm en zijn alle te voegen in het argumentatie-patroon dat ontstaat bij deze campagne. Het argumentatiepatroon is gebaseerd op het argumentatieschema op basis van autoriteit en het argumentatieschema op basis van vergelijking, aangezien roken in de stellingen van de autoriteit vergeleken worden met iets onwenselijks (‘Roken is zóóó witte sokken in sandalen’). Het strategische gebruik van de autoriteitsargumentatie in deze campagne wordt onderzocht aan de hand van drie aspecten van strategisch manoeuvreren, namelijk: selectie uit het topisch potentieel, adaptatie aan het publiek, en de presentatiemiddelen. Hierbij komt naar voren dat er gekozen wordt voor een combinatie van autoriteitsargumentatie en vergelijkingsargumentatie, omdat dit aansluit bij de wensen en de kennis van het publiek, waarbij het gebruik van de autoriteiten tevens de presentatie is. De variatie aan autoriteiten in de presentatie zorgt voor een mogelijke vergroting van de overtuigingskracht en herkenning bij het publiek. Het strategische gebruik van de autoriteitsargumentatie in de gezondheidscampagne ‘Roken kan echt niet meer’ zorgt ervoor dat de boodschap over wordt gebracht naar de doelgroep en de boodschap mogelijk overtuigender overkomt. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek kan gaan over het KWF als algemene onderliggende autoriteit en het gebied van kennis waar het daadwerkelijk over gaat, coolheid of kanker. De aanleiding hiervan is het KWF, die garant staat voor de betrouwbaarheid van de impliciete, onbekende bron, waarbij dit misschien wel gelijkgetrokken kan worden naar de andere autoriteiten. Verder kan er kwantitatief, empirisch onderzoek uitgevoerd worden naar de daadwerkelijke overtuigingskracht van de autoriteitsargumentatie in deze campagne.","['strategisch gebruik', 'roken kan echt niet meer']"
From colonial land rights to Malay corporate shares: entrepreneurship and ethnicity in Malaysia before the New Economic Policy,"Loos, Kenny William Anthony van der","['Lindblad, J.T.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"When the ruling Alliance-coalition of Malaysia suffered a painful defeat in the 1969 general elections, ethnic riots erupted in the streets of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s capital city. These riots proved a watershed moment in the history of Malaysia, since they convinced the country’s political leaders that more should be done for Malay Malaysians in order to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. For this reason, an affirmative action programme called the New Economic Policy (NEP) was adopted in 1971. As a consequence of the NEP, Malay entrepreneurs obtained a considerable stake in the domestic economy. The thesis analyses whether the favourable competitive position that accrued to Malay entrepreneurs under the NEP was historically unique. It addresses the following research question: to what extent did changes in the conditions for the development of entrepreneurship of varying ethnic origin during the period 1920-1970 anticipate the New Economic Policy? I argue that, although the favourable conditions facing Malay Malaysian entrepreneurs under the NEP were historically unprecedented, positive discrimination of Malays in government policies has deep historical roots. Initially such policies were fairly narrow in scope, gradually broadening as time went by. By the second half of the 1960s the policy climate already portrayed many of the features that would come to characterize the NEP.","['affirmative action', 'Alliance Party (Malaysia)', 'British colonialism', 'Chinese entrepreneurship', 'ethnicity', 'Indian entrepreneurship', 'indigenous Malaysian entrepreneurship', 'Malay entrepreneurship', 'Malaysia', 'New Economic Policy (NEP)']"

Vasari en capriccio: een kunsthistorisch begrip in laat 16e-eeuwse kunsthistorische literatuur,"Rosmalen, Paul van","['Grasman, E.', 'Bartelings, N.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie heb ik tot doel te onderzoeken wat Vasari met de term capriccio heeft bedoeld. Daarbij ben ik in de eerste plaats ingegaan op zijn eigen werk en de context waarin hij de term gebruikt. Bij capriccio als adjectief heb ik vooral gekeken naar het semantische veld waarbinnen capriccio wordt gebruikt. Bij het gebruik als substantief heb ik al meer een vinger kunnen leggen op de betekenis en het belang van de term binnen de kunsttheoretische vocabulaire van Vasari. Capriccio is volgens Vasari een bepaald soort persoonlijke, en aan de kunstenaar inherente, creatieve inspiratie die een kunstenaar kan verkrijgen, in bezit kan hebben en kan uiten. Verder gebruikt Vasari capriccio met enige regelmaat als omschrijving van bepaalde elementen in kunstwerken waarbij hij vooral uiting heeft willen geven aan diens originaliteit. Hoewel capriccio overwegend een positieve connotatie heeft, gebruikt Vasari de term ook met enige regelmaat in negatieve zin. Voor Vasari is capriccio een tamelijk breed begrip waarbinnen de creatieve persoonlijkheid van een kunstenaar tot uitdrukking kan komen en zich in elk soort (kunst)object bij elke kunstenaar kan manifesteren. Voor Gilio is capriccio enkel een (kwalijke) creatieve eigenzinnigheid.De kritiek van Gilio dat capriccio het tegenovergestelde is van de natura en de verita, is in mijn optiek overgenomen door latere auteurs zoals Comanini, maar wordt daarbij tegelijkertijd ook in een meer positief daglicht gesteld. Capriccio ontwikkelde zich tot een term die haaks stond op het “conventionele” en werd daarom juist geprezen. Het is deze ontwikkeling die in mijn optiek sterk heeft bijgedragen aan de ontwikkeling van capriccio als een heel breed kunsttheoretisch begrip bij Vasari, tot aan de specifiekere betekenis die de term later is toegekend.","['Vasari', 'Capriccio', 'Vite', 'Gilio', 'Comanini', 'Invenzione', 'Fantasia', 'Arcimboldo', 'disegno', 'ekphrasis']"

"A Myth of Loss: Religion, Death and Love in Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials""","Telkamp, Durba","['Newton, Michael']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Although the target audience of Philip Pullman’s trilogy His Dark Materials, consisting of Northern Lights (1995), The Subtle Knife (1997) and The Amber Spyglass (2000) might seem to be children and young adult readers, the books have also attracted numerous adult readers. In this fantasy story Pullman addresses important questions regarding issues such as religion, the existence of God and the function of belief, love, and death. But beyond all these controversial and difficult discussions, this thesis argues that the story itself is best understood as permeated by a sense of loss. In each part of the trilogy, a character ends up losing a loved one, be it a parent, child, sibling, daemon or lover. In the final book, the Authority, Pullman’s vague god figure, is also killed off, resulting in a collapse of religion and the Church as an institution. His two young protagonists, Will and Lyra, travel through the world of the dead and eventually free all the souls trapped there, and these souls dissolve into elementary particles and become part of the physical world. This leads to the question of what really happens after we die, if there is no Heaven, and we simply return to the state that we were created from. This idea completely undermines what we are taught by religions such as Christianity and Islam, that there is a life after death and one will go to heaven or hell depending on their actions and choices of this life. Thus, besides a physical loss caused by death, there is also a loss of faith. Finally, this thesis will argue that through his portrayal of religion, death and love in the trilogy, Pullman presents loss as a defining element of life, and this prevalent sense of loss enables him to redefine the meaning and function of religion, death and love in the 21st century, while also putting forward a new myth that might compensate for such losses.","['Philip Pullman', 'fantasy', 'realism', 'myth', 'loss', 'death', 'religion', 'love', ""children's literature""]"

God the Exclusively Christian Father,"Klop, Marry-Loïse","['Dorst, Lettie']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study concerns the possible influence of Christian culture on Islamic metaphorical language. In order to reveal whether or not such Christian influence is indeed apparent in the metaphorical language of Dutch Muslims, the responses of Dutch Islamic teenagers to principal Christian metaphors referring to God, which were applied to Allah, were analysed. The main research question was the following: How do Dutch Islamic teenagers respond to principal Christian metaphors referring to God applied to Allah? The selected principal Christian metaphors referring to God were the following: GOD IS A MASTER, GOD IS A KING, GOD IS A JUDGE, GOD IS A FATHER and GOD IS A HUSBAND. The analysis showed that the Islamic participants in this study only accepted the metaphors which also occur in the Quran, i.e. GOD IS A MASTER and GOD IS A JUDGE. The metaphor GOD IS A KING also occurs both in the Bible and the Quran, but this metaphor received mixed reactions, as some participants thought it was too ‘earthly’ to be appropriate when referring to Allah. The exclusively Christian metaphors were rejected by all the Islamic participants in this study. This rejection was based on the notion that these metaphors were too ‘earthly’ to be appropriate when referring to Allah as well. Thus, no Christian influence on the Islamic metaphorical language was detected in this research. Moreover, based the results in this study, the conclusion is that Christians and Muslims perceive and understand their deity in different terms: God the Father and God the Husband are exclusively Christian.","['Linguistics', 'religious metaphors', 'metaphors', 'conceptual metaphor theory']"

Eerst is de geschiedenis van Marokkanen kort geschetst en is gekeken naar een aantal problematieken waarmee deze groep vaak wordt geassocieerd. Tegen die achtergrond is hierna ingegaan op de hoofdvraag van het onderzoek, namelijk hoe Marokkanen de afgelopen twee decennia werden beschreven door autochtone Nederlandse schrijvers. Om deze vraag te beantwoorden zijn vijf romans onderzocht, namelijk Hajar en Daan van R. Anker, Tirza van A. Grunberg, Vluchtwegen van M. van Kempen, Het meisje met het hoofddoekje van M. Schouten en VSV van L. de Winter. Hierbij zijn – aan de hand van statistieken van het CBS – vijf hoofdthema’s geselecteerd waarop is gelet, namelijk Theo van Gogh en Mohammed B., radicalisme bij Marokkaanse jongeren, de hoofddoekproblematiek, vooroordelen, geloof en onderwijs. De conclusie is om twee redenen van grote betekenis. Ten eerste vanwege het nieuwe onderzoeksgebied. De visie van Marokkaanse schrijvers op Nederland en de multiculturele samenleving, werd al herhaaldelijk uiteengezet. Deze scriptie geeft echter een idee van de andere kant: het beeld van Marokkanen bij autochtone Nederlandse schrijvers en daarmee ook – en dit is de tweede reden – van het beeld van Marokkanen bij “De gemiddelde Nederlander”.","['Marokkanen', 'autochtone', 'literatuur']"

Een grote vluchtelingenstroom kwam op gang waarvan er enkele duizenden vluchtelingen in Nederland terecht kwamen. Dit onderzoek geeft antwoord op de vraag hoe de verschillende Nederlandse kranten reageerden op de komst van deze veelal politiek links georienteerde Chilenen. Ook komt naar voren welke argumenten kranten gebruiken om voor of tegen de komst van de Chileense vluchtelingen te pleiten. De belangrijkste verklarende factor voor de aard van de berichtgeving is de politieke oriëntatie van de Chileense vluchtelingen is. De vluchtelingen konden rekenen op wantrouwen van de rechtse krant De Telegraaf. In meerdere krantenartikelen sprak De Telegraaf zijn zorgen uit over de komst van gevaarlijke personen naar Nederland waarmee de krant doelde op communisten en socialisten. Deze Koude Oorlog retoriek is een van de argumenten waarmee De Telegraaf probeerde om de komst van de Chileense vluchtelingen te ontmoedigen. De communistische krant De Waarheid en de democratisch socialistische krant Het Vrije Volk stonden aan de andere kant van het spectrum. Het feit dat de Chileense vluchtelingen het socialistische bewind van Allende hadden gesteund zorgde voor veel sympathie en steun bij deze twee linkse kranten. De twee kranten waren voorstander van zo veel mogelijk Chilenen naar Nederland te halen. Het sterkste argument dat zij hierbij in handen hadden waren de gruwelijke verhalen die de Chilenen hadden te vertellen; over de martelingen in Chili, over de werkzaamheden van de DINA in Europa maar ook over hoe zwaar de vluchtelingen het in Nederland hadden. Door deze verhalen te vertellen en de vluchtelingen als kwetsbaar te portretteren lieten de kranten zien dat de Chilenen ‘onze’ hulp hard nodig hadden.","['Chileense vluchtelingen', 'beeldvorming in de Nederlandse media']"

Nowadays, more and more museums make an effort to create access to their collection of artworks through programmes designed especially for Deaf people, like guided tours in sign language by Deaf museum educators or on tablets. An inclusive museum, however, is not labelling people as ‘Deaf’ or ‘hearing’, but is accessible to everyone without the need to design special programmes for particular groups. This interdisciplinary research combines Museum Studies, philosophy, Disability Studies, and cognitive neurosciences, to raise awareness for the inaccessibility of museums to the prelingual Deaf, and develops a theory of a multisensory presentation of collections of artworks that is accessible and beneficial not only to the Deaf, but also to other visitors. From the viewpoint of the museum visitor as embodied being, this research examines the possibility to make aesthetic judgments based on touch, taste, and smell.","['Deaf', 'museums', 'modern art', 'senses', 'embodied cognition', 'multisensory', 'aesthetics', 'Deaf community', 'artworks', 'accessibility']"

Energy Union: European energy security in light of EU-Russian energy relations,"Rijssen, Robert van","['Gerrits, A.W.M.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Energy security is currently one of the most discussed and debated topics in political circles. This is partly due to shifting energy narratives and the growing understanding of the different dimensions of energy. For the European Union, energy policy and governance has been placed centrally on the agenda, with the Energy Union becoming one of the key priorities with the new Juncker Commission. The movement towards a broader conceptualization and understanding of energy security has come from a renewed attention on the relationship between the EU and Russia. The EU-Russian energy trade relationship is a central feature of the interaction between the two actors; they are even interdependent when it comes to the natural gas trade. This is crucial to understand the contemporary energy security situation of the EU. This study focuses on this particular relationship by testing it against several indicators in order to gain an insight into the various elements of the EU-Russian energy relationship. In order to meet the energy security challenges effectively and coherently, the EU and the Member States must actively pursue a comprehensive and far-reaching energy governance system, something which has been lacking so far. There have been promising signs that the EU is finally ready to do so with the Energy Union, however the final political feasibility can still be questioned. Any energy security measures that the EU intends to implement should focus on unilateral action since the political relationship with Russia is unstable. The EU should in fact work from its core strengths; economic integration, cooperation and strength in numbers. By concentrating on the market aspects of energy security, the EU can significantly improve its energy security vis-à-vis Russia in the short term.","['energy security', 'EU-Russia', 'energy union']"

The Incompatibility of Christianity and Proto-Capitalism in Robinson Crusoe,"Saleem, Danyal","['Stelling, Lieke']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719) suggests that true Christian spirituality and virtue was threatened by eighteenth-century capitalism. In his novel, Defoe illustrates how religious piety was rendered difficult in the eighteenth century, an era in which many people participated in overseas trade because of the rise of proto-capitalism (Semmel 30). Crusoe has less difficulty being a devout Christian when living on the uninhabited island than he does before he is shipwrecked and after he goes back to society after twenty eight years of living in isolation. Crusoe’s lifestyle on the desolate island is in stark contrast to his lifestyle on the European mainland. On the latter, the European bourgeois capitalist culture motivates Crusoe to become wealthy and lures him into the trading business overseas. Yet on the desolate island, where Crusoe is the sole survivor of a shipwreck, he thanks God and repents the previous mistakes he has made. The absence of social and economic distractions gives him an opportunity to become more familiarized with Christianity. As Crusoe is isolated from society on the desolate island, he initially feels desperation and fear, which makes him turn to the Bible. It is because of what he reads in the Bible and his isolation from society that Crusoe reflects on his previous lifestyle and appreciates his new connection with God. However, by the end of the novel, the reader might wonder whether Crusoe has been able to keep the resolutions which he has made on the island. He is unable to maintain his religious piety when he leaves the island, as the capitalist society tempts him to become a private trader again. Indeed, by contrasting life on the mainland in a blooming market economy to life in isolation on an island, Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe suggests that capitalism and a society obsessed with materialism made conversion to true Christianity difficult, or even impossible. As regards the influence and historical context of Robinson Crusoe, I will approach the novel from a New Historicist perspective and explain that it is a product of its time. Below, I will first show that the novel reflects contemporary ideas of true Christianity and conversion. After placing the novel in a historical context, I will contrast Crusoe’s lifestyle on the mainland amidst society with life in isolation on the island to analyze Crusoe’s religious experience and his psychological change to see how the capitalist society affects him and renders him unable to maintain religious piety. I will do this in three separate chapters. In this paper, I will limit my research to The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, as a focus on the whole Crusoe trilogy would be more appropriate in a master thesis.","['Christianity', 'Capitalism', 'Proto-Capitalism', 'Religion', 'Conversion', 'Robinson Crusoe', 'Eighteenth century', 'Literature']"

Die Darstellung der europäischen Gesellschaftsmodelle in Johann Karl Wezels Robinson Krusoe,"Tongeren, Maximiliaan van","['Müller, J.M.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Duitse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,de,"Robinson Krusoe von Johann Karl Wezel ist ein politisch-satirischer Roman der die Entwicklung der europäischen Gesellschaft stark kritisiert. Zuerst werden die Gattungen Robinsonade und Utopie definiert, später in der Arbeit wird der Roman in der Gattungsanalyse als Robinsonade mit dystopischen Elementen bezeichnet. Diese Robinsonade unterscheidet sich deutlich von Campes Gegenstück. Dieser Unterschied (der schon in der zugrundeliegende Idee über das schreiben eines Romans stark vertreten ist) wird auch kurz angesprochen um das literarische Umfeld dieses Romans zu deuten. Diese Studie vereint die Forschungsansätze von McKnight, Jansen und Thurn, indem die ökonomische, die politische und die aufklärerische Elemente der Satire analysiert werden. Nebenbei wird gezeigt wie Wezels Kritik sich zu den ökonomischen Theorien von Adam Smith und John Locke verhält. In Wezels Roman sind sehr viele (implizite) Kritiken an die Theorie von Adam Smith zu finden. Deutlich positiver ist er der Theorie von John Locke gegenüber. Wezel zeigt in seinem Roman, dass das Privateigentum eine notwendige Entwicklung der Gesellschaft ist, die allerdings sehr schwerwiegende Folgen für die mögliche Entwicklung der Gesellschaft hat, indem dieses Privateigentum ein Keim für Konflikte und degenerative Entwicklungstendenzen ist. Sehr beachtenswert ist die Rolle der Wilden in diesem Roman. Sie sind nämlich die einzigen, die über längere Zeit eine stabile Gesellschaft errichten können. Bemerkenswert ist, dass sie die einzigen sind, die nicht von der satirischen Kritik betroffen sind. In seinem Roman zeigt Wezel die zerstörerische Tendenzen der Gesellschaftsentwicklung im Rahmen der Entwicklung des Privateigentums und verübt er starke Kritik an den europäischen Superioritätsgedanken.","['Johann', 'Karl', 'Wezel', 'Robinson', 'Krusoe', 'Gesellschaftsmodelle', 'Robinsonade', 'Utopie', 'Smith', 'Locke']"
The Retrospect of Radical Republicanism: Le Père Duchêne of 1848 and the Revolutionary Past,"Raalte, Jeroen van","['Storm, Eric']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"By reintroducing the republic as the form of state, the French Revolution of 1848 also revived memories both joyful and terrifying of the First Republic (1792-1799). Despite its troublesome connotations, radical republicans enthusiastically seized upon the heritage of the Jacobin regime. Through a case study of the newspaper Le Père Duchêne. Gazette de la Révolution, this thesis studies the relationship of these radicals with the revolutionary past. Its findings suggest that the latter had three functions in radical republican discourse. First, given that Le Père Duchêne extensively invoked Jacobin ideology, rhetoric and symbolism, the past constituted a source of inspiration. Secondly, by proclaiming itself as heir to Robespierre and the likes, Le Père Duchêne deployed the past as a means of legitimacy. Since the traumatic memory of the Jacobin Reign of Terror seriously undermined the latter, the journal rewrote the narrative of the guillotine, presenting it as the necessary outcome of circumstances created by the adversaries of the Jacobins: the Gironde. Finally, it used this altered image of the past as an analogical frame projected onto the present. By equating the acts of contemporary moderates with the Girondists’ purported treason in the past, Le Père Duchêne understood 1848 as the continuation and eventually culmination of the very same strife between malevolent bourgeois reaction and virtuous popular republicanism.","['France', 'radical republicanism', 'Revolution of 1848', 'historical memory']"
Beyond Recognition: The Expansion of Photographic Representation in an Abstract Environment,"Peeters, Heleen Annie Maria","['Bruyn, Eric C.H. de']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study investigates why non-representational photographs are accepted as abstract art even though they remain tight to reality. By analysing this acceptance, this thesis also examines the purpose of non-figurative photographs and asks why the genre has become more prevalent in our contemporary environment. The first part of this investigation analysed photography and abstraction conceptually. Neither term can be given an all-round ontological definition, as they are too diverse and change over time. In today’s surroundings, technological advances have great influence: photography has become an embedded tool that is over-used. The viewer is overwhelmed and needs to be motivated to engage with the work. In our Internet- driven, data-sharing environment, abstraction has also become part of everyday living. Therefore, abstract art as a model of reduction has lost its function. Today, abstract art is based on the paradigm of complexity. The second part of this thesis studies the work of photographers Wolfgang Tillmans, James Welling and Thomas Ruff. These artists show how non-figurative photographs can generate engagement from the audience. By offering unclear representations, the artists have underlined the inherently abstract nature of the medium. The result of my study suggests that contemporary abstract art is perceived from a new perspective. It is irrelevant to acknowledge abstraction and representation as paradoxical, as they have become the same. Ironically, photography thereby became an impeccable tool for producing abstract art. The results may never be fully disconnected from the world; nonetheless, the medium is located in an abstract position, which in our contemporary surroundings feels right at place.","['abstract', 'photography', 'Tillmans', 'Welling', 'Ruff', 'perception', 'non-representational', 'abstracted', 'vision']"

Met behulp van zowel een kwantitatieve als een kwalitatieve analyse worden de ethostechnieken in de nieuws- en forumberichten in kaart gebracht. Op de internetforums werden elf verschillende ethostechnieken aangetroffen. Van die elf technieken behoren er acht tot de ethosdimensie ‘deskundigheid’ en drie tot de dimensie ‘welwillendheid’. Nieuwsmedia gebruiken minder verschillende ethostechnieken; slechts drie. Alle drie de technieken behoren tot de dimensie ‘deskundigheid’, waarmee uitkomsten van eerder onderzoek naar overtuigingstechnieken op internetforums en in nieuwsberichten bevestigd worden: de ethosdimensie deskundigheid wordt het meest gebruikt door zowel journalisten als forumdeelnemers.","['Retorica', 'Ethostechnieken', 'Energiedrank']"
Israel's Societies & The Societal Security Dilemma,"Drijvers, A.J.","['Ennis, C.A.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In order to explore the dynamics of unequal citizenship between the Jewish citizens and the Arab citizens of the state of Israel this thesis engages with the societal security dilemma, a variant of the traditional security dilemma that operates between different societies on an intrastate level and focuses on collective identity concerns. The societal security dilemma as such offers an alternative approach to the traditional perspectives provided on ethnic conflict by security studies. Through the method of content analysis the perceived threats to the collective identity of both the Jewish Israeli society and the Palestinian Arab society present in the state of Israel are qualitatively analyzed. From the side of the Jewish Israeli majority political-legal measures aimed at Israel’s Arab minority are investigated as part of the action-reaction process. From the side of the Palestinian Arab minority the Vision Documents, a set of three separate and seminal documents which express the minority’s view of the future of the Israeli state are investigated as part of the action-reaction process. The two societies find themselves locked into a regular societal security dilemma in which the Jewish Israeli majority demonstrates expansionist security-seeking behavior and the Palestinian Arab minority exhibits non-expansionist security-seeking behavior.","['Israel', 'Citizenship', 'Societal Security Dilemma', 'Collective Identity', 'Israeli-Palestinian Conflict', 'Vision Documents', 'Ethnic Conflict']"

Het beeld van de ramp: Een vergelijking van tropen in icoonfoto's en nieuwsfoto's,"Olsthoorn, Iris","['Koetsenruijter, A.W.M.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De westerse cultuur is sterk beïnvloed door beeld: fotojournalistiek vormt een belangrijk onderdeel van de hedendaagse media. Ook binnen de geschiedschrijving maken icoonfoto’s een groot deel uit van het collectieve Westerse geheugen. Foto’s zijn een van de belangrijkste elementen van de algemene beeldvorming binnen een maatschappij. Icoonfoto’s staan symbool voor een grotere context dan wat op de foto staat afgebeeld. Vooral in het geval van rampen zijn icoonfoto’s een middel om complexe gebeurtenissen begrijpbaar te maken voor publiek. Hoewel er veel onderzoek is gedaan naar de werking van iconische foto’s, valt er een groot gat op het gebied van receptie-onderzoek: over hoe en wanneer een foto iconisch wordt is niet veel bekend. Wat nieuwsfoto’s met icoonfoto’s gemeen hebben, is dat ook zij een handvat kunnen zijn in het verbeelden en uitleggen van complexe gebeurtenissen in het nieuws aan het publiek. Vaak gebeurt dit door framing: door middel van een referentiekader wordt een situatie op een foto verduidelijkt. Hierbij is het vaak problematisch dat dit frame vol van politieke en ideologische bevooroordeling zit. Ook icoonfoto’s verwijzen met hun symbolische betekenissen naar politieke en ideologische connotaties, maar bij dit soort foto’s is dit vele maler complexer: waar een icoonfoto door zijn status een opzichzelfstaand object is, zijn nieuwsfoto’s met een frame vaak afhankelijk van contextuele elementen zoals bijschriften en berichtgeving. In een poging om het gat in het onderzoek naar statusverwerving te dichten, maakt dit onderzoek een visuele, intersubjectieve vergelijking tussen nieuwsfoto’s en icoonfoto’s. Omdat icoonfoto’s en nieuwsfoto’s beiden politiek en ideologisch geladen zijn, maar dit bij icoonfoto’s veel complexer is, is belangrijk om juist een analysemethode te gebruiken die deze connotaties links laat liggen. Tropen zijn beeldkenmerken die in beiden soorten foto’s veel voorkomen en tegelijkertijd geopolitieke contexten doorkruisen, waarbij zij een beroep doen op een bredere culturele consensus. Een tegenstelling tussen het Westen en de Ander kan hierbij wel gesymboliseerd worden, maar een beeltenis van een bepaalde oorlog waarbij bepaalde personen gemoeid worden wordt in een trope uitgesloten. Dit maakt een trope tot een goed te analyseren beeldkenmerk in het geval van een vergelijking tussen icoonfoto´s en nieuwsfoto´s, omdat deze directe politieke en ideologische connotaties overstijgt. Kleppe en Zarzycka (2013) maken in hun onderzoek naar motieven in de World Press Photo contest gebruik van een analyse op basis van tropen. Hierbij stellen zij dat een trope vier karakteriserende kermerken heeft, te noemen presence of body, recognisability, affective powers en symbolic accessibility. Deze vier kenmerken worden in dit onderzoek gebruikt en verduidelijkt voor de analyse van de invulling van tropen in icoonfoto’s en nieuwsfoto’s. Voor dit onderzoek wordt gemaakt gebruik gemaakt van een corpus van rampfoto’s, die vanwege hun karakter vaak veel duidelijke beeldkenmerken bevatten. Ook maken rampen en oorlogen tegelijkertijd een groot deel uit van zowel het nieuws als de geschiedenis. De visuele vergelijking op basis van tropen laat zien dat er veel vergelijkingen zijn tussen de tropen in icoonfoto’s en nieuwsfoto’s. Icoonfoto’s zitten vaak vol vooroordelen over menselijke rollen, bestaande tegenstellingen zoals man-vrouw, sterk-zwak en blank-zwart. De trope is het sterkst wanneer de symbolische tekens morele waarden overtreden. Ook bij nieuwsfoto’s zijn veel tegenstellingen te vinden, maar voor de niet-Westerse man zijn bij dit soort foto’s wel heldenrollen weggelegd. Ook zijn nieuwsfoto’s vaker afbeeldingen van acties, plotse gebeurtenissen en onrust in alledaagse taferelen. Uit de analyse blijkt dat er zowel verschillen als overeenkomsten wat betreft de invulling van tropen zijn binnen de vergelijking van icoonfoto en nieuwsfoto. Hoewel het onderzoek geen uitspraken kan doen over de daadwerkelijke statusverwerving van één foto, heeft het handvaten geboden voor eventueel verder onderzoek op het gebied van potentiële iconiciteit wat betreft beeldkenmerken.","['tropen', 'icoonfoto', 'nieuwsfoto', 'icoon', 'beeldvorming', 'fotojournalistiek']"

The first deals with contemporary exhibitions and the curatorial procedures that are introduced in the 1960s, while the other focuses more on Conceptual Art and its emergence during the same period. After 1960s, many artists introduced a more experimental and conceptual dimension in their work therefore, art started altering. More specifically, the integration of postwar sculpture into Conceptual Art and vice versa, brought about a transition in the curatorial procedures that were developed during the 1960s in the Netherlands and beyond. The main objective of this thesis is to examine the ways in which this progression occurred, by analyzing the innovative approach of Wim Beeren in the exhibition ‘Op Losse Schroeven’ and 40 years later Cherix’s prudent idea in the exhibition ‘In and Out of Amsterdam’. Through this critical investigation, an adequate and appropriate assessment of the emergent ‘new art’ is offered in combination with the alteration of art production. Through this research I intended to examine the roles of both international and Dutch artists along with international and Dutch galleries and museums, in the emergence of the abovementioned 'new art'.","['Conceptual Art', 'Exhibitions', 'Sculpture', 'Stedelijk Museum', 'MoMA']"

Unusual features in the colour classification of Modern Irish,"Swinkels, Inge","['Carlin, E.B.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis I investigate the unusual features found in the Modern Irish colour classification system, relative to features of colour naming found in other languages. Within the Indo-European language family, the Celtic languages are the only ones that have a grue category, which means there is one colour term denoting both green and blue, rather than distinct terms that express both these categories. In Irish, however, there is a term for grue, plus two additional terms for green and blue. This is not just a feature unattested in IE languages, it is an anomaly worldwide as well. Other dissimilarities with IE languages include the basic referents of colour terms when describing humans: in many languages, colour terms refer to complexion, but in Irish this is haircolour. Lastly, the total number of basic colour terms of Irish is unusual as well: despite the colour lexicon being very extensive, the colour terms denoting orange, pink, purple, and brown, are considered non-basic or secondary terms.","['Modern Irish', 'Celtic languages', 'Celtic linguistics', 'colour', 'classification', 'Berlin and Kay']"

This study examines the practices of Sida engaged as a donor agency in a PPP with UNIDO and Volvo in a project called Heavy Duty Equipment and Commercial Vehicles Maintenance Training Academy (HDECoVA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The analysis of documents and interviews collected during a field trip to Ethiopia reveals that a mismatch exists between the results captured by the project’s measurement frameworks and progress reports developed by UNIDO, and the expectations of the Swedish government. The study further reveals that this mismatch can lead to tension between the different actors in the partnership and an increased vulnerability of Sida. The findings of this research lead to the conclusion that there are reasons to believe these challenges could become a constrain for donor agencies to address complex development challenges in the future or pose challenges for the collaborative process of PPPs.","['accountability', 'results', 'private-public partnerships', 'aid', 'development cooperation']"

(Tess Ilijse)","['Bartelings, N.L.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In deze scriptie worden verscheidene portretten van Maria van Bourgondië (1457-1482) onderzocht. Van deze Bourgondische hertogin, die van 1477 tot 1482 aan de macht was, zijn veel portretten overgeleverd. Zij vormt hierdoor een interessante representante van haar tijd, positie en gender. Centraal in deze scriptie staat de vraag hoe Maria van Bourgondië geprofileerd werd in portretten uit de periode 1457-1519 en wat de betekenissen en functies waren van de manieren waarop zij werd uitgebeeld. Met een analyse van een corpus portretten uit deze periode heb ik aangetoond dat drie rollen overheersen die de figuur van Maria vervult in de portretten: hertogin, vrome en devote echtgenote en een derde rol hier aangeduid met de term mater familias. Met het onderzoek heb ik getracht de verscheidene manieren waarop een vijftiende-eeuwse vorstin in de kunst is verbeeld aan het licht te brengen. De manieren waarop Maria is verbeeld tonen aan dat vrouwen diverse traditionele rollen toebedeeld kregen in de vijftiende-eeuwse kunst. Maria van Bourgondië wist zich desondanks als regerend hertogin te profileren. De portretten van deze hertogin vertonen verscheidene weergaven die elk hun eigen betekenis en functie hadden. In deze scriptie wordt echter maar een klein deel van de vele overgeleverde portretten van Maria van Bourgondië behandeld. Veel ruimte is nog over voor verder onderzoek naar portretten van deze bijzondere vrouw.","['Maria van Bourgondië', 'hertogin', 'Bourgondië', 'Maximiliaan van Habsburg', 'portret', 'vijftiende eeuw', 'vrouw', 'rollen', 'Bourgondisch']"

Solvyns and Brandes: Colonial Art at the Intersection of Ethnography and Natural Science,"Sinha, Neilabh","['Meersbergen, Guido van']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis is a comparative study of the works of two artists from the Low Countries, Frans Balthazar Solvyns and Jan Brandes, who worked in two different cities - Calcutta and Batavia - in the late 18th century. In doing so, it identifies connections between the art produced and the existing discourses of ethnography, natural science and art. The thesis uses insights from these discourses to understand knowledge production in the period and the role played by art in this process. The cultural context of this art production is also explored through an examination of publications of the Asiatic Society and the Bataviaasch Genootschap - “learned societies” that were founded in the late 18th century in the two colonial cities. Thus, the thesis attempts: a) to describe the knowledge production activities of the late-18th century in the colonies, with art as the focus and point of departure, and b) to thereby analyse and understand the period in terms of the transition from rariteitenkabinets of the post-Renaissance period to the state sponsored knowledge creation of the 19th century. In doing so, the thesis addresses the links between knowledge and power and analyses essentialism as an effect of the application of scientific thought and illustration to ethnography.","['Solvyns', 'Brandes', 'colonial art', 'ethnography', 'natural science', 'scientific illustration', 'colonialism', 'knowledge', 'essentialism']"

The 1641 Rebellion wasn’t as clear-cut as it seems. There are discussions within the historical community about the nature of the rebellion, and the possibility of multiple rebellions occurring at the same time. Was the rebellion in 1641 one rebellion, instigated by the nobles in Ulster who wanted to put pressure on king Charles I to do something about their growing grievances and followed by popular uprisings throughout the country? Or are those popular uprisings a separate rebellion that on its own caused nobles to join the revolt to safe their livelihoods? This also raises the question if the revolt was top-down or bottom-up. The main focus is on the perpetrators of the rebellion. This also gives the opportunity the participate in a third discussion, namely if the 1641 Rebellion really was an Irish Catholic uprising against their English Protestant neighbours, or if this view should be nuanced.","['Ireland', '1641 Rebellion', 'Sligo', 'Roscommon', 'Leitrim', 'Wars of the Three Kingdoms']"
The US-Japan Security Alliance and Okinawan Anti-Base Identity Did enhanced military cooperation between the United States and Japan have led to a decline of Okinawan base opposition?,"Viergever, Marnix","['Black, Lindsay']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to investigate whether there is a connection between improved US-Japan security relations and Okinawan base opposition in the period 2010-2014. Security relations between the United States and Japan are for a large extent shaped by the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Security and Cooperation, which permits the continuous presence of US military bases in Japan to maintain peace and safety in East Asia. Nowadays Japan still hosts approximately 50,000 US forces. About 50 percent of these forces are stationed in Okinawa, which consists of only 0.6% of Japan’s territory. Furthermore, 75 percent of the US military facilities in Japan are also located in Okinawa, demonstrating the unequal US military burden between Okinawa and mainland Japan (Okinawa Prefectural Government 2011). The United States, as well as Japan, agree on the importance of stationing a large amount of US military forces in Okinawa because of the strategic location of the island for maintaining Japan’s peace and safety in East Asia. However, large anti-base protests in Okinawa illustrate that a significant part of the local population opposes the security norm of the Japanese government to host US forces. Improved political ties, joint disaster relief operations and increasing external security threats have resulted in enhanced military cooperation between the United States and Japan in the period 2010-2014. Also, during this period Japanese favorable views on the United States were with an average of 71.6% also somewhat higher than between 2006 and 2009 (58.25%) (Pew Research Center 2015). Nevertheless, it is not clear whether US-Japan security collaboration also resulted in a better image of America among the people in Okinawa. Therefore, the main research question is: to what extent has enhanced military cooperation between the United States and Japan led to a decline of Okinawan base opposition?","['Japan', 'United States', 'Okinawa', 'Bases', 'anti-base opposition', 'Futenma']"

Diagrammatic Distortion: Semiotics and Simulation in Anne Carson’s Autobiography of Red,"Hiskes, Andries","['Korsten, Frans-Willem']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Anne Carson’s Autobiography of Red (1998) is a text that traverses the boundaries between postmodernism and mythology. As such, it investigates and builds further upon its own mythological foundations, rooted in the poem Geryoneis by the ancient Greek poet Stesichoros. The aim of this study is to explore, through a close reading of Carson’s text, how we can move from thinking about mythology solely in terms of representation towards thinking of mythology in terms of simulation. This argument will be made by taking a semiotic approach. This approach not only makes a diachronic study of mythological language possible, but also makes it possible for us to think about how signs traverse (spatially) between different sign systems. The study starts by using René Girard’s approach of reading myths as texts of persecution in order to uncover Autobiography of Red’s underlying ideological codes. Linda Hutcheon’s theories concerning historiographic metafiction and parody are then used in order to explore how Carson, in using syllogistics, investigates the origins of the supposed blinding of Stesichoros by Helen of Troy. The study then moves on to a diachronic study of the sign systems in the text using Roland Barthes’ theory concerning myth as well as his metalingual system. The final chapter of this study starts out by conceptualizing a notion of textual space, following Barthes’ distinction between ‘work’ and ‘Text’ and Gilles Deleuze’s and Felix Guattari’s philosophy of smooth and striated space. After having conceptualized textual space, a diagrammatic and simulative function of mythology is theorized.","['autobiography of red', 'mythology', 'semiotics', 'postmodernism', 'post-structuralism', 'textual space', 'simulation']"

Architecture in Film: The Lost Utopias of Late Modernism Revived,"Coo, Inez de","['Bruyn, Eric de']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the reasons for the reappearance of late modernist utopian architectural projects in recent artist films. Three films by three different artists (Martha Rosler, Dorit Margreiter and Patrick Keiller) have been selected for their critical use of post-war architecture in film or video and the way they look specifically at suggestions of revolutionary social changes to the concept of the house. In each chapter one film or video is examined in relation to the architectural project(s) it discusses, specifically with regards to the intentions of the architect. Rosler, Margreiter and Keiller show three ways of reflecting upon the way we think about late modernist housing, a type of housing that was extremely ambitious in attempting to change the way we think about shelter and social communities, and is, at least stylistically, still of great influence to the architectural projects that are built today. All three artists have a distinct political awareness that appears in the way they discuss architecture. Consisting of structures that consolidate ideology, architecture is fascinating for the profound influence it has on our everyday life. I argue that the return of modernist utopias in the collective cultural imagination shows a need for a cautiously hopeful attitude towards a future that moves beyond the so-called end of history. These three artists look towards futures that were suggested in the recent past, futures that have been long since dismissed, and try to find elements that may be salvaged from their way of looking towards structural social change that might be of use for us today in combating the effects of neo-liberal influence on everyday life. Because of its contingent, disembodied and fragmented nature, film proves to be the ideal medium for investigation and can be seen as creating its own version of radically subjective utopia in each case study.","['architecture', 'video art', 'film', 'utopia', 'modernism', 'le corbusier', 'constant nieuwenhuys', 'martha rosler', 'dorit margreiter', 'patrick keiller', 'situationism', 'functionalism']"

Na een enorme publieke schuld te hebben opgebouwd, kon de stad in 1493 niet langer aan haar betalingsverplichtingen voldoen. In deze scriptie wordt aan de hand van stadsrekeningen en bestuurlijke bronnen uit de periode 1477-1515 besproken hoe Leiden weg kon zakken in dit schuldenmoeras en wat de gevolgen hiervan waren voor haar bestuurlijke autonomie. Hierbij speelde de uitgifte van lijf- en erfrenten een grote rol. Ondanks dat Leiden van 1504-1510 onder curatele van mr. Floris Oom van Wijngaarden werd geplaatst, lijken de maatregelen van de hertog na het uitbreken van de crisis niet tegenstrijdig te zijn geweest met de belangen van de Leidse stedelijke elite. Zij hadden er eveneens belang bij om de publieke schuld te saneren, omdat de stedelijke kredietwaardigheid hen persoonlijk aanging in de vorm van represailles die buitenlandse schuldeisers op hen toe konden passen in het geval van wanbetaling door de stad. Door de handen ineen te slaan wisten de stadsbestuurders en het landsheerlijk gezag Leiden te behoeden voor een werkelijk faillissement en de daarmee gepaard gaande verwoestingen.","['krediet', 'public debt', 'stadsfinancieën', 'rekeningen', 'Middeleeuwen', 'lijfrenten', 'Leiden', 'Floris Oom van Wijngaarden', 'Staet ende atterminatie']"

As he claimed, for native speakers’ standard norm is acceptable, however, for the rest of the circles, local variations are more logical. Georgia is part of the third, extending circle, and thus, the question which deviances from norm are acceptable and which are not is the question to ask. The presented study of Georgian-accented English is the first research in the Georgian-English accent studies that is oriented to find out the three groups of pronunciation mistakes: unintelligible, disturbing and ugly. This was possible by creating three groups of listeners, native English speaking, Georgian and Dutch English speaking judges who assessed the Georgian-English speech and singled out the problematic features. The results of the study has shown some serious mistakes that hinder the intelligibility and are disturbing. However, those features that were assessed as ugly were not considered to be very important and were advised to improve only on the higher level of English teaching.","['SLA', 'English Language', 'Linguistics', 'Language policy']"

Political transition and historical memory in Spain: discourses and practices,"Sendra Soto, Alberto J.","['Storm, Eric']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"After the death of Franco in 1975, Spain undertook a process of democratization (The Transition). In many aspects, this process constituted a great example for many other democratic transitions. However, some shadows still overflies the political system emanated from that process. During the decade of the 2000's, many associations started a process for the recuperation of those forgotten through the 'Pact of Silence': a tacit agreement by the main political actors of The Transition, which left aside the memory of the victims of the dictatorship, in order to consolidate a weak emerging democracy. This social demands finally generated a Law of Historical Memory (2007). However, many political and social sectors in Spain considered it as insufficient. With the change of government, in 2012, this law was 'de facto' derogated. The spanish recent memory, then, constitutes an active weapon in the spanish political battlefield; still nowadays, and despite the law. This thesis, through oral interviews to testimonies of different generations, seeks for the differences in the discourse about the historical memory between those who lived The Transition, and those who did not. Does it exist a generational gap?

Indian Perceptions of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road: a Discourse Analysis,"Alphen, H.F. van","['Black, L.O.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC’s) growing economic power has been frequently linked with its growing political and military power. Academic articles and Indian newspapers interpret China’s Maritime Silk Road (MSR) policy in threatening and in a non-threatening ways. The dominant discourse interprets the MSR from realist (strategic competition) and liberalist (economic cooperation) perspectives. However, the picture is not as clear-cut as it seems: the literature lacks a constructivist and poststructuralist approach. This paper attempts to fill this gap and considers the study of media representations as an important tool for understanding international relations and the promotion of foreign policy in India. It uses a poststructuralist discourse analysis as a method in the case study on the ‘China threat’ and MSR discourse in four online Indian newspapers. In line with French poststructuralist Foucault, it demonstrates the importance of discourse, identity, knowledge and power. The discursive construction of China as Other in the Indian media is based on historical identity formations. Identity is at the heart the ‘China threat’ discursive foundations: the ‘String of Pearls’ (SOP), India’s neighborhood, China-Pakistan relations and the ongoing Sino-Indian border dispute. In representing the ‘truth’ about the MSR as a future threat to India, the Indian media fails to address China’s participation in global anti-piracy missions. The ‘China threat’ discourse is produced and reproduced for India to domestically implement a strong strategic IOR policy, to invest in the army, and transnationally to deepen diplomatic ties with neighboring IOR countries and to establish a security alignment with the US and Japan.","['maritime silk road', 'discourse analysis', 'India', 'China', 'string of pearls', 'identity', 'threat perceptions', 'media representations', 'indian ocean region']"

In this sense, it describes the types of mixed structures reported in previous literature and it reviews contradictory claims considering, on the one hand, that mixed structures are just part of a discursive strategy (code-switching), and on the other hand, that they are part of a fully-fledged new code (a so-called mixed language). The thesis concludes that only by measuring the stability of mixed structures across speakers and across contexts of use will it be possible to reach a solid conclusion with regard to this matter. Secondly, against the prevalent assumption that Paraguayan Guarani is mostly homogeneous across regions, the thesis conducts an acoustic study comparing the formant values of Guarani vowels produced by urban speakers from Asunción and rural speakers from Concepción. Results show that the differences between individual segments are not statistically significant. However, significant differences are revealed in the F2 of two vowels, /ɨ/ and /i/, in specific consonant environments, thus pointing to potential variation in coarticulation patterns.","['Paraguayan Guarani', 'phonetics', 'language mixing']"

When Artists Invent Documents: Three Fictional Archives in the Context of Postmodern Archival Theory,"Burger, Christine","['Bruyn, Eric de']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The artist-as-archivist is not a new concept. Artists have been dealing with the archive for some time, mostly employing personal or found material. There is a small group of artists that works with fictional archives, meaning that the archives they produce are made from scratch. These archives do not necessarily represent actual events but rather point towards issues surrounding the archives that seem problematic. This thesis will look at three of these fictional archives and bring them in connection with postmodern archival theory. This theory advocates a more open and active archive, and in this context it seems possible to discuss fictional archives and their implications. Aspects such as identity, minorities, production of knowledge, Institutional Critique, trauma and the writing of history will be considered. As the three main case studies will serve The Fae Richards Photo Archive (1996) by Zoe Leonard, Fauna Secreta (1985) by Joan Fontcuberta and Pere Formiguera and The Atlas Group (1989-2004), initiated by Walid Raad.","['Artist-as-archivist', 'fictional archives', 'photography', 'art', 'trauma', 'gender', 'episteme']"

To what extent is the gradual deterioration in NATO-Russia relations between 1991-2014 causally related to NATO's eastward expansion in Eastern-Europe?,"Unverdi, Gurbet Behram","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Recent challenges in the relationship between NATO and Russia have led to suspension of political and military cooperation. This thesis assesses the causal relationship between the gradual deterioration of relations and NATO’s expansionism to Eastern Europe. This research uses process tracing of key events and developments to draw a historical pattern of the transformation in the relationship since the ending of the Cold War up until the Ukraine Crisis of 2014. To analyse the relation, this work uses a hybrid model of neorealist and social constructivist theories to understand power relations and motivations that underlie the developments. Overall, NATO’s eastward-enlargement to include former Soviet republics in its membership and its aspirations of creating a European-wide anti-ballistic missile defence system are identified as the main components that fuelled the deterioration in relations with Russia. Responding from a sense of insecurity, Russia has grown more assertive in regional politics to ensure its national interests. Russia has been able to project power in regional politics in aims of regaining its former power status. Russia’s increasingly confrontational stance has eventually manifested in military interventions in Georgia and Ukraine. The current suspension of relations does not constitute a structural new Cold War, but nevertheless is the product of an overall deterioration of relations.","['NATO', 'Russia', 'Transatlantic', 'Cold War', 'contemporary security agenda', 'euro-atlantic security', 'security studies', 'international security', 'ukraine crisis', 'Georgian War', 'neorealism', 'social constructivism', 'enlargement', 'bmd', 'ballistic missile defence', 'annexation of crimea', 'CFE', 'EU', 'nato-russia council', 'NRC', 'NRF', 'USA', 'USSR', 'Putin', 'Obama', 'New Cold War', 'post-Cold War', 'reset']"

Translating Teen Tongue,"Genegel, Samantha","['Zeven, Katinka']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the difficulties faced when translating American Young Adult Fiction into Dutch. P.C. Cast’s House of Night series contains many elements of American everyday-life, such as a Western accent, references to American celebrities, to typical American stores, and to the American school system. The cultural identity and the representation of dialect is explored extensively in that the situatedness of the novel in America determines the identity of the novel’s characters. It is therefore interesting to compare the first book of the series with its Dutch translation, in order to see how the translator dealt with the specific American elements of the source text. This task has become more difficult for the translator, because apparently there is no consensus on the literary category of Young Adult fiction and the thereto belonging age group. Whereas the original novels are marketed towards a readership of 16 years and older – as they are not suitable for young readers’ –, the Dutch translations are marketed towards different audiences, all considerably younger than the original novels. If the translator has taken this intended readership into account, it will have had considerable consequences for the vocabulary use in the novel. My aim is therefore to examine various possible translation-problems in order to see how much the intended readership has influenced the translation-process and therefore the novel as a whole.","['Young Adult fiction', 'readership', 'House of Night', 'translation', 'teen language']"

Hoer vs Hunk: tienermeisjes framen sexting,"Stoop, Malou","['Burger, Peter']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Het is geen hedendaags verschijnsel dat de maatschappij bezorgd is over de seksualisering van jongeren. Met de komst van smartphone en sociale apps maakt zij zich tegenwoordig zorgen over nieuwe seksuele praktijken die jongeren zouden uitvoeren. Sexting is er één van. Sexting is een samenvoeging van ‘sex’ en ‘texting’ (‘sms’en’) en kan worden gedefinieerd als ‘het versturen van seksueel getinte foto’s of berichten’. Er bestaan twee visies over sexting. De aanhangers van de eerste visie, bestaande uit psychologen, juristen, ouders en journalisten, beschouwen sexting als een maatschappelijk probleem. Bijna alle jongeren, en met name tienermeisjes, doen aan sexting en ondervinden hier schadelijke gevolgen van. De aanhangers van de tweede visie erkennen dat sexting risicovol kan zijn, maar vinden dat het beeld dat de media en andere maatschappelijke groeperingen hanteren op morele paniek gebaseerd is. Volgens hen worden de schadelijke consequenties en prevalentie van sexting overschat. Er is echter ook een overeenkomst tussen beide visies. Beide groeperingen hebben niet aan de doelgroep waarover zij spreken – tienermeisjes - gevraagd hoe zij tegen het fenomeen sexting aankijken. In dit onderzoek wordt daarom geanalyseerd hoe meisjes van 16 en 17 jaar sexting framen. Deze tienermeisjes vellen een negatiever oordeel over meisjes die aan sexting doen dan over jongens die dit seksuele gedrag vertonen. Meisjes zijn een ‘hoer’, jongens zijn ‘sexy’.

Only a handful of sustained literary discussions of his work have been published. An unfortunate event, since many of his books give a representation of post-war developments in the form of (post)-apocalyptic stories, and these narratives reflect the society’s fear of what humankind was able to invent, and how these inventions could be harmful to its very existence on a global scale. By embedding non-fictional post-war developments in his science fiction, Wyndham created stories that – even today – can be read as warnings against such dangers. This thesis examines the ways in which post-war social, political and economic developments are embedded in Wyndham's The Day of the Triffids (1951), The Kraken Wakes (1953), The Chrysalids (1955), and The Outward Urge (1959), and what rhetorical force his stories have. Moreover, the thesis concentrates on how the science fiction genre enabled Wyndham to warn his readership for the possible fatal consequences of the Cold War parties’ behaviour and how the genre facilitated Wyndham in expressing criticism of these two power blocs. Furthermore, it focuses especially on Cold War elements that affected British society, such as the nuclear threat, the Space Race, and the changing social position of women.","['John Wyndham', 'Cold War', 'Post-war British society', 'Cold War Science Fiction', 'The Day of the Triffids', 'The Outward Urge', 'The Chrysalids', 'The Kraken Wakes', 'Post-war societal position British women', 'Nuclear fear', 'Space Race']"

Vegetarianism and Veganism in Indonesia,"Laarse, Maxime C. van der","['Henley, David E.F.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,South and Southeast Asian Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"During the 39th World Veg(etari)an festival, which was held in Jakarta in 2010, the International Vegetarian Union manager John Davis said that Indonesia’s vegetarians were ‘one of the biggest vegetarian societies in the world’. Vegetarian and vegan restaurants are mushrooming in the cities, the Indonesian Vegetarian Society and the Vegan Society of Indonesia have a solid base of members, and the number of individual practitioners of the lifestyle appears to be big as well. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Theosophy all have contributed in some way to the development of vegism in Indonesia, as well as the foundation and spread of the Vegetarian Society via Australia from England, originally focussing on animal-rights. Indonesia is also interesting to analyse for this matter as its traditional diet seems to be well-suited for veg(etari)ans, as it consists of tofu, tempe, jackfruit, many vegetables and fruits, and originally (almost) no dairy products. This thesis analyses the social movement of vegetarianism and veganism as present in Indonesia, focussing on the origins, the organised forms of vegism, as well as zooming in on the individual practitioners, by depending on a (self-)conducted questionnaire, analysing demographics, reasons, the practices and the process.",

Framing in de berichtgeving over asielzoekers,"Mes, Jolijn","['Leeuwen, Maarten van', 'Pilgram, Roosmaryn']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In Nederland vragen steeds meer mensen asiel aan, maar het ontbreekt bij veel Nederlanders aan persoonlijk contact met asielzoekers. Hierdoor wordt hun beeld vaak voor een groot deel bepaald door berichtgeving in de media (Gamson 1996, 4). Aangezien framing een essentieel en onvermijdelijk onderdeel in de nieuwsberichtgeving is, zal dit een grote rol spelen in de beeldvorming van Nederlanders over asielzoekers. Het is daarom van belang om inzicht te hebben in de mate van framegebruik in dit soort berichtgeving. Dit onderzoek kijkt naar het framegebruik in de berichtgeving over het plaatsen van een opvangcentrum voor asielzoekers in Oranje in zes Nederlandse kranten. In dit dorp was sprake van een ‘problematische plaatsing’: er kwam veel onrust en media-aandacht bij kijken. De frames die behandeld worden zijn gedestilleerd uit eerder onderzoek naar framing in de berichtgeving over asielzoekers. Dit heeft geresulteerd in een bundel van elf frames. Dit onderzoek wijkt af van eerdere onderzoeken, doordat er gekeken wordt naar zowel regionale kranten als landelijke populaire en landelijke kwaliteitskranten. Er is voor dit corpus gekozen omdat uit eerder onderzoek is gebleken dat er verschillen aan te wijzen zijn tussen deze drie verschillende soorten kranten. Het inzetten van hetzelfde frame heeft niet altijd hetzelfde effect: sommige frames kunnen bij de lezer een positief gevoel teweegbrengen, terwijl hetzelfde frame in een andere situatie de lezer juist een negatief gevoel bezorgd. Om inzicht te krijgen in deze verschillende toepassingsvormen is er ook onderscheid gemaakt in het positief dan wel negatief gebruik van de frames. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat alle elf frames voorkomen in het behandelde corpus. Ook is gebleken dat het slachtofferframe het vaakst wordt ingezet en het moraliteitsframe het minst vaak. De regionale kranten en de landelijke kwaliteitskranten laten de grootste verschillen zien met elkaar. Zo verschillen ze het meest in welke frames vaak gebruikt worden, de hoeveelheid frames per artikel en voornamelijk in de verspreiding van positieve en negatieve frames. De landelijke populaire kranten vallen in de resultaten steeds tussen de regionale kranten en kwaliteitskranten in. Deze resultaten geven de indruk dat de kwaliteitskranten een significant veelzijdiger beeld laten zien binnen een artikel dan de regionale kranten. Er zijn echter een aantal kanttekeningen met betrekking tot de betrouwbaarheid van de codeerwijze. Voor verder onderzoek zou het aan te bevelen zijn om met meerdere codeurs te werken om zo de betrouwbaarheid te toetsen.","['asielzoekers', 'framing', 'nieuws']"

Vleselijke lust en een dodelijk verlangen,"Warmenhoven, Elise","['Helen, Westgeest']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Hedendaagse fotograaf Joel Peter Witkin onderscheidt zich van zijn tijdgenoten door het portretteren van dode vrouwenlichamen in een gecreëerde surreële en ideologische wereld. Zijn zwart-wit beelden van levenloze vrouwen, gepositioneerd en gestut als voertuigen van erotische verlangen zijn tegelijkertijd choquerend en uitdagend. Witkins doel is om grenzen te overschrijden, waardoor het profane wordt ontsloten en de mogelijkheid zich aandient om seksuele taboes te doorbreken. Dit onderzoek richt zich hoofdzakelijk op de manier waarop deze vrouwenlichamen zijn geportretteerd en hoe seksueel verlangen in relatie tot de dood een hernieuwde betekenis krijgt binnen de traditie van de post mortem fotografie. Witkin bewijst dat Freuds theorie over de driften en instincten van de mens (Eros en Thanatos) nog steeds toepasbaar is op de kunsten en dat de kunsthistorische traditie van het portretteren van de vrouw als weerloos, passief slachtoffer en fetisjistisch object een geschikt onderwerp is om seksuele taboes en vrouwenonderdrukking ter discussie te stellen. In dit onderzoek worden literaire en kunsthistorische voorbeelden gebruikt ter illustratie om Witkins perverse en gewelddadige beelden te analyseren en te plaatsen binnen een feministisch kader.","['Eros Thanatos', 'Joel Peter Witkin', 'Sigmund Freud', 'Surrealisme', 'gotische roman', 'postmodernisme', 'post mortem fotografie', 'feminisme', 'seksueel geweld', 'George Bataille']"

Dit onderzoek verlegt de aandacht naar de journalistiek, naar de media. Hadden de media invloed op dit debat? En zo ja, welke? Dat zijn de hoofdvragen in dit onderzoek dat zich baseert op een analyse van krantenartikelen tussen 1991 en 2001. In 1991 verschenen de eerste krantenartikelen met kritiek op het rechtsherstel en in 2001 werd de discussie daarover gesloten door de uitkeringen van de Nederlandse overheid aan de vervolgingsslachtoffers van de Holocaust. Voorafgaand aan deze krantenanalyse volgt een historiografische analyse van de literatuur over het Nederlandse rechtsherstel ten behoeve van de Joodse slachtoffers. Daarin wordt kritisch gekeken naar de bestaande literatuur, naar wat er in die literatuur wordt uitgelicht, en de stiltes in die literatuur. Op deze manier worden ook de verscheidene standpunten die de overheid, de wetenschap en de Joodse gemeenschap hebben ingenomen in deze periode geïnventariseerd. Daarna volgt een historische analyse van de media, waarin 1997 een keerpunt blijkt. Dit is het moment waarop de discussie over het rechtsherstel in de kranten oplaait.

Transfiguration into the world of dreams: The adaptation of foreign musicals for the Takarazuka stage,"Carvalho Santos, Caroline de","['Smits, I.B.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"While references to the Takarazuka Revue are by no means scarce in academic writing about Japanese theatre or popular culture, the perspective chosen by most authors is often based on gender studies. This is an understandable trend, considering the Revue’s status as a long-running company whose actresses consist solely of unmarried women. It is exactly this status that opens the door to inquiries regarding the gender identification or sexuality of the seito (lit. ‘student’; the performers of the Revue are referred to as seito to nuance that they are still in training rather than being professional actresses1), as well as that of the fans who consume this form of entertainment. However, this approach places the focus on the theatrical productions and their value as entertainment as being subservient to gender mechanics of the Revue instead of the other way around. Often, the creative work involved in the lavish productions staged by Takarazuka receive but a brief mention in academic writing, if any at all. It is my opinion that the manner in which Takarazuka shows are written and staged is equally important to the understanding of the Revue’s popularity as the efforts made by its seito to master the art of playing another gender. To this end, I will focus on the adaptation of foreign productions to the Takarazuka stage. Because these adaptations invariably undergo changes in order to be assimilated into the Revue’s repertoire, I believe that by researching the differences with the original material will offer an interesting perspective in which way the writing and staging of shows contributes to creating the world of dreams Takarazuka is famed, or notorious, for.","['takarazuka', 'japanese theatre']"

'To have' or not 'to have': a survey of predicative possessive constructions in the Pacific Northwest Coast linguistic area,"Kruijt, Anne","['Crevels, Mily']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Stassen (2009) defines four major types of predicate possession: with-possessives, topic-possessives, locational possessives and have-possessive. This thesis examines which of these types occur in a sample of the languages of the Pacific North West Coast linguistic area. The data used for this research was collected for eight languages and the sample is one of convenience, though it was attempted to gather a sample as genetically and geographically dispersed as possible. The possession-type for each language was determined by examining data gathered with a questionnaire and/or with existing data from grammars or dictionaries. The research shows that four of the languages use a predicativized with-possessive construction, one has a basic with-possessive, one has a topic-possessive, and two have a dual system consisting of a have-possessive in combination with one of the other basic types. Stassen (2009) formulates four universals of predicative possession, one for every basic type of construction. The universal for with-possessive is as follows: if a language has a with-possessive, it has deranked DS-sequences. The data shows that Gitksan is a with-possessive language, but that it has balanced DS-sequences. This makes Gitksan a counterexample to the with-possessive universal as formulated by Stassen (2009).","['predicative possession', 'Pacific Northwest coast', 'linguistic typology', 'with-possessives', 'have-possessives', 'locational possessives', 'topic-possessives']"

Resurgence of Violence in Tajikistan: A Conflict Resolution Perspective,"Gazieva, Madina","['Bader, Max']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Five years of bloodshed in between warring factions of Tajikistan had culminated in the signing of the 1997 Peace Agreement which was designed and supervised by international actors. The process was hailed as one of the most successful peace-building operations in conflict resolution history. Thirteen years later, Tajikistan witnessed an insurgency which stemmed from the very same resentments that caused the civil war in the first place. Why did the peace agreement fail? To answer this question, this thesis draws on conflict resolution theory by identifying its claims and shortcomings. The study pinpoints four main propositions made by conflict resolution theorists, namely: role of regional identity, state capacity, third party mediation and agreement design and power-sharing, and evaluates their effects on the resurgence of violence in Tajikistan. This thesis additionally tests the relevance of conflict resolution theories by applying them to Tajikistan archetypal case answering the central question of ‘how can the 2010 resurgence of violence in Tajikistan be explained by conflict resolution theory?’ The study finds that while conflict resolution theory is effective in explaining the resurgence of violence in Tajikistan, peace-building in Tajikistan was unsuccessful; the democratisation process did not take place, the agreement was democratically limited and failed to address the causes of conflict while power-sharing provisions were short-lived and naïve. The peace process in Tajikistan resulted in a ‘negative peace’ where peace is characterised by the mere absence of war, demonstrating that the capacities of peace-building are limited, and should be treated with caution.","['Tajikistan', 'Peace-building', 'Conflict resolution']"

Party Competition and the British Election of 2015: The Interaction between Niche Parties and the Mainstream,"Bekker, Iris A.","['Griffiths, Richard T.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The role of smaller parties in British politics has become increasingly interesting since the 2010 election produced the first coalition government in post-war Britain. The period leading up to the 2015 election offers a good opportunity to study the dynamics between these smaller parties and the establishment. Many of these smaller parties can be considered niche parties as they are defined by a single or limited set of issues. This allows for an assessment of party competition employing B.M. Meguid’s PSO Theory. This thesis provides a case study of party competition prior to the British General Election of 2015. It includes the two mainstream parties; the Conservative and the Labour Party, and two niche parties, UKIP and the SNP. Through the case study, the thesis questions the influence that niche parties have on mainstream parties prior to elections in Britain. In particular, it argues that; 1) electoral threats posed by UKIP and the SNP significantly influenced the strategies of the Conservative Party and the Labour Party; 2) these strategies subsequently influenced the electoral performance of UKIP and the SNP. The findings show that threats posed by the niche parties influenced the electoral strategies of the Conservative and Labour parties. In the face of niche party threats between the 2010 and 2015, the Conservatives adopted four strategies; the immigration-, the EU referendum-, the EVEL- and the anti-coalition- card. The first three strategies were directed against UKIP’s imminent threat. Both the third and fourth strategy were used as a weapon against their mainstream opponent; the Labour Party. In reaction to the surge of the SNP, the Conservative and the Labour Party both sought to accommodate Scottish voters on the issue of devolution. Yet, the most influential strategy involving the SNP concerned the anti-coalition card. In response to Conservative allegations of a Labour-SNP deal, Labour disregarded the SNP as an acceptable coalition partner. These two strategies of the mainstream parties were influential for the SNP’s landslide. Besides, they helped the Conservative Party to attract defectors to UKIP back to the fold. UKIP’s high vote share was partly the result of the Labour Party’s failure to stop its supporters outside of London from defecting to the niche party. However, the fact that UKIP merely obtained one seat in the election was mostly due to voter distribution and the electoral rules. Altogether, the analysis of party competition between the four parties prior to the 2015 election supports the arguments outlined in the thesis.",

So far, most of the studies tend to focus on how terrorist organisations operate instead of how they incorporate their constituency. therefore, this thesis will give an insight in the structure of terrorist organisations and how they control their constituency. However, this thesis will develop a better understanding of the relation between the organisation and their constituency. The construction of citizenship is assessed by looking at three elements of citizenship construction: legal status, participation, and identity. It is argued that both the IRA and PLO have experienced a similar construction of citizenship in their organisation and sheds a light on how terrorist organisations create coherence in their organisation. The terrorist organisation optimise these elements of citizenship to include and bind their constituency to their organisation and their objective.","['Terrorist Organisations', 'Citizenship', 'IRA', 'PLO']"

Labour unions and inequality: A comparative study of Brazil and South Korea,"Padmos, Rick","['Carmody, Michelle']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research tries to answer how the influence of labour unions can have a positive or negative effect on inequality during and after the neoliberal era. Neoliberalism is a broad concept referring to an economic paradigm that rose in the 1980s. It is built upon classical liberal thoughts on self-regulating markets. The best way to conceptualize it is to split neoliberalism into three intertwined categories: As an ideology, a mode of governance and as a policy package. It can be seen as an ideology, because decision-makers and economists see neoliberalism as the only way to achieve economic growth. The second category refers to certain modes of governance. Neoliberal modes of governance include the transformation of bureaucratic mentalities to entrepreneurial mentalities. The last category, neoliberalism embodies itself as a set of public policies in deregulation of the economy, liberalization of trade and industry and privatization of state-owned companies (Steger & Roy 2010: 11-14). Neoliberalism had positive effects such as economic growth. However, a striking effect is that it increased the gap between the rich and the poor. This was possible because neoliberal organisations possessed extensive resources, they had alliances with key elites, and had strong personal networks outside the government (Andrain 2014: 23). Consequently due to privatization the state provided less welfare and safety nets. Labour unions are one of the best social groups to defend the rights of the labourers and to advocate a more equal society. As Mcguire (1999) shows in his research it appears that great influence of labour unions have a negative effect on equality. In this research a comparative study will be made of Brazil and South Korea regarding the role of labour unions in the reduction of inequality.","['neoliberalism', 'labour unions', 'inequality', 'Brazil', 'South Korea', 'comparative study', 'neoclassical economics', 'new unionism']"

Lula was inaugurated right after Brazil was named one of the most important emerging economies, demonstrating the growing potential and role the Brazilian economy began to play worldwide. Furthermore, it has been mentioned that Lula’s presidency was unlike any other. He is said to have been truly dedicated to advancing economic growth, while also aiming for social change and reducing inequality levels. Can the three phenomena mentioned in the nexus be combined and tackled simultaneously? Consequently, by focusing on the Lula era (2011-2013) this thesis will attempt to answer the following research question; to what extent can economic growth go hand in hand with a reduction in poverty and inequality?

Latin America's New Discourse towards Drug Policies: The Role of Cannabis Legalization in Uruguay,"Hoz Schilling, Mario de la","['Wiesebron, Marianne']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In December 2013, Uruguay became the first country in the world to fully legalize cannabis, regulating all processes from the possession, growth, and distribution of the plant. As a breakthrough in the international drug control regime, it reflects the rapidly shifting paradigm towards drug policies in Latin America. The international and mostly U.S. led attempt to eliminate the production, transport, sale and consumption of so-classified illicit drugs, or narcotic and psychotropic drugs, has been for several decades an important dynamic in the relations, movements and conflicts across all of the Americas. The social and human costs have been very high and an increasingly larger amount of activists, politicians and researchers have spoken out against this often called ‘war on drugs’ and have sought for alternatives to avoid the costs paid by society. These alternatives mostly focus on cannabis, the most consumed illicit drug worldwide (UNODC: 2014, 41). Accordingly, this paper will mostly limit its scope on the specific role of cannabis. Though the prohibitionist model continues to prevail in the region, an increasing amount of countries have decriminalized cannabis and the reform debates in the region have gradually gained legitimacy and importance in the past few years. Due to the importance and impacts that these transnational trends have in the region, this paper will assess what role the legalization of cannabis in Uruguay has played in the discourse towards drug policies in Latin America. The objective of this study is to analyze the Latin American paradigm shift away from prohibitionism and towards the regulation of cannabis as an alternative to the war on drugs and, in such context, the decreasing hegemony of the U.S. in the region. The case study, more specifically, will look at the transnational effects that Uruguay’s decision has had in the region to reinforce these trends.","['Drug Policies', 'Latin America', 'Uruguay', 'Cannabis', 'Legalization']"

The articulation of Kashubian identity: Changing conceptualizations and the influence of historical circumstances,"GUTIERREZ MORENO, ANGELA","['Moody, Simanique']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Kashubian people constitute an ethnic and linguistic minority that inhabited the historical region of Pomerania, and they currently occupy certain parts of the Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland (predominantly in Gdansk and Slupsk). The linguistic situation of Kashubians has always entailed implications as to their identity, mainly due to the oppression of Kashubian as a minority language (Grabowska and Ladykowski 2-3). Identity issues had already emerged after the collapse of the German empire and with the Kashubians’ consequent adherence to the new Polish state, cultural distinctiveness was harshly damaged. The present thesis analyses the changing conceptualization of Kashubian identity in former Danzig-West Prussia, the Wartheland and Upper Silesia. Time wise, the thesis principally focuses on the end of the First and the Second World War under the National Socialist regime (1919-1945), yet taking into account the impact of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries in Kashubian history. The main aim is to look at the articulation of the Kashubian identity over time and consider the impacts of the contextual historical circumstances and state influence on Kashubians.","['Kashubian', 'identity', 'language', 'Nazi', 'Prussia', 'conceptualizations', 'minority', 'Germanization', 'Volksliste']"

Zo ontstond er onder de vrouwelijke consument een groeiende behoefte aan ideeën en tips over kleding en uiterlijke verzorging. Deze behoefte werd ingevuld door de komst van overwegend Westerse en later ook Aziatische modetijdschriften vanaf 1988 die de lokale modetijdschriften markt domineerden. De internationale tijdschriften brachten nieuwe beelden en ideeën over schoonheid met zich mee. Dankzij het groeiende aanbod aan internationale cosmetische producten werd het voor de Chinese consument mogelijk het Westerse uiterlijk na te streven. De ideeën over schoonheid en mode worden in de gemondialiseerde commerciële wereld bepaald door de keuzes van anderen. Hierbij spelen redacteuren en de inhoud van modetijdschriften in China een belangrijke rol. Werd er bij de introductie van vele internationale modetijdschriften rond de eeuwwisseling nog weinig rekening gehouden met de lokale context, zo is er de laatste jaren een trend te zien waarbij de inhoud juist wordt aangepast aan die context. Na 1978 lijkt er langzamer-hand een scheiding te zijn ontstaan tussen uiterlijke schoonheid (voornamelijk ingevuld door Westerse uiterlijke kenmerken) en de innerlijke, morele schoonheid (Chinese modellen). Het uiterlijke schoonheidsideaal is heel commercieel en wordt toegeschreven aan de culturele ‘ander’ (Westen), terwijl de innerlijke schoonheid en de daarbij horende culturele waarden blijven toegeschreven aan Chinese vrouwen.","['China', 'Advertising', 'Women']"

This thesis addresses the research question: How have conservative Christian ideologies stigmatized sexual behaviours in Kazo during the HIV epidemic in Uganda? In order to answer this, we first discuss how the fight against HIV created circumstances under which conservative Christian groups managed to gain a foothold in Ugandan politics and society. We subsequently give a historical overview of the spread of the HIV virus in Uganda, and the overall role that conservative Christian faith-based organizations (Evangelical and born-again) played during this time, from providing HIV related relief to those in need, to supplying HIV education. We show how the growing influence of these groups and their ideologies led to attempts to politicize and stigmatize homosexuality by associating it with HIV, culminating in the passing of the 2014 Anti-Homosexual Act. The thesis addresses recent local consequences of this legislation and analyses the results of an ethnographic case study that was conducted with the assistance of a local charity in the Kazo slum in Kampala, an area heavily impacted by HIV. Information was gathered by interviewing a sample of the local population. We examine the perceptions of HIV and how the new conservative Christian ideologies have reshaped local views on sexuality and morality. Furthermore, the impact of the recent anti-homosexuality legislation is analysed.","['HIV', 'Uganda', 'Christianity', 'Anti-Homosexuality Act']"

Parallels are drawn between the xenophobic ideologies of both types of party, the views these parties had regarding the existing European political structures and dynamics, and their shared use of populism as a pragmatic political tool. All in all, it is found that, even though both phenomena share inherent similarities, due to the fact that the Great Recession was not as “bad” as the Great Depression and that contemporary Europeans remain skeptical of far-right parties, the great difference remains the discrepancy in scale between the two series of events, which is reflected in exactly how much ground both types of far-right parties gained during their respective time periods.","['Great Depression', 'Great Recession', 'Populism', 'Far-right', 'Nazism', 'Euroskepticism', 'Islamophobia', 'Antisemitism', 'Xenophobia', 'Front Nacional']"

China's engagement in Southeast Asia through the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA),"Tran, Anh Vu","['Wang, J.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Two relevant trend can be identified as the primary driving forces behind change in the regional order of Asia. The emergence of a dense web which connects states and non-state actors through economic agreements, and the rise of China. The initiation of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) has developed wide speculations of China's regional ambitions. This paper attempts to provide an understanding of China's foreign policy, its motives to pursue closer integration and the implications that it will have for the regional order. The main proposition of this thesis argues that China’s foreign policy is aimed at establishing a multilateral order in regional and global economic governance with an ultimate goal of limiting economic reliance on the ‘West’. Thus, China’s aim is to pursue gradual changes within the economic order which will accommodate the economic interests and preferences of China better as well as that of other emerging and developing countries. The pursuit of a multilateral order corresponds to a need of a secure and stable environment which enables China to develop its own potential and dilute Western influences in the region without significant disruptions. The ACFTA inherently forms an aspect of China’s regional policy objectives as it serves to stabilise China’s relations with the most significant trade organisation in East Asia and corresponds to China’s desire to gain a more prominent role in international institutions and cooperative frameworks. This thesis suggests that economic interdependency forms the primary driving force behind these developments which foster the need for regional stability and closer economic cooperation. ACFTA has shown that China is willing to make significant economic concessions towards Southeast Asia in order to foster its cooperative relations. However, it should be considered that China will make the necessary concessions without damaging its ‘core interests’ in terms of economic development and access to strategic resources.","['ACFTA', 'China', 'ASEAN', 'ASEAN-China Free Trade Area', 'China-ASEAN Free Trade Area', 'CAFTA', 'multilateralism', 'economic regionalism']"

Neoliberal policies have opened up national markets to international competitors. In Latin America the traditional cultivation of coffee by small farms started to become challenged due to the subjection to the competition with multinational enterprises. Farmers have set up cooperatives and the Fair Trade Organization have assisted them to obtain a fair access to the market. In addition, fair trade cooperatives intent to promote the development of the farmers’ living standards. The Fair Trade cooperative, Union of Indigenous Communities of the Isthmus Region in Mexico and Society of Small Producers for Coffee Export in Nicaragua, seem to have reduced the vulnerability of farmers to fluctuating market prices. Although, the Fair Trade cooperatives have offered farmers a platform of development and sustainability, the effects of Fair Trade and the cooperatives internal procedures are likely to be influenced by the social, economic and political context of each country. However, while limitations are present to the effects of Fair Trade, the organization has provided a positive step in the process of sustainable development and equitable international trade.","['Fair Trade', 'Cooperatives', 'Nicaragua', 'Mexico', 'Union of Indigenous Communities of the Isthmus Region', 'Society of Small Producers for Coffee Export', 'UCIRI', 'SOPPEXCCA', 'INMECAFE']"

Latin America – a region which never fails to attract scrutinising scholars owing to its socio-economic and political landscape, has witnessed the burgeoning of its domestic corporations and the creation and cessation of alliances among its component states. This thesis analyses the relationship of these two actors in order to shed light on the effects of globalisation in the region. It shall then argue that the process of globalisation in Latin America should not be seen in a generalising perspective. Rather, as the circumstances in the region’s economic and political landscapes suggest, the relationships between Multilatinas and the regional economic blocs indicate the “lumpiness” of the movement of capital, that is, occurring at different levels of intensity and not happening at an increasing level of global cohesion believed to eradicate nation-states.","['Multilatina', 'Mercosur', 'Pacific Alliance', 'Globalisation', 'Latin America', 'Regional economic blocs', 'transnational corporations']"

Met behulp van een commerciële spraakherkenner, die apart getraind is in het Nederlands en in het Duits, is onderzocht in hoeverre cognaten herkend worden in de ´eigen´ taal en vervolgens in de andere taal. Deze cognaten zijn ingesproken door een perfect tweetalige spreekster van zowel het Nederlands als het Duits. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat beide spraakherkenners niet goed overweg kunnen met woorden in isolatie, zonder linguïstische context (30% correcte responsie voor het Nederlandse model versus 36% voor het Duitse model). Wel kunnen beide herkenners met een korte zin van het type ´voorzetsel-cognaat-slotwoord´ overweg en scoren ze in de eigen taal goed: het Nederlandse model geeft 76% correcte responsie versus 76% voor het Duitse model. Cognaten uit de andere taal zijn voor de herkenners niet eenvoudig te verwerken. Beide herkenners scoorden zeer slecht, hoewel het Duitse taalmodel relatief een stuk beter Nederlandse woorden herkende dan Nederlandse model de Duitse. Het Duitse model herkende minder dan 11% van de cognaten correct, het Nederlandse model herkende slechts 4% van de cognaten correct.

"A site with benefits? Conflicting Interests in Heritage Conservation of Hampi, a World Heritage Site","Misier, Amrita","['Swamy, Priya']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper examines the conflicting national and local interests in heritage conservation of the World Heritage Site Hampi in Southern India as a result of contrasting ideas concerning the definition given to the site. With underlying motives of presenting an authentic national image beneficial in promoting its national economic and cultural interests in the global competition, India makes use of heritage conservation in constructing the desirable image of its heritage. This is reflected in the demolition of the Hampi bazaar in the name of conservation to preserve an idealized authenticity of the past through heritage, which came at the cost of the eviction of many local residents whose life was intertwined with the site through this bazaar. In doing so, the nation engages in global branding through UNESCO and attempts to accommodate to their paradigms, which however are critiqued for its Eurocentric approach, not suitable for an Asian heritage context. While this approach classifies Hampi as a cultural heritage, a more appropriate term would regard the site as a living heritage, taking into account the local interests that are ignored in the pursuance of the national interests through Hampi resulting in the conflict of the Hampi bazaar.",
Why is War Possible From a Human Perspective?,"Germanacos, Nicholas L.","['Sneller, Rico']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis attempts to investigate the reasons for going to war and committing warlike actions from a human perspective. It endeavours to answer the question why atrocities are possible even by individuals with little or no exposure to violence. The French philosopher Gabriel Marcel wrote on a theory named 'the spirit of abstraction' in which he elaborated upon the manner in which abstraction causes killing to be justified in the mind of the individual. This theory is applied to the Napoleonic war diary 'The Recollections of Rifleman Harris' and investigates the notion's application to the Napoleonic Wars from a more general perspective. It follows the story of Rifleman Harris and attempts to explain how he set out as a farm boy and returned a man that had waged war with an utterly different perspective of the world. It also aims to raise suggestions about whether Marcel's theory can be applied to ""modern"" times and that abstraction is responsible for so much of the cruelty and malice present in society.","['Napoleonic', 'War', 'Philosophy', 'Marcel', 'atrocity', 'ethics', 'human', 'Harris', 'Rifleman Harris', 'Napoleonic Wars', 'spirit of abstraction', 'abstraction']"

Identity by exclusion: Japan’s exclusionary nationalism and its impact on domestic minorities,"Richards, Kieran","['Wakefield, B.A.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Zainichi Koreans have been excluded Japanese society by a latent structure of discrimination that is encoded in the Japanese constitution and promoted by homogeneous society idealists such as Nakasone. This latent structure becomes blatant when the notion of Japanese homogeneity and cultural superiority is challenged. This drive for exclusion exhibits itself through anti-foreigner rhetoric of politicians such as Ishihara who instrumentalise fear and nationalism for their own political ends, and manifests itself as negative portrayals of Koreans in media and through Zaitokukai protests. Understanding the Zainichi Koreans within the context of Japanese national identity shows that Koreans are denied an identity, a history, and legal and economic rights by the dominant narrative of a homogenous and culturally superior Japan. When this narrative is challenged, it is then reinforced by nationalistic politicians and the Zaitokukai who actively exclude the Zainichi. Japan’s national identity has been constructed in opposition to its heterogeneous past and contemporary heterogeneous countries. For its ethnic minorities that are associated with its multiethnic past, they face losing identity and blatant discrimination in modern Japan.","['Zainichi', 'Japan', 'Nationalism', 'Marx', 'Exclusion', 'Identity', 'Nakasone']"
Becoming Kim Il Sung: Establishing and maintaining a personality cult,"Akker, Stephanie Karianne van den","['Ceuster, Koen de']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"On July the 8th 1994 North Korea was struck with the heaviest grief imaginable. Their Great Leader, Comrade, Father and 'the Sun' of the nation passed away. The leader who had come to be seen as immortal had left his people behind, leaving the recently created state in the hands of his designated successor and son Kim Jong Il. In the poem cited above, the author expresses the passion North Koreans feel towards their leader. When a leader comes to decease, the admiration often moves on to his successor. Nevertheless, the warmth and obsession felt towards the deceased Kim Il Sung only grew stronger as time went by. The excessive public admiration and devotion for the founder of the North Korean state continued to bloom into what can now be seen as one of the strongest personality cults of the modern era. (Kim 158) This passion and admiration has been driven and is sustained by a sophisticated deployment of various forms of culture representing a very specific reading of North Korea's history that makes national history revolve around the life of the Great Leader, Kim Il Sung. History, as Jordanova (2000, 4) explains, is not absolute, but always created and hence needs to be seen in perspective. In the case of North Korea; history is built around the Great Leader's personality cult, integrating the idea of an eternal leader into the past of the nation, and thus making them intertwine. North Korean history declares that there is no North Korea without the Great Leader. This historical narrative goes unchallenged as all media and culture are under the control of the Workers' Party of Korea, the founding and ruling party of North Korea (Britannica). Culture and history, under these monolithic circumstances does not amount to anything but another form of propaganda, used to create and manipulate Kim Il Sung's personality cult. Propaganda is the spreading of ideas and information with the purpose of influencing an institution, a cause, or a group of people (Britannica). It is a mode of communication through which a society can be manipulated and influenced. The target's opinion can be distorted in order to support a particular cause or belief. Throughout the years, propaganda has evolved into the form of texts, artwork and films. (White) Through propagated media and culture governments and authorities are able to secure their desired benefits. By carefully considering different types of culture and media in North Korea, the leader-focused construction of history can be put together as pieces of patchwork creating a single quilt. More specifically, an examination will be made of the length of measure taken in North Korea by it's authorities to install the profound belief in the immortality and benevolence of the Great Leader Kim Il Sung. This thesis will show how a personality cult is created and simultaneously analyze how it is maintained in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, describing the various methods of maintaining a personality cult, achieved through the mobilization of cultural, media and the arts, all of which are adapted to a fabricated historical storyline in order to sustain the leaders' image. For example, written texts serve as tools through which the Workers' Party of Korea is able to adapt North Korean history to revolve around Kim Il Sung. Academic publications and journal articles use the power of words to project the authors' and the authorities' interpretation onto the public. Equivalently, visual art makes a contribution to the development of Kim Il Sung's personality cult. These arts include e.g. visual propaganda, portraits, badges and paintings. Besides written and visual works, performing arts also have a significant impact on the creation and preservation of a powerful personality cult, as can be found in theatrical performances such as opera, film, and television programs, all of which recite and relive the days of glory passed. This 'glory passed' presented to the nation through performances evidently has no other intent then to serve as another propaganda tool emphasizing the essentiality of Kim Il Sung's existence. (Kim 158 - 159) It is indisputable that in North Korea cultural products do not only serve the purpose of entertainment, but more importantly, are instruments for controlling and mobilizing society through the creation of Kim Il Sung's personality cult. Propaganda has been incorporated into all aspects of North Korea's culture, successfully intertwining Kim Il Sung into the nation's illusion of history. Looking more closely at the relentless determination to build a personality cult and the manner through which the Workers' Party of Korea successfully beclouded the population's perception of reality will now be further investigated.",

Equatorial Guinea pursued the path of most Sub-Saharan nations and it achieved its independence in 1968, followed by a harsh dictatorship that continues until nowadays. However, the destiny of the country changed when oil resources were found in the 1990´s and Equatorial Guinea come to be the third largest oil producer of the continent. The recent economic growth has not been reflected in the life standards of most population and only 0.6% of the rising GDP is expended on education. The remarkable inequality, combined with a linguistic isolation under a dictatorship, have an important impact in the development of education and specifically primary education.

Moreover, this paper is concern with a remark in the peculiar use of Spanish as an official language and how the use of this language can affect the field of education.",

The research is based on the question: “In what way has community-based tourism improved the economic position of selected local communities in Bali, Komodo, Lombok & Java? How has this affected the sustainability of the natural environment of these communities between 1995 and 2015?” The introduction gives a brief insight into the affiliations the author has to Indonesia and the growing concerns arising from the negative side effects tourism has on the environment. The thesis consists of 3 chapters: the first chapter addresses the theoretical framework in which community-based tourism is explained. The second chapter gives an overview of historic developments in economics and tourism in Indonesia and the plans the Indonesian government has for the future. The third chapter consists of the case studies. The conclusion summarises the main findings. The author points out the inconsistency in the execution of community-based projects by the Indonesian government and the lack of reliable data to measure the actual progress. Much attention is paid to the preservation of nature but the benefits of tourism for the local community is still somewhat lacking.","['Community-based', 'tourism', 'Indonesie', 'Bali', 'Java', 'Komodo', 'Lombok', 'sustainability']"
From Ignorance to Hope: A Study of the Stigmatisation of Homosexuality in India,"Ball, Olivia","['Lindblad, J.T.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The thesis discusses to what extent do popular media contribute to the reduction of stigmatisation and discrimination against homosexuals in post-colonial India? The hypothesis is: development and expansion of media improves public awareness of the taboo topic of homosexuality which will in turn reduce the stigmatisation. The first chapter describes the socio-legal context of homosexuality in India, explaining the foundations for stigmatisation and discrimination against homosexuals and identifies who the main discriminators are. The second chapter uses Appadurai’s theory of scapes and in particular mediascape to help establish the influence such a scape has in reducing stigmatisation and discrimination against homosexuals in postcolonial India. This chapter draws similarities and conclusions from anthologies, auto biographies and biographies, newspaper articles and magazines, Bollywood films and Indian television. The final chapter is focussed on a case study of a growing influential homosexual social group in Mumbai named Gay Bombay that uses the media as a powerful tool in creating a safe haven for homosexuals since the late 1990s. The results have shown that homosexuality is a taboo topic with the current law criminalising the act. The extent of which media influence public opinion has grown with increased globalisation and the introduction of the internet. Some popular media outlets portray non-glamourized depictions of homosexuals more often than ever before but the stereotypical portrayal of the group is still common. It is definite that the public’s perception is directly influenced by media presentations and so if the media has the ability to promote a positive image of homosexuality one questions why they do not. Word of mouth belief is identified as one of the main problems that prevent change in opinion. Changing several million people’s opinions on such a taboo topic is a distant dream for homosexuals, especially whilst the law is still in place. One questions whether India has the political will to repeal its anti-homosexual legislation even if the media increases positive awareness of homosexuality.","['Stigmatisation', 'Discrimination', 'Homosexuality', 'India', 'Gay Bombay', 'Law', 'Media']"

The geopolitical implications of the economic rise of China,"Mecaj, Armela","['Lindblad, Thomas']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on the implications of the economic rise of the People’s Republic of China, giving special emphasis to the consequences of the process of liberalization of the nation’s economy had on the geopolitical realignment of the international political system. Furthermore, this thesis concentrates on the economic reforms that resulted in the opening of the economy of the People’s Republic of China since 1980s. Particular attention will be paid to the way in which this process of economic liberalization coincided with a fundamental reordering of the global economy. This work examines the implications of China’s economic prosperity on the Global South from the standpoint of the constant commercial links between Beijing and the Developing World. This realignment of the world economy has a significant impact on the process of globalisation, due to the fact that it brings about a situation in which the Global South is able to depend on itself for its sustained economic growth. In addition to this, the commercial links between Beijing and the Developing World allows the Global South to bypass the neoliberal principles that the Western financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank attempt to impose on them. This thesis postulates that the implications of the economic reforms implemented by China facilitated the realignment of the foundations of the global economic order. Moreover, this thesis also focuses on the different scenarios that could be brought forward due to the economic rise of China, including a possible revisionist quest in the geopolitical order, due to the increased importance of groupings such as BRICS. At the same time, this work will also deal with the ways in which the People’s Republic of China positions itself as a reliable partner in the global economic order in order to ensure its long-term growth.","['economic rise', 'geo political implications', 'global economic order']"

The country’s geographic position on the edge of the Balkans underlines the significantly negative implications that instability may have on Greek security and internal unity. Therefore, officials in the Greek political ranks have been very cautious on on-going developments in the Balkans and thus they have been attempting to establish a further model of cooperation and détente within the Balkan regional context.

Language Imperialism in the Indian Education System; Linguistic Minorities and the Role of English,"Reygers, Tamara","['Simanique, Moody']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Throughout history, globalization has become an intrinsic phenomenon in the development of world cultures and societies, connecting and driving the world communities ever closer together. An active role in this process has been played by language. The speed at which an international language, such as English, is spreading around the globe is becoming more and more evident in the daily life of every individual. The widespread use of this language as a lingua franca at an international level can be directly related to the strong political and economic imprint that the United Kingdom and the United States of America have had throughout the past centuries. During the course of the Era of Colonialism and Imperialism, western languages were forced upon countries and cultures by military coercion in order to facilitate the exploitation of colonies and be able to economically support the European markets. The spread of western languages in colonized countries gave way to language imperialism, a term coined by the famous scholar Robert Phillipson in 1992. The status of the English language however, has shifted from a colonial imposed language towards the role of being an internationally spoken language, which is now mainly considered as related to science, technology, modernity, and for poor people as a chance to escape poverty and oppression. For this reason, the question is posed of whether English still represents an example of language imperialism within non-native English speaking countries. English as a language has become so powerful and widespread that Matthew Parris described it, as “a seismic event in our species history” because no other language has ever predominated over others and approached universality (Watson 260). The dominance of one language is of special concern within the context of local languages and minority language groups as well as within the education systems of multilingual countries. India represents a suitable example when talking about this matter, in that the country has made significant use of English domestically and internationally promoting its importance at every social level. McKay sees the position of English in the world, as “a result of a series of interwoven factors and a complex process brought about by those who actively promote the language and those who consciously choose to learn it” (24). Thus, it can be stated that the most effective way to spread English is through education; however, also the most precarious one. Multilingual countries such as India see English language of paradoxical nature. On the one hand it is considered as a language of progress on the other hand it is a “language killer” of local languages. Hence, it is of great importance that language policies in the education system are implemented in order to safeguard the status of minority languages, preventing them from vanishing while also ensuring language rights to minority groups. The main goal of this paper is that of analysing the role of the English language as a global and imperial language in India, by assessing the impact of its influence in the lives of the students from minority groups, despite the conflicts that arose as a consequence of the implementation of the Three Language Formula by the Indian State. An analysis about language rights and language policies will be provided to gain a better understanding of the importance of exclusive linguistic rights, which are not yet implemented in the Indian constitution. Furthermore, the school system in India will be described by comparing statistical data about school enrolment, literacy rates as well as the diffusion of the English language among Indian schools as an increasing medium of instruction and the effect English language teaching has on students. Lastly, a case study of the Indian state Karnataka will be described in order to illustrate the problems related to the implementation of language policies leading towards debates over language choices in the education system. This will be done in order to draw the conclusion that even though India is known and proudly presents itself as a multilingual country embedded with highly diverse cultures, a homogenization of languages will be difficult to avoid within an increasingly globalizing and modernizing world. Arjun Appadurai brings about a significant truth, when he states that: “at the heart of globalization is the tension between cultural homogenization and cultural heterogenization” (Appadurai 295).","['Language Imperialism', 'India', 'Minority languages', 'English']"

Origins of political clientelism in Indonesia: Some statistical evidence,"Jacquemin, Brice","['Henley, David']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The main aim of this thesis is to identify the main environment in which clientelism thrives in Indonesia. The environments selected were urban and rural divisions, poverty and economically undiversified areas. Throughout the literature read on this topic, many authors point to these three factors as determinants of clientelism. With the help of Ward Berenschot, from the Royal Institute for Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV), and his Expert Survey on Clientelism in Indonesia, I was able to statistically support whether certain environments favour clientelism compared to others. The key findings from this thesis was that in Indonesia, based on statistical evidence, there is one of the three factors which increases the likeliness of clientelistic practices to take place. Both urban and rural divisions and poverty did not have positive findings statistically. There was no significant correlation to suggest that these factors played a large role in the determining of political clientelism in Indonesia. The only factor which did yield positive results was the economic environment of the region. The pattern, as the thesis will demonstrate, tended to be that the more economically diversified a region, the less clientelistic practices it had. The reasons as to why centre around the fact that economic diversity is healthy for a region, as it does not allow for a single actor to set the informal rules and practices. Despite quantitative analysis, this thesis also discusses the effects clientelism holds over Indonesian political life. Through the combination of quantitative and qualitative sources, this thesis effectively compares and contrasts literature to statistical findings. Therefore, I effectively can come up with independent opinions that are derived from these two sets of sources, and am able to support and contribute to authors which blame economic practices for clientelism.","['Political clientelism', 'Indonesia']"

Collective Memory in Latin America: the role of the Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica in the construction of peace in Colombia,"Krebsbach, Dörte","['Håvar, Solheim']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This bachelor’s thesis deals with the topic of collective memory in Latin America. It analyzes the role of the Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica (CNMH) in the construction of collective memory and concludes that it can be understood as a new approach to peace building. The thesis is divided into three parts: first it gives a theoretical background about the concept of collective memory. The second part deals with collective memory in the Southern Cone of Latin America and shows recent developments in the field. The third part turns to the Colombian case study. Here the Colombian conflict is shortly explained and the CNMH tasks are presented. Thereafter the discussion follows, which concludes that the construction of collective memory can be understood as a peace-building tool. In this context the focus of the CNMH on the victims is explained. The focus on the victims in the construction of collective memories about the Colombian conflict serves as a tool to relieve them from the psychological burden that presses on their shoulders due to the experienced violence. In addition the victims serve as a common denominator in memory, since by the focus on the victims the actual cause of the conflict, political and societal polarization, is taken out of the focus of the public commemoration process. In addition to that, by the focus on the victims, the CNMH registers civil society’s voices and ensures that they are heard. By giving civilians a greater level of participation in the public debate, the civil society becomes a third party actor, which is seen as crucial to an enduring peace process.","['collective memory', 'Colombia', 'Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica', 'victims', 'peace building']"

Intellectual Debates in the Early Turkish Republic: The Stance of Kemalist Elite towards Liberalism as a Competing Political Program,"Stergiopoulos, Dimitrios","['Zürcher, Erik-Jan']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this study is been examined the stance of the Kemalist elite towards liberalism as a competing political program of modernization and as one opposed to that of the RPP (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi – Republican People’s Party) in the period of 1922-1945. According to the prevalent viewpoint in most of historical analyses of the early republican history of Turkey, the path to the formation of the new state and the viewpoint of the ruling elite clashed with the liberal ideal. The hybrid ideological nature of Kemalism, as the dominant trend of Turkish nationalism, and its distance from other existing paradigms is clearly captured by Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk)’s phrase uttered during the debate on the abolition of the sultanate, ‘Biz bize benzeriz’ (We resemble ourselves). Through the study of the government’s acts and the intellectual debates of the period, I show that certain aspects of liberalism, such as constitution, rule of law, popular sovereignty and representative government, are an organic part of any modern political system, including Turkey's, and that any state has to adopt at least some of them if it is to be regarded as modern.","['Turkey', 'Kemalism', 'Liberalism', 'Political Ideologies']"

Eurocentric endeavour or empty rhetoric? An assessment of EU promotion of Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories through a Normative Power Perspective,"Pfeyffer, Nick Frederik","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The European Union’s approach towards the OPT on human rights has often been criticised for its conflicting interests, its internal division and coordination. However, simply renouncing the EU’s effort in human rights promotion in the name of realism, neo-liberalism or Eurocentric imperialism does not offer clarifications why the EU is committed to universal human rights norms and as to why the EU proved to be very weak in projecting its human rights agenda. This thesis suggests a normative power approach to the study of EU human rights policy towards the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Vital to it is the assumption that EU human rights policy and the relation between the EU and Israel has been and should be normative. To analyse this assumption, this thesis draws upon the existing literature in regard to ‘Normative Power Europe’ and adopt Ian Manners tripartite analytical framework in order to assess the EU’s adherence to human rights norms and its external identity, illustrate how the EU diffuses human rights norms, and how the impact of this should be evaluated in the case of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In doing so, this thesis aims to add to the empirical abundance of NPE literature and applying normative power to the human rights dimensions of EU-Israeli relations. To address these goals, the research shows the inconsistencies between the EU’s rhetoric and the diffusion of norms in Israel’s policy. This thesis will argue that the EU has normative intentions but that this is not a precondition for firm action and the diffusion of human rights norms in Israel. The protection of human rights as core norm of the EU is easily sacrificed when it has to compete with (vital) self-interests such as a collective European identity, security interests and strategic interests. The extent to which the EU pursues a human rights agenda is nevertheless very limited to the detriment of the EU’s normative identity.","['EU foreign policy', 'Israeli-Palestinian conflict', 'EU human rights promotion', 'Normative Power Europe', 'European identity', 'strategic interests']"

European Neighbourhood Policy: An analysis of the policy-formation process,"Schmitt, Annsophie","['Rood, Jan']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The European Neighbourhood Policy was launched in the year 2004 and aimed at promoting prosperity, stability and security in the neighbouring countries. The Thesis tests the explanatory power of European Integration theories in explaining the formation of the European Neighbourhood Policy on the European level. Elements of the theory of Liberal Intergovernmentalism, the theory of intensive transgovernmentalism and historical institutionalism are used. The Thesis aims to answer the question why the European Neighbourhood Policy appeared on the ENP, which factors influenced its shape and who were the relevant actors. The ENP is an interesting policy to research for different reasons. The countries participating in the ENP differ in their political and economic development. Furthermore, after the Enlargement round in 2004 it was one of the first foreign policies in which the European Commission had a significant role. The Thesis aims to analyse the interplay between the European Institutions which led to the current policy and the policy emphasis on security and stability. The relevant documents of the European Commission, the Presidency Conclusions of the European Council and the Conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council were analysed. The Enlargement of the EU in 2004 triggered the initiation of the ENP as it led to a new neighbourhood of the EU, this can be explained by the mechanism of Path-dependency. The preferences of the Member States of the EU, the decision to conduct in common the relations with the new neighbourhood on a European level and the economic cooperation with the new neighbouring states can be explained with the Liberal Intergovernmentalism. The intensive transgovernmentalism explains the distinguished role of few Member States in initiating the ENP, for example as Poland. It is assumed that the European Council and the General Affairs and External Relations Council set the objectives as prosperity, stability and security on the basis of the Member States preferences. The Commission used similar tools as in the policy of Enlargement, for example conditionality, and expanded its influence in the policy of foreign affairs. Its influence on the objectives was limited.",

The reason why this is, is the fact that ideologies in these areas when it comes to Hindus and Muslims dealing with each other differ. While in India the difference between the two groups are empathized and the inequality between the two religious groups is clear, on Bali it is the similarities between Hindus and Muslims that are stressed and there is no clear inequality between the two religious groups. Why the ideologies are different can be accounted for by the history of the two areas. In India, there was a time when Muslims invaded the country and ruled over them for more than three hundred years. It assumed by the Hindus in India that the Muslims in their country are descendants from the invaders and because of it they are enemies. On Bali, Muslims and Hindus have learned to live in harmony. They feel like they belong to one group. The economy on the island is dependent on an harmonious relationship between the two religious groups.","['Hindu', 'Muslim', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'Bali', 'Inequality', 'Religion', 'Hindu-Muslim relations', 'Communal violence']"
EU-Russia energy chessboard: from interdependence to conflict,"Yusibov, Isa","['Bader, Max']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Within the emerging geopolitical frameworks of the global energy market, the concept of energy security has become a vital part of state strategies for implementation, both by consuming and producing countries. Based on the trade relations between consuming and producing actors, one of the dominant ideologies in the political sciences (neoliberal interdependence theory) argue that economic interdependence between actors leads to co-operation on the bases of mutual benefits which decreases the emergence of conflicts. This thesis intends to shed a light on EU-Russia energy relations, specifically in terms of natural gas linked to energy security of EU as the biggest energy consumer and Russia as the biggest supplier of natural gas to EU. By comparing the energy policy strategies, current energy statistics and emerged interdependence, this thesis argues that the securitization of EU energy (gas) policy is experiencing serious challenges due to (increasing) European dependence on Russian gas resources which have not resulted in further co-operation but rising tensions. The main argument of this thesis therefore is that the nature of EU-Russia gas relations is too complex to be explained by the optimism of mutual interdependence between these actors","['European Union', 'Russia', 'interdependence', 'energy security', 'diversification']"

Although Sherlock Holmes has indeed been a commercial success over the past hundreds of years, it has had its struggles dealing with its popularity. The 19th century audience already practically forced Doyle to write a sequel to the novel. Since then Sherlock Holmes’ audience and their surroundings obviously have changed dramatically. Technological advancements are not the least important influencers of the original detective stories. The most recent adaptations are the Sherlock Holmes movies with Robert Downey Junior and Jude Law and the BBC series Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Both have again reached millions of fans worldwide resulting in a growing demand of new episodes. With that comes a third technological development, the Internet, where an enormous fan base was created and Sherlock Holmes got an online identity of its own. The question arises how a character and his detective stories can still be so popular today. Apart from using facts and numbers that indicate its popularity, this thesis will investigate the developments in British television that has supported the reinvention of the character of Sherlock Holmes.","['sherlock holmes', 'bbc', 'sherlock', 'online identity', 'popular culture', 'television studies']"

Avoiding the resource curse in Bolivia - dealing with lithium abundance through a historical lens,"Hoenderdos, Karel","['Thomas, Lindblad']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Bolivia has a failed past in terms of generating prosperity through resource abundances. The country held enormous reserves of silver, tin, and natural gas, and is now in possession of half of the world’s supply of lithium, necessary in the fabrication of rechargeable batteries. The assumption is that the world will turn to electric vehicles in the near future, a shift that will increase the demand for Bolivian lithium dramatically. The phenomenon that a country rich in resources suffers from economic distress is called the resource curse. This thesis attempts to delve deep into the underlying causes of past examples of the resource curse in Bolivia, to determine whether there are similarities that can serve as recommendations to the present. Political stability is a prerequisite to avoid the curse, as well as macro-economic policy and diversification in the economic sphere. Bolivia is holding one of the treasures of the 21st century and needs to create the optimum circumstances in which they can extract, produce, and export their lithium in sustainable conditions for sustainable profit.","['Lithium', 'Bolivia', 'Resource Curse', 'Tin', 'Natural Gas']"
Self-Harming Performance Art in the Russian Context: The Work of Pyotr Pavlensky,"Nelson, Ingrid","['Boele, Otto F.']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Russian and Eurasian Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"As artistic ideas move from one context to another, they change in context-specific ways with each adaptation. This has happened in Russia regarding adaptations of self-harming conceptualist performance art, a genre originally derived from the Conceptualist movement that began with Marcel Duchamp’s creation of Dada in the early 1900’s. Conceptualist performance first began in the Soviet Union in 1976, and for the next several decades continued to develop in the Russian context; through the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the chaos of the post-Soviet nineties, and the restoration of strong central control that has marked the Putin era. Most recently, Russian conceptualist performance was thrust into the international limelight with the controversial arrest of the punk-rock collective Pussy Riot, in 2012. Pyotr Pavlensky, whose work can be seen as one of the newest iterations of Russian Conceptualist performance art, began his performance career in response to Pussy Riot’s arrest, and the majority of his work has involved self-harming performances. From the perspective of interest in the translation of artistic principles from one context to another, this thesis attempts to analyze the extent to which Pyotr Pavlensky’s work adheres to Western frameworks of self-harming performance art and the extent to which it diverges from these frameworks.","['Performance art', 'Russian', 'Protest art', 'Pavlensky']"

Sovereign and Servant: Tibetan Gesar Epic as Ideological State Apparatuses in China,"Ching, Ming Cheung","['Blezer, Henk']",2015,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, there has been a resurgence of attention towards the Tibetan oral epic Gesar in the People’s Republic of China (P.R.C.). On the surface, it appears that Gesar re-enters the sight of the general public in China after the Chinese application to UNESCO was successful in 2009, by which the Gesar epic tradition is accepted and inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Immediately following the recognition from UNESCO, the Chinese publication of, on, and about Gesar exponentially thrived. All these celebrations of Gesar sounded so merry and joyous that it almost seemed a natural gesture by UNESCO, without taking into account the role of the Chinese State Apparatuses. Therefore, it is necessary to contextualize this event within the long and winding six decades of history of Gesar study in China, which has always been impossible to separate from political intentions. Constituted and powered by a gigantic and complex socio-cultural and political mechanism, which has been in motion behind the scenes long before 2009, many of these seemingly natural and spontaneous progressions of the modern image or representation of Gesar as a collective whole have always been carefully crafted. The main goal of the thesis is to identify the national ideology governing Gesar, and to show how the three main active sectors, which consist of the government, academia, and the publishing world, interact, function as, and formulate themselves into what Althusser describes as Ideological State Apparatuses, in order to reterritorialize Tibet and Tibetan culture through representing Gesar. Lastly, the final chapter is dedicated to efforts made, no matter how feeble, scattered, or spontaneous, struggling to deterritorialize the Chinese representation supported and endorsed by the hegemonic Ideological State Apparatuses.","['Gesar', 'Epic', 'Minorities', 'Tibet', 'China', 'Oral Tradition']"
