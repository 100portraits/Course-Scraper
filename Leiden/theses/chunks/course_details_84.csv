From development to developing: complexity science as applied to the political economy. Kenya's economic evolution within the New Silk Road.,"Ligteringen, Merei","['Forough, Mahmad']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Contemporary development studies needs a 'processual shift' from development to developing in order to transcend the static problematisation of African underdevelopment. The Washington Consensus and the Beijing Consensus still approach African underdevelopment according to a teleological view that is rooted in the belief that economic growth is necessary for achieving prosperity. By applying complexity science to the economy, this research fills the lack within International Relations (IR) of critically revising African development in contemporary, changing contexts. A model of economic evolution is employed to conduct a transformative analysis of Kenya's developing within the twenty-first century New Silk Road (NSR). Utilising the process tracing method to examine combined data sets, the researcher explores manifestations of the interdependence between evolutionary technological, institutional, and strategic forces. The analysis provides an innovative account of how and why economic evolution has emerged in Kenya. Future research should refine the model, but not define it: evolution is an endless process from which the economy as a complex adaptive system emerges.","['complexity science', 'economic evolution', 'developing', 'Africa', 'co-evolution', 'interdependence', 'physical technologies', 'social technologies', 'economic strategy', 'New Silk Road (NSR)']"

The San Marino Jinja and the globalisation of an ecological Shinto,"Fabbri, Davide","['Veere, H. van der']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"On the 21st June 2014, a Shintō shrine was inaugurated in the independent Republic of San Marino, as the second shrine outside the soil of Japan. The San Marino Jinja サンマリノ 神社 has been officially supported and recognised by Jinja Honchō 神社本庁, the administrative organisation that oversees about 80,000 Shintō shrines in Japan. However, what is mainly told about Shintō, still nowadays, is that it is the most antique and purely indigenous religion of Japan, a polytheism of immanent deities, defined as kami, strongly connected with the Japanese soil and centred around the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami, and the imperial family descending directly from her. But, if Shintō is actually such a not inclusive religion, is it possible to define this foreign shrine legitimately and consistently Shintō, on a theoretical and practical perspective? In other words, if the claims of Shintō are the ones of a Japanese religion for Japanese people only, why the San Marino Jinja has been officially inaugurated and how does a Shintō shrine operate in a different country and cultural context? Actually, as it will be possible to discover through this research, most of the pillars on which Shintō is based are not historically consistent or accurate. It will be also possible to demonstrate how historically inaccurate it is to consider Shintō an indigenous religion in the first place. Therefore to deconstruct these claims, which could obstruct a legit globalisation of it, in this research Shintō will be discussed first from a theoretical point of view. Firstly by deconstructing the general held idea of Shinto itself, following the academical debate of the last fifty years. Secondly, by presenting the new rhetoric promoted by Jinja Honcho about Shinto as the “World's new religion of ecology”, in order to increase its national and international popularity. With this theoretical background it will be then possible to analyse the phenomenon on a practical perspective. In order to do so a comparative analysis will be featured: the Ise Jingu, the oldest model reference of jinja, will be compared to the San Marino site. The result will demonstrate whether the European shrine presents the same operating patterns as the native one, and therefore whether is a legit instance of a successful Shinto globalisation.","['shinto', 'ecology', 'san marino', 'jinja honcho', 'religion']"
Art as the Marker of a Common Cultural Heritage in East Asia: the Case of Goryeo Buddhist Painting in Japan,"Pacini, Benedetta","['Paskaleva, Elena']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This MA thesis aims to analyze the relationship between Japan and Korea from the point of view of Cultural Heritage Studies and Art History. The case study I took into consideration is the Korean Goryeo Buddhist Paintings, a painting tradition which is almost disappeared by its homeland, but which conserves the majority of its last surviving examples in Japanese temples and museums. This case study has no precedents and it is an interesting tool to understand the political dynamics behind the discussion of cultural properties return in East Asia. This thesis will consider the study of the subject throughout various fields: it starts from the historical debate on the paintings, then it will move to the colonial period policies for the protection of cultural properties in Japan and Korea, to the modern legislation on the return of cultural properties, the creation of a Japanese scholarship around the Korean painting tradition and lastly, it will end with an art historical analysis of the items.",
Storytelling Practices in the New Millennium,"Ferrara, Martina","['Smits, Ivo']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this new millennium, the world is facing many drastic changes. Technology has revolutionized our lives and we are still trying to grasp the essence of this new age. Many traditions are fading, one of them being the practice of oral storytelling, used in pre modern societies by common folks to amuse themselves and to educate children at the same time. This essay analyzes the transition from traditional storytelling to mass communication, and its implications, through the case study of Japanese snake and dragon lore. The dragon, a well established symbol of Eastern Asian cultures, is the mythical evolution of a snake, considered to belong to the same species. The two animals are treated, however, in very different ways: the first is venerated as a kami , a god, while the second, even though object of worship too, is so feared that speaking about it is still considered a taboo. During the last century oral storytelling practice has been fading out, overpowered by the attractiveness of new medias. However, while the traditional practice is slowly dying out, storytelling itself is, I argue, just changed media. This essay will look into modern portraying of snakes and dragons, comparing tradition with new media. Through the example of Oscar winner movie Spirited Away (2001) and especially through the character of the white dragon Haku, it will be shown how anime and manga can represent a new way for the transmission and preservation of folk tales and beliefs. The director, Hayao Miyazaki, created the movie with the precise aim of educate children about Japanese values and traditions. Manga and anime can be considered a new form of storytelling, accessible simultaneously by anybody and anywhere in the world, that at the same time crystallizes a set of stories and beliefs.",['Snakes Dragons Spirited Away']

'To lobby or not to lobby.' The Battlegroup Concept as a first attempt to a practical embodiment of the European defence and security strategy.,"Wensing, Willem","['Sluiter, Peter']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The announcement of the establishment of rapid response European Battlegroups (EUBG) in the Helsinki Headline Goal of 2004, functioning as the first European military capabilities, was marked as the start for the establishment of a common defence and security policy in the European Union. It is argued that the EUBG were a logical consequence of de further deepening of the European integration process at the end of the 1990s and would prove that even on such a sensitive issue the member states were able to contribute without only pursuing the national interest. This research focuses on the implementation and impact of the EUBG concept and shows that there must be a clear distinction between paper reality and the military feasibility of supranational cooperation. Subject to many determining factors the EUBG have never been deployed and are not recognized as common support until today. As such, this research seeks for the substantiation why the EUBG did not succeed in their primary task as accelerator of the integration process. This research suggests that without a policy-based embedding, a military executive organization misses not only the right facilities, but it is also insufficiently supported to be successful in the end.","['Battlegroup', 'CFSP', 'CSDP', 'European army', 'Sovereignty']"
The Lagging of Dutch Women in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations,"Hiltrop, Jordana","['Choi, Nan']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In October 2000, the United Nations Security Council passed the resolution 1325 on gender mainstreaming. Several resolutions on this topic have followed and together these resolutions form the Women, Peace and Security agenda. This agenda encompasses all aspects of gender mainstreaming such as the protection of women’s rights in conflict and post-conflict, the prevention of sexual abuse against women and the enhancement of women in United Nations peacekeeping operations. This thesis particularly studies the latter issue, urging the Member States to deploy more women peacekeepers in peacekeeping missions. The larger deployment of women in missions is of high importance since the inclusion of women peacekeepers has advantages for conflict and post-conflict societies. Therefore, the United Nations advises the Member States to adopt a National Action Plan and aims to fully support national governments to implement gender mainstreaming in their policies and guidelines. This thesis hypothesises that there is a gap between the increasing policies established by the Dutch government in favour of gender mainstreaming and the reality of vast under-representation of Dutch women peacekeepers in peacekeeping operations. An analysis of the Dutch National Action Plans and Defence Action Plan demonstrates how the official Dutch governmental discourse fails to increase the participation of Dutch women in peacekeeping operations. The three main observations, resulting from this analysis, are the lack of internal focus within the national policies and the Dutch society on gender mainstreaming, the use of the word ‘women’ instead of ‘gender’ and the fact that the Dutch government treats the implementation of the policies as a final goal, while these policies are merely a sub-part of a larger effort. Therefore, it can be concluded that the official Dutch government discourse on the Security Council resolution 1325 shows the gap between the little change in Dutch women’s participation in peacekeeping operations and the adoption of policies in favour of gender mainstreaming.",['Peacekeeping Operatoins Women']

"Neither Show nor Showdown: The 'Fascist Effect' and Cooperative Nationalism in Late Colonial Indonesia, 1935-1942","Lengkeek, Yannick","['Luttikhuis, Bart']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the impact of fascist ideas and practices on anticolonial nationalism in late colonial Indonesia (primarily 1935-42). Focusing on the example of Partai Indonesia Raya (Parindra) and its youth organization Surya Wirawan, it aims at bringing together disparate historiographies on fascism, anticolonial nationalism, and Indonesian intellectual history. Moreover, it traces the first 'birth pangs' of Indonesian paramilitarism back to the late colonial period, thus arguing against the commonly held view explaining the militarization of Indonesian politics merely as an effect of the Japanese occupation (1942-45). Therefore, this thesis uncovers traces of a 'homegrown' tradition of paramilitarism that drew a considerable part of its inspiration from fascist role models. For the purpose of this study, fascism is applied as a heuristic tool to ask hitherto avoided questions about organizations like Parindra that have long been labeled as 'cooperative' nationalist parties. In doing so, this thesis considers Indonesia as one of the countless (emerging) nations that were receptive to the global fascist hype in the 1930s.","['fascism', 'anticolonialism', 'nationalism', 'decolonization', 'parindra', 'surya wirawan', 'soetomo']"

A more satisfying view on why big nations lose small wars: the decisive elements for asymmetric conflict outcome,"Brongers, Kevin","['Regilme, Santino']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Military conflicts with a significant difference in military power or strategy between two opponents are called asymmetric conflicts. Since World War II, research proves military and technological superiority proved to be a highly unreliable ground to predict the outcome of wars. This thesis aims to develop a more satisfying answer on why big nations lose small wars in asymmetric conflicts. The weaknesses and strengths of the currently leading explanations on asymmetric conflict outcome are assessed and combined. Instead of creating another rival view, currently known decisive elements for asymmetric conflict outcome are combined in a new, more comprehensive model. Although further research should assess the significance of the individual variables and the relevance of possible other variables, this thesis concludes that if the duration of an asymmetric conflict is short, the external political pressure aimed at the strong actor is low, the internal political pressure in the home country of the strong actor is low, a symmetrical military strategy is adopted and the strong actor received more military support from an external actor than its opponent, the strong actor is most likely to win the asymmetric conflict.","['global conflict', 'asymmetric conflict', 'Mack', 'Arreguin-Toft']"

Discourse on the Use of English in Dutch Pop Music,"Kuijt, Elisabeth","['Smakman, Dick']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper investigated discourse on the use of the English language in Dutch pop music. An important term in this research was societal treatment. Societal treatment studies deal with the explicit manifestations of beliefs, feelings and behavioural intents present in a wide range of communications (Santello 2015). The questions which were researched in this thesis were: What are the language attitudes of the people of the Netherlands towards Dutch and towards English in pop music? Do they have a language preference? Three methods were used to look at the societal treatment of English and Dutch in pop music: content analysis, indirect measurement, and direct measurement (Van Meurs 2010). In the content analysis, Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) was gathered about the use of Dutch and English in pop music from different forums. All this data was categorized into twenty-three different categories. The indirect measurement consists of a questionnaire which focused on the four tendencies which were found in the content analysis. These four tendencies were the connection to the song, the understanding of the song, the thoughts on the lyrics, and the enjoyment of the song. The goal of this questionnaire was to define if there were differences in the treatment of Dutch and English in these tendencies by letting people evaluate different video clips. In all the video clips Dutch artists were present but half of the video clips were sung in Dutch and the other half was sung in English. The direct measurement was the creation of two discussions online which focused on upcoming new Dutch music genres and the language attitudes of the Dutch towards the Dutch language. Overall, the results show that most of the Dutch have a negative language attitude towards their first language and have a language preference for English in pop music.","['language', 'pop music', 'language choice', 'opinions', 'societal treatment', 'The Netherlands', 'Dutch', 'English']"

The enunciation of 'terrorism' as a kind of power and its distribution in the West,"Hakim, Mona","['Chouraqui, Frank']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This paper is motivated by the assumption that ‘terrorism’ is a loaded and politically significant term, the use of which exudes and produces power relations. It acknowledges this, and also argues that not everyone has an equal right to use the term. This leads to an examination into the kind of power that is manifested in the use of the term, by putting the social constructivist framework to work and placing the semantic field of terrorism within that framework. It identifies a kind of power attached to the enunciation of the term ‘terrorism’ and argues that it is unequally distributed between perceived potential victims of terrorism and perceived potential perpetrators of terrorism. Drawing on Nietzsche’s genealogical analysis of morality, I argue that it is counterproductive to deny potential perpetrators the power of enunciation around the term ‘terrorism’ on the basis that this leads to a kind of slave revolt in terrorism. Redistributing the power of enunciation around the term ‘terrorism’ might remove the line that separates potential victims from potential perpetrators of terrorism and work towards reducing the threat of terrorism itself by allowing those potential perpetrators to exercise this capability within mainstream society, as opposed to seeking alternative communities to do so outside of it.","['Social constructivism', 'power', 'knowledge', 'terrorism']"

Examining EU Economic Sanctions against the Russian Federation using a Constructivist Approach,"Tsimpidaros, Vasileios-Ioannis","['Foulon, Michiel']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The thesis seeks to provide an explanation regarding the decision of the European Union to impose economic sanctions against the Russian Federation, after the latter’s involvement in Ukraine with the annexation of Crimea, by using a constructivist approach. The argument of this thesis for the constructivist interpretation of EU sanctions against Russia lies on the notions of EU Identity and EU Shared Values. The analysis of the purpose of the sanctions, their relation with the international legal order and the decision making process leading to their adoption, results in an interpretation that can be satisfactory under the constructivist approach. This approach is useful in order to explain EU’s imposition of economic sanctions against the Russian Federation as part of its broader foreign policy. Furthermore, by employing the method of Congruence Analysis the thesis draws inferences between normative predictions deriving from the given theory and empirical observations. Moreover, the argument of this thesis concludes that the special character of the EU, the notions of its Identity and Shared Values affected its collective decision to impose economic sanctions. Ultimately, the thesis renders the European Union to fit the constructivist assertions regarding the functions of the international system.","['Sanctions', 'European Union', 'Russia', 'Constructivism', 'Economic', 'International Relations', 'Foreign Policy', 'Crimea', 'EU Identity', 'EU Shared Values']"

India and the Responsibility to Protect: A Constructivist Analysis,"Pimpale, Arya","['Natermann, Diana']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"India has a mixed stance on the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) norm due to its partial support to only pillars one and two and not pillar three. The first two pillars go hand in hand with the country’s foreign policy on humanitarian assistance. The third pillar that states the responsibility of the international community to protect citizens from mass atrocities using militarily intervention is incompatible with Indian foreign policy’s longstanding commitment to sovereignty and non-intervention. To comprehend India’s stance on the R2P norm, this thesis traces India’s views on the earlier principle of humanitarian intervention. India’s past humanitarian interventions into its neighbours have taught the country that social change cannot be achieved through forced military intervention. While India has always been suspicious of western intentions behind intervention, the R2P norm is also a direct threat to India’s own sovereignty as it focuses on India’s domestic vulnerabilities such as its human rights situation. Combining Amitav Acharya’s theory of norm localisation and feedback, and Negron-Gonazales’ and Contarino’s theory on compatibility between strategic interests and local norms, this thesis argues that localization of the R2P norm has not been possible in India due to incompatibility of its strategic interests, domestic norms or both with the third pillar of the R2P norm. In order to localize and accept the norm, India has attempted to limit the definition of mass atrocities under the norm to ease the threat on India’s own sovereignty.","['Responsibility to Protect', 'India', 'Foreign Policy']"

De opkomst van een nieuw journalistiek genre: Hoe de doelgroep van NOS op 3 de digital longform ervaart.,"Burger, Lotte","['Pleijter, Alexander']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Met de komst van het internet is vrijwel het gehele medialandschap veranderd. De journalistiek is steeds meer een digitale onderneming geworden, een ontwikkeling waarbij tevens nieuwe journalistieke genres zijn ontstaan. Zo experimenteert men met nieuwe vertelvormen die inspelen op multimedia, interactie, hypertekstualiteit en creatieve features. Op die manier is ook de productie ‘Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek’ ontstaan. Dit verhaal van de New York Times dient als bakermat voor het opkomende journalistieke genre ‘digital longform’. De publicatie van ‘Snow Fall’ zorgt direct voor veel enthousiaste reacties, maar krijgt ook behoorlijk wat kritiek te verduren. Zo vragen critici zich onder andere af in hoeverre nieuwsgebruikers zitten te wachten op digital longform producties. Dit is een belangrijke vraag, want als blijkt dat de nieuwsconsument geen behoefte heeft aan deze nieuwe journalistieke vertelvorm, is het voor redacties zinloos om veel energie en geld te steken in het produceren van dergelijke verhalen. De enige manier om een antwoord te geven op de geuite kritiek, is door te onderzoeken hoe digital longforms worden ervaren door de gebruikers, iets wat tot dusverre niet of nauwelijks is gedaan. Dat is dan ook de kern van dit onderzoek. Via een hardopdenkmethode en aanvullende diepte-interviews wordt in dit verkennende onderzoek gekeken naar hoe de gebruikers van NOS op 3 de digital longform ervaart. Het jongerenplatform experimenteert al een aantal jaren met nieuwe journalistieke vertelvormen, waaronder de digital longform. Aan de hand van verschillende kenmerken die dit journalistieke genre vertoont, wordt geprobeerd de ervaring van de jonge doelgroep te onderzoeken. Hierbij wordt de volgende hoofdvraag gesteld: Hoe ervaren gebruikers van NOS op 3 digital longforms op het gebied van: het verhaal, multimedia, interactie, hypertekstualiteit en vormgeving? De proefpersonen krijgen twee digital longforms van NOS op 3 voorgelegd. Aan de hand van een kwalitatief experiment wordt gekeken hoe zij de producties ervaren aan de hand van de verschillende kenmerken die deze vertelvorm vertoont. Zodoende kunnen de resultaten uiteindelijk worden gekoppeld aan de theorieën die voor dit onderzoek zijn gebruikt, waardoor het mogelijk is een antwoord op de hoofdvraag te formuleren. Uiteindelijk is te zien dat beide producties zowel plus- als minpunten vertonen. Vooral de balans tussen de lengte in combinatie met de diepgang van beide producties heeft grote invloed op de ervaring van de nieuwsgebruiker. Maar ook de inzet van verschillende modaliteiten en de hoge mate van interactie spelen een belangrijke rol in de beoordeling van beide producties. Hoewel er bij de onderzochte verhalen nog veel verbeteringen mogelijk zijn, lijkt het erop dat de jonge nieuwsconsument in ieder geval openstaat voor meer experimentele vertelvormen in de journalistiek.","['journalism', 'digital longform', 'longread', 'NOS op 3']"

Negatieve feiten: een verdediging,"Efting Dijkstra, Karel","['Schaar, M.S. van der']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De centrale vraag in dit paper is wat een ware negatieve propositie waar maakt. Kan dit een negatief feit zijn, of moet het op de een of andere manier door een verzameling positieve feiten worden waargemaakt? Er is in de analytische filosofie een discussie gaande over het al dan niet bestaan van negatieve feiten en hier onderzoek ik de vraag wat feiten zijn en hoe negatieve feiten hier wel of niet inpassen. Of negatieve feiten worden erkend of niet blijkt vooral te maken te hebben met de opvatting over de ontologische status van feiten zelf. Russell, die het begrip introduceerde, ziet feiten als aparte ontologische categorie en laat toe dat feiten van abstracte aard kunnen zijn. Peter Simons, hedendaags verdediger van de analytische filosofie, beschouwt feiten aan de andere kant als fysieke objecten in een toestand. In deze materialistische visie is geen ruimte voor negatieve feiten en moet een ware negatieve propositie op de een of andere manier worden waargemaakt aan de hand van positieve feiten. Ik zal argumenteren voor een positie waarbij feiten uit zowel fysieke als abstracte onderdelen kunnen bestaan en dat feiten in ieder geval voor een deel afhankelijk zijn van denkende subjecten. Dat zij hiervan afhankelijk zijn doet echter geen afbreuk aan de objectiviteit van feiten. Met deze opvatting over wat feiten zijn, is er geen probleem met het aannemen dat negatieve feiten bestaan en vormt deze aanname de meest eenvoudige en natuurlijke oplossing voor wat een ware negatieve propositie waar maakt.","['Negatieve feiten', 'Bertrand Russell', 'Logisch atomisme']"

It offers new insights in the influence this group has had on the international developments of the West New Guinea dispute, thereby strongly challenging current historiographical consensus. This topic is approached from a New Diplomatic History perspective and focuses in almost equal parts on private archives, governmental archives and secondary literature. It showcases the value of expanding the notion of ‘diplomacy’ to also include non-state actors and therefore is able to present a more complete image of the exchanges between, and influences on, the countries involved in the dispute. Ultimately this thesis is able to conclude that the group was of large influence on the views and undertakings of the different governments involved in the dispute. This is accompanied by the group’s influence on Dutch domestic press coverage of the West New Guinea dispute. Such coverage turned out to be much more representative of the group’s opinion on the matter than that of the actual larger public.","['West New Guinea', 'Rijkens Group', 'Groep Rijkens', 'Private Diplomacy', 'New Diplomatic History', 'Nieuw-Guinea']"

Cannabis Regulation in Uruguay: Reducing Harm and Improving Security?,"Serné, Floris","['Wiesebron, M.L.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2013, the small Latin American republic of Uruguay became the first country in the world to legalise the production, distribution and possession of cannabis, whether it be for recreational, medical or scientific research purposes. This move has received harsh criticism and at the same time was hailed as ‘the tipping point in the War on Drugs’. This thesis will assess the origins of the policies as put forward by the Uruguayan state. The thesis is divided in three chapters. The first chapter will provide the academic debate surrounding legalisation of drugs in general and cannabis legalisation in particular, and the most important arguments in favour of, as well as against legalisation. The second chapter will provide the historical and international context of the Uruguayan drug policies up to legalisation in 2013. In the third chapter a case study will be presented and this will answer the question as to why the Uruguayan Government of José Mujica chose to legalise cannabis, as well as present the results of the policies up until today. It will be argued that questions and concerns about security lay at the heart of the policies and their justification, but that the impact on the security situation in the country will be limited. The thesis will also contend that other objectives of the regulations, primarily aimed at ‘harm reduction’, the reduction of the negative social and health consequences of drug policies, are only limitedly achieved.","['Cannabis', 'Uruguay', 'legalisation']"
"Kindermoorden in de krant. Het discours van Nederlandse kranten over kindermoord, 1930-2015","Horst, Tom van der","['Burger, Peter']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Kindermoorden zijn van alle tijden. De manier waarop geschreven wordt over kindermoorden in kranten verandert door de tijd. Dit onderzoek laat zien dat kindermoorden in de jaren dertig en de jaren zestig heel institutioneel beschreven werden in Nederlandse kranten. Uitzondering vormt hierop de berichtgeving bij de uitvaart van de vermoorde kinderen, daar veranderde de aard van de berichtgeving in een meer maatschappelijk discours. Vanaf de jaren negentig is er een groei van persoonlijke berichtgeving over de kindermoorden. Dit wil zeggen, berichten over de nabestaanden, over het leven van het slachtoffer of het verleden van de dader. Vanaf de jaren 2010 hebben persoonlijke berichten de overhand genomen in de kranten. Dit onderzoek is tegelijkertijd een vergelijkend onderzoek met dat van Claire Wardle, die hetzelfde onderzocht voor Engeland en de Verenigde Staten. Naast een aantal overeenkomsten, zijn er ook verschillen tussen krantenberichten in Nederland en deze twee landen gevonden. Het grootste verschil zit in het aantal maatschappelijk getinte nieuwsberichten. In Nederland kent dit soort berichten een aantal oplevingen, in Engeland en de Verenigde Staten zit er een stijgende lijn in maatschappelijke berichtgeving bij kindermoorden. Dit onderzoek richt zich ook op veranderende verhaalpatronen binnen krantenberichten over kindermoorden. Vanaf de jaren dertig tot de jaren 2010 veranderen deze patronen constant. De status van de politie veranderde van held naar anonimiteit en de kritiek op justitie nam met de jaren geleidelijk toe. Ook kan er in de loop van de tijdspanne waarop dit onderzoek zich richt, steeds meer een angstcultuur geconstateerd worden.","['Discours', 'Murder', 'Newspaper coverage']"

(2001)","Huang, Hsiang-Yun","['Bruyn, Eric de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis provides an analysis of the presentation and use of time in films. The central case studies look at the films of Taiwan-based director, Tsai-Ming Liang. The films analysed are: Goodbye Dragon Inn (2003), Stray Dogs (2013), and What Time Is It There? (2001). Alongside these, I will also discuss a selection of other films that use the device of the long take. The first chapter deals with the construction of narrative time and real time in films which employ long takes and have plots that are based on a linear time model. This analyis forms a critical position on André Bazin’s theorization of long take. The second chapter explores how non-linear temporality can be constructed in films which make extensive use of long takes. The chapter uses Gilles Deleuze’s notion of time- image as the main framework. These findings regarding the formal structure of films and their temporal structures are then explored further in the third chapter. The third chapter focuses on the contemporary social modalities of time. To do this, it will look closely at the ways in which films depict the kind of social time that emerged in Taiwanese post-industrial society operating under the logic of late-capitalism.","['Real time', 'Time-Image', 'Post-Industrial Society', 'Cinema of Long take', 'Tsai-Ming Liang', 'Taiwanese Cinema']"
't kan Verkeren,"Boeckel, Timm van","['Boers, Marion']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Between 1520 and 1720, the depiction of the board game Verkeren, an old-Dutch variant of Backgammon, thrived on Dutch prints and paintings. In this period, two hundred and fifty images appeared, depicting the board game in different settings and context. Over the years, much research has been done on chess, cards and iconography of images in the Golden Age. The meaning of the game Verkeren has, however, never been studied. To decipher the contemporary meaning of Verkeren in prints and paintings, Panofsky’s iconographic method, De Jong’s theory, and the method of comparison is applied in order to decipher the contemporary meaning of Verkeren in prints and paintings. This thesis dives deeper into the connotation of the board game, which needs to be played with both dice and intellect. The dice with its unpredictable outcome makes the game favourable for gamblers to bet. The gambling was associated with excessive drinking and squandering of money and could result in the neglect of family and/or a visit to a brothel. Therefore, Verkeren was seen as a vice and was mainly linked pride and idleness. These vices fitted perfectly in the spirit of the Golden Age, where the new upcoming, wealthy middle class had to determine their norms and values and had to face their pitfalls. The rich youth with their licentious behaviour, like fornicating, drinking, and gambling needed to be kept in line. Whereas authorities tried to control the gambling by regulating Verkeren, artists warned their viewers with compositions containing a moralistic and often humorous narrative, in which Verkeren served as an example of vice.","['Backgammon', 'Verkeerspel', 'Triktrak', 'gambling', 'dice', 'Verkeren', 'vice', 'vanity', 'vanitas', 'game', 'iconography', 'iconology']"
Social justice of the Maya people in the Guatemalan education system,"Hogers, Fabian","['Maat, Eelco van der']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"During the Guatemalan Civil War, which lasted from 1960 to 1996, the indigenous Maya people of Guatemala have suffered immensely. Namely, 170.000 Mayas were killed and thousands have had to flee to Mexico. In 1996, the Peace Accords were signed and promises were made for social justice of the Maya people in the education system, which had excluded them for centuries. At the same time, the World Bank started sponsoring a programme of heavily decentralized schools in Guatemala, called PRONADE schools, where local communities could easily open and manage primary schools through funding of the Ministry of Education. This thesis seeks to test to what extent social justice of the Maya people has been realized in these PRONADE schools compared to traditional public schools. Thereby, the approach of the Word Bank in schooling will be evaluated, using Fraser’s three-dimensional model of social justice as an indicator of success. Fraser’s dimensions of social justice consist of economic justice, cultural justice and political justice, which have frequently been applied to the education system. Fieldwork in Guatemala was carried out in March-April 2017, combining source analysis with in-depth semi-structured interviews. The results of this research show that, although the goals of the World Bank of equal access to quality education and the provision of bilingual education might have been partially realized, social justice still has a long way to go in the Guatemalan education system. Realization of economic justice in the PRONADE schools remains ambivalent, however, the PRONADE schools did score slightly better on cultural and political justice compared to traditional public schools, although by far not satisfactorily.","['Guatemala', 'Education', 'World Bank', 'Maya people', 'Social justice']"

"Responsibility to protect, a norm in decline. The discursive shift after Libya","Voordewind, Manuel","['David, Maxine']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the conflict in Syria started in 2011, an estimated 400,000 Syrians have lost their lives. The international community has failed to prevent crimes against humanity in the Syrian context and has been highly criticised for its inaction and incapacity. In this thesis, the source of this inaction will be investigated. Syria has manifested a divided United Nations Security Council (UNSC), unable to unilaterally act under the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) banner. Those in favour of R2P increasingly face opposition from non-western powers. Russia has persistently opposed R2P action and advocates for a new form of R2P, the Responsibility While Protecting (RWP). The application of R2P in Libya can be identified as the reason for this shifting discourse of R2P. This thesis will argue the application of R2P in Libya led to a negative discursive shift of R2P, especially in relation to the military aspect of R2P. The focus will be on the Russian role in this shifting discourse since Russia holds a veto power in the UNSC, making it a key player in international politics. The Russian influence will be investigated through analysing two Russian UNSC speeches relating to R2P: one speech in the Libyan context, the other in the Syrian context. The speeches have been selected after thoroughly analysing all UNSC speeches dedicated to R2P. The two speeches have been chosen to analyse for they best reflect the shifting Russian discourse on R2P. A critical discourse analysis of these two key speeches demonstrate Russia’s position in the debate is indicative of a shift in the overall discourse on R2P, from relatively accepting to critical, moving into the direction of RWP. It is thus concluded that the R2P concept, in its current form, is in decline.",

The relations between knowledge and public attitudes towards the EU and Euroscepticism: A case study of Slovakia,"Barillova, Dominika","['Shaev, Brian']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The research dealing with public attitudes has been around for many years. Citizens and their opinions have become very important in modern democracies as it is they who are the cornerstone of democratic systems. More attention has been paid to opinions at the EU level. Support for the EU among all Europeans has decreased and an era of Euroscepticism started. Scholars blamed many different reasons and events for increasing discontent with the EU, the lack of knowledge about the EU is just one of many. Slovakia has always been one of the most enthusiastic member states. In fact, this has not changed much despite the continental increase in Eurosceptic thinking. Moreover, Slovaks belong to more knowledgeable half of Europeans according to Eurobarometer and also this thesis. Despite a small drop in the positive views towards the EU among Slovak people in recent years, they stay on a positive side of thinking about the EU. This demonstrate no significant presence of Euroscepticism in Slovakia. However, the EP election turnout of Slovakia remains the lowest of all the member states and people are not interested in the EU affairs to a great extent at all. Hence, Slovaks in general cannot be classified as Eurosceptic as they express more positive views than negative, yet they definitely classify as indifferent.","['EU knowledge', 'Euroscepticism', 'Public attitudes', 'Slovakia']"

Political Discourses on Secession in the EU,"Bekker, Iris A.","['David, Maxine']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The EU may be facing a perfect storm as a result of recent crises, mounting Euroscepticism and rising nationalist sentiments, with the latter also playing a role in recent events in Catalonia and Scotland as well as in the Brexit referendum. This new political context provides an excellent opportunity to reassess the stance of the EU with regard to secessionist conflicts. This thesis uses this opportunity to build on the work of Bourne (2014) by analysing whether the political discourses of regionalist parties and EU representatives, on secession within the EU framework, changed between 2014 and 2017 – in the case of Catalonia, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The analysis shows that the only discourses that changed significantly over time were those of Sinn Féin in the Northern Irish case and of EU representatives with regard to Scotland. Besides change over time, it found change between cases; the discourse of EU representatives in the Northern Irish case represents a departure from the Prodi/Barroso Doctrine that was prominent in the Catalan and Scottish case. The findings also suggest that the EU’s unwillingness to be involved in secessionist conflicts as well as the dismissal of post-secession EU membership has not necessarily discouraged regionalist parties from using the EU to underline the civic nature of minority nationalism; the parties under analysis continued to seek legitimacy for their cause at the European level through strong normative language, while professing adherence to the EU (values) and the democratic will of the people. Finally, the thesis shows that the EU may have started to adopt a more active stance in secessionist debates – undeniably so in the case of Northern Ireland.","['secession', 'Europeanisation', 'Catalonia', 'Scotland', 'Northern Ireland', 'Brexit']"
US Pressure on Japan-Russia Relations in Light of the Ukrainian Crisis,"Silbaum, Viktoria","['Black, Lindsay']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2013 Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin announced their readiness to renew the dialogue on the Kuril Islands – the disputed territory that kept the Japan-Russia bilateral relationship frozen for almost 70 years. Due to the territorial dispute, the Japan-Russia economic and diplomatic cooperation remained relatively underdeveloped, which provided a great opportunity for both to benefit from the improved bilateral cooperation. However, the breakthrough has never happened, since the Japan-Russia relationship deteriorated after Japan joined US sanctions against Russia due to Russian involvement in the Ukrainian Crisis. Conventional explanations cite that the United States pressured Japan into imposing sanctions against its national interest. In this paper I provide an analysis of Japanese sanctions against Russia to answer the question of whether US pressure on Japan resulted in reactive Japan’s foreign policy sanctions against Russia. Therefore this paper will put forward a case to answer the question of whether Japan’s foreign policy was influenced by it being a reactive state. For the purpose of this research, I analysed the three rounds of sanctions from March 2014 to July 2016 by using a process tracing method combined with attributed influence and preference attainment to identify and measure US pressure on Japan. Drawing the concept of a reactive state model I will demonstrate how the United States pressured Japan against Japanese national interest. By focusing on the extent of Japanese sanctions, I put forward the case that Japan was able to implement low-key yet independent policy in case of sanctions.","['US-Japan relations', 'Japan-Russia relations', 'foreign policy analysis', 'the Ukrainian crisis', 'sanctions', 'reactive state']"
"""Market Power Europe"": Patterns of limited energy acquis externalization in Switzerland and Ukraine","Fegert, Moritz","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis assesses whether the EU is as a market power shaping third countries' legislation and policies as asserted by ""Market Power Europe"", a theoretical framework, which has been insufficiently explored in the literature so far. More concretely it is scrutinised if electricity market liberalisation and emissions trading acquis has been externalised to Switzerland and Ukraine. First, it is shown that there is market power potential in the field of energy, as the European regulatory order was increasingly strengthened since the mid-1990s and gave birth to two significant markets for electricity and carbon emissions trade. Second, it is demonstrated that even though acquis externalization occurred to a certain extent in both cases, four intervening variables filtered the EU's market power. Indeed, market interconnectedness, political culture, the nature of the political system and the level of institutionalization of the EU's relations with a third country need to be taken into account when assessing the EU's market power in a given third country. These findings are not only theoretically relevant, they also suggest that the EU should concentrate on the development of its Single Market and regulatory order as well as on solid institutional framework conditions to cement its power towards third countries and enlarge its global influence.","['European Union', 'externalization', 'Market Power Europe', 'energy policy', 'Ukraine', 'Switzerland']"

To this end, it finds that De Boodt’s illustrated albums throw fresh light on an old question. It is the intention of this study to explore the relation between developments in empirical and emblematic approaches to natural history, especially in visual representations, through the examination of the work of an individual who was involved in all three. The works of Anselmus de Boodt demonstrate that he drew on a variety of approaches to the study of the world and is therefore representative of the late Renaissance intellectual ideal of the polyhistor. The polyhistor as an ideal derived from the desire to achieve a holistic understanding of the world by taking into account its physical as well as symbolic attributes. The study of these attributes is seen retrospectively as the object of empirical and emblematic methodologies respectively, methodologies that are understood as being in conflict. Nonetheless, they are united in the work of De Boodt, as asserted by this study, on the grounds that vision was the point of convergence and departure for both.","['Anselmus de Boodt', 'History of Science', 'Art', 'Natural history', 'Scientific Illustration', 'Early modern', 'Vision', 'empiricism', 'emblem', 'polyhistor', 'Hoefnagel', 'Rudolf II']"

‘Het groene geloof van milieumaffia en klimaatfantasten’,"Schreurs, Bente","['Burger, Peter']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Deze masterscriptie onderzoekt de logos- en ethostechnieken die in kranten- en tijdschriftenartikelen, op klimaatsceptische blogs en in Facebookdiscussies worden ingezet in de discussie over het idee dat klimaatopwarming een complot is. Hoe overtuigen journalisten en socialemediagebruikers het publiek van hun (on)geloof in een complot? Dat doen ze onder andere door gebruik te maken van de retorische overtuigingsmiddelen logos en ethos: respectievelijk de argumentatie en de indruk die die spreker op het publiek maakt. Het doel van dit onderzoek is het creëren van een overzicht van gehanteerde logos- en ethostechnieken. Het onderzochte corpus bestaat uit artikelen van De Groene Amsterdammer, de Volkskrant, De Telegraaf en Elsevier, blogs van Climategate en De staat van het klimaat en discussies op diverse Facebookpagina's. De onderzochte periode betreft de jaren 2012 tot 2017. De methode is een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse, wat betekent dat men op zoek gaat naar patronen en categorieën – niet naar de frequentie van de middelen. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat Donovans drie stijlen van (on)geloof – fervent geloof, voorwaardelijk geloof en debunking – in alle geanalayseerde eenheden voorkomen: in de krantenen tijdschriftenartikelen, in de (reacties op de) blogs en in de Facebookreacties. In de laatste categorie is er helemaal geen sprake van ervaringsgeloof, de extra categorie die Burger voorstelde in zijn proefschrift (2014). In de (reacties op de) blogs en in de Facebookreacties wordt ervaringsgeloof zelden geuit. Bij elke (on)geloofsstijl zijn verscheidene argumenten onderscheiden. Autoriteitsargumenten domineren de discussie. Waar debunking overheerst in de traditionele media en in de Facebookreacties, wordt er in de (reacties op de) blogs vooral fervent geloof geuit. Discussianten in de bladen, op de blogs en op Facebook verschillen sterk in de wijze waarop ze autoriteit claimen bij het onderbouwen van hun geloof. Terwijl de traditionele media zich vooral baseren op officiële claimsmakers, specificeren discussianten op Facebook hun beroep op autoriteit in veel gevallen niet. In reacties op de blogs worden veel gevestigde autoriteiten aangehaald, maar wordt er ook vaak verwezen naar de eigen autoriteit of de autoriteit van de blog zelf. Ethostechnieken worden zeer veel aangedragen, zowel door journalisten als door socialemediagebruikers. Dit zijn niet alleen technieken uit de categorie deskundigheid, maar ook uit de categorieën eerlijkheid en welwillendheid. Het model van Burger en Anemaet (2011) is voor een groot deel bruikbaar gebleken. In de bladen en op de blogs zijn alle twaalf technieken uit dit model terug te vinden, op Facebook maar zeven van de twaalf.

(E)motion of Saudade: The Embodiment of Solidarity in the Cuban Medical Cooperation in Mozambique,"Ocadiz Arriaga, Miriam","['Kaag, Mayke']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on current Cuban medical cooperation in Mozambique. It begins by placing this form of cooperation within the emergent field of South-South relations, whereby two nations from the Global South maintain an autonomous link throughout the decades. The socialist island of Cuba has long been regarded as a world leader in health, one that, in place of sending substantial revenues, delivers human resources. Its main tactic has been to place Cuban professionals at a grassroots level, in order to work within the local healthcare system. This has been the case in Mozambique, a nation with a healthcare system often described as fragmented and heavily dependent on foreign aid, and in this sense Cuba may represent a more horizontal alternative. From a macro perspective this is an interesting topic within international relations, one that adds various perspectives to the field of medical aid worldwide. However, this paper suggests a further analysis of the different layers within this phenomenon. Beyond merely being a governmental agreement, this is a particular Transatlantic route where women and men move between continents, facing tangible and intangible borders in order to collaborate within the medical field. Under these circumstances, individuals must cope with new environments, re-establishing their lives in other societies, thus modifying their lives and those of their communities. Behind such dynamics, solidarity stands as a remarkable principle to sustain the historical and contemporary mobilization of people in the Global South. Using an ethnographic perspective based on life stories collected throughout six months of fieldwork, this thesis unwraps the multiple layers that go into constructing this phenomenon in order to understand how solidarity is embodied in the daily lives of Cubans and Mozambicans. The aim is to present the “human face” of contemporary South-South mobility, especially in the field of health and medicine, in order to highlight how political discourses on solidarity are deconstructed to be personally internalized within this intercultural encounter.",

Anthonis Mor en zijn werk,"Thiadens, Peter","['Grasman, E.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,nl,De scriptie ‘Anthonis Mor en zijn werk’ gaat in op de factoren die impact hebben gehad op de loopbaan van de schilder Anthonis Mor. Mor kreeg zijn opleiding in het atelier van Jan van Scorel (1495-1562) in Utrecht. In hoofdstuk twee wordt het werk van Jan van Scorel besproken en de betekenis die hij gehad kan hebben voor Anthonis Mor. Jan van Scorel beschikte over een groot netwerk. Hoofdstuk drie gaat in op dat netwerk en op de politieke omstandigheden in die tijd. Via de relaties van Jan van Scorel kwam Anthonis Mor in contact met het hof van Maria van Hongarije (1505-1558) en haar adviseur Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle (1517-1586). In feite begint dan zijn leven als portrettist. Meer dan tien jaar werkte hij voor de Habsburg familie en haar entourage. Hij werd schilder in dienst van Filips II (1527-1598). Hoofdstuk vier beschrijft de traditie van portretteren waar Anthonis Mor op voortbouwt. Het was belangrijk dat bepaalde beeldelementen in de portretten terugkwamen. Deze iconografie wordt besproken in hoofdstuk vijf. Het laatste hoofdstuk gaat in op de schildertechniek. De scriptie start met een beschrijving van het leven van Anthonis Mor. Deze beschrijving is meer een biografische schets omdat er in feite - buiten zijn werk - niet veel over hem bekend is.,

"Wat mag de journalist schrijven?; De keuzes in stijladviezen voor Volkskrant-redacteuren betreffend racisme, etnische kwesties en seksisme","Verhulsdonk, Iris","['Jong, Jaap de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Binnen het journalistieke veld moet in toenemende mate rekening gehouden worden met culturele veranderingen. Bij kwesties als ras, immigratie, etniciteit, sekse en gender is duidelijk te zien dat taal verandert. De ‘Zwarte-Pieten-discussie’ is bijvoorbeeld niet meer weg te denken uit de sinterklaastraditie en het woord ‘neger’ is tegenwoordig uit den boze. Daarnaast is de vraag of je het hebt over een ‘brandweervrouw’ en een ‘redactrice’ in plaats van een redacteur of brandweerman wanneer gesproken wordt over een vrouw in deze functie. Deze discussies zijn illustratief voor een bredere sociale discussie over taalgebruik die te maken heeft met etniciteit en seksisme. In deze scriptie is onderzocht op welke manier er bij de Volkskrant wordt omgegaan met adviezen over discriminerend taalgebruik op het gebied van gender, ras en etniciteit. Het onderzoek bestaat uit drie onderdelen. Eerst zijn de stijlboeken van de Volkskrant uit 1992 en 2006 met elkaar vergeleken met behulp van grounded theory. Vervolgens zijn 14 columns van de ombudsvrouw van de Volkskrant wat betreft deze kwestie geanalyseerd aan de hand van discoursanalyse. De resultaten uit deze onderdelen zijn vervolgens gebruikt bij het laatste onderdeel van het onderzoek: een interview met de huidige ombudsvrouw van de Volkskrant, Annieke Kranenberg. Dit interview is vervolgens ook aan de hand van discoursanalyse onderzocht. Uit dit onderzoek komt naar voren dat journalistieke tradities nog een belangrijke rol spelen bij de Volkskrant. Klachten over stigmatiserend taalgebruik worden ter zijde geschoven door de journalisten, met als voornaamste reden dat zij de werkelijk weergeven zoals deze is. De ombudsvrouw heeft hier een andere houding is. Zij is kritisch naar de redactie toe, maar wanneer zij oproept tot verandering klinkt ook in dit advies de rol van journalistieke principes en tradities door.","['Volkskrant', 'Ombudsvrouw', 'Taalgebruik', 'Racisme', 'Seksisme', 'Discourseanalyse', 'Stijlboek', 'Journalistiek']"
"NOS Snaplines, het journaal voor jongeren?","Brink, Emma","['Opgenhaffen, Michaël']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Door het gebruik van nieuwe media in de journalistiek, zoals Snapchat, rijst de vraag wat dit doet met de journalistieke content. Snapchat heeft zeer specifieke eigenschappen: content moet live zijn, content verdwijnt weer (Bayer et al, 2015) en er zijn allerlei bewerkingstools aanwezig (Piwerk en Joinson, 2016). Snapchat is erg populair onder jongeren en het is daarom niet gek dat een nieuwsorganisatie als de NOS Snapchat gebruikt om die doelgroep te bereiken. In eerdere onderzoeken naar blogs (Singer, 2005) en Twitter (Lasorsa et al, 2012) werd onderzocht in hoeverre een nieuw medium de journalistieke normen van onpartijdigheid, transparantie en gatekeeping schaadt. Uit deze onderzoeken bleek dat journalisten grofweg dezelfde journalistieke normen en werkwijze handhaafden op blogs als binnen traditionele journalistiek, maar dat dit op Twitter veranderde. Journalisten gebruikten enerzijds hun traditionele normen binnen Twitter, maar pasten zich ook aan Twitter aan. In dit onderzoek zijn 186 snaps van NOS Snaplines geanalyseerd aan de hand van de drie begrippen: onpartijdigheid, transparantie en gatekeeping. Uit de resultaten blijkt NOS Snaplines relatief onpartijdig wanneer het gaat om tekst. Wanneer er naar bewerkingstools zoals emoji’s en stickers wordt gekeken, blijkt dat deze bewerkingen de snaps wel partijdig maken. Deze bewerkingstools kunnen namelijk ook emoties of meningen verkondigen. Eerder onderzoek stelt dat journalisten een manier zoeken om emoties uit te besteden. Dit kan een journalist doen door niet zijn eigen emoties op te schrijven, maar de emoties van een ander (Wahl-Jorgensen). Er zou in het geval van NOS Snaplines gesteld kunnen worden dat emoties worden uitbesteed aan eigenschappen van een medium, door bijvoorbeeld emoji’s binnen Snapchat in te zetten. NOS Snaplines blijkt uit de analyse over een lage mate van transparantie te beschikken, terwijl social media normaliter transparanter zijn dan traditionele media (Singer, 2005; Lasorsa et al, 2012). Hyperlinking maakt social media transparant, maar Snapchat heeft deze mogelijkheid niet. Toch zijn er andere manieren om transparant te zijn. Zo is Snapchat een medium waar juist alledaagse content, materiaal van achter de schermen en content vanaf locatie kan worden geplaatst, wat transparant kan worden bevonden maar weinig gebeurt in NOS Snaplines. Uit de analyse naar het derde begrip, gatekeeping, blijkt dat de rol van gatekeeper sterk wordt bewaakt binnen NOS Snaplines. Het podium wordt niet snel gedeeld. De begrippen onpartijdigheid, transparantie en gatekeeping lijken nog gehandhaafd te worden binnen Snapchat, in die zin kan gesteld worden dat de journalisten Snapchat ‘normalizen’. Ze zorgen dat hun eigen normen en waarden gebruikt kunnen worden in het nieuwe medium. Gesteld kan worden dat NOS Snaplines nog lijkt op een traditioneel achtuurjournaal, uit de analyse is gebleken dat zelfs de opbouw hetzelfde is. Maar aan de andere 3 kant gebruiken de Snaplines-redacteuren emoji’s en stickers die het nieuws partijdig maken. In eerder onderzoek naar Twitter viel op dat er minder waarde werd gehecht aan het concept van onpartijdigheid (Lasorsa et al 2012), wat ook het geval blijkt te zijn in NOS Snaplines. Dit duidt op het idee dat binnen sociale-mediajournalistiek voornamelijk de journalistieke norm van onpartijdigheid aan het veranderen is. Hoewel in de literatuur het dominante paradigma is dat subjectiviteit en emoties in nieuws beperkt moeten worden, zijn er ook tegengeluiden waarbij onderzoekers een positievere houding hebben tegenover emotionele (meer partijdige) journalistiek (Pantti, 2010; Wahl-Jorgensen, 2013; Opgenhaffen en Welbers, 2017). Want opiniërend, persoonlijk en subjectief nieuws kan een voordeel hebben op feitelijk nieuws omdat consumenten, zeker op social media, worden overspoeld met feitelijk nieuws. Een interpretatie kan dan een extra laag geven aan het objectieve nieuws (Marchi, 2012). Daarnaast blijkt uit de analyse dat de nieuwsonderwerpen die worden besproken vooral bestaan uit non-public affairs, oftewel nieuws dat aantrekkelijk is voor jongeren, maar waarvan journalisten normaliter denken dat het minder nieuwswaarde heeft (Boczkowski & Mitchelstein, 2010). Hoewel NOS Snaplines-redacteuren aan de ene kant hun journalistieke normen gebruiken binnen Snapchat, passen ze ook hun werkwijze aan Snapchat aan. Hieruit kan geconcludeerd worden dat redacteuren van NOS Snaplines op een andere manier journalistiek bedrijven en dat de journalistiek wel degelijk verandert door een nieuw medium als Snapchat.","['Snapchat', 'Journalistiek', 'onpartijdigheid', 'transparantie', 'gatekeeping', 'nieuwe media', 'social media', 'jongeren']"

Ordinal numerals in dialects of Dutch,"Sleeman, Ruby","['Barbiers, S.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis is a synchronic study of the derivation of ordinal numerals from cardinal numerals in several different dialects of Dutch, combining a dialectological and a formal linguistic approach. Ordinals are formed with one of two ordinal suffixes, -de or -ste, both of which occur in all Dutch varieties. However, there is variation among several dialects in Flanders (Belgium): they exhibit stem-suffix combinations which differ from those in Standard Dutch (SD), giving forms like zeven-ste and twaalf-ste for SD zeven-de and twaalf-de. The thesis investigates the patterns of this variation and offers motivations for those patterns. Novel data acquired through an online questionnaire show that there are three patterns: SD, a core Flemish pattern and a transitional pattern in between. These patterns show a clear geographical distribution. I propose that the distribution of the two suffixes can be largely explained by syllable weight in the transitional system and that an analysis in terms of the final stem consonant or in terms of foot weight cannot capture all the facts.","['ordinal', 'numerals', 'microvariation', 'Dutch', 'morphosyntax', 'suffix distribution', 'morphophonology']"

According to those who oppose the project, the reclamation endangers the physical and cultural landscape of the Balinese.

Thousands of people have been protesting the $3 billion reclamation project at the offices of the Bali provincial government in Denpasar. In order to realize the Benoa Bay project, more than 700 hectares of water will be drained out of the former environmental protected zone.

"""The Disobedient Uleebalang: Sarekat Islam and Colonial Civil Rule in Aceh, 1918-1923""","Kamila, Raisa","['Schrikker, A.F.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis will argue that the collaboration between local elites in Aceh, the uleebalang, and the Dutch colonials after the establishment of civil governance in 1918 was an uneasy one. In contrast with existing historiography that depicted the position of uleebalang merely as the henchmen of the colonial authorities, this thesis will examine a specific event, that is the involvement of several uleebalang in North Aceh into the mass organization Sarekat Islam (Union of Islam) in the 1920s, to provide new insight into the nature of the collaboration and the making of modern political life in Aceh. In brief, this case presented anxiety and distrust of Dutch officials towards their local collaborator, the uleebalang, due to their activity in Sarekat Islam. By focusing on 1918-1923, this thesis attempts to analyze how Aceh was integrated into the colonial administration of the Dutch East Indies by means of collaboration with its local elites, the uleebalang. Rather than looking at the selected events of Sarekat Islam in North Aceh merely as local dynamics as previous research has done, this thesis will discuss the connection between local events with wider networks of anti-colonial resistance in the Dutch East Indies between 1918-1923. In doing so, this thesis aims to fill the gap in the historiography of colonial Aceh in its early years of civil rule while also contributing to the historiography of colonial civil administration of the Dutch East Indies.","['indirect rule', 'uleebalang', 'Aceh', 'colonialism', 'Sarekat Islam']"

"Fusing Islamism and Neoliberalism in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco: A Study into the Economic Policies of Three Islamist Parties","Lyra, Aguinaldo","['Meijer, Roel']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Abstract: This thesis analyses the economic policies of three Islamist parties that have come to power in the aftermath of what has come to be known as the Arab Spring. Campaigning on a platform emphasizing social justice and wealth redistribution, these parties have likewise embraced neoliberal economic policies. This thesis investigates how the Egyptian Freedom and Justice Party, the Tunisian Ennahda party and the Moroccan Party for Justice and Development have justified these two apparent contradictions and whether these parties perceive the latter as being antithetical to the former. On the basis of a wide range of primary and secondary sources, I conclude that the main channels through which these parties believe social justice and wealth redistribution are to be achieved in a neoliberal economy is through ‘trickle-down economics’ and wealth redistribution through zakat and other forms of individual charity. Evaluating the respective parties’ periods in power, one would have to conclude that as far as securing social justice is concerned, the reality is quite different from the campaign rhetoric. This has to some large extent been caused by demands raised by international financial institutions in exchange for loans to these countries, but likewise occurred prior to engaging in negotiations and eventually signing agreements with these institutions. Especially in the realm of labor laws, minimum wage laws, stimulating small and medium size enterprises and reducing subsidies on much needed consumer goods, the parties have not lived up to their earlier promises.","['Egypt', 'Economics', 'Tunisia', 'Morocco', 'Islamism', 'Brotherhood', 'Politics', 'Neoliberalism', 'Social Justice', 'Redistribution']"

Transnational Political Activism and the Use of Social Media: Riffian Activists in the Netherlands,"Keus, Ismay","['Boender, Welmoet']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"After the death of a local fish seller in November 2016, the Rif area in Morocco has witnessed the proliferation of a social movement, using Berber (Amazigh) ethno-political discourse to demand social justice and socio-economic improvement for the Riffian people. As a result of that, Riffian (second generation) migrants in the Netherlands have mobilised and organised themselves in action committees, to express their solidarity with the social movement in their home country. This research explores how their mobilisation, collective action framing and organisation relate to their elaborate use of new/social media. Facebook has provided Riffians a platform to articulate a shared Amazigh identity, as well as to share their personal commitment to the social movement in the Rif. This has led to mobilisation beyond preexisting (Amazigh) migrant organisations. At the same time, de-centralised and nonhierarchal organisational structures remain important for the co-ordination of transnational political activism, especially in the case of transnational collective action.","['migrant politics', 'new/social media', 'social movement theory (SMT)', 'transnationalism', 'collective action frames', 'Berberism/Amazighism']"

“Beirut is a Bitch and Everyone Wants His Share”: Understanding the Metaphorical Feminisation and ‘Rape’ of Beirut,"Glen, Fiona L.","['Naeff, Judith A.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This cross-disciplinary thesis investigated the use of metaphors in modern and contemporary Lebanese literature which portrays Beirut as a woman, and violence or turmoil within the city as sexual assaults. Both of these metaphors were identified in texts by Zena el Khalil, Elias Khoury and Etal Adnan, along with shorts from Beirut Noir. Lakoff’s theory of metaphor was used to underline the significant interactions between figurative language, knowledge and real action which motivated the research. The mother-virgin-whore triad was found overly simplistic to describe Beirut’s figuration, although interestingly non-normative characterisations such as corrupted mother and once-virgin arise in the literature. However, Beirut has been consistently imagined as a ‘whore’ throughout history. This stereotyping has a particularly complex impact on the allocation of blame and pity in the related literary imagery of Beirut’s ‘rape’, which was further dissected through feminist and critical theory. Overall, an interrelation between machoistic violence and the destruction city was identified, exemplified in Civil War literature but arising in broader contexts. This thesis' intersectional question merited a broad, multi-stranded answer, concluding that imaginaries of women and cities alike must be nuanced and multiple in order to escape harmful stereotyping which can ‘justify’ destructive action.","['Gender politics', 'Lebanese literature', 'conflict', 'sexual violence', 'feminism', 'metaphor']"

It is widely accepted that the misogynistic killings started in 1993, one year before the North American Free Trade Agreement entered into force, but still no consensus on the number of victims is reached and many cases remain unsolved. This thesis examines the role of grassroots activism in pressuring the Mexican government to take responsibility, recognize the crimes, and implement solutions to the feminicides occurring in the Mexican border town Ciudad Juárez. An understanding of the causes and contributing factors is crucial to determine the role and responsibility of the government. By applying social movement theory and framing theory to the social movement Ni Una Más and various small-scale grassroots organizations, the effects of grassroots activism on the government’s attitude and policies regarding feminicide and gender-based violence have been investigated in this thesis. Even though feminicides are still regularly occurring nowadays, and the Mexican authorities thus ultimately failed to eradicate the problem, social movements and grassroots activism have proven to play a decisive role in raising national and international awareness, pressuring the government to take effective measures to solve the problem, and striving for justice and security for the women of Ciudad Juárez.","['Feminicide', 'Grassroots Activism', 'State Responsibility', 'Ni Una Más', 'Social Movement Theory', 'Framing Theory', 'Public Women Discourse', 'Ciudad Juárez', 'Mexico']"

Bringing together two fields of study that have been treated separately until now, the author historicizes and contextualizes the evolution of a 'conflict-development' nexus and the repercussions of this emerging dynamic on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The methodological approach makes use of a combination of scholarly and primary sources, drawing together the fields of Conflict and Development Studies, Communication for Development, literature on Palestine, and case studies the author became familiar with through her own experience in the field. Moreover, the use of narrative analysis and inquiry is employed to develop and support the argumentation. Hereby, the thesis establishes how aid to Palestinians and the communication of the conflict by donors has become increasingly divorced from realities on the ground.",['Development Aid Conflict Communication Narratives Palestine']

Media Coverage of Climate Change in India: A Case Study of the COP21 and the Paris Agreement,"Sijbrandij, Minke","['Sengupta, Roshni']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Climate change is a controversial concept. While in the US the debate is ongoing to whether it is caused by humans, in India anthropogenic climate change is largely endorsed. Here, the dispute concerns the question of responsibility; they are engaged in a debate dealing with the issue of historical versus current emissions, and the concept of equity and climate justice. Media coverage of climate change in India has changed largely over the years. Firstly dominated by the concept of carbon colonialism and a nationalist discourse, it gradually shifted towards a co-benefits approach and green growth narrative. Whereas in the early 2000’s media coverage was largely framed along a risk-responsibility and North-South divide, with the Copenhagen summit in 2009 the narrative had become more nuanced and India’s growing emissions were no longer ignored. During the negotiations in Paris, both the risk-responsibility as well as the North-South divide could be observed again and much attention was given to India’s vulnerability to climate change.","['Paris Agreement', 'India', 'Climate Change', 'Media Coverage']"
"“You Cannot Hide Me Away”: Stigmatization, Discrimination, and Varying Experiences of People with Albinism in Sub-Saharan Africa","Solli, Tilla","['Bellucci, Stefano']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis utilizes a comparative perspective in analyzing the perceived differences between how people with albinism (PWA) are treated in Benin, Cameroon, The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe, by examining the variables of ethno-religious composition and socio-economic conditions in the countries. This research has shown that although the differences might be small, they are of crucial importance in how a PWA is perceived in these countries and how these notions have changed over time; from PWA being revered in pre-colonial Yorubaland and the old Kongo Kingdom, to today’s experiences of stigma and discrimination in name-calling, mutilations, and killings. Similarly, a stark contrast also exists amongst some of the countries – from PWA in Benin being revered, to PWA fearing for their lives in Tanzania due to a higher demand for PWA body parts to be used in witchcraft. Tanzania is also the African country that has garnered the most international attention for its treatment of PWA, and although the government and the state attempt to limit the extreme discrimination, it continues to persist. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that the problems of stigma and discrimination as experienced by PWA are not limited to Tanzania, but exist all over the African continent.","['Albinism', 'Africa', 'Stigmatization', 'Discrimination', 'Witchcraft']"
Neoliberalism and Neo-Structuralism in Brazil: Complementarity in the Facilitation of Economic Development,"Boyan, Totic","['Valdivia, Rivera S.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Between 1990 and 2010, approximately during the democratic governments of president Cardoso and Lula, Brazil witnessed a strong improvement in economic development. During this period, poverty rates had fallen in astonishing numbers, while inequality levels declined significantly. This thesis investigates to what extent the neoliberal economic policies implemented by Cardoso, and the neo-structural economic reforms instituted by Lula, resulted in the economic development that Brazil experienced during the said period. The main hypothesis of the thesis is that both economic models have been complementary in facilitating economic development in Brazil. The first chapter of the thesis concerns itself with defining the most important concepts and terminology related to the topic under investigation, such as ‘economic development’, ‘neoliberalism’ and ‘neo-structuralism’. Then in the second chapter, the paper will deal with the historic context of the economic problems Brazil faced before the economic development, and how Cardoso and Lula sought to deal with these problems. Finally, using social and economic indicators relevant to economic development, a comparative analysis will be made between the influence that Cardoso’s neoliberal economic policies, and the influence that Lula’s neo-structural economic reforms had on the long term economic development of Brazil. The thesis concludes by stating that the comparative analysis has demonstrated that the two economic models, neoliberalism and neo-structuralism respectively, were indeed complementary in achieving Brazil’s long term economic development. The relevance of this research to the wider academic debate is that it has provided some insight into the extent to which neoliberalism and neo-structuralism can be complementary in the facilitation of economic development for countries still in the early stages of development.","['Brazil', 'Neoliberalism', 'Neo-structuralism', 'Economic Development', 'Poverty', 'Inequality']"
Broken Windows: How the Impunity of the State Facilitates High Rates of Femicide in El Salvador,"Geerling, Manouk","['Solheim, H.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The exponential increase of femicides in El Salvador over the last years can most likely for a part be attributed to the impunity of the state when it comes to prosecution of perpetrators of gender-based violence (Walsh and Menjívar 587). Moreover, the machismo culture that is present in most Latin American countries, creates a backdrop for the normalization of gendered violence. Internalized misogyny that Salvadoran women presumably have adopted in a culture that continuously tells them that they are to blame for any abuse they might face, could very well be another part of the explanation of the lack of a decrease in femicide rates since 2012. In this paper the possible reasons behind the exponential growth of femicide rates in El Salvador will be explained throughout three chapters. First of all, a theoretical framework will be provided, in which several relevant concepts will be defined. Secondly, femicide in El Salvador will be contextualised by looking at both the history of femicide in Latin America and that of El Salvador more specifically. Finally, the last chapter will apply a SWOT-analysis to examine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the 2012 Special Integrated Law for a Life free From Violence against women, as to find out why the legislation has apparently failed and how it could be more successful.","['Femicide', 'Latin America', 'El Salvador']"

To what extent can Cambodia be considered a democracy? An authoritarian regime in democratic clothing,"Akkersdijk, Matthijs","['Verver, Michiel']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the early 1990s, the UN intervened in Cambodia in order to democratise the country. Since then Cambodia has adopted more democratic institutions. Although the country became more democratic in official terms, the country largely operates outside of accepted democratic values. The aim of this paper is therefore to find out to what extent Cambodia can be considered a democracy. Focussing on the indicators of democratisation and de-democratisation processes (breadth, equality, protection, and mutually binding consultation), it becomes clear that Cambodia has been experiencing a process of de-democratisation. At the same time, the ruling party managed to increase its state capacity. This has been a necessary tool for the party to stay in power. Acknowledging that high state capacity can contribute to democratisation processes, it is surprising that high state capacity and democratisation do not seem to go hand in hand in the Cambodian case. The form of state capacity is therefore an important aspect. Focussing on Cambodia, it soon becomes clear that the country deviates from the Western standard. Cambodian politics and economics are centred around patronage and neopatrimonialism. This has been the main reason why efforts towards democratisation have failed in Cambodia and why an authoritarian regime remains in power.","['Authoritarianism', 'Cambodia', 'CPP', 'Democratisation', 'Hun Sen', 'Neopatrimonialism', 'Patronage', 'State Capacity', 'UN']"

"""Trojan Horse"" vs. ""New Canadians"" - News Discourses on Refugees in the United States and Canada after the 2015 Paris Attacks","Schlack, Alicia","['Gageldonk, Maarten van']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Following the 2015 Paris attacks, public opinion on refugees drastically diverged in Canada and the United States. Whereas Canadians became more supportive towards taking in Syrian refugees, US-Americans increasingly disapproved the intake of refugees. In the weeks after the attacks, the fact that one of the attackers entered Europe with a Syrian passport through the refugee roads initiated a global discussion on the safety of taking in Syrian refugees. Especially television news were of major importance in pushing this debate. Through critical discourse analysis, this bachelor thesis examined whether the divergent trends in public opinion in the United States and Canada could be explained by differing news discourses. The analysis found that the US discourse extensively focused on refugees as a potential threat to national security. Due to the fact the US had entered the pre-election phase at this point, the discussion on refugees was markedly politicized. Especially Republican presidential candidates were given plenty of airtime to comment on refugees, while refugees themselves were left almost entirely voiceless. In contrast, the Canadian news discourse discussed the crisis more from a humanitarian perspective, extensively covering philanthropist Canadians who were aiding Syrian refugees through different means such as privately-sponsoring, providing medical care or donating money, clothes and housing. This analysis demonstrates that the news discourses in Canada and the US were indeed profoundly different. This supports the theory that different reporting on refugees in the wake of the Paris attacks contributed to the shifts in public opinion in Canada and the US.","['News Discourse', 'United States', 'Canada', 'Paris attacks', 'refugees', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'television news', 'agenda setting theory', 'public opinion']"
The Securitization of Migration through Media: Comparing the Portrayal of Migrant Flows in Europe in the 1930s and Early 21st Century,"Derksen, Alexander Christiaan","['Walhout, E.C.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the 20th and 21st centuries it can be witnessed that the portrayal of migration was linked with the economic situation of the receiving country. In an era of economic growth the migrants could be utilized and be beneficial to the economy and in a period of economic decline the migrants could not be utilized and were therefore a ‘threat’ to the national economy. However, official economic statistics do not show that migrants do have a negative economic effect on the receiving country. This means that there is no clarity on the effects of migration. This lack of clarity will be explained by analyzing the influence of the media on the political sphere and the target audience in both the 1930s and the early 21st century, through the framework of securitization studies. The aim is to show that the negative portrayal of migration by the media will lead to the implementation of right-wing anti- immigrant rhetoric across the political spectrum and create a negative sentiment among the native population towards migrants.","['Europe', 'Migration', 'Securitization Studies', 'Copenhagen School', 'Welsh School', 'Human Security Approach', 'France', 'Germany', '1930s', 'Early 21st Century']"

With what measurements do people generate such stereotypes and what does it mean? Regardless the skin color preferences it is a reality that the action of skin whitening or intended tanning is part of a cosmetic procedure. In other words it is an action of ‘doing beauty’. Beautifying one’s self is a common action that is seen in the world regardless of culture and skin color often plays a significant role in shaping what is beauty in a society. Many scholars in the field of researching white skin preference amongst Japanese women tend to associate and conclude by mentioning that it is due to the historical preference or it is due to the admiration for Caucasian skin as the definition of beauty or it is simply a ‘Japanese thing’. However, cultural preference of skin color is not always consistent and it could highly fluctuate due to the influence of cosmetic and fashion industry. Therefore in order to fill in the gap of research in relation to understanding white skin preference in Japan this thesis will analyze how could the white skin preference be understood in Japan in relation to the influence of cosmetic and fashion industry.

By drawing the relation between these three seemingly separate issues, a divergent perspective upon the global trading system is exposed. The thesis reaches its outcome by using both macro and micro analyses. Where macro analyses allows the debate to have a more theoretical nature, the micro analyses of the case study on Agricultural Dumping in Mozambique shows a more practical side of the debate. By the use of these two analytical tools, the thesis illustrates how Agricultural Dumping is a negative effect of Food Aid, enabled through Free Trade Agreements. As open market policies and low domestic protection are part of these agreements, local agricultural markets in sub- Saharan Africa become unable to compete with subsidised imported agricultural goods. Hence, the three issues all contribute to an unequal market system that, in certain situations, provides advantages for the donor country and leaves the receiving country at a disadvantage.","['Agricultural Dumping', 'Free Trade Agreements', 'Food Aid', 'Food Policy', 'Mozambique', 'Neoliberalism', 'Statism', 'Critical Political Economy']"

An “evolutionary approach” for rural electrification and poverty alleviation in China,"Koivunen, Aaron","['Wang, Z.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Rural electrification programs are being implemented around the world to provide access to clean energy and fight energy poverty. Even though great achievements have been made in the past decades, especially in China, there are still obstacles which need to be overcome. Providing long-term benefits to the rural poor is rarely achieved due to neglected institutional, technical but also social factors. Most importantly, the approach governments adopt for implementing such programs has a strong effect on how successful policy goals are reached. By looking into centralized and decentralized approaches to electrification, this thesis uncovers the advantages and shortcomings found in two case studies in China and Bangladesh. In particular, this thesis analyses how the decentralized “evolutionary approach” can overcome some of the present obstacles in the Chinese socio-political context and thereby contribute to more sustainable rural development and poverty alleviation. Overall the results point towards a viable incorporation of more decentralized aspects into Chinese policy experimentation and future rural electrification pilot projects within China and ultimately further countries.",

Since the Convention came into force, the number of funding directed towards disabled peoples organization grew significantly. With increase in number of NGOs, including disabled people’s organisation, more and more researchers began to be interested in studying the nature of relationship between the donor and the local NGO. In Tanzania, most of the local NGOs with an aim to improve lives of people with disabilities, receive majority of their funding from Western donors, where the recent trend is to implement the so called “human-rights based approach”. As this paper will discuss, the NGO-donor relationship is in itself unequal due to NGO’s financial dependency on the donor organization. The power relations are expressed through the process of developing an agenda of a development project, more specifically in project’s objectives and how these are in accordance with the NGO’s mission and to what extent can these be achieved with regards to the local context. Apart from achievability, this paper will discuss relevance of the targets and who benefits from these efforts. The analysis evolves around studying the relationship between CHAVITA, a local NGO advocating for the lives and better living conditions of deaf people in Tanzania, and DCW, a British charity organization, which is currently funding their Sign Language Development Project.",['disability development donor‐NGO']
Ethnic Nationalism in War Film: The Case of Operation Chromite,"Pippel, Aaltje Dirkje","['Han, Namhee']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The division between North and South Korea has interested scholars over the years, especially because the differences between North and South have become more apparent over the years. Emma Campbell argues that ethnic nationalism, in which North and South Koreans are considered as brothers and sisters, is challenged by globalization. However, Shin argues that globalization only intensifies ethnic nationalism because of the threat from the outsider to the imagined community. This thesis shows how ethnic nationalism is challenged in South Korea, exemplified by the analysis of Operation Chromite, a Korean War film. This analysis shows that the film distinguishes a sharp ‘us’, the southern fighters, versus ‘them’, the northern fighters. While the southern fighters are depicted as heroes, the northern fighters are characterized as evil. From this analysis, it can be concluded that ethnic nationalism is challenged in South Korea by South Korean-ness because the North is demonized in contrast to the South. However, further studying of this subject is necessary in order to see if this film is part of a trend towards South Korean-ness instead of ethnic nationalism, or that the film can be considered as an outlier.","['Ethnic Nationalism', 'War Film', 'Operation Chromite', 'Korea']"

New Student Movements: Education revolutions in the Republic of Chile,"Duuren, Matthijs van","['Soledad Valdivia, P. Silva']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Chile has been known for its transition from an authoritarian military regime to a democracy in 1990. This shift in government transformed the country on many aspects, as it did gradually with the attitudes of the Chilean youth towards the education system. The latter named, however, has not been changed tremendously in the past two decades and half. Students have slowly but surely managed to show their discontent with the education system. According to Marco Kremerman in ‘La privatización de la educación: estudio del caso chileno’ (2008) ‘the Chilean educational system has been configured as a true ‘apartheid’ and segregation is seen both ‘between’ and ‘inside’ of different types of establishments’ (31). Chilean high school and university students dared to express their views on what could be changed about the education system, after the transition of governments. This paper will embark on framing the issue of marketization of education and how it has been contributed to the construction a collective identity of new student movements in the Republic of Chile. The central objective of this thesis will be to elucidate how framing contributed to the construction of a collective identity of student movements in 2006 and 2011. As a consequence, the central hypothesis of this study argues that the privatization of education in the market economy resulted into the two student revolution in Chile. Chapter one of the thesis will provide the reader with the theoretical framework. It is divided into three subchapters; ‘old’ vs. ‘new’ social movements, framing theory and collective identity. Next to that, chapter two will be a contextualization, and thus link the theories or concepts mentioned above in the first chapter to the case study in chapter three. Within chapter two, first of all a socio-historical background of new student movements will be examined upon. In a chronological order; first of all the ‘Penguin Revolution’ of 2006 shall be discussed before the ‘Chilean Winter’ of 2011 will be examined upon. Furthermore, the dissimilarities between public vs. private institutions will be exposed with its voucher system and all its consequences. At last, the case study in chapter three will analyze the ‘Penguin Revolution’ and the ‘Chilean Winter’ by applying the research techniques and definitions used in the theoretical framework combined with the contextualization in chapter two. The methodology that will be used in this field of study will be quantitative research from Nicolás M. Somma, associate researcher at the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies in Chile (COES) and Professor of Sociology at the Pontificia Universidad Católica . He collected a dataset of the protests by using newspapers, radio, websites and social movement organizations. Therefore I regard him as a very reliable and independent source. As qualitative research I will use a conducted interview by Lucia Newman from Aljazeera English. Before working for Aljazeera in 2006 she had 20 years of experience working for the CNN and reported throughout Latin America (Los Angeles Times, 2006). The interview she conducted in 2011 was with Giorgio Jackson, a prominent student leader. Since 2014 he holds the position of delegate of the Republic of Chile (BBC Mundo, 2016). As I spend a part of by Bachelor International Studies in Chile I also briefly interviewed a Chilean friend who participated in the student protests and studied Marketing and Strategic Communication.","['Student Movements', 'education', 'Chilean Winter', 'Penguin Revolution', 'social movements', 'framing and collective identity']"

Gendered Policies in Japan: Aiding Women or Reviving Corporate Glory?,"Oduber, Dara","['Pieke, F.N.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Japan has been dealing with a decreasing fertility rate for decades. This has had a direct effect on Japan’s labor force, as they now face shortages. Another reason for the lack of labor force participation is due to the low female labor force participation in the Japanese labor market. The Japanese government has been actively implementing policies to attract more female labor force by either eradicating workspace sexism or by investing more into childcare. Some of these major policies are the Equal Employment Opportunity Law (EEOL), Child Care Leave Act and Child Care and Family Leave Law, Angel Plan and New Angel Plan. While some policies have helped alleviate some of the burdens Japanese women carry, the female workforce participation is still low, as is the fertility rate. Furthermore, although the Japanese government actively seeks to resolve these issues, the motive behind it is ambiguous, as the issue of gender equality and sexism are often used as false incentives, especially during elections. The male-dominated corporate culture present in Japan also further fuels this. Thus, solutions become harder to reach while the issues still remain prevalent.","['Gender inequality', 'Japan', 'Gendered policies', 'Labor force', 'Corporate culture']"
"The Integration Process of Immigrants from the Middle East in Austria: Legal, Political and Socio-Cultural Aspects","Ulrich, Verena","['Strava, Cristiana']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Migration has been one of the most prevailing issues in European public, political and academic debate over the last few years. Due to its specific geographical location within Europe and its reputation as a stable welfare state, Austria has become an important country of asylum. Today, it is one of the European countries which hosts most asylum seekers relative to its population. At the same time, politically and legally, Austria embodies one of the most conservative integration regimes in Western Europe. At a societal level, integration is widely negatively connoted―especially with reference to Muslim immigrants―and islamophobia and hostility towards Muslims has increased. In the light of the recent inflow of migrants from Muslim-majority countries, Austria seems to be forced to effectively engage with the adoption of integration measures that fit a country of immigration with sensibility towards the general public’s islamophobic tendencies. To investigate into the topic further, my thesis aims at covering integration from three perspectives: the role of the Austrian government, the predominant perceptions of Austria's society and of immigrants from the Middle East, including my own data collection. My thesis therefore focuses on the following question: What are some of the legal, political and socio-cultural aspects that have influenced and determined the integration process of Middle Eastern immigrants in Austria since 9/11?","['integration', 'immigration', 'Austria', 'Middle East', 'discrimination', 'refugees', 'islamophobia', 'socio-cultural interaction', 'everyday racism', 'Austrian public discourse']"

Confronting the Dictatorship: Spain’s Political Revival of the Past,"Duken, Carlotta","['Dieterman, Elisabeth M.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Spain’s democratic transition has served as a model of transition for many other countries of the third wave of democratization. However, despite the remarkable features of peacefulness and rapidity of transforming from an authoritarian to a democratic state, the country abstained from a rupture with its old regime and from measures of transitional justice. In the center of Spain’s politics of continuity was the “Pact of Forgetting“ or pact of silence, an informal agreement amongst political parties in 1976 to silence the past of the Spanish Civil War and the dictatorship, in order to overcome historical cleavages and facilitate democratization. Nevertheless, since the 1990s, the pact of silence has been broken on several occasions by left political parties and increasingly come under pressure by civil society’s demands for justice. The 2000s were defined by two trends: an acceleration of left and societal demands for a recovery of historical memory and justice measures on the one hand, and conservative parties’ resistance in dealing with Spain’s past on the other hand. This thesis will examine the reasons for the disintegration of the pact of silence, with a particular focus on the “memory war” between left and right parties.","['Spain', 'Dictatorship', 'Amnesty Law', 'Pact of Forgetting', 'Memory Politics', 'Historical Memory', 'Transitional Justice']"
Mecca: Trancending Architecture through Time and Space,"Zaim, Yonca","['Kaptein, Nico J.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Mecca of today displays a concrete image of a modern city. Contemporary buildings and planned communal spaces following the rules of 21st century architecture dominate the plains of this religious hub. This process of change on the Meccan cityscape can be traced through a number of factors; population growth, the globalization of the world, oil and its ties with the West. However, one factor lies key in triggering these changes - the Saudi-Wahhabi takeover of 1916. During the early beginnings of the First World War the Ottoman Empire was coming to a gradual end, loosing her power and influence on the lands under her rule. Challenged with fighting enemies on the western front, Ottoman focus on the Hijaz region shifted, offering a leeway for the Wahhabi faction to gain in strength and overthrow the Anatolian control, acclaiming the area known today as Saudi Arabia. This thesis aims to focus on what the consequential influences of the Wahhabi takeover in the 1920s were for the cityscape of Mecca through discussing: the differences between Mecca’s administrative styles under the diverging rule of the Ottoman Empire and the current Saudi decree; the religious background and effects the main principles of Wahhabism played on Meccan architecture; the discovery of oil and its repercussions of modernization and globalization; and the possible instigation of a new Islamic paradigm of Mecca, since its image has been altered so drastically. A time frame will be placed2, starting from the early stages of the 20th century, where the Ottoman Empire’s reign came to an end, up until the modern day Wahhabi rule.","['Mecca', 'Architecture', 'Ottoman Empire', 'Wahhabism', 'Space and Time Compression', 'Cityscape', 'Modernisation', 'Islam']"

The Myth of the Motherland in Russia - Analyzing Cultural Memory Construction,"Robinski, Marie","['Boele, Otto']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The main objective of this thesis is to show that cultural memory on World War Two is stronlgy linked to the feminine myth persistent in Russian culture. This argument is proven on the basis of the analysis of three case studies. The cases at hand are “The Motherland Calls“ statue in Volgograd, “The Motherland“ statue in Kiev and Poklonnaya Gora harboring the Victory Park in Moscow. By examining the historical narratives created through cultural discourses and public debates about these monuments I was able to uncover power relations that direct these narratives. In addition, I examined the role of cultural memory in shaping national identity and social unity. To be able to do so I provide information on the feminine myth, cultural memory and present my own analytical framework for the investigation of cultural memory construction. The outcome of my analysis is the discovery of the defining role of the feminine myth with regards to cultural memory construction on World War Two in Russia and Ukraine.","['Cultural Memory', 'Feminine Myth in Russia', 'World War Two in Russia', 'War Monuments in Russia']"

The Nostalgia for Strongman Rule and Marcosian Politics,"Hartweg, Maraiah Alexandra","['Verver, Michiel']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“Marcos is not a Hero!”, were the words that echoed throughout the country in the later months of 2016. The echoes reached far and beyond its domestic boundaries. For a moment, the cries of the people - of the people who suffered, of the people whose loved ones are still missing, of the people who stood and continue to stand against the tyranny the Marcos regime reigned on the Philippines, resounded across the entire globe. Local and International media did not hold back on the coverage of the protesters who organized themselves in the masses in the Philippines, as well as in diaspora communities across Europe, the United States and Asia. The national outcry against the Marcos regime was a direct result of the decision made by the Supreme Court of the Philippines and President Rodrigo R. Duterte to allow former dictator Ferdinand Marcos to be buried at the Libingan ng Mga Bayani (LNMB or Heroes‟ Cemetery) on 18. November 2016.The burial of the former President Ferdinand E. Marcos at the Heroes Cemetery in November ignited a mix of pent up emotions on authoritarian rulership among millions of Filipinos. Speculations on the familial ties or characteristic similarities between Marcos and Duterte were kept at bay prior to the burial. Nevertheless, when President Duterte and the Supreme Court decided that they will pursue the state burial for the former dictator, it became evident that thirty years of democracy were not enough to forget the torrid past. During the burial demonstrations, the similarities between both former President Marcos and incumbent President Duterte began to raise suspicion on the return of the Marcosian ideology, the revitalization of strongman rulership and the “glorification the authoritarian brand of leadership” (Paddock 2016; Philstar.com „Marcos not a hero!‟ 2016). Prior to winning the 2016 Presidential Elections, Rodrigo Duterte‟s use of the populist political style became clear to the public, especially during specific turning points and highlights in his campaign. During his candidacy, Duterte neither hesitated to joke about rape, nor to speak about his plans to bring back the death penalty, to perform extrajudicial killings, or to reinstate Martial Law if needed. Every speech, video and article that came out about the candidate seemed to test the morality of the people more and more. The theatricality of Duterte‟s candidacy became evident in the narrative, in which he has constructed himself, as well as in the language that he used to articulate himself, and even in his late arrival to the elections (Curato 2017; 146-147). As Duterte‟s political style quickly proved its success, certain questions came to mind about the current progression of liberal democracy, like: How are Filipinos able to disregard their (catholic) morals and give their full support to a violent, threatening and misogynist leader? Have the pent-up feelings of the “silent majority” finally reached its culminating point? And, most importantly, how has he been able to successfully harness popular support out of hate, fear and bigotry? These questions on the fanaticism between both pro- and anti-Duterte, or pro- and anti-Marcos for that matter, are what sparked my initial interest in the Duterte phenomenon, regarding his 6 sudden rise in popularity, landslide victory and continued support from the electorate. Hence, this thesis will attempt to answer the research question: “How is Rodrigo inspired by Marcosian Politics?” in order to understand the revitalization of strongman rule and Marcosian Politics. To answer the overarching research question, the thesis will look into the aspects that contribute to the idea that the incumbent president is in any way inspired by the former dictator. This entails a closer look into Rodrigo Duterte‟s rise to power, as well as a look into how both presidents have treated their opposition. The sequence of the sub-questions gives focus to the thesis and clarifies the points that will be considered when analysing the elements of Marcosian Politics that Duterte allegedly draws inspiration from.","['Duterte', 'Marcos', 'Philippines', 'Populism', 'Strongman Rule', 'Sultanism', 'Personalistic Rule']"

Russia’s decision to intervene militarily has arguably been of great influence on the Syrian conflict. The main focus of this thesis is to assess the effectiveness of Russia’s foreign policy regarding Syria, specifically the ongoing Syrian conflict. This is measured by analysing the translation of foreign policy goals into implementation and by determining whether the goals have been met. The groundwork in terms of literature consists of scholarly work on the making and implementation of foreign policy both in general and in relation to Russia. The main chapters are devoted to the goals, implementation and achievements of Russia’s foreign policy with respect to Syria. First, light is shed on the goals of Russia’s foreign policy regarding Syria and their mode of implementation. Then it is determined if and to what extent the foreign policy goals have been met. This then allows for analysis of the factors that have either fostered or constrained the implementation of Russia’s foreign policy goals. Finally, a cautious effort is made to discern future prospects regarding Russia’s foreign policy in Syria.","['Russia', 'Syria', 'Foreign Policy', 'Effectiveness']"
Representations of hafu in Japanese advertisement: The relevance of the intersectionality of race and gender,"Steenmetz, Nina Maria Kulumi","['Ezawa, E.A.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Up until now, there has been a lot of studies done on the topic hafu in Japan. Although, a gap can be identified when we consider gendered aspects of the mixed-race identity. Social aspects within an identity such as race and gender, should not be simply observed separately but investigated on how they interact with or affect each other. This thesis examines the mixed-race identity as a multidimensional concept by focusing on the intersectionality of race and gender. The main question is: “how does the intersection of racial and gendered identities contribute to the identity experience of hafu in Japan?” Firstly, this thesis argues how the intersectionality theory, primarily introduced by Crenshaw, adds value to understanding the mixed-race identity. It will highlight the importance of this angle. Secondly, it will provide a historical background of hafu in Japan and discuss the gaps in the literature on this topic. After a critical discussion of the issue, an analysis investigates how representations of hafu in Japanese advertisements are contributing to the identity of hafu. It will provide an insight of how images in advertisements show intersecting gendered and racial identity assumptions for male and female hafu.","['hafu', 'intersectionality', 'race', 'gender', 'japanese advertisement', 'mixed-race', 'mixed-race identity']"

This was the first time that women participated in Guatemalan politics as a group. However, the movement has had difficulties bridging the boundaries of class, race and ethnicity in the post-war era. In a deeply divided society women´s organizations rarely cooperate with each other and have been reluctant to create a collective political identity. In recent years unity has been sought through cooperating on specific issues such as violence against women. In these rare instances of cooperation the organizations have mobilized under a strategic collective identity based on “unity around difference” and by framing their interests under the framework of human rights. This thesis finds that in the #NiUnaMenos protest, held on the 19th of October, 2016, solidary was created by drawing from the discourses of the revolutionary past and on a common understanding of history.","['Guatemalan Women´s movement', 'feminism', 'Guatemala', 'Gender', 'Political Identity']"

The Role of Businesses in Enforcing Human Rights in the United States,"Kotoaro, Rosa Aleksandra","['Fynn-Paul, Jeffrey', 'Moody, Simanique']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Under international law, states assume obligations to respect, protect, and to fulfil human rights (OHCHR). This thesis will demonstrate that the state can fail to carry out these tasks, and that in these situations businesses can step up to enforce human rights, thus filling regulatory gaps. This topic will be approached by first providing a definition of CSR, and explaining the relevance of the concept. Following this, the thesis will discuss different eras in the history of state versus business power, proposing that there has been a shift from an era of extensive state power towards a relative erosion of state capacities, accompanied by an increase in the power of corporations. While it will be proposed that this erosion of state capacities has opened up new possibilities for companies to adopt political responsibilities (Schrempf-Stirling 2), the thesis will also seek to understand why companies would make use of these possibilities. In order to analyze firms’ motivations to expand their influence to the political sphere to promote human rights, the thesis will introduce a theoretical framework which will identify three different CSR theories. To examine the applicability of these theories, the thesis will perform three case studies in the context of the United States: 1) Open Carry, 2) Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act or the ‘House Bill 2’, also known as the ‘bathroom bill’, and 3) Executive Order 13769 or the so-called ‘Muslim ban’ or ‘travel ban’. Through these steps, the objective of the thesis is to determine 1) whether businesses have indeed expanded their capacities to the political realm in the context of human rights promotion, thus filling regulatory gaps as suggested by CSR scholarship, 2) how they have done so, and 3) what the underlying motivations behind companies’ CSR practices are. The findings are expected to support the twofold hypothesis that 1) businesses can become the key enforcers of human rights by expanding their power to the political arena, and 2) businesses have philanthropic and ethical responsibilities besides their economic responsibility of profit-maximization, which contribute to explaining their CSR activities.","['Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Human Rights', 'the United States']"

European nuclear scientists were much more productive under the conditions they encountered in the United States than they would have been if they had stayed in their home countries. In addition, the economic wealth of the USA enabled both American and expatriate scientists to make their wildest dreams come true, because money was not an issue and the best laboratories and technologies of that time were available to them. Although many of these European physicists stayed in England for a short period of time, eventually they fled into the USA.

Although the existence of a thriving sex industry is not uncommon elsewhere, Japan’s case is quite different and unique. This difference lies in the overly sexual objectification of schoolgirls. It was reported that schoolgirls started to engage in compensated dating, or enjo-kousai(援助交際) the specific term in Japanese for this activity. At the time of discovery, this phenomenon took the Japanese society by surprise. Enjo-kousai was once ubiquitous and prevalent in the Japanese media and under the public eye. However, as suggested by newspaper headlines, in recent years the term has not been applied unless connected to organized crime or celebrities/politicians scandals.

These ‘other mothers’ first started to gain relevance in the documentaries produced by the children of the disappeared in the early 2000s, in which their testimony emerged as a tool for discovering untold stories about the dictatorship period and for challenging traditional motherhood in the Latin American culture. Hence, this thesis aims at analysing how can the ‘other mothers’that appear in the children's documentaries promote an alternative version about the past and challenge traditional assumptions about motherhood. This will be done through the analysis of two mothers in two specific documentaries, namely Papa Ivan(2004) and Encontrando a Victor (2005).","['Argentina dictatorship Las Madres documentaries memory', 'Argentina dictatorship mothers documentaries memory']"

One of these was the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC, Autodefensas), the umbrella organisation of the pro-state, right-wing paramilitaries that developed close ties with state agencies and politicians. These corrupt networks, known as parapolitics, not only provided protection and economic benefits to the paramilitaries but also allowed them to influence the political sphere. Hence, paramilitary-state collusion also shaped the demobilisation process of these structures that occurred between 2003-2006. According to prominent organisations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the flaws of the transitional justice framework under which AUC demobilised, for instance the lack of sufficient investigation, allowed the continuation of paramilitarism. Re-emergent paramilitary structures are now present in 24 out of 32 departments of the country and are continuing shape politics, which also implies the continuation of paramilitary violence. This essay analyses the case of AUC and the re-emerging paramilitary structures to understand how corruption allows the continuation of paramilitary violence and parapolitics despite the demobilisation of the Autodefensas.","['Colombia', 'parapolitics', 'corruption', 'AUC', 'paramilitarism', 'violence', 'bacrim']"

The methodology utilised for analyses was copied from the research of Sela-Shayovitz and provided the following four indicators for police legitimacy: trust in police, police performance, interpersonal treatment and procedural-justice process (2015). By categorizing quotes, sentences and comments within the positive or negative side of these indicators, the affect media has on framing police legitimacy could be established towards the three selected timeframes. The analysed secondary sources include academic articles, as well as online newspapers, documentaries, and social media pages relating to the campaign Where is Amarildo? and the favela Rocinha. The research displayed that the first hypothesis, which assumed that the disappearance of Amarildo displays a predominantly negative coverage and leads to diminished police legitimacy, is partly true. Subsequently, the second hypothesis was that the closure of the case in February 2016 could display a mainly positive indication of police legitimacy due to the established sense of justice. It can be concluded that this assumption is false in relation to the mainstream media and partly true in relation to the grass root voices. Furthermore, the research displayed that the hypotheses that the indicators interpersonal treatment and procedural-justice process are the main indicators of police legitimacy was false. It is strongly advised to conduct more research on these four indicators, or additional variables, in order to avoid future ‘Amarildo’s’.","['Brazil', 'Police', 'Legitimacy', 'Amarildo de Souza', 'Media', 'Where is Amarildo?', 'Trust', 'Police Performance', 'Procedural Fairness']"

Why are refugees so unwelcome in Japan?,"Gimeno Ruiz, Claudia","['Cheuk, Ka-Kin']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the start of the Syrian civil war, 11 million people have been displaced from their homes and 5 million of them have had to flee to neighboring countries and beyond. As the UNHCR calls for action and encourages governments to open their borders in the face of what they have labeled “the biggest humanitarian refugee crisis of our time”, Japan’s borders remain largely closed to the inflows of refugees - Japan only admitted a total of 28 refugees in 2016. The explanations that the government has been offering about why the system is such a strict one are closely related to national identity building through political discourse. Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe has said that Japan must prioritize national issues before being able to welcome foreign migrants. This statement points towards the key role that a homogeneous society is utmost important in the build-up of Japanese national identity. How does the rather small number of refugee inflows, despite its minimal impacts on Japanese politics and society, remains so unwelcome in Japan? This thesis will provide the reader with a deeper understanding of this question by looking at the impact nationalism plays in Japanese society, the way its collective history is portrayed and in the Japanese migration policies.","['Japan', 'Refugees', 'Nationalism', 'Foreign Policy', 'Migration Policies']"

The theoretical framework of food regimes, and of the corporate food regime as an extension, is utilised in order to present the various actors and ideological backgrounds relevant to this discussion. Additionally, this paper outlines the global and national contexts of coffee production in order to place any findings in its appropriate context. Lastly, the theoretical issues found through the aforementioned discussion is explored within the case study of the ‘Food and Nutrition Sovereignty and Security Law’ or law 693.

"#DabOfShame: You dance, We die - Kenya’s Twitter resistance to the electoral agenda.","Marty, Edwige Philippine","['Goede, Meike de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the context of the upcoming elections in Kenya in August 2017, debates on Twitter have highlighted the gap between the political elite’s electoral agenda and the population’s daily struggles of surviving and coping with harsh realities. Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, recently launched an online campaign calling for voters registration – #UhuruDabChallenge – which was met with fierce protestations online, formalised under the #DabOfShame. This thesis will analyse the framing of this clash of priorities on Twitter by looking at the spread and use of one hashtag in particular – #DabOfShame – and one of the subtheme the #KOT community highlighted, that is the country’s hunger and drought crises. Indeed, analysing the #DabOfShame highlights the gap between the state discourse and the subsequent online responses, which has a huge impact on the way pertaining daily issues and their realities are depicted online. In particular, looking at Kenya’s most salient and recurrent difficulties – the hunger and drought crises – pinpoints how the users shed light on the problems, thus “framing” an opposition of concerns, and pushing the political elite to address them. Interestingly, the users and content analysis of this specific hashtag give insights into the political socialisation processes that Twitter enables and the platform it provides for the Kenyan connected generation to express its grievances in the everyday context. Eventually, this can inform discussions on the possibility of social media to influence the government’s agenda and produce a united common front in a context of political polarisation. This, however, also reveals concerning trends in the way Twitter is used by the political elite in Kenya, in particular by its president, which suggests that social media are possibly developing into new podiums on which political legitimacy is fought and gained.","['Twitter', 'Social Media', 'Politics', 'Frame analysis', 'Narrative agency', 'Kenya', 'election']"
"From Difficult Birth to Defiant Adolescence - Land, Race and Nation-Building in Zimbabwe","Verhey, I.J.O.","['Bellucci, Stefano']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis looks at the effects that the UDI, the Second Chimurenga and the Lancaster House Agreement (LHA) have had on Zimbabwe and the current official government discourse by assessing the historical documents and various speeches by President Robert Mugabe. This thesis explores how the new Zimbabwean elite class was formed by the Chimurenga and what effect this had on the political economy, in terms of land and resource distribution, the race dynamics and nation-building under black majority rule. It stresses the importance of taking a more nuanced approach than simply blaming either Mugabe or the colonial past for the current social, political and economic crisis in Zimbabwe. At 36 years old, Zimbabwe is such a young state that much remains to be researched and discussed, not only for the sake of scholarship but also to better understand the struggles that the average Zimbabwean faces and to move away from Western-led development aid towards more effective and self-sufficient grassroots and projects.",
African RECs as regional peacekeepers – a case study of SADC,"Berg, Jeroen van den","['Goede, M.J. de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"For the last decade, a new trend has emerged in both the academic as well as political debate which identifies a decline of American domination and a rise of “the rest”. In other words, a movement towards multipolarity. A particular topic of dispute among both scholars and politicians is the degree to which this multipolar world order is either regionalising or globalising the world. One of the domains that has been impacted by the study of regionalisation is the domain of security. A particular topic of debate amongst politicians and scholars concerns peace operations and the role of the United Nations (UN) and regional organisations. Within the African context, the question arises if the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) should take on the role of regional peacekeepers. This paper sets out to analyse the regionalisation of peace operations in Africa and question the viability of regional organisations as an alternative to the UN as main actor in peace operations. To this end, it will measure the ability of RECs to organise and execute peace operations. It will become clear that the regionalisation of security is a logical consequence of the regional and cross-border characteristic of African conflicts and that regional organisations bring some merits to the table in terms of local legitimacy and willingness. Nevertheless, the case of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) will show that a long way still lies ahead and that the organisation currently only manages to bridge some of the same shortcomings as the UN encounters, without offering much advantages.","['Peacekeeping', 'Africa', 'Regionalisation', 'Regional Economic Communities', 'United Nations']"
Alternativeless Rake Treading: Explaining the Lack of Change in Belarusian Foreign Policy after the Annexation of Crimea,"Moshes, Elizaveta","['Bouma, Amieke']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This work studies the Russia-Belarus and EU-Belarus relations in the post-Crimean period with the aim of explaining why after the initial steps away from the Russian influence in the early 2014, Belarus eventually decided to return back. Belarus shares many key characteristics with Crimea, creating a potential threat to Belarusian sovereignty and narrowing down the possible scope of maneuvering for Belarus in the post-Crimean age. Thus, initially a thaw was noted between Belarus and the EU. The factors studied in this thesis are economics, public opinion trends, political trends as well as the perceptive of Lukashenka himself. These factors demonstrate that at this moment, unless various economic and political reforms take place, Belarus yields more from a closer relationship with Russia as Moscow can and is willing to offer more incentives than Brussels. The study follows the act of balance framework, which explains any derivations from the Russia direction as attempts at maximum short-term gains rather than long-term changes.","['Belarus', 'Russian-Belarusian relations', 'EU-Belarus relations', 'post-Crimean period', 'Regime survival in post-Soviet space', 'Act of balance']"

The influence of RMB undervaluation on agricultural producers in China,"Noordermeer, Tomas","['Wang, Jue']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The unprecedented growth of the Chinese economy was mainly featured by rapidly augmenting exports, which were partly enabled by a beneficial currency valuation of China’s domestic currency, the renminbi (RMB), during the turn of the 21st century. However, along with the liberalization of the Chinese market economy, especially after China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), agricultural producers were faced with increasing foreign competition as well as ceasing product protection. One question that arises is whether the currency undervaluation enabled the agricultural producers to maintain their competitiveness despite their abrupt confrontation with market exposure. Another question that arises is whether the currency undervaluation enabled the agricultural producers’ to increase their outputs, in light of the opportunities engendered by market liberalization. In other words, in this thesis, I will examine the extent to which agricultural producers benefited from the renminbi undervaluation during the turn of the 21st century.","['Currency undervaluation', 'Agriculture in China', 'Agricultural outputs', 'Product protection']"

"Decentralization, corruption and violence caused by drug trafficiking organizations in Mexico","Dimitrova, Valeriya","['Rivera, Soledad']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Drug-trafficking, corruption and violence are all highly negative phenomena and currently present throughout the Mexican states. In the last years of the twentieth century policies of decentralisation of the political power began in Mexico parallel to a democratic transition. This led to a change in the already existing corrupt practices within the country. Decentralisation of the government in transitional countries increases corruption, while corruption within public institutions predisposes to less crime reporting due to less faith in the system. The aim of this piece is to explain the persistently high levels of violence caused by drug-trafficking organisations in some Mexican states after decentralisation of the political power. The method chosen for this paper is the use of literary sources complemented by quantitative data, presenting it in tables and then constructing graphs to show the correlation coefficient between the investigated parameters. It was discovered that a higher rate of perceived corruption and a poorer justice efficiency performance could very well explain the persistently high levels of violence caused by drug-trafficking organisations in some Mexican states.","['Decentralisation', 'corruption', 'drug-trafficking organisations', 'violence', 'Mexico']"

After an anchored 30-year-old regime, Egypt witnessed rapid transitions between the rule of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF), an interim president and two elected presidents within a period of only 6 years. Thus, the Arab spring and the rapid regime transitions have significantly played a role in shaping Egypt’s foreign policy and respectively, Egypt’s role.Today’s Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, is bringing the historical and traditional sense back to Egypt’s foreign policy. History, geography, size have previously shaped Egypt to be a leading power of the region. However, as it faces internal upheaval, Egypt seems to be culturally, politically and economically dormant from its dominant role. The Egyptian foreign policy may be currently under revision but it has an opportunity to re-define the role of Egypt in the region. This paper will first outline the historical roots and developments of the Egyptian foreign policy constructed under Nasser and Sadat, and progressed under Mubarak. Although both leaders pursued regional power, they led different ideologies which will be elaborated by opposing theories: raison de nation and constructivism led by Morsi on the one hand and raison d’état and realism on the one hand led by Sisi.","['Egypt', 'Foreign Policy', 'Muslim Brotherhood', 'International Relations', 'Egyptian Revolution', 'IR Theories']"
Pinochet: introducing Corruption into Chile the Role of Neoliberalism and Authoritarianism,"Carlucci, Martina","['Rios Oyola, Sandra']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis answers the question: to what extent are both neoliberal policies and the lack of checks and balances typical of Pinochet’s authoritarian regime (1973-1990) responsible for the emergence of corruption in Chile? This thesis conducts a qualitative analysis, and, firstly, designs a theoretical framework based on the literature on the relation between neoliberalism and corruption, as well as authoritarianism and corruption. Secondly, this thesis provides the historical, economic and moral context in which Pinochet’s dictatorship grew. Thirdly, this thesis answers its research question and concludes that neoliberal policies led to corruption from the very beginning, namely from a disorganized process of privatization. This favoured quick deregulation and allowed the elites to put their interests before the ones of the nation. Accordingly, private elites acquired state enterprises through the practise of exclusion of qualified bidders, and agglomerated in the grupos económicos, stimulating an enduring system of political patronage and clientelism. This thesis further determines that the lack of checks and balances – given by the absence of free press, opposition parties, Contraloría and an independent judiciary power – made it impossible to keep the government accountable and helped to strengthen even more political patronage and clientelism. Finally, this thesis proves that, in this context, neoliberalism provided the means to the dictatorship to engage in corrupt practises and to Pinochet himself to get visibly richer.",['Chile Pinochet neoliberalism authoritarianism corruption']

"Resource Curse, Oil Rent and Mismanagement: The Case of PDVSA","Mensah, Priscilla","['Amann, Edmund']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In many extractive economies natural resource has the potential to be detrimental to development through the disabling of the countries’ economies, and could be an incentive for mismanagement compared to countries without substantial natural resources (Holden 870). This phenomenon is known as the resource curse (Badeeb et al. 123). This study is a critical assessment of the resource curse theory with regards to the management of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company (PDVSA). It investigates the arguments of the resource curse theory that the resource abundance curses institutions through poor governance and promotes high government spending and corruption (Tornell and Lane 34). To achieve the aim of the research, this study reviews the rent-seeking model and the institutional model of the resource curse theory, and examines their applications to Venezuela’s state-owned company. Since the resource curse theory does not give sufficient explanation hence, institutionalism as a different school of thought has been used to complement the theory. The empirical findings and discussion indicates evidence of the rent-seeking model and institutional model in addition to the rationality of institutionalism. This in other words means that the resource curse theory cannot entirely explain the case of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA.","['Resource Curse', 'Institutions', 'Rent seeking', 'Corruptions', 'Spending', 'Oil abundance and dependency', 'Venezuela', 'PDVSA']"
The Suffering of Syria and the Failure of the Responsibility to Protect,"Colonna, Joseph","['Crystal, Ennis']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The struggle between sovereignty and humanitarian intervention remains one of the fundamental controversies in international politics. The 1648 Treaty of Westphalia helped to bring peace to much of the world through the creation and realisation of national sovereignty, however a growing global consciousness began to resist against this. The ratification of the responsibility to protect (R2P) doctrine in 2005 by the UN General Assembly set the humanitarian interventionist pendulum in motion. Providing a mechanism to facilitate foreign intervention in a sovereign state in order to protect human welfare, the R2P doctrine indicated a shark contrast with the past. Although proving successful in many cases, this doctrine has been pushed to its limits in Libya and Syria. Through content and discourse analysis this paper assesses the impact of the Libyan and Syrian crisis on the R2P doctrine, and as a result questions the feasibility and viability of the doctrine. R2P references in key UN documents show that R2P fails to positively influence decision making in the highest echelons of international diplomacy, while the comments of state representatives show that NATO’s un-mandated regime change in Libya has infected the doctrine. This infection has been so great that in its current form, R2P no-longer has a place in facilitating humanitarian intervention.","['Syria', 'R2P', 'Civil War', 'Libya', 'UN']"

Seriously Concerned? Brazilian Deputies on Inequality and Tax Reform,"Burattini, Beatriz","['Amann, Edmund']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The reputation of politicians and their parties has not been spared by Brazil’s ever deepening political crisis, as a variety of corruption scandals have delegitimised a large part of the country’s political establishment (Watts; Addley). Considering the dimensions of these scandals (Associated Press in Brasilia), citizens may wonder whether the men and women they elected feel obliged to serve their society. Putting scandals aside, the prevalence of income and wealth inequality in the country is another problem that raises this question. One of the country’s structural issues, inequality harms society by increasing criminality and political instability (dos Santos et al. 111; Price of Inequality 83-92). Although Brazilian politicians could tackle this issue by introducing a system of progressive taxation where wealthier citizens are taxed more than less wealthy ones, they have allowed that a system of regressive taxation remains in place (Price of Inequality 31; Andrade 837-840; Junqueira 93). Income taxes could be used to counter this problem, but since the Brazilian government relies less on them, the tax structure remains regressive (Price of Inequality 30-74; Economics of the Public Sector 453; Andrade 837-840). While there have been attempts to reform the tax system in the past, no tax reform has been passed in the favour of wealth redistribution (Junqueira 93; Andrade 849). Moreover, in light of the myriad of scandals in Brazil’s political arena at the moment, one may wonder whether the country’s politicians feel any sense of duty towards its citizens. In an attempt to come closer to examining how self-interested Brazil’s political class actually is, this paper will use the tax reform attempt of 2008 to determine whether income redistribution – a form of ‘greater good’ – is regarded as a priority for Brazilian politicians. After analysing eleven political debates by Brazilian deputies from the 53rd legislature, this research has found that inequality still cannot be seen as a priority for most of the country’s political class. This can be explained by considering Brazilian political culture and how it has been shaped by history.",
What We Do Is Secret: A Comparison Of The Actors Present In South Africa’s Medical And Muti Markets For Organs,"Jansen, Bernard","['Nyst, Victoria']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This bachelor thesis seeks to identify the relevant actors in the medical and muti markets for organs in South Africa. Firstly a theoretical background is presented, in order to identify the relevant theories and concepts needed to understand organ markets. A brief overview of the two markets to be compared is also given. This background serves to support the central research question: Who are the relevant actors in the medical and muti markets for organs in South Africa and how do the respective actors interact and how do these interactions flow? A methodology for answering the above question is also presented. The method used in this bachelor thesis consisted of a review of the relevant literature and media sources in order to build an overview of actors in each market. These overviews are then used to construct actor network diagrams for each of the markets. The overviews and diagrams are then discussed. The study has shown that the markets are indeed comparable, and that they share a similar flow of organs. However, the muti market is a decentralized one with a strong linear flow from the source person to the recipient. The medical market on the other hand was found to be a distributed network, with organs and interactions flowing between and through a number of actors rather than from one side to another.","['Organ', 'Organ Trafficking', 'Organ Market', 'Muti', 'Commodification', 'Actor Network', 'Witchcraft', 'Africa', 'South Africa']"

A comparison will be drawn after investigating multiple societal factors; the stance towards authority, differences between generations, social class and inequality. Also other examples of students’ revolts and social changes will be studied to gain a broader view on what was happening in both these times in Europe. Eventually findings of each case will be compared and this will provide a deeper understanding of both Maagdenhuis occupations.

In brief, is nostalgia good or bad for us? I will approach these questions by exploring the answers already available in the academic discourses of psychology and historiography. There are two features particular to nostalgia: it is an emotion and it is concerned with the past; hence, psychology and historiography were selected here as the two disciplines most closely engaged with the said areas. The pool of studies from these two disciplines selected here represent strikingly opposing perspectives on nostalgia and thus an investigation of the viewpoints which they exemplify promises fertile learning grounds.","['nostalgia', 'psychology', 'historiography', 'modernity', 'history', 'language']"

The Societal Impact of Starbucks in Urban China,"Timmerman, Sabine","['Cheuk, Ka-Kin']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The emergence of globalizing companies in China such as Starbucks have different effects on the Chinese society. The changing consumption pattern of the post-Mao generation, especially the middle class, is the reason to research Starbucks’ presence in China. The company’s influence will be examined through the lens of three concepts: Starbucks’ as a foreign company, its influence on the Chinese state, and the emergence of individualization in a post-Mao China. I argue that it is necessary to look at the ‘bigger picture’ instead of focussing on only one of the previously mentioned factors. It seems that Starbucks thanks its popularity in China by offering glocalized products and therewith respecting the country’s cultural heritage in the form of traditional cuisine and drinks. The company maintains its relationship with state authorities by launching new projects with involvement of the Chinese government. The fact that Starbucks has so many products stimulates the sense of individuality among its clientele. A multinational foreign company does not only impact the consumption pattern of a population, but it also has implications for a society’s behaviour in general.","['Urban China', 'Starbucks', 'Consumption', 'Consumer behavior', 'individualization', 'foreign businesses']"

Black feminist scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw initiated the social justice movement “#sayhername” in 2015 to address the severity of black women’s maltreatment and their underrepresentation in society. Her conceptualisation of “intersectionality” theory in 1989 allows for academic debate on the “matrix of oppressions” that undermines black women on the grounds of race, gender, sexual orientation, capitalism and imperialism. This recent development has raised the necessity to overcome the effacement of black women’s narratives from the past and the present. However, roots of intersectionality theory lie in the establishment of the historical black feminist organisations that separated from the “mainstream” black liberation and women’s liberation groups to challenge the intersecting oppressions. This thesis examines the historical black feminist struggles towards empowerment to argue that the oppressions still need to be overcome in the 21st century United States. It discusses three different black feminist organisations that emerged in the 1970s who laid the groundwork for present-day black feminism and intersectionality theory. First, the National Black Feminist Organisation (NBFO) which was the first group to defend black women’s needs and to raise the black feminist consciousness. Second, the Combahee River Collective (CRC), which developed the pivotal basis for intersectionality theory to discuss matters of sexual orientation and lesbianism to bring minority issues to the public attention. Last, the Third World Women’s Alliance (TWWA) that established a democratic global sisterhood to educate and to empower women of colour who were equally burdened by imperialism. An analysis of these three black feminist groups illustrates how feminist and historical literature neglect black women’s accomplishments for black women’s justice. Additionally, an understanding of the historical struggles of black feminists is essential to challenge the injustices minority groups experience today. As a result, this thesis argues that new social justice movements of consciousness-raising, black women’s empowerment and a gender-inclusive political agenda are necessary to foster gender and race equality.","['Intersectionality', 'Black Feminism', 'racism', 'sexism', 'social justice', 'Kimberlé Crenshaw', 'black liberation', ""women's liberation movement"", 'minority groups', 'radical black feminists']"

Iranian Realpolitik: Iran’s Foreign Policy towards Armed Conflicts in Neighbouring Countries,"Ahlawat, Rajat","['Forough, Mohammadbagher']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Iran‟s foreign policy has evolved substantially since the time of the Islamic Revolution in 1979. A major shift came after the demise of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, and especially under the presidency of Akbar Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami. The most important drivers in Iran's foreign policy in its neighbourhood are its national security and economic interests, which seem to go hand in hand in most of the cases. The thesis looks at Iran's foreign policy in its immediate neighbourhood, i.e. from its policy decisions on support to Christian Armenia against Shia Azerbaijan, cooperation with the United States (the ""Great Satan"") in Afghanistan and Iraq, and its support towards stabilization and reconstruction of Afghanistan all point in the direction of pragmatism in the foreign policy, decisions which directly have an effect on improving both security as well as economic standing of Tehran in the whole region. It also shows a tendency of continued support towards its allies, using all possible tools to advance its standing and influence in the region; religion, culture, economic aid, reconstruction, trade and cooperation, support to de-facto and local power holders, all serve as means to advance its national interests in terms of the policy of realpolitik.","['Iran', 'Realpolitik', 'IranianRealpolitik', ""Iran'sForeignPolicy"", 'Iran-Afghanistan', 'Iran-UnitedStates', 'Iran-Armenia-Azerbaijan']"

Met de behandeling van deze vraag probeert dit stuk inzicht te geven in het functioneren en het nut van het Oranjenetwerk van Duitse verwanten in deze voor de Oranjes moeilijke tijd. Een helder beeld van de vorm en het functioneren van dit netwerk is essentieel voor het begrijpen van wat het Oranjehuis in de stadhouderloze periode eigenlijk nog voorstelde. Wat gebeurt er met een vorstenhuis als het plots door nieuwe machthebbers buitenspel wordt gezet en alle toegang tot bestuurlijke functies wordt ontzegd? Wat levert een dynastiek netwerk, zoals Amalia van Solms dat voor 1650 door het uithuwelijken van haar kinderen aan Engelse en Duitse vorsten had samengesteld, dan nog op?

Kunst aan de meter. Een onderzoek naar de emancipatie van textiel als kunstvorm in de twintigste eeuw aan de hand van tentoonstellingen in het Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam,"Apeldoorn, Jara","['Boers, M.E.W.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In de twintigste eeuw is gepoogd om textiel als kunstvorm te verheffen, te emanciperen, tot een aan de beeldende kunsten gelijkwaardige kunstvorm. Dit onderzoek onderscheidt de emancipatoire ontwikkeling van textiel als kunstvorm grofweg in drie essentiële fases. In de eerste fase, na de Eerste Wereldoorlog (1914-1918), werd gepoogd textiel te verheffen van ambacht tot toegepaste kunst. Met toegepaste kunst wordt hier de esthetische vormgeving van functionele kunstuitingen bedoeld. Na de Tweede Wereldoorlog (1940-1945) richtte de tweede fase zich op de verheffing van toegepaste kunst tot beeldende kunst om in de derde fase een verheffing in te zetten van beeldende kunst tot autonome ruimtelijke kunst. Het Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, dat in 1895 werd geopend, groeide in de twintigste eeuw uit tot een toonaangevend internationaal museum voor moderne en hedendaagse kunst en vormgeving. Textiel was een van de talrijke kunstvormen die het museum presenteerde, daarmee werd textiel in een brede context getoond. Het onderzoek heeft zich daarom gericht op het Stedelijk Museum als casus waarbinnen de twintigste-eeuwse emancipatie van textiel als kunstvorm onderzocht kan worden. De tentoonstellingen Het behang en het gordijn (1927), Textiel als Kunst (1956) en Perspectief in textiel (1969) vertellen samen het verhaal van de pogingen tot emancipatie van textiel als kunstvorm. Bij de tentoonstellingen hebben de organisatoren van de tentoonstellingen de emancipatie van textiel als kunstvorm gestimuleerd op verschillende manieren en met verschillende motieven.","['Textiel', 'Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam', 'Emancipatie', 'Kunstenaarstextiel', 'Textiel kunst']"

The metathesis of *-Hu- and *-Hi- in PIE,"Jakob, Anthony","['Pronk, Tijmen']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"It was Werner Winter (1965: 192) who first drew our attention to the phenomenon of laryngeal metathesis, that is the idea that a sequence of *-Hu- and *-Hi- apparently underwent metathesis interconsonantally, potentially already at the Proto-Indo-European stage. However, the full evidence has yet to receive a full and systematic appraisal, and there is no consensus as to the age or correctness of this rule. In my research, I hope to find an answer to the following questions (1) Was laryngeal metathesis already present in Proto-Indo-European? More specifically, can it be viewed as an automatic (allophonic) realization of such a sequence, or was it already a phonemicized rule in PIE? (2) What exactly were the conditions for such metathesis, i.e. did it occur between all consonants, including resonants and *s? (3) How can we explain apparent exceptions to this metathesis (Lat. futurum, Gr. φῠτόν, Hirt’s law in Balto-Slavic)? A large part of this research depends on the methodology. The first task I will undertake in my thesis is to establish exactly which languages and language families can give us information on the position of a laryngeal in a full-grade root, and how reliable this information is. I will then highlight a number of positive examples of laryngeal metathesis. Finally, I will evaluate this evidence, and attempt to answer the questions posed above.","['Indo-European', 'laryngeal', 'metathesis', 'accentology', 'Dybo', 'Hirt']"
The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict – Fueling Roles with Securitized Religion,"Ram, Romina","['Neudecker, Hannah']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Unlike the Cold War era, in which realist perceptions about the global world order were prevalent, the explanation of roots of conflicts has since then increasingly shifted towards questions of culture and ethnicity. According to Samuel Huntington (1993, 1996), who introduced the notion of a clash of civilization, civilizations are fundamentally characterized by their respective religions. In concrete terms, it became a widely shared assumption that classical (realist) conflicts caused by economic, territorial or power-related motives were outdated. This thesis aims to build its argumentation on this “revitalization of religion” while aiming to assess the two opposing roles of Israelis and Palestinians as securitizing actors, which consistently invoke religion in their securitizing policies (Laustsen/Waever 2000: 705). These are fueled by myths and opposing identities that create an ‘us’ versus ‘them’ phenomenon. The human need for identity and its social construction is thus key for the further analysis. Taking a starting point from Lucke’s and McLarren’s (2017) work, the question is raised whether and how religion should be included within the securitizing framework. This work is based on the idea that religion is easily securitized by actors who base their entire argumentation on an existential threat posed by the ‘enemy’ against them.","['Israeli-Palestinian conflict', 'Religion', 'Securitization']"

El agua se obtiene de fuentes tanto superficiales como subterráneas, pero esas fuentes ya son sobreexplotadas gracias al rápido crecimiento de la población en las últimas décadas. El gobierno peruano implementa una política pública para distribuir el líquido vital centralizadamente por la cooperación público-privada con las empresas proveedores de servicios públicos (EPS). Esta investigación pretende establecer hasta qué punto las políticas públicas logran la equidad, mediante entrevistas grabadas en Lima entre noviembre de 2016 y enero de 2017 y el uso de fuentes primarias como estadísticas. Se analiza la influencia de las políticas públicas como causa y solución al problema de inequidad, así como las actividades de los usuarios que pueden influir la cantidad del agua suministrada, y se tratan los derechos y los deberes asociados con el acceso al agua potable y la eficacia del procedimiento para presentar un reclamo. La tesis muestra que persiste la inequidad en el acceso al agua en Lima, pero que al mismo tiempo hay oportunidades para mejorar la situación. La responsabilidad de fijar e implementar las políticas públicas relevantes resta en las entidades oficiales, pero los usuarios también tienen la obligación de consumir agua de manera responsable y de conservar las fuentes.","['equidad en el acceso al agua', 'suministro de agua', 'Lima', 'bien público', 'políticas de agua', 'gestión de agua', 'derecho humano al agua']"
Ethiopia’s “economic growth miracle” defies the “one size fits all” approach to economic development,"O'Mahony, Aine","['London, Jonathan']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Over the past decade, Ethiopia achieved rapid and stable economic growth, considered as a ‘miracle’ when compared to other Sub-Saharan African countries. Ethiopia’s average real GDP growth per annum was estimated at 10.8% between 2003 and 2015 . In addition, Ethiopia succeeded in reducing its poverty rate by 21.8% between 2000 and 2011 . Classical development theories provide analytical tools to help outline traditional patterns of economic development. However, this paper will reveal that the EPRDF government defied generally accepted assumptions concerning processes of economic growth by establishing ‘the Ethiopian way of development’. The EPRDF ruling party fostered an environment for economic growth stability by focusing on original programmes and policies that developed infrastructures and improved access to basic services, expanded the commercialization of agriculture, and provided more opportunities for the private sector. The state’s development strategy was inspired by multiple economic and development theoretical elements. However, these concepts were adapted in an unprecedented manner in order to achieve Ethiopia’s development goals. This paper will complement this analysis by considering the influence of geographical and institutional factors on the economic growth of Ethiopia.","['economic development', 'miracle', 'Ethiopia']"

In both countries the state and the Orthodox Church work closely together in a so-called symphony model. During and after the 2008 war the Orthodox churches of both countries remained loyal to the state by supporting the position of their state in the conflict, but at the same time condemning the bloodshed (of Orthodox Christians killing one another) and calling for peace. In this thesis the role the Orthodox Churches played in this conflict was analysed. This thesis argues that their influence was significant. Not only did the churches call for peace and maintain positive relations with each other, they also prevented alienation between citizens of the countries by asserting that it was wrong that Orthodox Christians were at war with one another. Together the churches were also the most important way in which diplomatic relations between the countries were maintained. Finally the influence of the Orthodox Church on all levels of government cannot be underestimated.","['Russian Orthodox Church', 'Orthodox Church of Georgia', 'Orthodoxy', 'Russian-Georgian relations', 'Patriarchs', '2008 war', 'relations church and state', 'Near Abroad', 'Abkhazia and South-Ossetia', 'Symphonia']"

An Analysis of Chinese Constitutionalists’ Interpretations of Jean-Jacques Rousseau from 1899 to 1910,"Gao, Xiuze","['Teh, Limin']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"As influential Chinese Constitutionalists, Liang Qichao and Yanfu were the earliest to introduce and interpret Jean-Jacques Rousseau during the late Qing dynasty. They offered most of the interpretations of Rousseau’s thought among intellectuals during the late Qing period mainly by writing articles in the late Qing newspapers. This determined Rousseau’s image and interpretations of some modern Western concepts during this time. This thesis will analyze their interpretations of Rousseau and understandings of some modern political concepts in their articles related to Rousseau in the late Qing newspapers. This will be done as a means to decode how Rousseau and some modern political concepts were interpreted by constitutionalists at the beginning of his introduction. On the whole, Liang Qichao experienced two stages in introducing and interpreting Rousseau's thought. In the first stage from the period of 1899 to 1903, Liang Qichao applauded Rousseau’s thought. However, from the 1904 to 1910 period of the second stage, he started to question and even oppose Rousseau’s thought (this was especially after his visit to America in 1904). Differing from Liang Qichao’s perspective, Yanfu criticized Rousseau during the beginning of his contact with The Social Contract. Yanfu denied Rousseau’s thought as ""studies without roots"" (无根之学). Meanwhile, he further argued that Rousseau's thought was just dangerous fantasies. Under the political crisis of the late Qing government and missions of saving the state, race, and Confucianism of Chinese intellectuals, Yanfu and Liang Qichao, as Constitutionalists, treated the thought of Western thinkers as tools for saving China from the crisis. Although they held different attitudes towards Rousseau in the beginning, they both eventually criticized Rousseau’s thought as both dangerous and unrealistic. In chapter one, research motivations will be proposed. Next, the literature review of the thesis will be discussed, including the literature review on the research of modern Chinese thought, as well as Rousseau’s role in modern Chinese thought. Then, research methods and sources will be addressed. Chapter two proposes two features of Nakae Chōmin’s translation, namely, Nakae Chōmin’s translation in the Chinese historical context and the tendency toward revolution; from fighting against the tyrant to fighting against the monarchy. In chapter three, Liang Qichao’s interpretations of his approval of Rousseau from 1899 to 1903 will be discussed. Later, chapter four argues Liang Qichao and Yanfu’s critiques of Rousseau from the 1904 to 1910 period. Finally, a conclusion of the thesis will be provided.","['Liang Qichao', 'Yanfu', 'Nakae Chōmin']"

"""The Anaesthetized and Bewildered Present"": The Dislocation of Time in 1940s Modernist Texts","Hansen, Maj","['Newton, Michael']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In Elizabeth Bowen’s The Demon Lover and Other Stories (1944), Rosamond Lehmann’s The Ballad and the Source (1944), and Rose Macaulay’s The World My Wilderness (1950), the actual present strikes characters as unreal, since history is overturned, partly by the proximity of war: past, present and future are mingled. These prose texts are placed in relation to T.S. Eliot’s poetic commentary on our ambivalent attitude to time, Four Quartets (1943), which can similarly be seen as a response to the writer’s experience of the Blitz. The texts this thesis engages with explore the idea of simultaneity, a multiplied presence – but they also bespeak a disbelief in an independent present, one untainted by the past and future. Indeed, in these texts, the “anaesthetized and bewildered present” (The Demon Lover and Other Stories, Bowen 221) is obscured both by compressions and expansions of time, often in combination with a collapse of identity. Brimming with both nostalgia and painful memories, but also due to the looming presence of war, the texts are all in some way ‘haunted’, both metaphorically as well as literally. Ultimately, this thesis will argue that under the pressure of the war and its aftermath, 1940s Modernist texts question the linearity of time and experience.",['time Add late Modernism Add Second World War']

This phenomenon has been described by Evans (2007:367) for the first time as “the conventionalized main-clause of what, on prima facie grounds, appear to be formally subordinate clauses”. Although this phenomenon has been defined several times in prescriptive grammars, Evans (2007) was the first who has done descriptive research for many Indo-European languages, including Dutch. Unfortunately the French language has not been described. Therefore the main subject of this MA thesis will be to compare the theory of Evans (2007) for the Dutch language and apply it to the French language. This thesis will be limited to the conjunctions “if” and “that” which introduce the conventionalized main-clauses. The main objective of this research will be a comparative research into the Dutch and French language, more specific into the two conjunctions “if” and “that”. The reason why those two conjunctions have been chosen is the fact that they appear most often in all the languages which have examined by Evans (2007). The methodology of this MA thesis will be comparative and theoretical. Moreover, there will be a section including some case studies. The content of the different sections will be thus: the first chapter will give an overview of all the literature concerning the phenomenon insubordination. The second chapter will be dedicated to the conjunction “if” in Dutch and French. The next chapter will be dedicated to the conjunction “that” and the fourth chapter will be showing some case studies to support my theory. The Corpus d’Orléans has provided the information for this thesis. Finally, all results will be summarized in the conclusion.","['Insubordination', 'français', 'french', 'dutch', 'que', 'si', 'et si']"

Het verhaal wordt op diverse manieren ingezet voor de uitleg van retorische leerstukken. Voordelen hiervan zijn onder andere dat het verhaal allerlei aanknopingspunten en ondersteuning biedt voor de behandeling van leerstukken. Ook biedt het verhaal een aantrekkelijke weergave en inbedding van de retorische leerstukken. Ten slotte zorgt het verhaal voor een emotionele verbinding tussen lezer en hetgeen de auteur onderwijst. Door het verhaal op deze manier in te zetten vervullen de auteurs van de verhalen de taken van de redenaar, docere, delectare en movere.","['Corax', 'Tisias', 'Prolegomena', 'Retorica', 'Narratief', 'Didactiek', 'Onderwiijs', 'Geschiedenis van de retorica']"

The main intervention method in Korea for curing IGD is using boot camp clinics. Outside Korea using boot camp for IGD is something unheard-of as in most countries boot camp is used as a correctional facility where juvenile delinquents are forced to endure a rigorous routine or intensive training program. But in Korea this is a popularly used method for handling game addictions of its youth. At these camps children follow rigorous training programs to deal with their obsessive online gaming. In worldwide media, these camps have become a topic of much discussion and many have visited the camps to document the program and interview the participants, counsellors and instructors. Outside Korea many do not understand why Koreans use boot camp to cure IGD. This paper will therefore contribute in the research of intervention methods by giving an explanation why Korea uses boot camp for IGD.","['boot camp', 'south korea', 'internet game addiction']"

Sherlock Holmes: A Character of the City. Analysis of the Nineteenth Century city in Arthur Conan Doyle’s series.,"Weise, Brooke","['Schulte Nordholt, A.E.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"There are few literary characters who speak to the imagination such as Sherlock Holmes and his faithful companion Dr John Watson. The city in which these stories are set has an equally strong grasp on the imaginations of the masses: the moment Sherlock Holmes and London are mentioned within the same breath, a very iconic and somewhat stereotypical image of the city comes to mind. A foggy, smoke ridden city, congested with traffic, populated by exotic figures, which in the nineteenth century has become the heart of a global Empire.1 This of course, is a stereotypical image of the city, a way of describing the city by authors in order to gain some form of control over the immense city. This will be discussed in greater depth in the following chapter. The characters Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are still quite as popular as they were in the nineteenth century, maybe even more so. In the recent years the two iconic characters have starred in movies, various TV-shows as well as new books. There are some authors who have tried to recapture the magic of Sherlock Holmes.2 Whether they have succeeded is another matter, and does not fit within the scope of this research. Though the stories have always focussed on the world’s only consulting detective and the good doctor, they are always connected to capital of an Empire, London. This connection between Sherlock Holmes and London is precisely the subject of this research. The question which has been centralised in this work is: What was the message that Conan Doyle was possibly trying to send his contemporary readers through his description of London and his use of the genre of crime fiction?","['Sherlock Holmes', 'City', 'London']"
Trauma & Closure,"Bruijninckx, Paul","['Bruyn, Eric de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis consists of three chapters, each built up around a case study. The three chapters are divided in temporal sense. In the first chapter the concept of a continuous now is central to the analysis of the case study, the second chapter has a relation with the future, and the final chapter is related with the notion of history. What the films have in common is that in each film the protagonist undergoes a trauma. How the counter-chronological and ‘a-temporal’ narrative structure of these films problematizes the film ending is observed, analyzed and linked to the psychoanalytic notion of drive and desire. Furthermore, throughout the flow of chapters, I will analyze to what extent this manner of ending a film has ideological implications. Psychoanalysis as a tool to analyze film and its protagonists is used as a theoretical framework to analyze the ideological implications these film endings might have. More specific, starting from the angle of the ‘Lacanian’ Mirror Screen theory it is questioned to what extent the apparatus theory is challenged and problematized by these specific films and their endings. Moreover the concept of the simulacrum, as an extreme notion of ideology is questioned and criticized. The notion of ideology, and violence are approached from a ‘Lacanian’, or, I should emphasize, ‘Žižekian’ point of view. I argue that these films in order of appearance demonstrate that the concept of the simulacrum by Baudrillard needs to be reconsidered and redefined in relation with the traumatic kernel of the real, or should be considered irrelevant, and moreover, I argue that the apparatus theory needs to be redefined.","['Drive', 'Desire', 'Trauma', 'Closure', 'Denouement', 'Simulacrum', 'Apparatus Theory']"

Transnational Salafism in Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Politics: A Valuable Instrument or an Uncontrollable Ideology,"Al Baaj, S.A.","['Kaptein, Nico J.G.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The importance of religious world views cannot be understated for contemporary events in the Middle East; Religious Ideology remains a powerful mobilizer. The “Salafi” variation of Islam spans a politically quietist majority, few politically active individuals and groups, and of course politically violent and terrorist groups. The country most associated with the Salafi interpretation of Islam is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the homeland of the Wahhabi movement. This paper examines the extent to which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is involved in the spread of Salafism, as well as the consequences thereof. I argue that propagating Salafism has definitely been a part of the kingdom’s foreign policy, and that the internal environment of the kingdom is conducive to significant non-state support. Regarding consequences, violent strands of Salafism have been paradoxically useful but also most damaging. On the other hand, while domestic apolitical variations could be used for internal stability external apolitical Salafis could potentially be mobilized. Finally, politically active Salafis would be a nuance internally and not of much use externally. Importantly, transnational Salafism has proven uncontrollable and unreliable. It could backfire violently, and it can lead to tension and polarization within and across societies.","['Transnational Salafism', 'Salafism', 'Saudi Arabia']"

American and Chinese warships are increasingly active in these contested waters. While the G.W. Bush administration focused militarily mostly on the Middle East, Obama re-shifted with the ‘pivot to Asia’ significant military attention to East Asia. This study aims to clarify to what extent Obama legitimized the military component in the pivot through securitization, as proposed by the Copenhagen School. Therefore, several American and Chinese policy documents and speeches are analyzed. The results indicate that, contrary to what the administration claimed, military policies were predominant in the pivot and ‘extraordinary measures’ compared to pre-existing policies. Furthermore, the Obama administration securitized Chinese policies regarding the South China Sea by portraying them as threatening U.S. security, and thus exceptional measures are required. In successfully securitizing the issue, the administration constructed a reality in which Beijing would have to respond, perceiving Washington uplifting the issue to a ‘top security issue’ as credible.","['Securitization', 'Pivot to Asia', 'Sino-American relations']"
Targeting Westphalian Sovereignty: The Use of Armed Drones in Non-Conflict Areas,"Besana, Matteo","['Duyvesteyn, I.G.B.M.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper aims to analyse how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) popularly known as drones, impact the Westphalian sovereignty of those states in which the strikes are carried out. More broadly, the paper will investigate the wider implications drones have for an international system organised and based around the pillars of a Westphalian system of international relations. Territorial integrity and exclusion of external actors from a specific polity coupled with a monopoly of violence inside a certain territory are seen as the sine qua non elements of internal and external sovereignty. Analysing Westphalian sovereignty through the drone lens is important because the drone could act as a fundamental vehicle to analyse the state of affairs of the international system. The analysis conducted points to the drone as being the catalyst at the same time for a weakening and strengthening of the Westphalian state: a weakening for the states in which the strikes are carried out, and a strengthening for those states with UAVs capabilities which have dramatically expanded their reach to protect their citizens and project power in the international realm. A projection of power which reflects or reinforces a view of the international system divided amongst the have and the have-nots, a schism created by the possession of drone capabilities.","['Drones', 'Armed Drones', 'Westphalian Sovereignty', 'Organised Hypocrisy', 'Territorial Integrity', 'Exclusion of External Actors', 'Active Defense Against Terrorism', 'Westphalian State', 'Targeted Killings']"

E si è limitato a riprenderle dalla tradizione, o vi ha apportato anche delle modifiche? Esaminando aspetti diversi della metafora, proveremo a rispondere alla domanda principale della nostra ricerca: qual è l’origine della metafora nautica nel ""Canzoniere"" e in qual modo Petrarca l’ha ripresa nelle sue poesie? Prima sarà analizzata l’evoluzione attraverso il tempo della metafora fino a Petrarca, dopodiché sarà studiato in qual modo essa viene adoperata nell’opera del nostro poeta.

A comparative study on the Sayan languages (Turkic; Russia and Mongolia),"Mol-van Valen, Tessa de","['Crevels, Mily']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"In this study, the grammar and basic lexicon of the Sayan languages (Turkic), spoken in Russia and Mongolia, are compared by means of the features found in WALS (Dryer & Haspelmath 2013). The main goal of this thesis is to provide a comparative study on four Sayan languages, namely Tuvan, Tofa, Soyot, and Dukha. Tuba, the fifth Sayan language, became extinct before it was described and studied and, therefore, it is excluded from the linguistic study. The data in this study came from the grammars by Anderson & Harrison (1999 and 2006, Tuvan), Rassadin (1971, 1978 and 2010, Tofa and Soyot) and Ragagnin (2011, Dukha). Another question that will be discussed in this thesis is the reason why Tuvan is not moribund, while its sister and daughter languages are. To answer this question, I looked at the history of the Sayan peoples and their current social status. Of all Sayan languages, Tofa showed the least Mongolian influences. This is probably because the Tofa people moved away from the Tuva Basin before the Mongols had a linguistic influence on the Tuvan language. Together with data from the grammars and historical information, a Sayan tree diagram is reconstructed. From the history and the current social status of the Sayan peoples could be concluded that the number of speakers and isolation together form the reason why Tuvan is not extinct and flourishes, while the other Sayan languages struggle to survive.","['descriptive linguistics', 'comparative linguistics', 'Turkic languages', 'Sayan languages', 'Siberia', 'Mongolic languages']"

Let's Talk Trash: Zero Waste Initiatives in San Francisco and Toronto,"Stenzel, Clara","['Vries, Mark Leon de']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Our current society keeps consuming more and more, thereby generating increasing amounts of waste worldwide. There is growing realisation among policy-markers that landfill disposal is not sustainable, and thus that better waste management is needed. Some solutions have been elaborated, among which the sustainable concept of sending no more waste to landfill, or “zero waste”. Several cities have attempted to adopt this concept; Toronto and San Francisco are two of them. This thesis seeks to analyze how policy makers in both cities implement the zero waste concept in their cities, and the socio-political obstacles faced along the way. The study conducts a thorough textual analysis of both official and non-official sources, following a critical discourse analysis method. It identifies recurrent discursive and decisional patterns of waste diversion promotion, while revealing some lacks of consistency in encouraging actual changes in waste consumption. The thesis elaborates on how each city’s socio-political context have played in the implementation of the zero waste-to-landfill initiatives. The thesis finds that underlying conflicting motivations might have influenced the whole evolution of the initiatives in both cities, which are far from having reached their goals.","['Environmental Studies', 'Green Economy', 'Zero Waste']"

By doing so they created a new global justice discourse shedding light on the North South divide. Since its creation IBSA has gained greater influence in the global political order by increasing their presence in global institutions such as the World Trade Organisation and the United Nations. Acknowledging the difficulty of being accepted in large institutional councils (e.g. the UNSC) they have opted for a subtler approach and created diplomacy networks and steering committees. IBSA uses a soft power governance method known as orchestration to follow up on their founding document, the Brasilia Declaration. The IBSA initiative has sparked a new voice from the South which is challenging the current western dominance in international politics. The IBSA initiative aims to change the current course of international politics through international institutions. This article will delve into the method of orchestration and how IBSA uses it.

In fact, so-called ‘neomedievalism’ has emerged onto the global scene, and has become almost as widespread and as often referenced as when the Roman and Greek cultures were rediscovered during the Italian Renaissance. Neomedievalism is described as the postmodern ‘use’ of medieval cultures which often deliberately denies historical accuracy and is usually a nostalgic or romanticized version - or a crude representation - of medieval culture. This way of appropriating medieval themes and stories is possible because it is still “productive in the contemporary imagination”. This claim is substantiated by the popularity of countless medieval-inspired TV-series, films, medieval-styled ‘role playing games’, books such as J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire book and TV series - and of course music containing neomedievalist themes. This thesis will explore the role of neomedievalism in Viking Metal, Anglo-Saxon Metal and Neofolk, to find out how neomedievalism fits in with the counter-culture of these music subgenres.","['Viking', 'Metal', 'Music', 'Neomedievalism', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'Philology', 'Neofolk', 'Fantasy']"

It is a synthesis of the author’s own fieldwork data with the existing literature on the various dialects that belong to this group. Western Lamaholot has a little over 20 distinct phonemes, a strong tendency towards CV-syllables, and penultimate stress. It has SV and AVP word order but frequently shows fronting of non-focused elements. It makes use of serial verbs and a lot of the function words that are used are grammaticallized serial verbs. Nouns show a distinction between alienable and inalienable possession in possessive constructions. Some verbs are inflected for person and number through prefixes, and intransitive verbs sometimes get subject agreement suffixes. Adjectives, pronouns, and in some dialects demonstratives and numerals get a suffix -n, historically derived from genitive markers, when they are used as noun modifiers. This thesis discusses controversial topics in the Lamaholot literature such as the phonemic status of long vowels, the existence of adjectives as a separate class from verbs, and the exact function of -n. It also lists elements that vary between dialects such as object marking on verbs, word-final consonants, and possessive constructions.","['Lamaholot', 'grammar sketch', 'Central Malayo-Polynesian']"

This research aims to unravel the question of whether involving local women's groups in the official peace process will lead to women's political, legal and economic emancipation in post-conflict societies. This is done with a case study of Liberia, as it has become well-known for its active women’s peace movement, and election of the first woman president in Africa. The 2003 Comprehensive Peace Agreement was somewhat gender-sensitive, and also involved a regional women’s organization— MARWOPNET— as one of the signatories. Yet, while the gender agenda has been present in several programs and policies in Liberia’s reconstruction, the results so far have been moderate. This thesis argues that local women’s involvement in official peace processes will lead to gender issues being more present in countries’ post-conflict reconstruction. However, to achieve their goals, women’s organizations need support from other actors, and the focus should be on their involvement both in quality and quantity.","['peace', 'women', 'gender', 'peace building', 'Liberia', 'gender equality', 'peace agreement']"

Feministisch Flaneren in Film: Van de mannelijke voyeur naar een vrouwelijk flanerend subject in avant-gardefilm van de jaren zestig tot nu.,"Dobbelsteen, Hilde Sophie van den","['Houwen, J.J.M.']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Degene die kijkt heeft de macht, degene die bekeken wordt is machteloos. Deze dynamiek hoort bij de klassieke cinema die de mannelijke voyeuristische blik produceert en die de vrouw objectiveert en haar bekijkt enkel voor het eigen kijkplezier. Dit is wat ik in het eerste deel (hoofdstuk 1 en 2) van mijn onderzoek blootleg door middel van de klassieke filmtheorie aan de hand van Christian Metz’ theorie van de voyeur en het feministische antwoord op de klassieke filmtheorie van Laura Mulvey. De vraag rijst: Hoe kan de vrouw een actieve subject positie innemen in film? Op zoek naar een alternatieve modus van observatie voor een vrouwelijk subject in film zet ik in deel twee (hoofdstuk 2 en 3) de voyeur af tegen het concept van de flâneur. De flâneur is een historisch, subversief mannelijk figuur dat nauw verbonden is met de moderniteit en het stadse leven, en die het privilege geniet om vrijelijk te kijken en zich door de metropool te bewegen. Binnen het feministische debat zijn er ook vrouwelijke varianten van de flâneur beschreven. Sommige theoretici staan echter kritisch tegenover de vrouwelijke flâneur en achten haar bestaan alleen mogelijk in de vorm van prostituee of consument. Daarentegen zijn er enkelen met mij optimistisch over de mogelijkheid van een vrouwelijke flâneur in film als modus voor een vrouwelijke subjectpositie. De volgende stap in dit onderzoek is het loskoppelen de historische flâneur van de constitutieve eigenschappen, zoals voorgesteld door Ilija Tomanić Trivundža, om de feministische potentie van een vrouwelijke flâneur te onderzoeken. In navolging van Anke Gleber betoog ik dat een vrouwelijk flanerend subject in film zich niet beperkt tot een letterlijk flanerende vrouwelijke protagonist, maar ook ruimte maakt voor figuurlijk flâneren, zoals in de vorm van toeschouwer in de bioscoop, met het oog achter de camera, of als filmregisseur. Aan de hand van een aantal vergelijkende analyses ontwaar ik zowel letterlijk en figuurlijk flanerende vrouwen in avant-gardefilms, zoals in Rape (1969) van Yoko Ono en Cléo de 5 à 7 (1962) van Agnès Varda, vind ik een lesbische flâneur in Portrait d'une jeune fille de la fin des années 60 à Bruxelles (1994) van Chantal Akerman, een queer-flâneur in Night Soil - Economy of Love (2015) van Melanie Bonajo, en eindig mijn onderzoek (hoofdstuk 4) met een gekleurde vrouwelijke flâneur in de Strolling- serie van Cecile Emeke. Met deze casussen toon ik aan dat een vrouwelijk flanerend subject in film inclusief feministische potentie bevat.","['film', 'feminisme', 'vrouwelijk subject in film', 'flâneur', 'vrouwelijke flâneur', 'voyeur', 'avant-garde', 'klassieke film theorie', 'inclusief feminisme', 'flâneur in film']"
State capacity in Japan’s economy and its impact on Japan’s economic status in East Asia 1945-2000,"Wei, Dannan","['Shibata, Saori']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In postwar economic development, Japan has chosen a different way to neoliberalism. The government did not “step back” from the market or rely on the action of the “invisible hand”; it played an important role itself in economic development. Under the guidance and intervention of the state, Japan became an economic miracle and the most successful industrialized economy in the world, then experienced a collapse followed by great stagnation. Simultaneously, while Japan used to have the role of driver and leader of the regional economy before the collapse, it lost its advantageous position when it became stuck in great stagnation. Japan’s economic status changed drastically accompanied with its changing economic power. For an economy like Japan that cooperated highly with the state, the capacity of the state would have a huge impact on the economy, on both economic power and economic status. Japan’s changing economic power and status in the region became a mirror to reflect the changing state capacity in Japan.","['state capacity', 'bubble economy', 'flying geese pattern', 'economic development', 'East Asia', 'Japanese government']"
Overcoming the 'Post-War Regime:' Abe Shinzō and Japan's State Identity A Critical Discourse Analysis,"Bock, Christian de","['Wakefield, Bryce']",2017,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis intervenes within the current debate between both norm- and relational constructivist schools with regard to the maintenance and contestation of a state’s ‘identity.’ As to move past the exaggerated efficacy that norm- and relational scholars attribute to material and discursive factors respectively, this thesis instead argues – in accord with Critical Discourse Analytical insights – that both the material and discursive exist within a dialectic. Through arguing that the material and discursive internalize one another without being reducible to either factor, it becomes possible to gain a more nuanced understanding of how both material and discursive influence the maintenance and contestation of a state’s identity. To this end the thesis poses the question of: what discursive strategies did Abe Shinzō utilize as to overcome the restraints imposed by Japan’s ‘peace-loving’ state identity as to effect the remilitarization of Japan? This question is subsequently operationalized through a critical engagement with IR identity theory, Antonio Gramsci’s Political theory, and Critical Discourse Analysis’s insights into the realm of discourse. This allows for an enquiry into how Abe Shinzō utilized both discursive and material means as to overcome Japan’s current anti-militarist state identity.","['Constructivism', 'Norm Constructivism', 'Relational Constructivism', 'State Identity', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Japan', 'Security', 'International Relations']"

The Influence of Smallness and Non-Sovereignty on the Quality of Governance: The Case of Aruba and its Relationship with the Netherlands,"Aguirre Broca, Maria Fernanda","['Oostindie, Gert', ""O'Malley, Alanna""]",2017,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"For years, academics have focused on colonial past of Caribbean islands, not looking into what became of these non-sovereign jurisdictions. For this reason, this thesis focuses on the post-colonial relationship between a colonizer and colony, looking at the influence of smallness and non-sovereignty on the quality of governance. The relationship at hand is that within the Dutch Kingdom, between Aruba and the Netherlands; one that is constantly fluctuating. As Aruba has just celebrated 30 years of being an autonomous country within the Kingdom, it is a good time to reflect on the relationship, its influences and the quality of governance. It is apparent that there are also many advantages and disadvantages in the relationship; where each other’s support internationally is an advantage, and the Aruban mal-governance in the finance department is arguably the biggest disadvantage. The thesis elaborates on the influences of smallness, non-sovereignty and good governance on countries in general as well as on Aruba. The thesis ends combining all influences and concluding that there is no good governance in the jurisdiction and that its sovereignty is a bigger influence than smallness, as the island’s size cannot be changed. By using scholarly works, as well as media articles, archives and personal interviews conducted by the author herself; the thesis opens way for new research on the topic, as well as highlights the need for more discourse on the matter.","['Aruba', 'the Netherlands', 'Governance', 'non-sovereignty', 'Dutch Kingdom', 'caribbean', 'smallness', 'post-colonial', 'relationship', 'Politics']"
