Lateral reading en vertical reading als methoden van bronverificatie: Een kwalitatief onderzoek onder Nederlandse onderzoeksjournalisten,"Verloop, Linus",['Dr. J.P. Burger'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De rol van desinformatie in het huidige informatielandschap is sterk gestegen. Steeds meer mensen zijn ontvankelijk voor nepnieuws, dat soms ronduit gevaarlijk voor mens en democratie kan zijn. Eén van de grootste vijanden van desinformatie is de factchecker, die de ware feiten boven tafel probeert te halen. De werkwijze van factcheckers is al uitvoerig onderzocht, maar zij zijn niet de enigen die efficiënt bronnen moeten kunnen verifiëren. Aan de hand van dit kwalitatieve onderzoek wordt gekeken naar de wijze waarop onderzoeksjournalisten te werk gaan als het aankomt op bronverificatie. Als uitgangspunt worden de principes van lateral en vertical reading gebruikt, twee verschillende methoden om een bron te bestuderen. De onderzoeksvraag van dit onderzoek luidt dan ook: Passen Nederlandse onderzoeksjournalisten vooral vertical reading of lateral reading toe om online informatie te verifiëren? Om tot een bevredigend antwoord te komen wordt gebruik gemaakt van een veldexperiment, waarbij deelnemende onderzoeksjournalisten een aantal bronnen enige minuten moeten bestuderen, alvorens aan te geven hoe betrouwbaar zij deze achten. De respondenten zijn een vrij diverse groep, afkomstig van verschillende redacties, met ook verschillende specialismen. Uiteindelijk is duidelijk dat onderzoeksjournalisten een mix van vertical en lateral reading inzetten bij het bestuderen van bronnen. Het grootste verschil in de resultaten is deels te verklaren door het al dan niet ontbreken van een duidelijke strategie bij sommige deelnemers, een uitkomst die ook in eerder onderzoek waargenomen is. Efficiënt filteren en selecteren van informatie ging niet alle onderzoeksjournalisten even goed af, en sommigen worden zo overladen met informatie dat het opstellen van een goede strategie uitblijft. Daarnaast komt het opvallend vaak voor dat onderzoeksjournalisten vertrouwen op intuïtie. Een deel hiervan komt voor uit werkervaring en een deel van zogenaamd ‘gezond verstand’. Hierop vertrouwen kan veel tijd schelen in het onderzoeksproces, maar kan ditzelfde proces ook sterk in de weg staan. Zo werd tijdens het onderzoek meer dan eens relevante informatie niet meegenomen, simpelweg omdat de bron er niet betrouwbaar uitzag. Op basis van deze bevindingen is aanbevolen om op journalistieke opleidingen meer aandacht te besteden aan het opzetten van efficiënte zoekstrategieën om bronnen te verifiëren. Onderzoeksjournalisten moeten gezien de omvang van hun onderzoek meer handvatten krijgen om zo goed mogelijk informatie te filteren, om zo een completer beeld te krijgen. Vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op het opstellen van een dergelijke strategie, of meer vergelijkend onderzoek kunnen doen tussen factcheckers en onderzoeksjournalisten.","['verificatie', 'desinformatie']"
Podcasts van de pers: Over de remediatie van artikelen naar nieuwspodcasts bij geschreven nieuwsmedia,"Veen, Daan van","['Pleijter, A.R.J.', 'Opgenhaffen, M.P.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Steeds meer geschreven nieuwsmedia die oorspronkelijk of hoofdzakelijk artikelen produceren brengen nu ook audioproducties uit. Een belangrijke vorm daarvan zijn nieuwspodcasts, waarbij bestaande producties -hoofdzakelijk artikelen -van het medium op een bepaalde manier als achtergrond dienen. Naar de remediatie van artikelen naar deze nieuwspodcasts is nog nauwelijks onderzoek gedaan. De kenmerken van podcasts zijn wel al veelvuldig onderzocht. Met name transparantie komt daarin naar voren als een belangrijk kenmerk van de podcast. In dit onderzoek wordt daarom de verbinding gelegd tussen de remediatie van artikelen naar nieuwspodcast en de kenmerken van podcasts uit de literatuur en hoe deze daarin naar voren komen. Allereerst wordt er een analyse gemaakt van de verschillende soorten nieuwspodcasts die door de geschreven nieuwsmedia worden gemaakt. Hieruit wordt een relevante typologie opgesteld. Vervolgens wordt aan de hand van semi-gestructureerde diepte-interviews met verschillende podcastmakers van een diverse groep bedrijven uit de geschreven nieuwsmedia gevraagd naar deze remediatie. Op deze manier wordt gekeken hoe deze remediatie plaatsvindt en hoe de kenmerken van podcasts hierin naar voren komen. In het bijzonder wordt daarbij gekeken naar de rol van transparantie. Uit een analyse door middel van constante vergelijking van deze interviews blijkt dat nieuwspodcasts door deze nieuwsmedia op vele verschillende manieren worden gemaakt. De motieven om een nieuwspodcast te maken gaan daarbij verder dan alleen het uitbreiden van het aanbod en het vergroten van het bereik. Ook het promoten van de de kwaliteit van het nieuwsmedium als geheel en van de journalistiek in het algemeen kan daarbij een rol spelen. Dit hangt samen met de grote rol die transparantie speelt in de nieuwspodcasts. Deze transparantie valt uiteen in allerlei vormen, die zijn te positioneren op een schaal tussen twee hoofdvormen van transparantie; professionele en persoonlijke transparantie.","['podcasts', 'remediatie', 'transparantie', 'nieuwsmedia', 'mediaconvergentie']"

Western Sanctions And The Russian Response,"Slagter, Selma","['Frear, M.J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Russische Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the course of 2014, political tensions between Russia and the West were considerably increasing. As a result, the West implemented sanctions towards Russia, which then provoked Russia to impose counter-measures against the Western pressure, resulting in a downward spiral where both parties keep expanding and extending their measures, until the day of today. With this, the question arises on whether the sanctions imposed by the EU have been successful in fulfilling the intended objectives of their imposed sanction? If not, then what were the reasons? Has Russia, for example, been able to cushion the Western sanctions in an effective way, that the sanctions have not succeeded in tipping the scale of the cost-benefit calculations for Russia to comply with the criteria and objectives set by the EU? Or have there been other reasons, such as a reorientation to China, also known as the “Pivot to the East”? The research of this thesis focuses on the impact and effectiveness of the EU sanctions, Russia's reponse to the sanctions, and which factors have played a role in the overall impact and effectiveness of the EU sanctions.","['EU Sanctions', 'Russian Response', 'Results EU Sanctions', 'Effectiveness EU Sanctions', 'Pivot to China']"

During the Arab Spring, the monarchy was the only country in North Africa that has kept the same head of state. Researchers are inclined to explain the stability of Morocco by analyzing the political strategies of the state and the monarchy. But what is often overlooked in the study of the Arab Spring in Morocco is the people. The Moroccan people remained relatively calm. The protests in Morocco were not as widespread as the protests in the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. In addition, the protesters' demands were aimed at reform, not revolution. How come the people of Morocco had different demands than the rest of North Africa? When considering the exceptional stability of the country, the country's particular characteristics must also be considered. Because not only is Morocco the only monarchy in North Africa; the country also has an extra religious dimension, because it is an emirate. To what extent did the king's religious title play a role in limiting the demonstrations in Morocco? To what extent has the king's religious legitimacy been used as a strategy to maintain peace in troubled times? And to what extent has the media been used as an instrument for this religious legitimacy? This research will examine to what extent the above-mentioned issues have had an impact on the demonstrators during the Moroccan spring. A content analysis of newsarticles from the Arab Spring period will be conducted. In addition, interviews will be conducted with protesters.","['Morocco', 'Arab Spring', 'Framing', 'Media', 'Islam', 'Religious Legitimacy']"

The first chapter of the thesis is centered around more ‘classical’ thought about the temporality of film; ranging from Andre Bazin to Roland Barthes’ view on cinema and its impossibility to have a punctum - and how these are brought together and critically reworked by Laura Mulvey. The second chapter revolves around Gilles Deleuze’s Cinema books and the Bergsonian heritage of his conception of film as a medium. The third and last chapter (featuring at once one of the most recent film-philosophers and arguably the oldest) discusses Jacques Rancière’s writings on cinema, focusing on film’s opsis -its pure visuality -over the narrative qualities of the medium, and dives deeper into the influence of Jean Epstein’s thinking about film, focused through his discussions of photogénie and slow motion. Together, these three chapters form a tentative inquiry towards the possibility of a new cinematic form, of which the temporality of the filmic medium is integrally and inextricably part.","['temporality', 'film theory', 'Bazin', 'Barthes', 'Mulvey', 'Deleuze', 'Bergson', 'Ranciere', 'Epstein']"
The permissibility of human smuggling,"Eickhoff, Jessie","['Meijers, T.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis is questioned when human smuggling is permissible. By analysing the risk objection, the exploitation objection, the motivation objection, the freedom of association objection and the law-breaking objection is concluded that human smuggling is not always wrong, at least not pro tanto. Nevertheless, certain conditions have to be satisfied. For one the smuggler should illuminate as many risks as possible, if doing so does not involve more than moderate risks. Therefore a smuggler should actively investigate the possible risks and take steps to mitigate the risks. Secondly, the smuggler needs to fully inform the client about the risks. Thereon, the client must give his real consent. Thirdly, a smuggler should not exploit his clients. Therefore a smuggler may not harm or abuse his client. A smuggler may not deceive his client by not giving an equivalent in return. Furthermore a smuggler may not take advantage of someone in a vulnerable position for example by charging an amount that includes a high profit. Fourthly, a smuggler may break the law if there is a moral reason to override this. The smugglers’ illegal conduct is justified if it prevents a greater evil than the conduct caused, there is no legal alternative that would have averted the harm and that the person was not responsible for creating the threat she helped avert. Finally, human smugglers should only accept a client when he claims that his rights are threatened. Migrants are only allowed to engage in human smuggling if their human rights are threatened and should apply for officials if the state will indeed give a fair hearing. It is the state's responsibility to give a fair hearing.","['human smuggling', 'permissibility', 'political philosophy', 'ethics']"

"Wortels, information overload en authenticiteit: Waarom jongvolwassen nieuwsconsumenten tegenwoordig minder interesse hebben in lokaal nieuws","Bakker, Lieke",['Dr. A. W. M. Koetsenruijter'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De oplages van lokaal nieuws, voornamelijk in kleinere gemeentes, lopen terug (De Jong & Koetsenruijter, 2019, 27). Dit kan als gevolg hebben dat de belangrijke taken van lokaal nieuws, zoals het controleren van de macht, in gevaar komen. Dat er een verminderd lokaal nieuwsaanbod is komt onder andere doordat de huidige generatie jongvolwassenen minder geïnteresseerd lijkt in lokaal nieuws dan eerdere generaties (Duiven et al., 2015, 9). De volgende onderzoeksvraag is opgesteld: Waarom volgen jongvolwassen nieuwsconsumenten naar eigen zeggen geen lokaal nieuws? Deze vraag is zo open gehouden, omdat er weinig literatuur was dat dit fenomeen kan verklaren. Het doel van dit onderzoek is dan ook om concepten te vinden die door respondenten zelf worden aangehaald als hun redenen voor het niet volgen van lokaal nieuws. Om deze onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden zijn er semigestructureerde interviews gehouden met dertien in Leiden wonende jongvolwassenen, die wel nieuws volgen, maar geen lokaal nieuws. Deze interviews zijn met videobel programma’s gehouden, omdat de COVID-19 pandemie het onmogelijk maakte om de interviews face-to-face te houden. In de interviews gaven de respondenten een aantal mogelijke redenen voor hun desinteresse aan; I) zij voelen weinig regiobinding en weinig sociale cohesie in Leiden, II) zij voelen zich niet aangesproken door de Leidse lokale nieuwsmedia en de onderwerpen die worden behandeld in Leidse lokale nieuwsmedia, en tenslotte III) hebben zij minder vertrouwen in de betrouwbaarheid van Leids lokaal nieuws. Op basis van deze genoemde redenen zou Leids lokaal nieuws kunnen proberen om over meer verschillende onderwerpen te schrijven die jonge mensen aan kunnen spreken. Ook moet er geprobeerd worden om de betrouwbaarheid van hun nieuws te vergroten door de verhalen beter uit te diepen. Vervolgonderzoek is nodig om uit te zoeken of deze factoren die door de respondenten genoemd zijn daadwerkelijk een uitwerking hebben op de interesse van jongvolwassenen in lokaal nieuws.","['nieuwsinteresse jongeren', 'lokaal nieuws', 'information overload', 'geworteldheid', 'authenticiteit', 'authentiek nieuws', 'news fatigue', 'fake news', 'sociale cohesie', 'vermakelijkheid van nieuws', 'double viewing paradox']"

"Faith and Incurable Disease: Missionary Reactions to Sleeping Sickness in the African Great Lakes Region, 1902–1914","Becker, Jan",['Dr Duncan Money'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses missionary reactions to the sleeping sickness epidemic that haunted East and Central Africa in the early 20th century. Sleeping sickness was an inevitably fatal disease endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa. In focusing on the German protestant Bethel Mission and the French catholic White Fathers mission, this thesis argues that missionaries had distinct approaches towards sleeping sickness and that the disease was less prevalent in the African Great Lakes Region than previously assumed. Past scholarship on sleeping sickness has relied almost exclusively on the Belgian, German, and British colonial states’ archives. Sleeping sickness threatened these states’ claim to power and consequently induced profound colonial anxieties. Missionaries, instead, were less anxious in light of sleeping sickness. Missionary medicine and missionary mobility regimes aided the Bethel Mission and the White Fathers to cope better with the epidemic. Their archives offer an alternative to colonial archives that does not conflate the disease, and also acknowledges that vast areas in the African Great Lakes Region were free of sleeping sickness. The disease was one among many diseases the missionaries and their communities faced. The missionary sources this thesis relies on suggest that scholarship on sleeping sickness reflects a colonial imaginary rather than the lived reality of non-colonial individuals in the African Great Lakes Region.","['Sleeping Sickness', 'Mission', 'Missionaries', 'African Great Lakes Region', 'Medicine']"

Sebastian Melmoth: A Biographical Approach to Oscar Wilde's Catholic in The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Put, Ruben van de",['E.J. van Leeuwen'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyzes the Catholic themes within Oscar Wilde’s 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. In order to accurately do so it will establish proper definitions of gothic fiction and Catholicism. Moreover, within this analysis on Catholicism and gothic fiction, it will also establish which Catholic themes are significant within the analysis of The Picture of Dorian Gray. After these definitions and particular themes are established, an inquiry into Wilde’s personal life, and his relationship to Catholicism, will be executed. Eventually, an analysis of the novel itself, combining the Catholic themes and the biographical information presented in the earlier chapters, will be carried out. After these analyses are carried out, this thesis will establish that The Picture of Dorian Gray illustrates Wilde’s fear of being completely liberated. The judgment he received from the Marquess of Queensberry, the heteronormative Protestant community he grew up in, and even his lover Lord Alfred Douglas would eventually turn his desires to feel as liberated as his mother into a phobia of being completely free, which is depicted in his own conviction of Dorian Gray.","['Oscar Wilde', 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', 'Catholicism', 'Homosexuality', 'Gothic Fiction']"
De vork op tafel in Italiaanse Renaissance schilderkunst,"Meer, Jamie van der","['Dencher, A.R.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Kunstgeschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het tafelbestek zoals men dat kent in Europa heeft niet altijd bestaan in de huidige vorm. De interesse vanuit verscheidene musea in eetgewoonten en -gerei in de afgelopen eeuw is aanzienlijk. Het grote aantal tentoonstellingen waarin de tafelcultuur en de totstandkoming daarvan de hoofdrol speelt, onderstreept de toegenomen interesse. In veel van deze tentoonstellingen wordt met name gefocust op kunstnijverheidsobjecten uit de hoogtijdagen van eetgerei. Dit geldt ook voor tentoonstellingen waarin de vork een rol speelt. De vork is in Byzantium geïntroduceerd en als eerste gemeengoed geworden in Italië. In deze scriptie wordt, middels het bestuderen van een aantal voorbeelden van de Italiaanse schilderkunst uit de Renaissance, waarin de vork actief wordt gebruikt bekeken in hoeverre dit gebruik overeenkomt met bestaande theses over de opkomst vande vork. In de bestudeerde literatuur is geconstateerd dat de acceptatie van de tafelvork als gemeengoed in Italië is aangemoedigd door bepaalde etenswaren en ontwikkelingen binnen de cultuur en tafelgewoonten tijdens de Cinquecento. Op de bestudeerde voorbeelden is echter enkel de invloed van de individualistische mentaliteit en de behoefte aan praal in zowel decorum als tafelmanieren tijdens de 15de en 16e eeuw te zien.","['Tafelcultuur', 'Vork', 'Schilderkunst', 'Renaissance', 'Cinquecento']"

"Notícias falsas: professionele waarden, rolopvattingen en werkwijzen van Braziliaanse factcheckers","Heymans, Romy","['Burger, J.P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek naar de professionele waarden, rolopvattingen en opvattingen over werkwijzen van Braziliaanse factcheckers heeft als doel inzicht te verschaffen in de positionering van Braziliaanse factcheckers in hun dagelijkse professionele praktijk, het (nationale en mondiale) journalistieke veld en de Braziliaanse maatschappij. Deze informatie kan dienen als verdieping van de kennis over het relatief nieuwe concept van factchecken als onafhankelijke discipline, waar buiten de Verenigde Staten slechts beperkt onderzoek naar is gedaan. De onderzoeksvraag die wordt beantwoord, luidt: ‘Wat zijn de professionele waarden, rolopvattingen en werkwijzen van Braziliaanse factcheckers?’ Het onderzoek is kwalitatief van aard. Om antwoord te kunnen geven op de onderzoeksvraag zijn elf semi-gestructureerde interviews over het onderzoeksonderwerp afgenomen bij Braziliaanse factcheckers. Deze zijn geanalyseerd en in verband gebracht met voorafgaand onderzoek. Op deze manier is in het kader van boundary work verkend hoe de respondenten hun eigen beroep definiëren en inkaderen. Transparantie en objectiviteit zijn de waarden die het merendeel van de respondenten het meest van belang achten. Zij zien het als hun voornaamste doel om publieke voorlichting te verschaffen, al dan niet in actieve vorm via burgereducatie. De helft van de respondenten ziet het ook als taak van factcheckers om politieke actoren aan te zetten tot beter gedrag. Het verbeteren van de journalistiek beschouwen slechts vier van de respondenten als doel. Driekwart trekt geen harde grens tussen journalistiek en factchecken, maar ziet factchecken als onderdeel van journalistiek of als sterk verwante discipline. De overige drie respondenten schetsen wel een scherp contrast tussen reguliere journalistiek en factchecken, voornamelijk op basis van gebruikte methodologie en selectie van onderwerpen. Impact wordt vaak gezien als meest relevante factor bij de claimselectie. De meeste respondenten plegen geen wederhoor omwille van de eigen veiligheid of omdat de bron onvindbaar is. Alle respondenten staan kritisch tegenover het gebruik van expertbronnen. De grootste uitdagingen van Braziliaanse factcheckers zijn het waarborgen van de veiligheid en het vinden van voldoende financiering. Op basis van de resultaten wordt vervolgonderzoek voorgesteld naar verdere verkenning van de werkwijzen van Braziliaanse factcheckers via etnografische observatie. Dit zou een passende aanvulling op dit onderzoek zijn, dat enkel inzicht geeft in de visie van de respondenten op geschikte werkwijzen voor factcheckers. Een andere suggestie voor vervolgonderzoek is om meer vergelijkend onderzoek te verrichten naar de verschillen in rolopvattingen en werkwijzen tussen factcheckorganisaties in verschillende landen. Omdat de rolopvattingen en werkwijzen van factcheckers dikwijls locatie- en cultuurgebonden blijken, biedt dit mogelijk nieuwe inzichten.","['factchecken', 'desinformatie', 'misinformatie', 'Brazilië', 'verificatie']"
Transparantie: wondermiddel tegen het geloofwaardigheidsprobleem van nieuwsmedia? Het effect van metajournalistieke transparantie op de mate waarin jongvolwassenen actualiteitenprogramma's als geloofwaardig beoordelen,"Hoeks, Sanne",['Dr. A.R.J. Pleijter'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Tijdens de coronacrisis wordt veel (nep)nieuws verspreid en dat zorgt ervoor dat nieuwsconsumenten niet meer goed weten welke media ze wel of niet kunnen vertrouwen. Journalisten willen graag zo geloofwaardig mogelijk overkomen om het vertrouwen van het publiek te winnen. Verschillende onderzoekers opperen het gebruik van transparantie als oplossing voor dit geloofwaardigheidsprobleem. Er is veel onderzoek gedaan naar de invloed van transparantie op de geloofwaardigheid van de geschreven journalistiek, maar deze onderzoeken geven geen eenduidig antwoord. Daarnaast is er geen onderzoek dat zich specifiek op televisie richt. In dit onderzoek wordt daarom onderzocht of er een effect bestaat van transparantie op de geloofwaardigheid van actualiteitenprogramma’s op televisie. Specifiek is de invloed van metajournalistieke transparantie op geloofwaardigheid onderzocht, een vorm van transparantie waarbij de kijker een kijkje achter de schermen krijgt en ziet hoe het televisie-item tot stand is gekomen. Voorbeelden daarvan zijn documenten laten zien en verwijzen naar bronnen. Om dit te onderzoeken is een online experiment uitgevoerd waaraan 152 jongvolwassenen van 18 tot en met 25 jaar (M = 21.91, SD = 1.98) deelnamen. De participanten zijn willekeurig verdeeld over twee condities. De experimentele conditie kreeg een fragment te zien van het actualiteitenprogramma Nieuwsuur dat metajournalistieke transparantie bevatte en de controleconditie kreeg een soortgelijk fragment te zien zonder metajournalistieke transparantie. Vervolgens werd de afhankelijke variabele geloofwaardigheid gemeten. Op basis van de resultaten van het onderzoek is geconcludeerd dat er een effect is van metajournalistieke transparantie op de geloofwaardigheid van actualiteitenprogramma’s. Er is een klein positief effect gevonden van metajournalistieke transparantie op degeloofwaardigheid van de inhoud. Dit wil zeggen dat jongvolwassenen de inhoud van het fragment dat metajournalistieke transparantie bevatte als geloofwaardiger beoordeelden dan de inhoud van het fragment zonder metajournalistieke transparantie. Daarnaast is een effect gevonden van het vaker kijken naar het actualiteitenprogramma op de geloofwaardigheid van het actualiteitenprogramma. Er is geen effect gevonden van metajournalistieke transparantie op de geloofwaardigheid van het actualiteitenprogramma zelf of de journalist in het actualiteitenprogramma. Aangezien er geen grote significante effecten zijn gevonden kan worden gesteld dat transparantie geen wondermiddel is, maar mogelijk wel een kleine rol speelt in de oplossing van het geloofwaardigheidsprobleem van nieuwsmedia.","['Nieuwsmedia', 'Metajournalistiek', 'Transparantie', 'Geloofwaardigheid', ""Actualiteitenprogramma's"", 'Jongvolwassenen']"

"The Flower Drawings of Miss Knip: Henrietta Geertruij Knip, the first woman painter within the Knip family at the beginning of the nineteenth century","Timmers, Miranda","['Bakker, P.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Henriëtta Geertruij Knip (1783-1842) who descended from a humble background and lived in a time of great political upheaval and limited possibilities for women to establish a professional career as a painter, managed to do just that. She was part of the Knip family, a dynasty of painters that started of with her father Nicolaas Frederik Knip (1741-1808). She was not the first in the tradition of women painters in the Netherlands. The seventeenth and eighteenth century had offered chances, provided that there was an artistic or educated background. This was still the same at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Only through schooling by her father and thanks to the favourable connection with Gerard van Spaendonck (1756-1839) could a professional career as a painter be possible for a woman like Henriëtta Geertruij Knip. Apart from proven talent, there was financial necessity to train as many family members as possible, in case support was needed. This was the reason the Knip relatives worked together. It was possible for Henriëtta Geertruij Knip to travel to Paris by herself because two of her brothers were already there and she could stay in Maison Buffon under the supervision of Gerard van Spaendonck. She was probably financially supported by her older brother Josephus Augustus Knip (1777-1847), who was also a painter. Although Van Spaendonck had several women pupils, Henriëtta Geertruij Knip was the only one Dutch. She started out with botanical drawings and flower and fruit still lifes in water colour but after 1822 she would paint in oil paint. For this she was schooled in Paris again, this time by Jan Frans van Dael (1764-1840). She was trained in a traditional eighteenth century style but later works show elements of Romanticism when bouquets contained less different types of flowers and were placed in a more natural setting. Thirty-two works have been found that could have been made by Henriëtta Geertruij Knip but only ten are signed and dated and six are signed. If this number should prove to be true this means she produced less than one work per year during the estimated fourty-four years of her working life. This would mean that the money she generated from teaching made up the larger part of her income. However, it is more likely the location of many works is unknown or that works got lost. When looked at the careers of fellow women pupils of Gerard van Spaendonck and Jan Frans van Dael it is clear that these women took their painting very seriously and made it into their formal careers even though some may not have depended on the income. This having been her example it is no surprise that Henriëtta Geertruij Knip took part in the very first Tentoonstelling van Levende Meesters that was held in 1808 in the Netherlands. She was the only woman who did so together with her then sister-in-law Pauline Knip-Rifer de Courcelles (1781-1851). Henriëtta Geertruij Knip took part ten times and always together with relatives, like her older brother Josephus Augustus Knip, nephew Augustus Knip (1819-1859/1861) and/or her niece Henriëtte Ronner-Knip (1821-1909). Until 1821 she took part with water colours and from 1830 onwards she presented herself with oil paintings. Most of the times she participated with less works than her relatives and works were not always for sale. Nevertheless she presented herself as a professional painter with a steady work flow. Although Henriëtta Geertruij Knip had many pupils, the name of only one is still known, Elisabeth Johanna Stapert (1816-1887). The reason could be that she had a career as well. She also generated an income through teaching and taking part in exhibitions but got married later in life, although she did not stop working. Other women artists who came after Henriëtta Geertruij Knip like her niece Henriëtte Ronner-Knip, Sientje Mesdag-van Houten (1834-1909) and Thérèse Schwartze (1851-1918) all had more opportunities to present themselves in art societies like Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam and Pulchri Studio in The Hague. These had not been there during Henriëtta Geertruij Knip’s days. By 1871 and 1872 it would even have been possible to receive vocational training at the art academies of Amsterdam or The Hague. All aforementioned women were still trained by their fathers or other painters. The fact that they had successful careers in different genres than flower still lifes with many memberships in art societies and husbands that supported them, does show that opportunities had expanded as the nineteenth century progressed. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the nineteenth century Henriëtta Geertruij Knip seized opportunities like training in Paris, taking part in the Tentoonstellingen van Levende Meesters. She was sensitive to new developments in art, participated in the Knip family and was well able to earn her own income and present herself as a professional artist.","['Henrietta Geertruij Knip', 'woman painter', 'flower still lifes', 'flower drawings', 'nineteenth century', 'Knip']"
"Tyapa or Chapa, What is my Cat’s Name? Can Dutch Speakers Distinguish Between Russian Coronals Varying in Palatalisaiton?","Nachesa, Maya Konstantinovna","['Caspers, J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Dutch speakers have difficulty distinguishing such Russian sounds as /tj/ and /tjj/, or /tj/ and /tʃ/. The Perceptual Assimilation Model stipulates that we analyse sounds in a second language in terms of those from the first based on articulatory similarities. It predicts that if two sounds in a speaker’s second language are analysed as the same sound in the first, they will be difficult to distinguish. Proposing that Dutch speakers analyse Russian /tj/, /tʃ/, and /tjj/ as Dutch [tʃ], I used an AXB-task to systematically investigate Dutch speakers’ ability to distinguish the Russian sounds /t/ and /d/, the coronals /t/, /tj/, /tʃ/, and /tjj/, and the sibilants /ʃ/ and /ʃj/. Since stress affects the vowel quality of the vowel following plain and palatalised consonants differently, I also investigated the effect of stress. Last, participants indicated how easy it was to distinguish the contrast. Analyses revealed that the Dutch participants performed worse than the Russian speakers on /tj/-/tʃ/, /tj/-/tʃ/, /tʃ/-/tjj/, and /ʃ/-/ʃj/, while still having an accuracy of well above .50. Initial stress was only found to negatively influence discrimination of /tj/-/tjj/. The Russian speakers also performed worse on the /tj/-/tjj/ contrast, meaning results on this contrast are to be interpreted with caution. These results show that, while Dutch speakers experience difficulty with perceptually distinguishing sounds not available in Dutch, this difficulty is attenuated. This is important, because it confirms that Dutch learners of Russian should focus on these sounds, while at the same time suggesting that they already have a good head start.","['L2-sound perception', 'Russian', 'Dutch', 'Palatalisation', 'AXB-task', 'Online experiment']"

Previous linguistic research has shown that even though only Bantu languages are spoken in the area, there might have been Southern Cushitic habitation in the past. Taita Bantu words that resemble Cushitic words might be loanwords that were borrowed in a past period of language contact. This idea of extinct Southern Cushitic languages in the Taita Hills was proposed by Christopher Ehret and Derek Nurse in 1981. This thesis aims to critically review their article “The Taita Cushites”. Several tables with proposed Southern Cushitic loanwords in the Taita Bantu languages are included in the article. By reviewing 41 of these proposed loanwords, the accuracy of the article’s conclusions will be tested. New data is available on the Southern Cushitic and Bantu languages of East Africa that was not present yet in 1981. Using this data, new insights in the existence of the Taita Cushitic language(s) could be gained.","['Taita Hills', 'Historical linguistics', 'East-African linguistics', 'loan words', 'Bantu', 'Cushitic']"

Strategisch manoeuvreren op de automatische piloot: Een analyse van het strategisch manoeuvreren met het topisch potentieel van pragmatische argumentatie in het e-health programma ‘mindfulness’,"Reeuwijk, Amber van","['Leeuwen, M. van']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Nederlandse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Mindfulness is erop gericht bewustzijn te verkrijgen door het huidige moment aandachtig te waarnemen en uit het toekomst- of verleden-denken te stappen (Kabat-Zinn, 2020). Mindfulness wordt binnen de gezondheidszorg zowel fysiek als online aangeboden. Een online voorbeeld hiervan is het e-healthprogramma ‘mindfulness’ van Therapieland. Van het programma wordt verwacht dat de persuasieve kracht van het programma dusdanig aanwezig is dat de patiënt wordt overgehaald om een andere manier van denken aan te nemen; hij of zij wordt aangespoord om mindfulness toe te passen en het ‘automatische’ denken af te remmen. Bij het aan- of afraden van bepaalde handelswijzen is het voor het e-health programma ‘mindfulness’ kenmerkend dat er gebruik wordt gemaakt van argumentatie die bestaat uit het opsommen van de positieve of negatieve effecten; oftewel pragmatische argumentatie (Van Eemeren & Snoeck Henkemans, 2016, p. 86). Gezien het e-health programma ‘mindfulness’ een online programma betreft, is het voor de patiënt niet mogelijk om direct feedback te geven of te ontvangen. Het is voor het e-health programma van groot belang dat de pragmatische argumentatie op zo’n manier wordt gepresenteerd dat de argumentatie het meest overtuigend is. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om aan de hand van een analyse naar de selectie uit het topisch potentieel een verklaring te geven voor de manier waarop de patiënt wordt beïnvloed om een andere manier van handelen te aanvaarden. De centrale vraag hierbij is: op welke manieren wordt er binnen het programma ‘mindfulness’ van Therapieland strategisch gemanoeuvreerd met de selectie uit het topisch potentieel van de pragmatische argumentatie?",
High Levels of Chinese Capital Flowing into the Global Football Sphere: How Can It Be Understood?,"Chong, Lucas","['Kharchenkova, S.S.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the initial commercialization of the men’s Chinese professional football league, Chinese actors have started investing increasingly more resources in the foreign football sphere. Players, coaches, trainers and even clubs from all over the world have all been the subject of Chinese investment over the last few decades. Although spending has increased exponentially, the level of both the Chinese professional competition as well as the men’s national team have not improved at the same rate. This study uses existing literature from both academic sources as well as marketing and news reports on the subject to better understand the reasons to why investing in globalized resources has increased while also providing possible explanations to why the level of competitiveness has not been influenced as much. The study suggests that through the frameworks of soft power and state corporatism we can understand the levels of spending as larger state-driven strategy to both stimulate the football industry as well as to improve China’s soft power through international competitions. This study also suggests that based on the current academic and professional discourse surrounding Chinese competitive football, the reason for professional Chinese clubs’ relative low level of performance is due to a lack of incentive for the clubs to invest in future talent development. Although this study’s conclusions remain to be theories based on the interpretations of other academic researchers and experts, it still confirms that there is still much urgency for further research on this subject","['China', 'Football', 'Soccer', 'Globalization', 'Soft Power']"

Turkish Islamic influences in contemporary Bosnia & Herzegovina: Cultural and Political domains,"Anstey, Francesca","['Berger, M.S']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Turkey’s connection to the Balkans dates back to its shared past with the Ottoman Empire. After the dissolution of the empire, Turkey has maintained a continuous, albeit fluctuating, involvement in the region. The period after the breakup of Yugoslavia (1992) and the Serb-Bosnian war (1992-1995) marked an interesting turning point in Turkey’s further involvement within the cultural, political, and religious spheres of the Balkan region. Turkeys' involvement and influence in the region can be described through the cultural and political factors and most importantly to its Ottoman Islamic heritage. The aftermath of the Serb-Bosnian war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (hereafter shortened to Bosnia) demonstrated a rise of foreign Islamic actors seeking to provide aid and relief to the affected Bosnian Muslims and their community. The post-war period was heavily defined by Saudi Arabian and Iranian actors and to a lesser extent Turkish actors. The departure of Saudi and Iranian actors allowed Turkish religious voices to take over spaces left by those previous actors. This turning point is interesting to explore as it questions the nature of Turkey's continuous involvement and its development in the region, specifically in Bosnia. This leads to the question: In what ways have Turkish religious influences developed and affected Bosnian Muslims after the Serb-Bosnian war (1992-1995)?","['Turkey', 'Islamic influence', 'Turkish Foreign Policy', 'Bosnia & Herzegovina', 'soft power', 'cultural diplomacy', 'Gulen', 'Diyanet', 'AKP', 'Erdogan']"

Same-Sex Love and Desire in Middle English Literature: Lanval and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in Context,"Van Oosten, Serena","['Murchison, Krista']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis will explore the depiction of same-sex love and desire in Middle English literature by comparing and analysing two key Arthurian Romances, namely Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (SGGK) and Lanval. By looking at the context behind these texts, this thesis will explore how medieval audiences would have responded to the texts’ portrayals of same sex love and desire. SGGK was published around 1400, and it is interesting because of the relation between Gawain and the Green Knight. Gawain and the mysterious lord he is staying with – the Green Knight – have to exchange what Gawain receives at night; Gawain receives only kisses from the lord’s wife, and the terms of the exchange require him to ‘deliver’ these to the lord. This situation raises the question of how a medieval audience might have reacted to such an example of same sex desire – and if the audience would have interpreted this exchange as homoerotic at all. Lanval was composed around 1200. In Lanval, the main character is accused of being a homosexual. However, he only gets accused of this because he refuses the queen’s love. This raises the question of whether same sex love was seen as negative in the medieval age, and how people dealt with those who are accused of being homosexual. The analysis in this thesis will focus on the question of how medieval society dealt with same sex desire. This question will be analysed by drawing on the context of the medieval time and the literature that time produced; which was centred around the Bible. Furthermore, the analysis will focus on the differences between the texts under exploration—taking into account the different time periods in which they were written—and on the differences between these two texts in terms of how their audiences would have read the texts’ portrayals of same-sex love and desire.","['Sir Gawain and the Green Knight', 'Lanval', 'Middle English Literature', 'Marie de France', 'SGGK', 'Same-Sex Sexuality', 'Homoeroticism']"

This thesis focuses on the German Green party ‘Bündnis 90/Die Grünen’ in the regional context of Baden-Württemberg, where the faction is the strongest force in parliament. The party’s political strategy and its politicians’ behaviour in relation to the actors at hand is explored. The theoretical framework is constructed around the Cleavage and Elite Theory. Existing scholarship showed that the meaning of the ‘alternative’ characteristic changed for the party over time. Developing from a Social Movement base, this analysis showed that today the party defines itself external to the political left-right axis, incorporating values from the progressive and conservative pole under the umbrella of the Green ideology. Held interviews clarified that this strategic position enables the Bündnis 90/Die Grünen to maximize its outreach to different electorate milieus, and to build cooperative ties with other parties, corporations and Social Movements. This highlights how the party benefits from these ties when advocating policies in parliament and when constructing creative, environmental solutions. The politicians perceive their role in the reconciliation of interests, and rationalize this strategy through the pressing need for climate action, presenting the Bündnis 90/Die Grünen as the only party that can enable change. As this study showed that the party and its politicians strongly focus on cooperation within Green politics, the relationship to other actors should be explored in future research, and the strategy described should be put into the context of the upcoming national elections.","['Green parties', 'political strategy', 'Elite Theory', 'Cleavage Theory', 'Germany']"

Women's Empowerment in Kashmir’s Conflicted Kupwara District: Comparing the Role of NGOs to Grassroots Female Groups on Emancipation,"Akerboom, Eva","['Blezer, H.W.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis covers the significance of empowering women who have been vulnerable to sexual violence in the conflicted Kupwara district, in particular Kunan Poshpora in the Kashmir Valley. This is done by looking at and comparing how non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and locally-led female movements strive to improve women’s wellbeing and participation in the region. To do so, this research paper attempted to answer the following research question: “How have NGO-organised women’s empowerment programmes impacted women’s participation in the Kupwara district compared to locally-led female self-emancipating groups following the rise of armed insurgencies and resulting sexual violence in Kashmir?” While previous research covers the role of NGOs and grassroots female activism in emancipating women, there is a gap in literature regarding their comparative positions. NGOs are considered apolitical agents and must remain neutral actors in supporting women throughout the conflict. However, their position is frequently challenged due to governmental restrictions and local suspicions in Kashmir. On the other hand, female-led activism aims to achieve political objectives by protesting for justice and liberation, and offering women a platform to share their traumas. This paper discovered that both organisations are interconnected in aspiring to emancipate women who have been victimised in Kashmir, albeit in different ways. The issue at hand lies fundamentally deeper than short-term solutions offered by NGOs or grassroots movements, and a plethora of factors need to be taken into account by both actors to successfully emancipate women in Kashmir.","['Kashmir', 'sexual violence', 'women’s empowerment', 'non-governmental organisations (NGOs)', 'female-led activism']"

Natural gas as a modern weapon? The case of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.,"Theunissen, Sanne","['Schellens, drs. D.E.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Natural gas is seen as a suitable transition fuel to make the transition to more sustainable energy sources possible. However, domestic production in several countries is declining. This had led to governments working on safeguarding their security of supply and therefore getting increasingly dependent on international projects. One of the international projects established to make up for the declining domestic production is the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Several countries have however expressed their dissatisfaction on the pipeline and believe that the project is politically motivated. The discussion on the project has been on the forefront of international relations over the years. Many observers and scholars have written about the negative implications it could have. But despite the many negative views, some countries still participate. This thesis explores why the pipeline is economically and politically beneficial for the country that is directly connected to it: Germany. Germany has been focusing on promotion of investment and sustainable growth over the years. The energy transition is one of the most important factors with regard to this. In this specific case, the pipeline is predicted to provide gains for Germany as it helps with the transition. The government regards the pipeline as a purely commercial project, which plays an important role in safeguarding security of supply and in the energy transition in their case. The concerns risen by other countries are not considered a risk on a national level. Germany is able to act as a buffer between Europe and Russia, which it has always done throughout history and can therefore also mediate for third parties.","['Energy politics', 'Power relations', 'Interdependence', 'Nord stream 2']"
GENDERING JUSTICE: Documentary Representations of Female Agency and Victimhood Regarding Sexual Violence in the Yugoslav Wars,"Hernandez, Julia","['Ieven, B.K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Concerning transitional justice, the turn towards advocating for localized action and gendered analysis has engendered a focus on female agency. In documentary film studies, a similar pattern emerges: over time, scholars have started to question prevailing representations of women, and to celebrate well-rounded, agentive representations. This thesis, which analyzes representations of female agency and victimhood in documentaries concerning sexual violence during the Yugoslav Wars, utilizes an interdisciplinary approach which draws from both of these fields. It incorporates the aesthetic analytical tools provided by documentary film scholars to analyze Sexual Violence and the Triumph of Justice (2012) and Mission Rape - a Tool of War (2014), while keeping as its main focus the gendered agency framework created by Björkdahl and Mannergren Selimović. Thus, it marries the two disciplines to provide a thorough understanding of prominent issues in transitional justice. This concerns both how transitional justice is practiced and how this practice is portrayed to the public by challengers and proponents of the prominent methods in the transitional justice space. I hope to contribute to knowledge in both fields, and to demonstrate how well-rounded and agentive representations of women’s agency can challenge the traditional narrative of passivity and victimization of women in conflict-zones.","['gender', 'transitional justice', 'agency', 'documentary film', 'Yugoslavia', 'sexual violence']"

This thesis attempts to understand the historical past of Ghana and the post-colonial roots of current urban development that has led to an intense contest for urban space, inciting disparity and displacement within the city of Accra. An evaluation of policy and investment strategy is studied to understand the vision of the state and its steps towards realising it. Methods to do this include using theories and articles focussing on urban dynamics within and outside Accra that can be used to understand the complex web of issues that Accra’s urban poor is within the housing crisis. Case studies in neighbourhoods such as Nima are used to show concrete examples of the theoretical conclusions made. To prevent the progress of urban development from creating more disparity this paper suggests a change in the understanding of current policy and development strategies by focussing on the colonial and cultural heritage of current urban developments. In addition, reforming policy that prioritise the urban poor, avoiding pitfalls of pilot studies and past attempts in providing adequate housing for the less fortunate. In conclusion, to change the future of this current crisis in urban development there is a need to take two steps back to set one better step forward.","['Real estate', 'urban development', 'Accra', 'disparity', 'post-colonialism']"
Rising Tensions Sink All Boats: The Regional Effects of Legal Action on the Maritime Silk Road in the South China Sea,"Boss, Tom",['Dr. Ruben Gonzalez Vicente'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"A critical section of China’s One Belt One Road initiative is the Maritime Silk Road, which attempts to connect China to its fellow sea-adjacent nations via maritime trade routes. Unfortunately, recent legal challenges have created tensions due to competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. Therefore, this thesis aims to answer the question: How has international legal action, or the threats thereof, enacted by South China Sea nations under the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea affected China’s Maritime Silk Road goals? By analyzing China's implicit and explicit goals for the Maritime Silk Road, this thesis finds that China’s primary motivations are increased regional cooperation and resource acquisition. Through an analysis of each of the claimant states, this thesis also finds that arbitration is both likely to occur in the future and harmful to China’s goals for the Maritime Silk Road, as the effects of further arbitration are likely to both raise tensions in the region and make it more difficult for China to secure critical energy and trade resources. Furthermore, this case study addresses why states comply with international law. This study provides support for Managerialism, finding that the case of the South China Sea includes enforcement through joint management by the claimant states of the regional legal regime, and a tolerance for a certain level of noncompliance.","['South China Sea', 'International Law', 'Maritime Silk Road', 'Territorial Disputes']"
The effects of climate change on intercommunal conflicts in Mali,"Dalmulder, Abiës Ninka","['N, Walters']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Climate change is becoming an increasingly significant global issue. One part of the world has become a particular focus of the possible impacts of this issue : The Sahel. Whilst the contribution of the Sahel to climate change is extremely limited, it will nevertheless be the area most impacted by climatic variations. Rising temperatures, longer droughts, more frequent floods and extremer storms are predicted to increasingly jeopardize the security and livelihood of millions of people living in the Sahel. Along with this is the fear that climate change will foster conflict. This thesis will argue that climate change does not directly cause conflict but instead functions as a ‘threat multiplier.’ Mali is used as the specific area of research and the conflicts between the Dogon farmers and Fulani herders will be used as a case study. This research will show how political exclusion, jihadism, forced sedentarism, a corrupt justice system and heavy-handed practices introduced by the colonial regime have been exacerbated by climate change and have consequently led to violent armed conflicts.","['Climate change', 'intercommunal conflict', 'Dogon-Fulani', 'political marginalization', 'sedentarism']"

Organized Resistance: How Social Movements in Mexico have Mobilized Against Organized Violence,"Graham, Vivian",['Rebeca Fernández Rodríguez'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The high rates of violence which exist in Mexico are largely connected to the existence of organized crime and the fruitless government counteractions against these groups. In the face of powerful criminal organizations and ineffective governance, Mexican civil society has mobilized to counteract this situation through the creation of social movements. This thesis therefore analyzes the ways in which different social movements in Mexico have emerged to resist the effects of organized violence between 2000 and 2020. Three case studies, in the form of unique social movements, have been selected for analysis due to their prominence, diversity, and reactions to organized violence. These include the Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity, the Cherán Indigenous Movement, and the Mexican Anti-Femicide Movement. This thesis finds several primary factors which contribute to the rise of social movements, which include the roles of neoliberalism, hierarchical structures, and identity. Other patterns emerge in the organization of these movements, namely that they mobilize in cycles and are internally fragmented. Despite the varied context and relative age of many of these theories, this thesis has proven that they still apply to more recent movements, upholding their continued relevance in the field.","['social movements', 'organized violence', 'mobilization', 'Mexico', 'civil society']"

Through a qualitative documentary analysis of various initiatives raised from the attempt to stop the relocation of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma base to Henoko Bay, Nago, the present study aims to highlight the engagement and key role of young activists in the strive against military bases. The documentaries selected to answer the research question are (i) the documentary “Our Island’s Treasure” (2019) by activist Kaiya Yonamine on the relocation of Futenma base to Henoko, (ii) the book “Occupied Okinawa” (2019) by activist Robert Kajiwara and the website of the Peace For Okinawa Coalition he is director of, (iii) the YouTube channel “Uchina Arinkurin TV” by young activist Yuzo Takayama and the youth statement recently published by University students Yuto Ishikawa, Keigo Nishio, and Kazu Nakamoto. The findings show that Okinawan youth activism represents a form of translocal activism because of its five core tenets: (i) autonomy and self representation, (ii) environmental protection, (iii) postcolonialism and democracy, (iv) decentralisation and spontaneous action, (v) contentious space. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the Okinawan youth is active and engaged in the military base struggle, albeit not having experienced the war personally. Ultimately, the present study sheds further light on the Okinawan activism and its relationship with global protest movements.","['Okinawa', 'anti-militarism', 'Indigenous self-representation', 'US military bases', 'youth activism.']"

This understanding is only the surface of the history of Indonesia and Indonesian identity. Indonesia being a former colony of the Netherlands for about 350 years, there has to be a lot more reasons about the intolerance towards Queer identities below the surface that has got to do with Dutch colonialism. With the existence of several queer practices and identities in Indonesia that goes beyond the understanding of the “Global Gays”, this thesis will discuss as to how the Dutch colonial regime could have shifted the understanding of queerness, by using the cases of the Lengger Dance, and the five genders of the Bugis people. These identities and practices still exist in Indonesia today, however they are not tolerated or accepted by contemporary society. Whereas on the other hand, the Netherlands are very accepting towards queer identities and practices. Using a queer and post-colonial perspective, laws, regulations, and cultural values of the Dutch will be looked into and will be compared with Indonesia. Even though the Dutch are accepting towards queer identities in contemporary times, I will try to see whether there are any influences or impact by the Dutch towards the shift towards intolerance in contemporary Indonesia.","['Queer Identities', 'Colonialism', 'Post-Colonialism', 'Cultural Exchanges']"

Increasingly, the introduction of indigenous intellectual perspectives to the global stage – many of whom have been custodians of ecologically important land for centuries – is being treated as a potential solution to this conundrum. In this evolving context, this thesis seeks to understand the role of African indigenous knowledge in global environmental protection. To answer this, a review of the practical and philosophical contributions of African indigenous communities to ecology is conducted, followed by a discourse analysis of the 2019 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, to identify how these knowledges are treated in a global context. Analysis of the report and of academic literature shows that African indigenous knowledges, while potentially incredibly valuable as environmental protection, are poorly represented on a global level, both in their content, and in comparison with other regions.","['indigenous knowledge', 'Africa: IPBES', 'global assessment report', 'Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services', 'local knowledge', 'indigenous communities', 'proverb', 'indigenous philosophy', 'eco-philosophy', 'agency', 'globalisation', 'climate change', 'policy', 'environment', 'sustainability']"

The Western Media’s Representation of the African Continent: An Evaluation of Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s Black is King,"Ndiaye, Nadia Charlotte Elisabeth","['Stathopoulos, A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Western media’s representation of Africa has primarily consisted of Afro-pessimistic portrayals, though the emergence of Afro-optimistic portrayals is arguably increasing. Black is King is an example of the attempt to increase Afro-optimistic depictions of Africa in Western media. This BA International Studies thesis evaluates how Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s visual album contributed towards the representation of the African continent in Western media. The literature review discussed five processes of African representation that have been identified in the academic discourse. Literary and film analyses were the primary methods used to examine the case study Black is King. The theoretical frameworks of wakandification and anti-antiessentialism were also used to highlight the film’s role in African representation. This BA thesis paper concludes that Black is King primarily misrepresents the African continent through depending on the stereotypical descriptions of Africa, the hyper-emphasis on royalty and social status, and on the primary observation of Africa through an African American perspective.","['Africa', 'representation', 'Western media', 'film analysis', 'literary analysis']"

"The Abraham Accords: Israel, the UAE, and the Consolidation of the Middle Eastern Pax Americana","Zewen, Claire","['Ben Aharon, E.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"On 15 September 2020, Israel and the United Arab Emirates signed the Abraham Accords Peace Agreement (AAPA), officially normalizing their relations. While the signatories and international proponents of the agreement portrayed the treaty co-sponsored by the United States as a landmark for peace in the Middle East, many have pointed out that Israel and the UAE have never been at war with one another. Moreover, a closer look at Israeli-Emirati relations reveals that their rapprochement can be traced back to the onset of the 1990s peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). The covert rapprochement has been reinforced by shared security and stability concerns, as well as economic benefits reaped from bilateral trade. Based on these considerations, the present study seeks to answer the question as to what extent the AAPA represents change in Israeli-Emirati relations, as well as how the prominent discursive tool of peace used to frame the decision to officially normalize relations can be conceptualized in reality. It is argued that, despite grandiose proclamations of a “dawn of a new Middle East,” the AAPA does not actually represent a major qualitative change in Israeli- Emirati relations.1 Rather, it serves to deepen already existing relations in the interest of reinforcing the US-sponsored regional order, which is conceptualized as the Middle Eastern Pax Americana.","['Abraham Accords', 'Arab-Israeli normalization', 'UAE', 'Pax Americana']"

The overspilling tensions in the Balkans as well as rising nationalism across Europe had rendered diplomacy a crucial medium for maintaining the balance of power.This thesis will answer the question of in what ways did the failure of diplomacy contribute to the fallout of the First World War? I explore the failures of diplomatic negotiations across Europe as a long term cause which provided the conditions for interstate warfare. To illustrate the political landscape of Europe at the time, the role of nationalism in exacerbating political tensions will be explored in a Europe-wide context. The violations of international law throughout the war will be analyzed to showcase the failures of building international peace through the terms of The Hague Conventions.The findings of this paper indicate that political alliances were a fundamental tool which encouraged increased hostilities. The failure of diplomacy was a culmination of a series of unequal treaties, negotiations held in bad faith, and the inability to reconcile clashing nationalist ideals. The aggressive undertones of each country’s foreign policy magnified the Balkan crisis into a world war.",['World War I']
The state’s responsibility to protect in an environmentally changing world: the influence of climate change on the risk for atrocity crime. A case study research of Mali and Nigeria.,"Vodegel, Marijn M.","['Smith, K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Responsibility to Protect principle assigns states individually and the international community as a whole the duty to protect all peoples against the atrocity crimes: genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. To best fulfil this duty, it is important to consider what factors increase the potential for these crimes. In order to examine whether climate change increases the potential for atrocity crimes, this thesis aims to answer the following question: should addressing climate change be regarded as part of the State’s Responsibility to Protect? To this end, it explores how climate change influences the risk for atrocity crimes in Mali and Nigeria. It does so through applying the relevant risk factors and indicators from the United Nations Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes to the current situations in these countries. The analysis shows that climate change does indeed increase the risk for atrocity crimes. It does so indirectly, especially through inducing more resource scarcity and economic hardships. Consequently, this thesis concludes that climate change should be addressed as part of the State’s Responsibility to Protect. It encourages states and the international community to include climate change in their strategies to adhere to this duty.","['Climate change', 'Responsibility to Protect', 'Mali', 'Nigeria']"

This part of the population will by then experience extreme rainfall, flooding, high temperatures and some will have trouble accessing drinking water. These unsafe living conditions are the effect of global warming. To prevent these environmental conditions action to tackle climate change has to be taken, cities throughout the world have to make adjustments by changing their use of the city. In many cities, policies are made to stimulate the use of sustainable energy with the final goal of becoming climate neutral. The energy transition is however also worrying a part of the population as there are doubts about the affordability of the transition, who is going to pay the price? This thesis will use literary research and policy analysis to examine the current energy-related situation in the Netherlands and give an overview of the current policies. Furthermore, the affordability of retrofitting is examined and communal retrofitting options like heat networks will be reviewed. Additionally, a comparison will be made with other countries.

How to deal with children of foreign fighters who are stuck in refugee camps in Syria is subject to a much heated debate. This thesis clarifies the complexity of this situation through a Norwegian case study. This is done through a vantage point of three different disciplinary perspectives, and answers the research question; how do legal scholars and helpers of children who have a claim to Norwegian citizenship in the refugee camps in Syria approach legal, humanitarian and rehabilitation challenges? Moreover, which challenges can they overcome in order to improve the current situation? In order to answer the research question, five interviews with experts from the different disciplinary perspectives were conducted. With the objective of clarifying the complex issue and gesture towards ways in which the current situation can be improved, this thesis reflects upon humanitarian, legal and rehabilitation-challenges. Results from a wide range of multi- disciplinary literature as well as interviews demonstrate that the most optimal way of solving humanitarian, legal and rehabilitating challenges is to repatriate the remaining four Norwegian children in the camps in Syria. The concluding remarks of this paper presents concrete solutions on how this should be done, and concludes that this can only be done by a cooperation and an interplay between all three disciplinary perspectives discussed in the paper.

Contextualizing the Responsibility to Protect within the African Philosophy 'Ubuntu',"Schloz, Elisabeth","['Smith, K.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The necessity for a principle such as the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) emerged in the aftermath of humanitarian catastrophes of the 1990s and the ineffective and partially destructive response by the international community. R2P represents the notion that states not only have a responsibility to protect their own citizens from atrocity crimes, but due to increasing global interconnectedness have a responsibility to protect citizens worldwide. Furthermore, through R2P, African actors have exemplified shifting power relations, i.e. their growing agency and political, economic, and cultural importance in international relations. This thesis poses the research question, how can ubuntu be used as a framework to understand R2P from an African perspective? This study aims to reacknowledge African agency in the creation and implementation of R2P and the value of a regional and cultural approach, seeing as the literature review reveals that the application of African philosophies to R2P requires further research. To analyze the role of ubuntu principles in R2P, desktop research and document analysis were used. In addition, an interview with Professor Timothy Murithi was conducted. By applying the principles of ubuntu to the responsibilities to prevent, react, and rebuild, this thesis concludes that ubuntu has the potential to increase the legitimate and cohesive implementation of R2P in Africa. Guiding values of ubuntu such as communalism, reciprocity, forgiveness, and communication highlight the humanitarian, ethical aspect of R2P. Furthermore, ubuntu enables a more regional approach to R2P that reacknowledges Africa’s role in international affairs.","['Responsibility to Protect', 'R2P', 'Ubuntu', 'regionalism', 'African agency']"
How to Get Away with Murder: The Governance of Private Military and Security Companies in the Global War on Terror,"Fontaine, Florence Joséphine",['Dr. Salvador Santino Regilme'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the effectiveness of United States (U.S.) and international regulations that seek to constrain Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs) in their operations during the Global War on Terror. This investigation is conducted through a case study analysis of the Nisour Square Massacre (NSM) committed by contractor personnel of the American PMSC “Blackwater”. Through the examination of the three criteria of (1) legal accountability, (2) law enforcement, and (3) conviction, this thesis contends that the regulatory framework proves to be largely ineffective in adequately governing PMSCs. The statutory and ambiguous language of legislation has prevented the ascription of legal accountability for the NSM to the private contractors. Additionally, effective regulation has been impeded by a cumbersome and lengthy jurisdictional process. It is argued that the final verdict has been incommensurate to the crimes committed at Nisour Square and been further exacerbated by the pardoning of the Blackwater guards by former U.S. President Donald J. Trump. Moreover, it is evidenced that the U.S. has circumvented international regulations and failed to comply with its obligations under international law. Overall, this thesis maintains that the ineffective regulation of PMSCs through U.S. and international law has evoked both a jurisdictional and enforcement gap, thereby deterring the process of effectively holding the Blackwater personnel accountable for the NSM.","['Blackwater', 'Global War on Terror', 'Nisour Square Massacre', 'Private Military and Security Companies', 'U.S. and International Regulations']"

Consequently, the thesis proposed a central argument that maintained that the Morocco-Israel normalization should not be considered a turning point of the two states’ relations. To determine whether the main argument was realistic, the thesis aimed at answering the overarching question: “what are the factors that led Morocco to start a normalization process with the State of Israel?” The research, to disclose the reasons behind the Morocco-Israel normalization, encompassed three empirical chapters which focused on historical, transnational, and political aspects related to the event that could have played a relevant role in the progress of the two countries’ relations. The research focused on a timeframe that covered the evolution of Morocco-Israel relations from 1948 to the present days. To better understand certain aspects of the relations, the research also considered a timeframe that focused on the Jewish-Berber relations in Morocco at the start of the Arab rule. The thesis relied on a qualitative research that relied on primary sources, like official government statements, and secondary sources, like academic journals and online news articles. Overall, the thesis concluded that Middle Eastern politics and the historical and transnational relations Morocco and Israel hold influenced the finalisation of the Morocco-Israel normalisation. Consequently, the main argument of the thesis holds.","['Morocco-Israel normalization', 'Morocco-Israel transnationalism', 'Morocco-Israel political relations', 'Morocco-Israel historical relations', 'Abraham Accords', 'Western Sahara Conflict']"

Yet it remains debated to what extent economic incentives drive bilateral normalization agreements. This research problem will be investigated in the context of the Abraham Accords, a recently signed normalization agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Three empirical chapters analyze economic incentives that were present in 2020 in the spheres of trade & economic relations, finance & investment, and tourism & people mobility. Central research findings include firstly, the UAE’s economic diversification leads to a demand of modern technologies which fits into Israel’s characteristic as a tech-driven export economy. Secondly, the UAE’s reinvestment of petrodollars through foreign direct investments connects well to Israel’s start-up sector that relies on investments. Thirdly, (religious) tourism is not only of economic importance for both States, but people mobility is necessary to facilitate economic cooperation in the spheres of trade & economic relations and finance & investment. Based on these findings the main argument is that political-economic incentives in the spheres of trade & economic relations, finance & investment, and tourism & people mobility were the main driver for Israel and the UAE to sign the Abraham Accords. International Relations theory in the form of Realism, Liberalism, Constructivism, and Marxism is applied as the study’s theoretical framework to better understand the State behavior and decisions taken by Israel and the UAE. The study concludes that these research findings are significant to understand incentives for potential future normalization agreements, particularly between Israel and other Arab States.","['Abraham Accords', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Israel', 'Economic Diversification', 'International Relations', 'Israel-Arab normalization']"

This may seem strange from the point of view of international law. In 1962, the International Court of Justice made a ruling on this issue, which should have resolved the dispute between the two countries. The ongoing dispute is, in fact, an indicator of the more comprehensive problem of demarcation of the past. The origins of the Preah Vihear Temple border conflict date back to colonial times and the subsequent decolonization period. During those times, both Cambodia and Thailand made efforts to augment their territorial sovereignty and to promote nationalism. The conflict thus created unfortunately continues to this day. The temple dispute has always been ready to erupt under the right circumstances if it suited Thai and Cambodian politicians. Moreover, the negative images and memories between Thailand and Cambodia have never ceased to exist, but are instead carefully maintained for political purposes. Such perspectives make it highly unlikely that the Preah Vihear issue will be resolved any time soon. Thai and Cambodian leaders have become stuck in a cycle of distrust about border issues that has been going on for many decades. The Preah Vihear dispute shows just how fragile Thai-Cambodian relations really are. The painful historical background, along with nationalist sentiments in the unfinished development of nation-building in both countries, is thwarting the formation of good relations. Preah Vihear, the temple on the border, has remained at the center of bilateral anxiety. This place of consecration has thus become a bone of contention.","['ASEAN', 'border dispute', 'boundary demarcation', 'Cambodian-Thai relations', 'heritage', 'International Court of Justice', 'ICJ', 'international law', 'mainland Southeast Asia', 'nationalism', 'Preah Vihear', 'Phra Wihan', 'territorial dispute', 'Thai-Cambodian relations']"

Nieuwe mogelijkheden om media te produceren en publiceren hebben ervoor gezorgd dat traditionele mediapartijen anders zijn gaan werken. Nieuwe actoren deden hun intrede, clubmedia hebben een belangrijke rol gekregen en de traditionele media hebben door nieuwe concurrentie een andere manier moeten vinden om zich te blijven onderscheiden. Door de steeds commerciëlere voetbalwereld, waarin voetballers, voetbalclubs en voetbalbonden sterke eigen kanalen hebben, is het voor de toekomst van de voetbaljournalistiek noodzakelijk dat onderzocht wordt hoe de verschillende partijen naast elkaar kunnen blijven bestaan. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: ‘Hoe percipiëren actoren uit het voetbalmedialandschap de high- choice media environment?’’ Het doel van dit onderzoek is om meer inzicht te geven in het veranderde voetbalmedialandschap, waarmee uiteindelijk ook bijgedragen kan worden aan de toekomstbestendigheid van de voetbalmedia. Om dit te onderzoeken is een gevarieerde groep experts uit de voetbalmedia, bestaande uit journalisten, sociale mediaredacteuren, persvoorlichters en hoofdredacteuren geïnterviewd. Uit de resultaten van de expertinterviews bleek dat de groeiende concurrentie, bestaande uit zowel clubmedia, snelle nieuwssites als sociale mediakanalen ervoor gezorgd hebben dat voetbaljournalisten op een andere manier zijn gaan werken. Door de komst van sociale media zijn sportorganisaties niet langer afhankelijk van traditionele mediapartijen. Persvoorlichters en clubmedia houden steeds vaker het monopoly op exclusieve informatie bij zichzelf. Om inkomsten te genereren, maar ook om de boodschap in eigen hand te houden, zonder kritische geluiden van onafhankelijke journalisten toe te laten die een ander belang dienen. Deze ontwikkeling zorgt ervoor dat journalistieke waarden minder vaak gerespecteerd worden en geruchten een belangrijker onderdeel zijn geworden van de berichtgeving. Traditionele voetbalmedia en voetbaljournalisten zijn zich meer gaan focussen op onderzoek, verdieping en duiding. Door de snelle mediawereld zijn zij zelden nog onderscheidend door nieuws als eerste te brengen. Eventueel vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op de specifieke rol van – bijvoorbeeld – de eindredacteur in het voetbalmedialandschap. Ook kan dit onderzoek over enkele jaren opnieuw uitgevoerd worden. De mediawereld staat immers geen moment stil en ontwikkelt zich razendsnel met nieuwe technologieën, nieuwe actoren en nieuwe manieren waarop het publiek betrokken is bij de voetbalmedia.","['Voetbalmedia', 'high-choice media environment', 'sportmedia', 'sport', 'sociale media', 'sportjournalistiek']"
The effect of explicitness of instruction and language knowledge on adults’ ability to learn an artificial grammar,"Meijden, Tessa van der","['Geambasu, Andreea']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Extracting and generalizing rules from a complex input is one of the foundations of learning a language and can be studied using artificial grammar learning tasks. Different results have been found, between artificial grammar learning studies but also within these studies. This thesis tries to explain some of this variance by looking into whether different study backgrounds influence the ability to learn an artificial grammar in adults. The experiment is based on earlier research conducted by Geambaşu (2018), in which she tested adults’ ability to learn an artificial grammar by using clear and vague instructions. She found participants who received clear instructions (explicit instruction condition) to perform better in the experiment than participants who received vague instructions (implicit instruction condition). The participants in the present task were divided into two groups: linguistics students and science students, since they differ most in their courses. They were exposed to the grammar via a passive familiarization and tested with yes/no grammaticality judgment task. The two instruction conditions and the stimuli were similar to those used by Geambaşu (2018). Participants who received clear instructions were expected to perform better in the task, than participants who received vague instructions. Further, participants with a linguistic study background were expected to have more explicit language knowledge and therefore perform better in the task, than participants with a science study background. Results indicate that there is no difference in the ability to extract and generalize rules from the sequences between students with a linguistics study background and students with a science study background. Further, no effect was found based on the different instruction conditions or for the pattern participants were exposed to. However, participants who showed explicit knowledge of the rule, by indicating a strategy based on extracting and generalizing the pattern of the sequences, performed significantly better.","['Artifcial grammar learning', 'linguistics students', 'science students']"

The thin line between success and decay is measured by politics and diplomacy. Many historians merely praised Stadholders and diplomats for their contribution, but in recent years it has become clear that their wives have also been part of the wide-spread network in the courts of Europe. This research specifically focuses on three Stadholderswives in the Rebublic: Amalia van Solms, Maria Henriëtta Stuart and Albertine Agnes van Nassau. As ladies of the House of Orange, these wives have contributed a great deal to the seventeenth-century diplomacy and dynasty by using feminine qualities and by taking over tasks that previously belonged to their husbands. The purpose of these actions was to continue their dynasty in the most prosperous way. It is the first time that the diplomatic role of these Stadholderswives is researched. It appears that Amalia, Maria and Albertine were female ambassadors who managed to make use of diplomats, husbands and nobility to ensure the continuation of their dynasty.","['stadhoudersvrouwen', 'diplomatie', 'zeventiende eeuw', 'vrouwengeschiedenis', 'Huis van Oranje', 'Amalia van Solms', 'Maria Stuart', 'Albertine van Nassau']"

Stereotypes about China in Dutch Primary Schools: The Role of Textbooks and Teachers in Perpetuating a Prejudiced Discourse on China,"Kimmenade, Lise van de","['Kharchenkova, S.S.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Primary school textbooks are filled with images and text that provide information about other countries, even if the intention of those books is not to teach about world orientation, but how to read and write. This thesis studied Dutch “Lijn 3” reading and writing books of Malmberg through Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA), which encompasses both textual Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Visual Discourse Analysis (VDA), and found that there is a significant amount of information on China within them. This information is often stereotypical, and corresponds to existing prejudice and humour on China and the Chinese ethnic minority in the Netherlands. Furthermore, interviews with teachers showed that they are aware of harmful effects of stereotypes and prejudice, but they are reluctant to intervene when they encounter stereotypes in books. They prefer to ignore stereotypes because they argue that children do not see them. This incorrect observation, that children are unable to see and understand stereotypes, creates a non-critical environment for children and teachers, in which stereotypes and prejudice teach children a power hierarchy. In this hierarchy, the Caucasian Dutch are dominant, and the rest is subordinate. This thesis suggests that stereotypes in textbooks need to be acknowledged by teachers, and communicated to children, or illustrators and authors need to eliminate stereotypes out of books, in order to change this problematic power hierarchy.","['Education', 'textbooks', 'teachers', 'prejudice', 'stereotypes', 'China', 'Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis']"
Pushing boundaries in the African aviation sector through Chinese expansion,"Schoonderwoerd, Sijmen",['Dr. S. Links'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The continent of Africa has a massive deficit in infrastructure, which is a bottleneck for the continent's economic development. To overcome this deficit, Africa needs to invest heavily in its infrastructure. The current road and rail networks are insufficient to cope with the increasing demand, and, taking into consideration the vast distances on the African continent, it is essential for Africa to develop aviation. With a developed domestic aviation market, China is stepping up to help with this task as it is expanding its global presence due to growing welfare and demand for resources and markets. This research aims to find out how African aviation benefits from this cooperation. The following research question has been drawn up for this purpose: How much does the Chinese drive for expansion contribute to the African aviation market? Case studies were carried out to answer this research question. These case studies have shed light on the partnership between China and Africa. It also shows which lessons can be learned from China. Based on these findings, it can be said that China's expansion is making a positive contribution to improving and expanding the African aviation sector as a whole.","['Aviation', 'China', 'Africa', 'cooperation']"

The establishment process of the Central Planning Bureau: A case study on economic planning in a capitalist and liberal democratic context,"Moerdijk, Caecilia",['Prof. Dr. H. te Velde'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Economic planning is a concept that is often associated with twentieth-century totalitarian regimes and communist countries. However, also in post-war Western Europe, multiple countries have established – or made an attempt to establish – national planning institutions. One of the Western European planning institutions that exemplifies the difficulty of implementing planning in a capitalist and democratic context is the case of the Dutch Central Planning Bureau (CPB). This thesis focuses on the planning debate in the Netherlands and tries to clarify the establishment process of the CPB (September 1945 – April 1947). The current historiography argues that the establishment process of the CPB must be regarded as a marginalization process caused by the general elections of May 1946. Based on a more in-depth analysis of multiple parliamentary documents and a large number of newspaper articles, this thesis argues that the current marginalization argument has to be marginalized itself in three ways: 1.) the formal changes that occurred were only minor and not all of them were at the cost of the power of the CPB; 2.) the focus has to be broadened towards all political parties involved in the discussion on state intervention and planning; and 3.) the main focus has to be on the political framing and positioning of the CPB with regards to economic policy.",

How have recent Japanese labour migration policies dealt with the theme of integration of foreign labour migrants?,"Duin, Daniëlle van","['Shibata, S.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the last decade, Japan has seen a sharp increase in labour migrants and research shows these migrants don’t always integrate easily and are often the subject of discrimination. Research on migrants, however, has mostly focussed on either the barriers to integration on the work floor or on the policies of the government, without focus on integration. This thesis links these two important research bodies, by studying immigration policy in relation to integration on the work floor. Using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and a case study of the recent amendments of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition act, it studies the attention given to the topics of labour, national security and human security. Results show that even though the government its policies play a key role in integration, the act holds little attention to the social aspect of integration. This social aspect consists of preventing discrimination and creating mutual understanding between Japanese citizens and migrants. Analysis shows that even though more labour opportunities to enter Japan were created in the amendments in 2014 and in 2018, migrants taking those opportunities (HSM, Technical Intern Trainees, SSW and health & care workers) still have difficulty integrating in Japan.","['Japan', 'Labour Migration', 'Migration Policies', 'Discrimination', 'Integration']"

"Between a rock and a hard place: Portugal, China and the EU","Pereira, Sofia","['Wang, Jue']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"China and the European Union have, for a long time, sustained a cooperative, yet at the same time, antagonistic relationship. The surge in Chinese FDI in Europe, after the global financial crisis, exacerbated unfavorable opinions of China, due to skepticism surrounding the intentions behind this investment increase. There is in place the belief that Chinese investment is negatively contributing to EU cohesiveness, by putting member states against each other to curry for China’s favour and secure investments, thus putting at risk the European order. The period post-2008 financial crisis saw Portugal becoming an important recipient of Chinese FDI, and as such, this paper analyzes the impact Chinese FDI has in Portuguese foreign policy and its integration in the EU. Portugal proves to be a unique case in comparison with other member states, due to its long-lasting relationship with China, and positive track record as a member of the EU. This dissertation examines this issue by using liberal intergovernmentalism and motivations behind Chinese investment, to argue that Portugal’s domestic interests play an important role in how it handles both China and the EU, as well as to defend that Chinese investment in Portugal as shown to be economically motivated. The results suggest that Portugal maintains a consistent and unchanged, for the most part, China policy. Furthermore, since most of Portugal’s domestic interests are met by the EU, according to liberal intergovernmentalism, in this way, it continues to contribute to its integration in the union. All in all, Chinese FDI in Portugal shouldn’t pose as a concern to the EU, seeing as the data reveals that Portugal’s top investors continue to be fellow member states, with China comprising a modest and slowly decreasing percentage. Therefore, the novelty of Chinese FDI in Europe continues to perpetuate an exaggerated anxiety, along with often unnecessary concerns, regarding the impact of said investment in Portugal.","['Chinese FDI', 'Portugal', 'Foreign Policy', 'EU Integration', 'Domestic Interests']"
mother tongue + 2,"wijk, thirza van","['lukac, morana']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The European Union (EU) is founded on the principle of ‘unity in diversity’, that is the diversity of cultures, customs and beliefs, and languages. Today around 445 million people, who together speak over 80 languages, find their home in the 27 member states of the EU. As the EU greatly values its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, it is committed to safeguarding its 24 official languages and promoting the learning of multiple languages in the Member States of the EU. One of the main goals of the EU’s language policies and initiatives is for every citizen to be able to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue. This goal, first formulated in 1995, is also known as the ‘mother tongue + 2’ formula. In the 2002 Barcelona European Council, the EU called for the improvement of education in order to give students the chance to develop language skills in two foreign languages in school. In reality, however, not all citizens are convinced of the merits of speaking various languages, which shows that linguistic diversity is not yet the norm. Besides that, publications of the European Commission show that only a quarter of EU citizens are able to hold a conversation in two foreign languages. As Member States of the EU have the right to decide on their own language policy due to the principle of subsidiarity, the influence of the EU’s language policy is limited. For this reason, the aim of this thesis is to investigate the reality of compliance to the ‘mother tongue + 2’ formula through the analysation of national language policies and language learning in two Member States, namely the Netherlands and Hungary. By conducting qualitative literature review this thesis found that in both countries the education system plays an important role in the acquisition of foreign language knowledge. However, in both countries a lot of improvements can be made in order to assure that every citizen learns two languages besides their mother tongue.","['European Union', 'Mother tongue + 2', 'Language policy', 'Multilingualism', 'the Netherlands', 'Hungary', 'Language education']"

The increase in the Venezuelan migratory flow and the successive problems that have arisen due to the margins of interpretation in the initial migration policy led to a lack of protection among Venezuelan migrants. However, the application of the new exceptional measures destined for the Venezuelan migrants has a more humanitarian element, but with a protectionist design. This again led to lack of protection and irregular immigration status, but on a lesser scale.","['diáspora venezolana', 'migración sur-sur', 'política migratoria-Colombia', 'política migratoria-Perú', 'derechos humanos de los migrantes', 'Derecho Internacional Humanitario', 'instituciones humanitarias internacionales']"
Speaking of Equality: An Exploration of Relational Egalitarian Linguistic Justice,"Kunst, Madelon","['Meijers, T.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"This essay explores the possibility of a relational egalitarian account on linguistic justice. For relational egalitarianism, a society based on equal social relations forms the essence of the egalitarian ideal. This paper argues that linguistic inequality, which places certain linguistic varieties in a politically, economically, and socially dominant position, automatically placing others in inferior positions, should be of concern for relational egalitarians in particular. Moreover, it portrays how existing accounts on linguistic justice are not sufficient in mitigating the relational egalitarian injustices generated by linguistic diversity. By combining and expanding these accounts, relational egalitarianism provides the theoretical prospect of true linguistic equality. However, it will appear that in practice, the feasibility of such an approach is severely constrained. This does then, in turn, raise important questions for relational egalitarian theory as a whole, which aims to be based in the practical reality that many real-life egalitarian social movements face.","['Relational egalitarianism', 'linguistic justice', 'linguistic inequality', 'ideal theory', 'non-ideal theory']"

These problems of scarcity are worsened by a growing Peruvian population and processes of urbanization, while water resources are distributed unevenly between Peru's three main geographical regions: 'la costa', 'la selva' and 'la sierra'. In order to combat these problems, the Peruvian government proposed and implemented a new water law in 2009: la Ley de los Recursos Hídricos 29338. This thesis evaluates the results of this water law and uses the active mining region of Cajamarca as a case study to evaluate the law. We find that the new water law provides a basis for a better integrated organization of water management through new institutions and organizations. However, its contents are ambiguous and leave room for neoliberal interpretations, which consolidates the power of the agro and mining sectors in the distribution of water sources in Peru.","['watermanagement in Peru', 'law 29338', 'neoliberalism in Peru', 'integrated water resources management']"

Door twee wijngedichten van Abu Nuwas te analyseren en in hun literaire en theologische context te plaatsen, verhelder ik dat de dichter een brede opvatting van religieuze tolerantie, naar zowel christenen als moslims, had. Deze opvatting was gegrond in zijn ruime conceptualisatie van de vergevingsgezindheid van God en zijn nadruk op de onwetendheid van de mens. Door al-Nazzam's legalistische en restrictieve lezing van de islam te bekritiseren, zet Abu Nuwas een alternatieve lezing van God's attitude tegenover wijndrinken voort en bepleit hij dat de islam moslims verplicht tolerant te zijn jegens elkaar, evenals tegenover niet-moslims. De enige zonde die niet is te vergeven is het associeren van andere wezens met God.

"“Leadership is not always about you” The Botswana Democratic Party, the Zimbabwe African National Union (PF), and the Legacy of Colonial Homophobia.","Waal, Stephanie Eveline","['Bellucci, S.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the evolution of the constructs of gender and sexuality in precolonial, colonial, and independent Zimbabwe and Botswana, with focus on the Shona, Ndebele, and Tswana during the (pre)colonial era, and the BDP (Botswana Democratic Party) and ZANU(PF) (Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front) in the late colonial and postcolonial period, to identify what particularities in Botswana’s and Zimbabwe’s historical trajectories explain the divergence between the stance of BDP and ZANU(PF) leadership on the decriminalization of same-sex relations (SSR). The Shona, Ndebele, and Tswana started with a similar outlook on SSR, and in both countries, the British colonial administration imposed penal codes that criminalize(d) SSR. Yet, while BDP leadership grew gradually more supportive of the eventual decriminalization of SSR in 2019, ZANU(PF) leadership has strongly opposed to repealing the colonial-era penal codes. The different (de)colonization process and degree of colonial domination in each country appear to have the strongest explanatory power for these diverging outcomes. Many scholars have linked homophobia to masculinity and patriarchy. At the same time, colonial rule is widely believed to have undermined African masculinities and destabilized existing gender roles, and scholars have argued that misogyny, hyper-masculinity, and homophobia in African nationalist movements can be seen as a reaction to feelings of emasculation among African men. Colonial rule was significantly less invasive in Botswana, and the transition to independence mostly peaceful. Resultantly, there was no strong feeling of colonial domination among Botswanans, and anti-(neo)colonial rhetoric had little value as a source of political support. Thus, homosexuality never became conflated with (neo)colonialism in BDP nationalism, because it never centered on anti-(neo)colonialism to begin with. In contrast, Zimbabwe’s invasive colonial experience and arduous independence struggle created a strong sense of colonial domination among male independence leaders, who experienced it as ‘emasculation,’ and used misogyny and homophobia in attempt to restore a position of patriarchal power. At the same time, the rejection of homosexuality became a way to challenge colonial narratives about African sexuality and masculinity that were used to justify their abasement. Resultantly, the conflation of emasculation and homosexuality with colonial subjugation featured prominently in ZANU(PF)’s anti-colonial nationalism. The influence of Fanonesque and Marxist-Leninist thought further deepened homophobic sentiments in ZANU(PF) nationalism, while these schools of thought were absent from BDP nationalism. There is also scholarly consensus that European missionaries played an active role in codifying homosexuality as ‘immoral’ in Africa, and scholars argue that as Christianity became heavily politicized in the region, so did homosexuality. In that sense, homophobia, much like Christianity, is a political tool in contemporary Africa. Limited imposition of colonial rule and Tswana-controlled integration of Christianity may have further limited the inculcation of European (missionary) notions of sexuality and immorality in BDP nationalism. Moreover, unlike BDP nationalism, ZANU(PF) nationalism was organized around anti-colonialism, and this social glue lost its power once independence was achieved. This necessitated the creation of a new common enemy, while socioeconomic underperformance and declining public support incentivized the creation of a scapegoat to deflect criticism. Political homophobia became part of the creation of this new common enemy and scapegoat, and gained its legitimacy from Zimbabwe’s (de)colonization experience. With steady economic development and widespread public support after independence, there was less of an incentive for the BDP to use sexual minorities as a scapegoat.","['Africa', 'LGBT+', 'LGBT', 'same-sex relations', 'sexuality', 'gender', 'colonialism', 'gay', 'homosexuality', 'nationalism', 'Zimbabwe', 'Botswana', 'ZANU(PF)', 'ZANU-PF', 'Southern Africa', 'BDP', 'Botswana Democratic Party', 'Mugabe', 'Southern Rhodesia', 'misogyny', 'misogynoir', 'Bechuanaland Protectorate', 'African Sexuality', 'Shona', 'Ndebele', 'Tswana', 'BaTswana', 'hegemonic masculinity', 'colonial masculinity', 'African masculinity', 'Christianity', 'homophobia', 'inkotshane', 'matanyola', 'patriotic history', 'political homophobia']"

Dit wordt ook wel framing genoemd: door het gebruik van specifieke woorden en beelden in je boodschap zet je een verhaal neer dat een bepaald stuk van de werkelijkheid belicht en een ander stuk juist vervaagt. Een goede methode voor het destilleren en analyseren van frames is een deductieve kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse. Het nadeel aan deze methode is dat er voldoende geschreven materiaal moet bestaan om een onderzoekscorpus te kunnen samenstellen. Wanneer er onvoldoende geschreven materiaal voorhanden is, zal er op alternatieve wijze data moeten worden verzameld. In deze scriptie is onderzocht in hoeverre het interviewen van personen een bruikbare methode is om frames te destilleren en deze vervolgens te analyseren aan de hand van een inductieve (kwalitatieve) inhoudelijke framinganalyse. De casus die in dit onderzoek centraal staat is het vervoer van gevaarlijke stoffen via het spoor. Door middel van 10 semigestructureerde interviews is een gesproken onderzoekscorpus samengesteld. Om na te gaan in hoeverre deze methode bruikbaar is, is daarnaast ook een onderzoekscorpus met geschreven materiaal (nieuwsartikelen, social media-uitingen, stakeholdercommunicatie) samengesteld. Om te onderzoeken welke frames er uit de corpora gedestilleerd kunnen worden en welke reasoning en framing devices te herkennen zijn, zijn beide corpora door middel van een inductieve kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse geanalyseerd. De resultaten laten zien dat het destilleren van frames via interviews een bruikbare methode is voor een framinganalyse. De gedestilleerde frames uit het gesproken corpus bevatten in veel gevallen dezelfde of vergelijkbare reasoning en framing devices, waardoor er veel overeenkomstige frames in de verschillende corpora gedestilleerd zijn. Op basis daarvan kan geconcludeerd worden dat het verzamelen van data voor het onderzoekscorpus via interviews een bruikbare alternatieve methode is om frames te destilleren en te analyseren aan de hand van een inductieve kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse.","['Framing', 'framinganalyse', 'inductieve kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse', 'frames', 'interviewtechnieken', 'corpusonderzoek', 'framing devices', 'reasoning devices', 'stilistiek']"
Agricultural Policies and Food Security in Nigeria: Agriculture as the road to the promised land of food security,"Jong, Diene de",['Dr. Leila Demarest'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Nigeria is facing large problems with food security. The country is ranked 100th (out of 113) on the Global Food Security Index, and the statistics on hunger, poverty, malnourishment, are not painting a much more positive image (The Economist, 2020). President Muhammadu Buhari and his government consider agriculture to be the path to food security in Nigeria. Over the years, several policies have been installed to launch the agricultural sector into development, increase domestic food production, and decrease food imports. These policies are not undisputed. Critics argue that the Nigerian government acts erratic and that the implementation of the policies is lacking. Although the goals of the policies seem to be in line with what the sector needs, in spite of the efforts, the sector has not managed to significantly increase production and Nigeria remains food insecure. This paper aims to contribute to the debate by investigating why there is such a big gap between the policymaking and positive results. To this aim I will identify the threats to the Nigerian food security, conduct a thorough analysis of the standing agricultural policies of the Buhari administration, give an assessment of their effectiveness, and in addition, I will research the producers’ perspectives on the policies by doing interviews. I find that the policies touch upon the right subjects; the goals and challenges are defined in line with what the agricultural sector needs, but the implementation is seriously lacking. Therefore, the agricultural sector is unable to develop and Nigeria remains food insecure.",

Political violence by insurgent armed groups has been a major problem which many Latin American governments have had to deal with since the Cold War, and Peru has not been an exception with the significant presence of Sendero Luminoso between 1980 and 2000. However, since the turn of the twenty-first century, several Peruvian regimes and installed security forces, the national police, intelligence services and even civilians express concern that the brutal and violent past due to political violence must not be repeated.

A New Era of Sino-Iranian Partnership: A Contemporary Study on the Key Drivers Behind Sino-Iranian Cooperation,"Sassanian, Ali Sina","['Ferchen, M.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Abstract Over the past five years, researchers have observed a significant intensification of Sino-Iranian relations. This development culminated in March, 2021, when the two countries struck the twenty-five year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership deal. This paper investigates the nature of current Iran-China relations by analyzing the main drivers behind this partnership. In doing so, it evaluates three recent developments that are crucial in this respect. These developments are (1) the striking of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership deal, (2) the ongoing negotiations on the renewal of the Iran nuclear deal, and (3) the current dynamics within Iran’s domestic politics. Following this analysis, this paper argues that current Sino-Iranian relations are relatively strong, and are likely to grow even stronger in the near future. This assessment is based on the rather stable nature of the main drivers behind this partnership. In that regard, this paper found that continuous Unites States containment policies towards Iran have indirectly contributed to the intensification of Sino-Iranian cooperation. As a result of these policies, Iran has grown increasingly dependent on China, both politically and economically. Furthermore, due to the highly profitable nature of this cooperation for Iran’s powerful conservative faction, a significantly different Iranian approach towards China is not expected in the near future.","['Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP)', 'Sino-Iranian relations', 'Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)', 'Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)']"
Challenges to government formation in Western European parliamentary democracies,"Rieder, Gaston","['Oude Nijhuis, D.M.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,European Politics and Society: Vaclav Havel Joint Master Programme,Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to understand the reasons behind the increase in the duration of government formation negotiations in Western Europe. It argues that there is a gap in the existing scholarship on this issue. On the one hand, scholars have noted that party systems in the region have undergone profound changes over the last decades, and particularly since the 2008 financial crisis. On the other, the effect this has had on the duration of government formation has not been as thoroughly researched. In order to explain this phenomenon, this thesis expands upon the survival analysis literature, by means of applying recent innovations to the Cox proportional hazards model, such as the Cox with Expected Durations package (Kropko & Harden, 2017, 2020). All in all, the results show that longer government formation processes can be attributed to two main phenomena: the rise in parliamentary fragmentation, and the rise in less stable legislative types as per the typology outlined by Laver and Benoit (2015). The findings of this thesis thus contribute to a better understanding of this crucial development in the Western European political landscape, which has wider implications for the stability of Western European democracies as a whole.","['government formation duration', 'Western Europe', 'party system change', 'Cox proportional hazards model']"

Focusing on a film about an expatriate sound recordist and his journey from his new home Berlin to that of his childhood. She describes the film as a work that engages with soundscape and landscape in a psychogeographical manner. Inspired by the work of Mollaghan, this thesis delves deeper into the notions of psychogeography and soundscape as described by Guy Debord and R. Murray Schafer. Abiding by Mollaghan’s study, the thesis concentrates on soundscape and psychogeography and its correlation between the experiences of individuals from an expatriate community. Throughout the years, the Japanese expatriate community in the Netherlands has grown increasingly, and so have the institutions and services catered towards Japanese expatriates. Is it possible that the emergence of familiar institutions and activities may create a similar soundscape to that of urban Japan? And if so, does this familiar soundscape evoke negative emotions or acculturative stress among expatriates? This thesis endeavors to explore the link between an unfamiliar soundscape and the loneliness, homesickness and nostalgia that it might evoke.","['Soundscape', 'Psychogeography', 'Expatriate communities', 'Nostalgia', 'Migration', 'Sense of belonging', 'Acculturative stress']"

Donald Trump’s foreign policy towards the Middle Eastern region: A study on the believer of its own truth,"Rust, Lisanne","['Aharon, B.A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"After an examination of primary and secondary American, Israeli, and international sources such as White House speeches, Aljazeera interviews, American and Israeli newspapers, and documentaries, this thesis shows that former president of the United States Donald Trump was the opposite of a mediator for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Instead of being the broker of peace, Trump’s foreign policy created more agitation in the Middle Eastern region, and on the international level. Trump played a strategic game, in which realist and constructivist elements were visible in particular. Thus, this study argues that Trump certainly did not improve the tense situation in the Middle East, although he truly saw himself as the true peace maker. In addition to that, this thesis makes a contribution to the field of International Relations in two ways. Firstly, this thesis created clarity by connecting several aspects of Trump’s decision-making on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to specific IR theories. Secondly, it is an addition to the yet incomplete amount of academic literature on the Trump Administration’s approach for this particular conflict.","['Trump', 'Israeli-Palestinian conflict', 'Foreign policy', 'International Relations']"

Capitalist Questions: Authoritarianism and the Rise of Duterte,"Kresko, Dimitry","['Duzgun, Eren']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In today’s day and age, the world is increasingly seeing the rise of “men of action,” those who pledge to save and protect a nation’s economy and its people from globalism. The current political climate has seen a rise in anti-neoliberal, populist rhetoric that reinforces already existing notions of a technocratic government; one that is self-serving and neglects the people. From Trump’s presidency to the Brexit referendum, the ongoing clash between political forces worldwide is tangible. Trying times often facilitate a longing from certain sections of the public for such figures. In recent years, the Philippines has experienced a president of this exact caliber; Rodrigo Duterte. Besides many of his outrageous statements, one of his most notorious campaign promises and indeed policies include his own iteration of the “war on drugs.” Police and hired vigilantes have been reported to shoot alleged drug suspects without a trial; at times resulting in collateral damage or even the wrong person being killed entirely. This policy has been heavily debated and largely condemned by institutions such as the Human Rights Watch for its apparent brutality. This thesis will analyze the underlying theoretical notions of these phenomena. A historical overview and analysis of the relationship between capitalism and democracy; including the origin and rise of neo-liberal thinking and its effect on the democratic process will be included.","['Neo-liberalism Authoritarianism Capitalism Populism', 'Rodrigo Duterte Philippines']"

De eindredacteur is een onderbelichte, maar waardevolle functie binnen de journalistiek. Dit is de kwaliteitsbewaker van een medium en verdient daarom meer faam. Door middel van semigestructureerde diepte-interviews en observatieonderzoek is de rol van de eindredacteur bij lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia onderzocht in een veranderend Nederlands medialandschap. De interviews zijn afgenomen met eindredacteuren of mensen die eindredactionele taken uitvoeren bij één lokale krant, drie regionale kranten en twee regionale omroepen in Nederland. Het observatieonderzoek is uitgevoerd bij de lokale krant om de bevindingen uit de interviews in de praktijk waar te nemen. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat er meerdere functietitels zijn voor personen die eindredactionele taken uitvoeren bij lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia. Eindredacteuren bij regionale kranten focussen zich op het controleren en verbeteren van de inhoud van de krant, terwijl eindredacteuren bij de lokale krant en regionale omroep meer verantwoordelijkheden hebben. Voor hen is leidinggeven een belangrijke taak op de redactie. Daarnaast is de indeling van de redactieruimte belangrijker bij de lokale krant en regionale media, dan bij de regionale krant. Het beperkte budget dat beschikbaar is, heeft invloed op het werk van eindredacteuren. Verder zorgt de digitalisering voor verandering binnen het eindredactionele vak. De conclusie is dat er meerdere functietitels zijn voor eindredacteuren en dat ‘dé eindredacteur’, zoals die eerder bekendstond, eigenlijk niet meer van toepassing is bij lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia. Bij de lokale krant en regionale omroep draait het om een aansturende functie, waarbij de indeling van de redactieruimte van belang is. Bij de regionale krant focust de eindredacteur zich voornamelijk op de kwalitatieve inhoud van de krant. Door de digitalisering leren eindredacteuren nieuwe dingen en weten ze daarom steeds beter hoe een ‘goede krant’ gemaakt wordt. Toch zorgt een beperkt budget ervoor dat de lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia niet de journalistieke diensten leveren die ze eigenlijk zouden willen. De nieuwsmedia komen bijvoorbeeld mankracht tekort op de eindredactie, waardoor slordigheden gepubliceerd worden.",
Waar is de eindredacteur als je ‘m nodig hebt? Een onderzoek naar de functievervulling van eindredacteur bij lokale en regionale nieuwsorganisaties in Noord-Holland,"Bergsma, Kim","['Jong, J.C. de']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Journalistiek en Nieuwe Media (Pre-master),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Eind 2020 uitten de Raad voor het Openbaar Bestuur en de Raad voor Cultuur zorgen over de steeds meer verdwijnende democratische functie van lokale en regionale journalistiek. Dalende advertentie-inkomsten, slinkende redacties en de toenemende omloop van nepnieuws veranderen het Nederlandse medialandschap. De controlerende en informerende functie van lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia wordt daardoor steeds belangrijker. De eindredacteur is de laatste schakel in de redactionele keten die journalistieke producties controleert voordat deze worden gepubliceerd. Om te achterhalen hoe de democratische functie beter kan worden uitgevoerd verdiept dit onderzoek zich in de rol van de eindredacteur bij lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia. De hoofdvraag die in dit onderzoek centraal staat is: Wat is de rol van de eindredacteur bij lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia in de provincie Noord-Holland? Om antwoord te geven op deze vraag is eerst literatuuronderzoek gedaan naar de rol van de eindredacteur. Vervolgens zijn vier diepte-interviews afgenomen die allen zijn gebruikt voor het uitvoeren van een kwalitatieve inhoudsanalyse. De uitkomsten van deze analyse zijn verwerkt in het resultatenhoofdstuk en leverde aanvullend drie redactieschetsen en een stijlboekanalyse op. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat de rol eindredacteur en de functie eindredacteur niet hetzelfde zijn. De rol van de eindredacteur bestaat uit twee componenten: eindredactionele werkzaamheden en co rdinerende werkzaamheden. Per lokale of regionale redactie verschilt wie deze werkzaamheden uitvoert en welke functietitel deze persoon heeft. Tevens zijn er redacties die deze twee componenten over meerdere personen verdelen. Om de zorgen van de Raad voor het Openbaar Bestuur en de Raad voor Cultuur weg te nemen wordt aanbevolen verdiepend onderzoek te doen naar de verdeling van de rol eindredacteur bij lokale en regionale nieuwsmedia in heel Nederland. Een onderzoek als deze geeft op grote schaal inzichten in de knelpunten en biedt de gelegenheid te bepalen waar structurele steun nodig is om het vervullen van democratische functie te laten wederkeren.","['Eindredacteur', 'lokale en regionale journalistiek', 'journalistiek']"
Exploring feelings of home and belonging among Syrian refugees in the Netherlands,"Hartog, Daan","['Shield, A.D.J.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research aims to understand the process of belonging by analysing where and how Syrian refugees experience belonging in the Netherlands. Against the background of national integration debates that have defined belonging and integration in the Netherlands in synonymity with being able to culturally assimilate, it is argued that that seeing belonging in terms of cultural assimilation has led to heavy focus on integration criteria like language acquisition, labour market entry, and education as conditions for being able to feel “at home”. As the data collected from semi-structured interviews show and by using Antonsich’ conceptualisation of place-belongingness as a foundation from which the process of belonging is explored, it is emphasised that feeling “at home” is a multidimensional process that stretches between and beyond different locations, with refugees developing different methods to adapt to new environments, circumstances, and communities in order to be able to feel “at home”. Apart from the physical home functioning as a safe and private environment where one can be ‘at ease’ in, the data gathered from the interviews show that experiencing feeling “at home” within the physical home is under constant negotiating with the neighbourhood environment as social connections and encounters in the direct neighbourhood affect feeling “at home” in the physical home itself, showing that the physical home is not merely an impermeable private stronghold but rather a starting point from which other places in the wider neighbourhood environment are explored. In addition to the analysis of this feeling “at home” in the physical home, concrete public places are explored for their unique qualities and provide a person with possibilities to attach to new places when such qualities are recognised. Specifically, places of restoration and places of sociality are claimed to enable belonging by their capabilities to increase self-awareness through active participation. Exploring public spaces like buurthuizen and nursing homes enabled the respondents to be a caregiver instead of a care-receiver, adding an existential dimension to their perception on how belonging is experienced and meaningful place-attachment is effectuated on a local scale.","['Integration', 'belonging', 'home', 'refugees', 'Syrian']"

How can the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) be seen as a part of postcolonialism in countries like Ecuador? By demonstrating how they and which articles have been violated in four time periods – the 1990s and 2000s uprisings, Rafael Correa’s regime, Lenin Moreno’s regime, and the pandemic- I also aim at finding out why they have been violated. In addition, this research has looked at one important colonial legacy of Ecuador: racism and discrimination. This has been further elaborated in the research, where the notion of mestizaje, class and racial discrimination has been further unpacked from a postcolonial perspective. Furthermore, the research argues that the UDHR, though ambitious, is not adequate enough to protect the rights of the indigenous communities. This is because the UDHR is not legally binding. However, the UDHR has also been unpacked from the postcolonial perspective: if global governance, can be seen as troublesome due to the imperial undertone it could potentially have. Lastly, the events that are being mentioned in the time periods serve as evidence that back up these claims.","['Ecuador', 'indigenous', 'uprisings', 'Gutierrez', 'Correa', 'Lenin', 'UDHR', 'Human rights violations', 'postcolonialism']"

Female Genital Mutilation: A Persistent Tradition: The effects of laws and policies on female genital mutilation in Kenya,"Wolting, Mirjam","['Stathopoulos, A.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"While female genital mutilation is considered a violation of human rights, it is still widely practised in many countries. With a rate of 21%, Kenya is not one of the countries with the highest prevalence rates. Nonetheless, despite the implementation of a law and many policies to prevent it, female genital mutilation is a persistent tradition. It is argued that this is the case due to ineffective implementation of the law and policies. This research investigates the effects that the law and policies implemented by Kenya’s government and non-governmental organisations have affected the conduct of female genital mutilation and influenced local perceptions of it. Through the analysis of existing literature and 9 interviews, it will contribute to the debate about anti-female genital mutilation legislation and strategies by generating insights about their effects in Kenya. Effects of the legislation on the conduct of the practice that are studied are secret conduct of the practice, lowering the age of cutting, medicalisation, and cross-border cutting. Effects on local perceptions of the practice that are highlighted are opposition to legislation, opposition to the practice, social divisions, stigmas, and increased awareness.","['female genital mutilation', 'FGM', 'Kenya', 'government', 'non-governmental organisations', 'effects legislation on culture']"

Adoption of carsharing services in China: Studying the consumption values Chinese consumers create when using shared cars,"Platell, Louise","['Kharchenkova, S.S.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"China’s economic success over the past decades has led to a massive increase in private car consumption. Even though this rise in private car use has positive societal effects, it is favorable to limit the consumption of private cars from an environmental point of view. For instance, because private cars cause a large amount of carbon emissions. One way to reduce private car use is by adopting shared cars. Earlier studies showed that consumers portray a positive attitude towards shared cars, but adoption rates remain low. To help the promotion of carsharing, this thesis has studied what values Chinese consumers create when using a car sharing service. This was done by distributing a qualitative questionnaire among mostly Chinese university students and analyzing the results by using the theory of consumption values. The findings of this survey showed that functional and emotional values are the most salient considerations for using shared cars. With regards to functional values, a car sharing service should be convenient, low-cost, and of high quality. To enhance emotional values, shared cars should be safe and hygienic, and provide freedom for users to go wherever they would want to go. The findings of this thesis show that the theory of consumption values is applicable to analyze consumption behavior within the sharing economy. Practically, the findings of this thesis also allow car sharing service providers to improve and promote their offerings.","['Carsharing', 'China', 'Consumption values', 'Chinese consumers']"

Constructing a Bulwark Against the West: international misrecognition as a driver for Russo-Iranian security relations,"Evers, Jurriaan",['Dr. A. A. Yenen'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"A review of the literature on the Russo-Iranian relationship identifies a widening mismatch between expectations and reality. Scholarly expectations highlight a propensity of conflict, based upon traditional security considerations resulting in a definition of the Russo-Iranian relationship that is instrumental, limited, and asymmetric – an ‘axis of convenience’. However, the last decade reveals that both Russia and Iran have been able to consolidate their bilateral security ties despite apparent clashes and historical mistrust. Contributing to constructivist scholarship, this thesis engages with international recognition to gain insight into the ideational and normative underpinnings of the Russo-Iranian partnership, in order to provide a new take upon the question why, and to what extent, the partnership does work – instead of why it does not, or will not, work. A constructivist analysis of international recognition and misrecognition has been conducted to answer this thesis’ main research question: What are the ideational underpinnings driving the Russo-Iranian security congruence? The findings in this thesis provide a balanced and contextualized account of both powers’ foreign policies and give greater attention to the forces of congruence shaping the Russo-Iranian partnership in the Middle East and beyond.","['Russo-Iranian relations', 'Middle East', 'Central-Asia', 'International (mis)recognition', 'Constructivism']"

The Joint Strike Fighter and the Internationalisation of the American Military Industrial Complex,"Aken, Petrus van",['Prof. dr. G.P. Scott-Smith'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper seeks to contribute to the literature concerning the Military Industrial Complex (MIC). Specifically, it examines the extent to which international cooperation in the Joint Strike Fighter-programme has influenced the industrial sector of the Netherlands as an American ally. During the Cold War and beyond, the MIC has had far-reaching consequences for the American military-industrial sector and US society as a whole. It is characterised by high levels of military spending, active state management of the industrial sector, a monopsony market, and a large degree of corporate influence on foreign policy. Given that the Netherlands has a long tradition of military cooperation with the United States, it is expected that MIC-dynamics have affected the American-Dutch partnership and have affected the domestic Dutch industrial sector as a consequence. The majority of the literature concerns the domestic consequences of the American MIC. Moreover, current scholarship regarding the JSF is predominantly focused on the military-strategic aspects of the programme. This thesis attempts to help the research further by examining the structural economic consequences of military-industrial cooperation between the United States and the Netherlands. It therefore adopts a Global Political Economy approach. Through an extensive analysis of Dutch and American sources, this paper will argue that the JSF clearly demonstrates the structural power of the United States in defence matters. This structural power lays the basis the examination of the MIC in an international context. In a JSF-context, the Netherlands has developed its own Industrial Complex, which is characterised by active state-management of the aviation cluster. Through cooperation in international programmes, such as the JSF, the Government of the Netherlands attempts to secure the survival of its aviation sector, to retain the knowledge infrastructure that underpins Dutch industry, and lay the basis for further cooperation with the American military-industrial sector.","['Joint Strike Fighter', 'Military Industrial Complex']"

"Weltösterreich: The Habsburg Legacy and Austrian Internationalism, 1916-1927","Baas, Wouter",['Patrick Dassen'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis shows that the conceptions of Habsburg multinationalism continued to have a decisive influence on interwar Austrian social democratic and Catholic conservative political thinking on internationalism in the period 1916-1927. The legitimations of the Habsburg Empire’s place in Central Europe, which included a distinguishing between political state and cultural nation, an othering of the ‘Eastern menace’ and the peculiar civilisational paradox of German superiority and national diversity, showed a ‘stability of meaning’ that continued to dominate Austrian political rhetoric after the Treaty of St. Germain. An actively fought ‘battle for intellectual hegemony’, which sprung from the Empire’s civilisational mission and found expression both in Austromarxist dogmatism and Catholic traditionalism, brought about a particular focus on education as a means for ‘socialisation’, renewal of Catholic values and internationalisation. Austrian Catholic and socialist internationalismsshowed similarities, stressing the importance of cultural internationalisation through education and free trade in Central Europe. The Christian Social chancellor Ignaz Seipel loomed large as an inspirational figure for (young) Catholics in the whole of Europe while Austromarxists Friedrich Adler and Otto Bauer tried in vain to bridge the gap between Labourist social democracy and Bolshevist communism The focus on Kulturpolitik and the universalist legitimations of Empire produced an internationalism that left room for utopian international schemes of European unity. Moreover, internationalism became a rhetorical tool in the increasingly polarised domestic debate in Austria, legitimising local political action with high-flying international idealism. This created a reality gap between local politics and utopian internationalism which resulted in an opportunistic Austrian foreign policy that was open to international initiatives like the League of Nations, the Little Entente and Paneuropa but that would never whole-hearted commit itself. Austrian international utopianism wanted to keep every option on the table which created a situation in which politicians had to settle for the internationalist option closest at hand. In the end, that turned out to be Anschluß to Germany.","['Austria', 'Internationalism', 'Kulturpolitik', 'Interbellum', 'Political Catholicism', 'Social Democracy', 'Otto Bauer', 'Karl Renner', 'Ignaz Seipel', 'Habsburg', 'Österreichische Aktion', 'Joseph Eberle', 'Red Vienna', 'League of Nations']"

One of the main arguments when discussing the democratic deficit of the EU, argues that the EU fulfils its democratic purposes, if it works ‘for’ the people. By providing effective governance and polity, the EU membership makes cyberspace safer and more secure for its member states, which is beneficial for all EU citizens. The EU and its agencies facilitate effective and operative cooperation that works ‘for’ the people. This research focused on two member states as case studies, The Netherlands and Hungary and found evidence that the EU provides a trusted and operative environment which contributes to cybersecurity in unique ways like no other international cooperation. This research looks for evidence that Europeanization, securitization, and interdependence drive the integration in cybersecurity at the European level.","['EU', 'European Union', 'cybersecurity', 'securitization', 'Europeanization', 'democratic deficit', 'Hungary', 'Netherlands']"

EXPERIENCING EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY THROUGH COVID-19: Analysis of Sweden’s Fiscal Solidarity in the Union,"Leighton, Ossian",['Dr. Vera Scepanovic'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"As Covid-19 was beginning to spread, European leaders were forced to debate not only the continued funding of the EU for the next 7 years, but a fiscal relief package as well. Sweden resisted calls to approve of the Commission’s 3 trillion-euro plan, begging the question how does Sweden justify its resistance to fiscal redistribution at the EU level in the face of a symmetrical crisis? Solidarity is a complicated subject matter in the world of international affairs, to assist in better understanding a concept written into EU treaties this thesis created a comprehensive typology of solidarity, broken down into humanitarian and social contract subtypes, with the social contract possessing two further categories, interdependence/mutual responsibility, and conditional solidarity. To understand Sweden’s positioning and messaging, the methodology employed was a discourse analysis by utilizing statements made by Swedish politicians and officials from the Government, Riksdag, and European Parliament to understand the messaging and ideas that were presented in their respective forums. This paper finds that Sweden predominantly utilizes conditional solidarity in its discourse, with modernization, trust and invertedly, identity, being primary factors in determining Swedish disposition of aid. Discourse and internal matters which were created from prior experiences in the early 1990s during a domestic financial crisis, that have bled over into Swedish-European relations. This in turn has opened a gap for anti-EU parties and politicians to mask their rhetoric as a new norm to push a narrative for the breakdown of Swedish contributions and interactions in the EU to prevent further interdependence between Member States.","['European Union', 'Multiannual Financial Framework', 'Solidarity', 'Sweden', 'Folkhemmet', 'Identity', 'Covid-19']"
Disproportionality within the climate crisis: EU Member States' responsibility in the protection of climate change migrants,"Van Gorp, Lieslore",['Mr. drs. G.G.

An overview of different international instruments makes clear what the current protective framework for climate change migrants is within the EU. Furthermore, the research provides legal arguments that add to the importance of improved efforts on climate change mitigation and may provide a positive obligation for EU Member States to grant international protection to climate change migrants. Moral arguments on their turn create an argument to answer why the EU Member States hold a responsibility in protecting victims of climate change. The EU’s responsibility for the protection of climate change migrants as well as its responsibility to improve efforts on climate change mitigation is mainly based on an argument on the disproportionality that can be found within the climate crisis, namely: the overrepresentation of the ‘Global North’ amongst the main contributors and the overrepresentation of the ‘Global South’ amongst the main victims. Current frameworks as the Temporary Protection Directive and the UN Guiding Principles are not able to fulfil the EU’s role as a protector of climate change migrants. The precautionary principle, the principle of common but differentiated responsibility, and the principle of non-refoulement may be a guide to better tools to fulfil this role.","['climate change', 'migration', '(neo)colonialism', 'EU Migration Policy']"

Circular Economy: a catalyst for a 21st century economic paradigm shift? An exploration of the economic transition in Amsterdam,"Costa, Carlotta","['Ennis, C. + Henderson, C.J.V.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study explores the dynamics and contributing factors facilitating economic paradigm shifts. In the 21st-century, a departure from linear to circular economic development may represent the solution for critical economic, environmental, and social issues. To understand how this paradigm shift occurs, an in-depth content analysis of the existing literature and secondary sources available on paradigmatic and policy change was firstly carried out. Once the driving factors for the transition were identified, semi-structured interviews were conducted to integrate theoretical observations with empirical findings. The research focuses on one case study: the transition to circularity in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This is a multifaceted phenomenon enabled by: the discrediting of linear growth economics at the landscape level, the origin and incremental influence of niches, and two regime shifts. The Multi-Level Perspective, developed by Rip and Kemp, explains this interplay of landscape, niches, and regimes. Amsterdam’s transition to circularity is determined by narratives that request urgent governments’ action to tackle issues such as climate change. In synergy with this landscape pressure, the creation and influence of niches, such as the Circular or Doughnut Economics, was found essential for the paradigm shift to occur. Lastly, once the political and economic regimes begin to implement these niches, tangible change occurs.","['Circular economy', 'Paradigm shift', 'Amsterdam']"
"The Responsibility and Accountability of International Institutions and Organisations for Austerity Measures in the Troika-Negotiated Financial Assistance Programmes to Greece, and for Their Impact on Human Rights Standards in the Country","Funa, Erika",['Jeffrey Fynn-Paul'],2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since requesting financial assistance from European and international partners in 2010, Greece has been involved in three consecutive macroeconomic adjustment programmes negotiated with the Troika of international institutions: the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. The European heads of states decided to provide the conditional assistance at the gatherings of the Euro Summit, an organisation where they also founded the Eurogroup and set conditions for Greece to start negotiations. After preparatory work by the Troika, the Eurogroup and the IMF shaped conditions and adopted decisions on the loan programmes. The Eurozone states, which contributed the majority of financing, channelled their financial assistance through the Greek Loan Facility, the European Financial Stability Facility, and the European Stability Mechanism. The IMF participated financially in the first two programmes, while remaining in stand-by in the third. Policy conditionality was specified in Memoranda of Understanding and formally adopted in Council Decisions adopted by the Council of the EU. It mainly consisted of Greece passing a number of austerity measures combined with specifically prescribed structural reform, a strategy based on the theory of expansionary austerity. The specific institutional rules and setup have given the international institution the power to shape Greece’s public spending and legislation in key areas such as labour, social field and more. Taking into account this impact and the consideration that institutions are the most important factors in the occurrence of poverty, while examining the theoretical and practical implications of austerity, this paper builds on the position proposed by Thomas Pogge that deliberate and predictable actions that lead to poverty can be deemed a violation of human rights. In particular, it explores whether the impacts of the conditionalities imposed on Greece by the mentioned international organisations can implicate their responsibility for the effect of their policies on the state of human rights in Greece, in particular the right to work and the right to social security.","['international institutions', 'human rights', 'austerity', 'accountability', 'social rights', 'poverty']"
Securitization of human rights in the migration policy of the EU: How the externalization of European border controls instrumentalizes a humanitarian legitimization to implement a security agenda,"Gerhard, Lea","['Idarraga, N.R.']",2021,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, especially after the ‘refugee crisis’ in 2015, a trend can be figured out whereby migrants and refugees that try to reach the EU are no longer met with a humanitarian approach and policies that secure their rights but are increasingly perceived as a security problem and accordingly treated by the European agencies. This also finds expression in the externalization of European borders to North Africa in the form of third country agreements. However, since these migration management policies that are guided by a security concept are at the same time justified by the protection of human rights, this reveals a clear paradox the thesis will bring to light. Among the cooperation of the Frontex mission ‘Sophia’ with the Libyan coastguard, it is shown that a humanitarian legitimization is used for its implementation. This differs from th actual practices that are characterized by violations of migrants’ rights. Frontex uses surveillance technologies and encounters migrants as a ‘security threat’, whereby a securitization of migrants takes place through the actual practices in the Mediterranean. Thereby, private military and security companies (PMSCs) play a crucial role in lobbying Frontex, shaping policies towards a security nexus. In this study, it is argued that the securitization of human rights can explain this paradox.
