A Comparison between Translation Strategies of Professional and Non-professional Subtitlers - The case of VS Arashi,"Wieringa, Floor","['Valdez, Susana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis concerns the translation strategies used by professional and non-professional subtitlers to translate the Japanese variety show VS Arashi into English. Previous research indicates that target texts of non-professional subtitlers are more source-oriented than those of professional subtitlers. Since the majority of previous research has focussed on anime, the aim of this thesis was to discover whether this is also the case for the English translation of a Japanese variety show. This was investigated using the methodology proposed by Gottlieb (2009), in which extra-linguistic culture-specific references are assigned a place on a scale ranging from source- to target-oriented. The analysis of the results showed that the non-professional subtitles are indeed more source-oriented than the professional subtitles. This may be the result of the non-professional subtitlers prioritising authenticity where the professional subtitlers prioritise readability, a lack of training on the part of the non-professional subtitlers, a difference in target audience with the professional subtitlers targeting a more general audience than the non-professional subtitlers, and the Japanese to English direction of translation causing the professional subtitlers to translate more target-oriented.","['source oriented', 'target oriented', 'translation', 'amateur translation', 'fansubbing', 'professional translation', 'japanese to english', 'fidelity']"

Se enfoca en la manera en que el Gobierno mexicano intenta solucionar el problema, influido por relaciones comerciales internacionales. Se analiza específicamente en qué medida el Gobierno mexicano es capaz de cumplir con los acuerdos y tratados internacionales en esta materia. Los escasos resultados en la guerra contra la piratería hacen que las empresas (inter)nacionales pierdan ingresos por su propiedad intelectual con el efecto de que México resulta menos atractivo para las inversiones y que tenga una mala reputación en el mundo empresarial internacional. Solo que esto no resulta en una posición muy desfavorable porque los países más desarrollados son dependientes de México para poder beneficiarse de sus derechos de propiedad intelectual. Por lo tanto, estos países buscan cooperar intensivamente para poder mejorar el sistema de protección de sus derechos en México.","['Propiedad intelectual', 'México', 'piratería', 'comercio informal', 'relaciones comerciales internacionales', 'legislación', 'criminalización']"

"À PARIS, ON NE SORT JAMAIS SANS SON ACCESSOIRE TENDANCE: A Mixed-methods Linguistic Landscape Study of Signs Used in France, Italy, and the Netherlands during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Zhao, Minyan",['Terkourafi. M.'],2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The construction of signs in the linguistic landscape (henceforth LL) of a given territory is driven by different reasons, and it can reflect upon an area's cultural, social, political, and economic circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic that influenced all countries in the year 2020 has kept a common and stable topic for many signs, which provides a unique opportunity to conduct a comparative LL study. The current study investigates COVID-19 related signs displayed on public transport, shop windows, city noticeboards, inside museums and churches in France, Italy, and the Netherlands. By conducting a mixed-method comparative study in three European countries that were (and still are) affected by the pandemic to different degrees, this study contributes to detecting how their multilingual status, identities, cultural values, and socio-political differences are constructed through a combination of linguistic and visual/multimodal representations, using LL signs as a relevant dataset. The data include 766 COVID-19 related signs collected from July to September 2020, in densely populated, urban areas of France, Italy, and the Netherlands. The quantitative and qualitative results show that monolingual ideologies prevail in France, in line with the country's long-lasting ""one nation, one language"" policy known as ""the Toubon Law"". The French signs heavily emphasized the importance of following the rules for the sake of safety and public health as well as illustrated the Parisian identity as a fashion hub. France also had the highest number of multimodal signs, showing a greater focus on visual representation to get important messages across during the pandemic. Italy featured a fair amount of English influence on LL signs, which may reflect the importance of tourism to economic recovery in the summer of 2020. A trademark of the Italian data were the many unique and humorous signs, which, alongside the low percentage of government-created signs used during COVID-19, reflect the cultural values of the country (use of humour in response to adverse conditions, preference for individual efforts, distrust of government). The Netherlands featured the highest proportion of English influence in LL signs, in line with the country's high proficiency in English. Minority languages spoken by large immigrant communities were better represented in the Netherlands, showcasing its linguistic and ethnic diversity. Solidarity, collective action and cooperation were emphasized in many COVID-19 related signs, illustrating Dutch cultural values and the fact that people in the Netherlands may have more trust in their government compared with France and Italy.","['Linguistic landscape', 'COVID-19', 'sociolinguistics', 'multilingualism']"

Hybridity in Post-Fashion Photography: Juergen Teller’s Miu Miu Resort 2020 Advertisement Campaign,"Pochat, Vanessa","['Westgeest, Helen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The development of fashion photography, just like its subject itself, was in the past and will be affected by trends in the future. The techniques and influences that emerged in the field since the late 1980s and 1990s have marked a paradigm shift from idealized to flexible conventions shaping the status quo of what constitutes a contemporary fashion (ad) photograph. The developments are reflected in modern fashion (ad) photographers’ works such as by Philip DiCorcia or Juergen Teller. The latter is considered a trending fashion photography pioneer. Although it is impossible to typify contemporary advertising photography’s expression, this paper illustrates one of its multi-approaches by investigating Juergen Teller’s (aesthetic) strategy in the advert campaign series Resort 2020 for Miu Miu in light of the concept of hybridity, which reflects the tendency of post-modernist photography. The notion of hybridity is characterized by dualism. The ad contains a multiplicity of hybrid elements revealed by using the methods of interdisciplinary research approach, combining literature review from various disciplines and visual analysis: Miu Miu Resort reflects not only a hybrid fusion of the luxury (the Miu Miu collection) and the banal (the setting or the models’ posing) but also plays on the concept of the grotesque which is in itself hybrid and is exemplified in the photographic series mainly by pairing incongruent categories such as animal and handbag. The general ambiguity in Resort is reflected in ‘conflicting’ compositions intriguing viewers and stimulate their curiosity for luxury products’ display, proved by findings of other scholars’ research on grotesque imagery’s persuasiveness. Teller’s imagery lacks cohesiveness and is not classifiable in many respects, as underlined by his neither amateurish, documentary, or filmic photography style nor in terms of gaze and gender-specific representations of the models. The artist’s work is unlike traditional fashion ad photography, which provides an exaggerated and decorative aura. Teller maintains the Resort campaign’s focus on the Miu Miu commodities by presenting the ordinary as ordinary. The anti-spectacular approach in Juergen Teller’s photographs alludes to the aesthetic concept Wabi-Sabi incorporating intentionally cropped body-parts or sunlight overexposure, rendering albeit the impression of naturalness, but the awareness of an artificial construction remains.","['contemporary fashion advertising photography', 'post-modernist photography', 'the concept of hybridity', 'banal aesthetic', 'the grotesque concept', 'visual analysis', 'Juergen Teller', 'Miu Miu']"

Cela afin de répondre à notre question de recherche : « Comment est-ce que Cocteau a portraituré sa protagoniste dans « La voix humaine » et comment est-ce que Poulenc l'a dépeinte dans la sienne ? » Les aspects formels de la pièce et de l’opéra que nous avons traités tout d’abord, nous ont aidé naturellement à trouver non seulement des similitudes mais aussi des différences entre ces « Voix ». Ainsi, grâce aux choix musicaux et textuels, le compositeur Poulenc a réinterprété aussi bien la pièce de Cocteau que la protagoniste. Nous pouvons conclure que la représentation de la protagoniste est légèrement adaptée dans l’opéra de Poulenc qui en donne sa propre interprétation (surtout plus tendre et calme), alors que l’essence de la pièce de Cocteau et celle d’« Elle » sont restées intactes : une « voix » si « humaine », vulnérable mais finalement étonnement vigoureuse...","['La voix humaine', 'Cocteau', 'Poulenc', 'théâtre', 'opéra', 'musique', 'littérature', 'mémoire', 'musico-littéraire']"

Looking into the difference of strategies held at the national and local level with their degrees of influence and impact of peoples’ daily life. This research focuses on the developed mechanism and framing for integration in France through three distinct governments under the presidency of Valérie Giscard d'Estaing and François Mitterrand. Through diving into parliamentary debates analysis, emerged different framing based on political perception of immigration, integration, racism, exclusion, hatred and policy strategies. While research carried at a local level focused more on social mobilisation and inclusivity to develop a frontal and pacific confrontation to hatred, racism and exclusion. To carry out this study, online and physical archival material documents were selected. The doors of ‘SOS Racisme’ were for the second time in their history open for research. Based on archival material, this study outlined that governance mechanism and different framing elevated at a national and local level of governmentality were different. It was found that due to a lack of understanding and physical exclusion of migrant population, a gap between communities was created. With the election of F. Mitterrand as President, new strategies for integration were develop and laid ground for social mobilisation to form. Hence, leading to a bottom-top approach and new means of understanding for a more fundamental perception of national wide diversity and integration strategies.",

The Dutch East India Company's Textile Trade between Coromandel and Makassar during the Eighteenth Century,"Prabu, Rohit","['Gommans, Jos J.L.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"The aim of this thesis is to study the intra-Asian textile trade of the Dutch East India Company (De Verenigde Oost Indische Compagnie, hereafter VOC) between the VOC’s establishment in the Coromandel region in the southeastern coast of India and the VOC’s regional establishment at Makassar on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia during the eighteenth century. This thesis focusses primarily on the commercial dynamics of the VOC’s trade in Coromandel textiles to Makassar. The core of the thesis is built upon the trade analysis of the distribution of Coromandel textiles by the VOC in Makassar during the eighteenth century on the basis of the richness of the VOC’s bookkeeping records. The study aims to give an account of the different textile varieties the VOC traded in and the underlying rationale that governed the VOC’s commercial policy of trading in specific categories of Coromandel textiles. Therefore, this study also negotiates the modalities of the VOC’s policy that informed the trade in Coromandel textiles to Makassar during the eighteenth century. The study is situated within the realm of growing literature on the intra-Asian trade of the VOC and hopes to make a contribution to the existing historiographical discourse on the intra-Asian textile trade of the VOC.","['Dutch East India Company (VOC)', 'Trade', 'Textiles', 'Eighteenth Century']"

The objective of this research project is to evaluate how South Africans feel about English, 26 years since the inception of democracy in the country, its role in education, governance and business, and the value they assign to language status. Ten South Africans between the ages of 17 and 65 from the main ethnicities in the country (Black, White, Coloured, Indian, Muslim) have been interviewed according to a semi-structured Interview Protocol. The attitudes of the younger speakers were compared to those that were born in previous generations, before democracy. The phonological properties of the participants’ speech were recorded within the BATH, KIT and GOOSE vowel spaces which have been identified as important social markers in South Africa and the South African English (SAE) sound. The participants pronunciations across the ethnic and social class spectrum were evaluated. The interviews and phonological recordings were conducted according to an elicited communications methodology (computer-mediated) using WhatsApp, Skype and Facebook. The participant attitudes were coded into six categories, i.e. positive, negative, perceptiveness, awareness, overcompensation, political correctness. Their vowel recordings were analysed according to its place of articulation and the presence of fronting. The participants displayed an innate positive attitude toward SAE and its role in stimulating future progress in the country.","['Language attitudes', 'macrolinguistics', 'sociolinguistics', 'social identity', 'phonology', 'vowel articulation', 'pronunciation', 'socio-phonetics', 'accent', 'dialect', 'South African English (SAE)', 'World Englishes', 'qualitative data', 'open-coding', 'grounded theory']"

Scholars have often assessed the work and its author very negatively: they claimed the work had no moral message, that it was badly written, and that Guido was very misogynistic in his depiction of women. In this thesis, the Historia will be analysed intertextually to show that Guido was not a bad translator of the French Roman de Troie (his main point of focus), but that he played with his pre-text to create an original work of history with its own moral aims and messages. In the second chapter, a case study of the character of the Amazonian queen Penthesilea will show how learned and complexly constructed the work actually is. Penthesilea questions the traditional gender norms, showing that not all women are bad in Guido's work. By transcending these gender norms, she is able to question a social construct that is even more important to reform in Guido's eyes: chivalry and its intricate connection with warfare. Guido wishes to show that chivalry has no place in warfare and that eventually, war brings destruction and misery upon all. While reading this work, the reader is constantly invited to delve further into the material and extract valuable moral lessons from it.","['Troy', 'Middle Ages', 'Literature', 'Chivalry', 'Gender', 'Guido delle Colonne', 'Penthesilea', 'Benoît de Sainte-Maure']"

Large numbers of its Dutch East Indies Muslim colonial subjects made the pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina every year. The Indies colonial authorities were bent on controlling and regulating this journey in an effort to control the pilgrims themselves. Especially because Mecca was suspected of being the centre of an anti-colonial conspiracy in the eyes of some officials like the Delft professor and journalist Salomon Keyzer and the Dutch consul at Jeddah J.A. Kruijt . A good working relationship with the authorities of Mecca and Medina and by extent the whole of the Hijaz would certainly help to achieve this. By 1927 this relationship was apparently very good. How did this come to be? The main question of this master thesis will be: how did the different Dutch consuls and Dutch East Indies civil servants perceive the political developments on the Arabian peninsula in the period 1918-1930? I will argue that the observations and conclusions of these two groups, the Jeddah consuls and the Dutch East Indies civil servants, were to a very large extent determined by two different and contrary streams in Dutch colonial philosophy: the ‘ethical school’ and a conservative reaction to this ‘school’.","['Imperialism', 'Interbellum', 'Ideology']"

Tales from famous African explorers like Henry Morton Stanley and David Livingstone gave the impression of a dark and wild continent as opposed to the orderly and civilized Europe. In the early imperialistic period of Africa, European powers tried to implement their notion of nature to their colonial territories. That is to say, a strict division between what is considered nature and what is considered not. Through (neo)colonial ties a fabrication of nature has developed and affected the Sub-Saharan African landscape for more than 150 years. Colonial imposition of European ideas like the European hunting tradition, the Romantic notions about nature, imposition of economic development and wildlife conservation all had a lasting impact on the African continent. By means of colonization, but also long afterwards, Sub-Saharan Africa has thus been highly influenced by old Western notions about Africa's nature. This thesis sets out to discuss how the Western philosophy of the relation between human and nature has dominated and continues to dominate many places in Africa as Western conceptions of what nature is and what it is not are seemingly still present to this day and age.","['Colonial History', 'Africa', 'East-Africa', 'Wildlife conservation', 'The Garden of Eden', 'Dark Africa', 'Hunting', 'National Park', 'Noble Savage', 'Bernard Grzimek', 'NGO', 'Decolonization']"

Remediatiestrategieën van Nederlandse nieuwsmedia: Een onderzoek naar aanpassingen bij omzetting artikel van website naar Facebookpagina,"Essers, Eva","['Opgenhaffen, M.P.A.', 'Pleijter, A.R.J.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Nieuwsmedia plaatsen tegenwoordig hun nieuws op allerlei platformen. Onder andere op een eigen nieuwswebsite, en op sociale mediakanalen. Deze platformen verschillen in medialogica. Zo hebben ze een verschillend publiek dat op een andere manier nieuws tot zich neemt, maar ook een andere interface waar nieuws anders op wordt gepresenteerd. Het is belangrijk om hiermee rekening te houden bij het plaatsen van nieuwsartikelen. Zo blijkt uit eerder onderzoek dat journalisten elementen van het nieuwsartikel aanpassen, zoals de titel en foto (Nijdam, 2019). Vormelijke en inhoudelijke aanpassingen doen bij het plaatsen van content van het ene naar het andere platform heet remediatie. In deze studie zijn deze zogenaamde remediatiestrategieën bestudeerd, aan de hand van een inhoudsanalyse van online nieuwsartikelen en Facebookposts van Nederlandse nieuwsmedia. Hierbij wordt er onderzocht of er een verschil is tussen de aanpak van regionale en nationale kranten. De resultaten van dit onderzoek tonen aan dat er over het algemeen vaker geen aanpassingen worden gedaan dan wel, bij het plaatsen van een artikel van de website naar de Facebookpagina. Ook zijn er een aantal trends te ontdekken in aanpassingen onder alle kranten. Een sterk verschil tussen regionale en nationale kranten werd niet gevonden. Wel verschilt de individuele aanpak van de nationale kranten vaker sterker van de rest. Zo is De Volkskrant de enige krant die vaker titels aanpast dan niet, terwijl het NRC juist het minst van alle kranten hun titels aanpast.","['sociale media', 'online nieuws', 'Facebook', 'nieuwskoppen', 'remediatie']"

Er wordt betoogd dat rond de omwenteling van september 1787 in de gehele Republiek orangistische burgers de politiek al dan niet met geweld probeerden te beïnvloeden, en dat zij daartoe werden gemotiveerd door de overtuiging dat de welvaart en vrijheid van de Republiek alleen kon worden hersteld als de stadhouder zonder tegenstand zijn taak als beschermer van de Nederlandse vrijheid kon uitvoeren. In Holland verzetten orangistische burgers zich in aanloop naar de omwenteling tegen de overwegend patriotse stedelijke regeringen en vrijkorpsen, daarbij geleid door Oranjegezinde regenten als W.G.F. Bentinck van Rhoon. Na de omwenteling vond een tweedeling plaats tussen orangisten die een gematigde restauratie voorstonden en orangisten die geloofden dat de Republiek alleen écht gered kon worden door alle patriotten uit het openbare leven te verwijderen. Omdat de stadhouder en de herstelde stadsregeringen de gematigde koers voorstonden, kwamen radicale orangistische burgers in verschillende steden tegenover hen te staan. Verstoken van regentensteun en in bedwang gehouden door het leger kon de orangistische burgerbeweging haar eisen echter niet afdwingen. Hoewel het protest van orangistische burgers in de loop van 1788 verstomde, beïnvloedde het de politieke besluitvorming, waardoor regeringsveranderingen en ontslaggolven vaak radicaler uitvielen dan de stadhouder zelf had gehoopt. De acties van orangistische burgers in 1788 laten eveneens zien dat zij geenszins werden aangestuurd door regenten maar juist op eigen initiatief handelden, uit overtuiging dat herstel de verwijdering van álle patriotten vereiste.","['orangisme', 'patriotten', 'orangisten', 'Bentinck', 'Willem V', 'prinsgezind', 'burgers', 'wetsverzetting', 'Oranjesociëteit', 'Oprechte Vaderlandse Sociëteit']"

The deeply torn and racially divided region of Southern Africa would become his administration’s stage to illustrate their moralistic foreign policy which was based on the promotion of human rights. Whereas Carter’s commitment to human rights was motivated by his personal experiences during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, his National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was led by strategic considerations which could advance the American position in the Cold War. These conflicting approaches to a human rights policy resulted in a vague, often hypocritical, and quickly shifting policy, which started with a strong moral undertone and focus on human rights, yet ended with economic and strategic considerations as the top priorities of the administration. Through its in-depth analysis of primary sources, this study has sought to research the change in the Carter administration’s human rights policy towards South Africa, thereby also discussing the general changes within the foundations of the administration’s foreign policy.","['American foreign policy', 'human rights', 'Jimmy Carter', 'Zbigniew Brzezinski', 'South Africa', 'apartheid', 'racism']"

S. van der Steen'],2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Bij seksuele hervorming in Nederland denken maar weinig mensen aan de Zedenwetten van 1911. Het begrip hervorming is voor velen verbonden aan het idee van progressie. Maar vóór de Eerste Wereldoorlog stond seksuele hervorming gelijk aan het criminaliseren van prostitutie, voorbehoedsmiddelen en homoseksualiteit. Vanaf 1911 liep Nederland met haar sobere Zedenwetten nog voor op de rest van Europa, om een decennium later juist ouderwets aan te doen. Seksuele hervorming is een fluïde concept en historisch onderzoek naar seksuele hervormingsinitiatieven in Nederland tijdens de eerste helft van de twintigste eeuw is versnipperd en onvolledig. Dit heeft ertoe geleid dat de meest progressieve vereniging uit de geschiedschrijving verdween. De Nederlandse Vereniging voor Seksuele Hervorming (NVSH) werd in 1932 opgericht als onderdeel van een internationaal netwerk dat verregaande sociale en seksuele verandering wilde bewerkstelligen. Zo zette de vereniging zich in voor de acceptatie van homoseksualiteit, abortus en gelijke rechten voor vrouwen. Deze scriptie analyseert hoe de hervormers van de NVSH hun boodschap aan de Nederlandse samenleving probeerde over te brengen en hoe de interne dynamiek van de vereniging hun missie beïnvloedde.","['Seksuele hervorming', 'NVSH', 'Nederlandse Vereniging voor Seksuele Hervorming', 'Interbellum', '1914-1940', 'Homoseksualiteit', 'Anticonceptie', 'Prostitutie', 'Politieke seksuele hervorming', 'Bernard Premsela', 'Magnus Hirschfield', 'Mathilde Wibaut - Berdenis van Berlekom', 'Florentinus Wibaut', 'Vrouwelijke seksualiteit', 'Vrouwelijk orgasme', 'Zedenwetten 1911', 'Nancy Tuana', 'Onwetendheid']"

INVESTIGATING THE CHALLENGES PEOPLE WITH ALBINISM FACE IN TANZANIA,"Beaumont, Blanca",['Karen Smith'],2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This study investigates the existing and remaining challenges in regard to the protection of people with albinism (PWA) in Tanzania. Unfortunately, this is a controversial subject, one which has been widely broached in international news and rather less so in the academic literature. In order to conduct this research, a qualitative newspaper and academic peer-reviewed literature analysis has been applied using Tanzania as a case study for albinism in the African continent. Moreover, data will be collected from reports, websites, secondary sources of qualitative nature and primary sources such as interviews of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), especially UTSS, which has played a role in attempting to help people with albinism. Beliefs in witchcraft still remains prevalent in the modern society of Tanzania, and constitute challenges to the protection of PWA. Indeed, this is the first factor that hinders the protection of the human rights of PWA, when researching their stigmatization and the perpetuated violence they suffer. Now going beyond the issue of witchcraft beliefs and other cultural aspects such as the process of othering, this thesis will address other challenges. For instance, poverty can be an incentive for amputation or murder of PWA, as there is an existing black market for buying and selling body parts of PWA. In addition to the aspect of poverty, this thesis will also address the challenge of corruption, and how corruption affects legal prosecutions of the perpetuators. Ultimately, the author will elaborate on notions of human rights, as these are not yet fully endorsed on all levels of analysis, referring to the international sphere, regional and lastly national.",
Identity & Law: The conflict between the Liberal Democracy and the Salafi Identity,"Leeuw, Aurora de","['Verbeek, B.J.E.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"Within the Dutch liberal democracy, a political as well as fundamental tension can be felt between the liberal democracy and Islam. One of the legal examples that can be offered in relation to the tension between the liberal democracy and Islam, is the “Temporary Law on Counterterrorism Administrative Measures"". This temporary law was put into place in order to fight threats of (Muslim) terrorism, by making it possible to (among other administrative measures) restrict the freedom of movement of a person through an area ban and / or travel ban based on the possible threat they can become, given their religious beliefs and actions (the fear of radicalisation). The question is where to draw the line between protecting society in relation to national security and restricting one’s freedom, based on religious beliefs that go against (some of) the principles of the liberal democracy. The main question of this thesis will therefore be the following: Is it justified for a liberal democracy to enforce administrative sanctions upon its citizens, based on their religious identity? In discussing the place of religion (and religious identity) within the liberal democracy, I will focus on four different approaches: the communitarian consensus, state neutrality, the human nature approach and the overlapping consensus approach. I will argue that none of these approaches offer a justified answer to how Salafi citizens can coexist peacefully with others while living according to the principles of liberal democracy. I will argue, however, that the inability of the Salafi identity to coexist with the ideals of the liberal democracy, does not necessarily justify state interference (by enforcing sanctions upon the Salafi citizens). It is important to look at the actions that follow from ones identity, in order to judge if state interference is justified. Following the three groups identified by Wiktorowicz in his “Anatomy of the Salafi Movement”, I will argue that the state is not allowed to act against purists, the state can use administrative measures to restrict politicos and is allowed to use both administrative as well as criminal measures against jihadis.","['Liberal Democracy', 'Salafism', 'Identity']"

Mainly using Dutch maps, plans and reports, this paper studies how Dutch knowledge of hydraulic engineering was reflected in their construction projects in the wet tropical Guianas. It examines the construction processes, structure and layout of canals, plantations, fortifications and towns. The hydraulic engineering of these projects is compared to practices in the Netherlands, Europe and European colonies, to determine whether it was as typically Dutch and unique as scholars often assume. The paper concludes that although the construction projects were planned in such a way that these fit well with the wet natural environment of the Guianas, the hydraulic engineering was neither unique nor typically Dutch. Instead, the projects resembled practices in other European colonies more closely than Dutch practices. The hydraulic engineering was therefore not the result of Dutch experience in water management, but rather the result of the environment of Essequibo and Demerara that forced the British, French and Dutch inhabitants to adapt to it.","['Essequibo', 'Demerara', 'Guyana', 'Environmental history', 'Hydraulic engineering', 'Construction', 'Water management', 'Heneman', 'Plantations', 'Canals', 'Forts', '18th century', 'WIC', 'Dutch West India Company']"

Institutionalizing Tax Transparency: A Constructivist Institutionalist analysis of Country-by-Country Reporting in the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project,"Rossum, Martin van","['Valk, J.H.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis argues that the international tax policy community is open to new ideas in times of crisis. However, in the development of an idea into policy, it is seriously weakened. Institutional norms and vested business interests have a strong conservative role in tax politics. Civil society activists fight for transparency of the practices of multinational companies in order to achieve fairer taxation. They successfully advocated a system of Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR), where companies have to report for each country they are active in. The idea was incorporated in the 2013-2015 OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project. The global financial crisis and tax haven scandals helped galvanize political change. Previous research focusing on state actors and rational power politics cannot account for this unlikely underdog victory. Using public documents, this study traces the development of CbCR in the BEPS Project. It highlights the strong role of a global elite that is open to new ideas to legitimize its leadership of global tax policy. The OECD functions to depoliticize the process into technical discussions, where institutional norms and business interests dominate. The resulting weakened version of CbCR was implemented globally. This thesis provides an insight in the closed, though not impenetrable, bastion of international tax policy making and its mechanisms of change.","['OECD', 'country-by-country reporting', 'CbCR', 'constructivist institutionalism', 'BEPS', 'Base Erosion and Profit Shifting']"

Dehegemonizing The Feminist Discourse: Comparing the Discourse Analyses of International Development Organisations and Moroccan Women’s NGOs,"Arancio, Carolina","['Strava, C.+ Taha, H.H.M.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to examine the various discursive approaches utilised by development organisations which work to ameliorate the status of women both globally and locally. In particular, the thesis compares the discourse analyses of international development organisations and Moroccan women's NGOs in order to identify recurrent terminologies and discrepancies in their construction of a feminist narrative. The results of the discourse analyses allow to further focus on the link between discourse, gender and hegemony by assessing whether the comparison demonstrates the presence of a prevailing feminist discourse on an ideological and linguistic level. In fact, the initial influence of international organisations in the development of Moroccan women’s NGOs has caused the presence of analogous nodal points definable as the transnational feminist language. Nevertheless, through the reformulation of the transnational language, the use of locally bounded nodal points, as well as through the unuse of the notion of empowerment Moroccan women’s NGOs have developed an independent and flexible strategy in constructing their feminist narrative which is increasingly overcoming the international tendency of hegemonizing the feminist discourse. Moreover, the semantic individuality elaborated by Moroccan women’s NGOs can be crucial to increase the participation of the principal receivers of their projects: hence, Moroccan women.","['Discourse analysis', 'gender equality', ""Moroccan women's NGOs"", 'international development organisations', 'hegemony']"

Through an analysis of the debates on British entry to the EEC that took place at the British Trades Union Congresses of 1970 and 1971, this thesis uses verbatim historical exchanges between trade union delegates to investigate the following. Firstly, the range of opinions held by various trade unionists from both those in favour and against British entry, in the face of the tendency to view organised labour as generally united in its views. Secondly, whether or not, in arriving at their views on the European Question, trade union representatives privileged economic arguments relating to the future living standards of their members and ideas relating to how industrial relations would operate in the EEC or whether broader political considerations actually proved more prominent. Finally, whether any link existed between a union’s stance on entry and whether it represented white-collar or blue-collar British workers or whether the fact that their members worked in domestically-focused sectors or export-oriented industries was more important.","['Trades Union Congress', 'Trade unions', 'United Kingdom', 'UK Parliament', 'EEC membership']"

The annexation of Crimea: A Neoclassical Realist Approach,"Krivka, Eva","['Gerrits, André']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Both scholars and politicians struggle to understand how the decision was made to go ahead with the annexation and for what reasons. Some scholars argue that Russia decided to annex Crimea because of its importance as “the spiritual source” of the Russian nation, others state that Russia’s historical claim to the peninsula was the reason for the annexation (Russia possessed it until 1954 when the Soviet leadership transferred it to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic). Another group claims it was a purely strategic decision since it allowed Russia to increase its military capabilities by taking over most of the Ukrainian Black See Fleet and that this was just the start of president Putin’s great power restoration campaign . Most of the explanations are rooted in either the realist theory that revolves around power maximisation and self-interest or the constructivist theory that focusses on norms and identities. This thesis will build on the realist explanations for the annexation of Crimea, by introducing an analysis through the understudied Type III neoclassical realist theory (NCR), coined by Ripsman, Taliafero and Lobell in their book ‘Neoclassical Realist Theory of International Politics’. The neoclassical realist theory used in this research recognises that a system-only explanation is insufficient and therefore combines systemic variables with unit-level variables in attempting to explain foreign policy choices. This thesis build on the realist explanations for the annexation of Crimea, by introducing an analysis through the understudied Type III neoclassical realist theory (NCR), coined by Ripsman, Taliafero and Lobell in their book ‘Neoclassical Realist Theory of International Politics’. The neoclassical realist theory used in this research recognises that a system-only explanation is insufficient and therefore combines systemic variables with unit-level variables in attempting to explain foreign policy choices. This thesis determined if the four intervening variables neoclassical realism type III identified (e.g. leader images, strategic culture, state-society relations and domestic political institutions) affected the manner in which Russia responded to certain external stimuli (geography, military technology, distribution of power, polarity of the international system, clarity of the international system and the nature of state’s strategic environment) that lead to the annexation of Crimea. This thesis found that a state's strategic environment contributed most significantly to the decision to annex Crimea, because without the political turmoil going on within Ukraine it would have been unlikely that Russia would have succeeded. The research also found that the intervening variables of leader image and strategic culture played a part in the decision making process. Even though the strategic culture helped to gain acceptance among society, it was the leader image that was most influential in shaping the ultimate decision. In the case of Russia and Crimea, it is very clear that president Putin was the actor that made the annexation a reality.","['Annexation', 'Crimea', 'Russia', 'Putin', 'Ukraine', 'Systemic Stimuli', 'Intervening Variables', 'Neoclassical Realism']"

Moral Rights for Ecosystems,"Linssen, Nathalie",['T. Meijers'],2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"Value in nature has often been studied from two perspectives, either externally or internally. Schools of intrinsic value like deep ecology have been found extreme in the past, their implications undesirable to humans. External perspectives like anthropocentric value judgements, for example ecosystem-service arguments, or considerations of intergenerational justice have become increasingly common and well researched. However, this thesis starts from the observation that anthropocentric value based morality does little to protect ecosystems for their own sake. Instead, it merely focuses on those parts that either appeal, service, or otherwise are useful to humans. It is especially this perception of ecosystems that lies at the root of current and past exploitation of the ecosystem. The result is nearly irreversible damage to the ecosystem. This thesis argues for pro tanto moral rights for the ecosystem, on the basis of interest-based moral considerability. I will show that previous arguments for or against the moral considerability of nature lack sufficient knowledge of ecological processes. If ecological processes are properly understood, the ecosystem can be said to have an interest. This interest, or wellbeing, is the striving towards homeostasis. This means that the ecosystem has moral considerability and is a moral patient. It is therefore eligible for moral rights. These rights-relations occur between moral agents and moral patient when there is contact. This will be explained through developing the Contact-Theory.","['environmental ethics', 'environmental rights', 'moral rights', 'wellbeing', 'moral considerability', 'ecosystem rights', 'interest', 'homeostasis', 'deep ecology', 'non-anthropocentrism', 'anthropocentrism', 'rights-relations', 'Hohfeld', 'moral agent', 'moral patient', 'contact-theory', 'value']"
Intangible Cultural Heritage Designation in South Korea: Reconstruction and Transmission of Salpuri-dance through Living Cultural Treasure Lee Eun-Joo,"Hinsberg, Maari","['Paskaleva, Elena']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The adversity of heritage designation is one of the major topics discussed in the critical heritage discourse. Enlistment can become a competition, establishing a hierarchy for heritage based on evaluation. The system is structured on exclusion, giving indeterminate criteria of values to phenomena to decontextualize its immediate surroundings and recontextualize them in reference to previous listings with the purpose of profit and attention to the notion of safeguarding. Especially in enlisting performative practices as intangible heritage properties, a problem can be seen in recording a fixed, standardized form of the performance in a certain moment in time. Following researchers responsible for providing descriptions in order to enlist properties, emphasis is placed rather on artistic aspects than on tracing original functionality and development. Well-intentioned but restrictive preservation efforts can result in shaping vibrant performative practices into “stale, taxidermized re-enactments” or highly staged performances. The repetition of a standard form is established in the process of nomination, fixed in designation, and consolidated and conveyed in transmission. Salpuri-chum, a spiritually functional dance, has been encapsulated in temporal stylistic descriptions and adapted to be performed by highly trained professional dancers for foremost representative and promotional purposes as a distinct display of Korean traditional culture.","['intangible heritage', 'folk dance', 'transmission', 'invention of tradition', 'heritage designation', 'heritagization', 'commodification', 'performance', 'nationalism']"

Oppa didn’t mean it: Examining parasocial interaction and social responsibility in K-pop fandom,"Herbrink, Kayleigh","['Breuker, Remco']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"K-pop has gained global recognition on a previously unknown level. K-pop artists are flying out to locations on every continent for events and concerts and are met with legions of adoring fans. Despite the language barrier and culture-difference, these fans feel nothing but understanding and excitement upon interaction with their favourite band. But the rise to the global stage has not been without obstacles. When the eyes of the world are on you, that means one is subjected to a myriad of cultural perspectives, many of which will inevitably clash with your own. In this scenario, cultural faux passes, or worse, are inevitable. Global fans, confronted with these instances, have reacted in various ways, ranging from witch hunts to blind defense. Knowing they have global fans should have made them more aware, is one of the sentiments, whereas another vocal group points out that perhaps cultural differences are to blame. Based on a review of the theory of parasocial interaction by Horton and Wohl (1956), two surveys were conducted. A quantitative survey was conducted among 328 respondents in the period of April 2020 to May 2020. Following the emergence of K-pop as a hot topic during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, a list of 15 open-ended questions was distributed in June 2020 among 26 respondents to gain more qualitative commentary to function as contrast and illustration to the survey’s results. Results showed a disconnect between the real-life experiences of the participants of the qualitative survey, and the numerical results of the quantitative survey, with the first suggesting a high level of parasocial attachment, and the latter a negligible level. Most important is the clear outcome that fans demand social action from their idols in return for their emotional labour as fans, as illustrated by the events involving K-pop fans during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Further research is needed to fully reconcile the results, and keep an eye on the development of K-pop and its fandom among social movements.","['k-pop', 'fandom studies', 'parasocial', 'black lives matter', 'korean idols', 'social responsibility', 'fan labour']"

Oral-photographic narratives: other perspectives on Indisch-ness,"Brugge, Jacklyn Frida","['Engelenhoven, Aone van']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis considers Indisch-ness (a state of Indisch belongingness) as a phenomenon of cultural consciousness that is exhibited and communicated through word of mouth. Eurocentric historiographies, the silencing by the first-generation, and misperceptions of cultural definitions are a few reasons why defining Indisch-ness will remain problematic and incomplete. After identifying the gaps in the literature on Indo-European identity, the investigation draws attention to the experimental nature of combining oral-photographic interviewing with photographic poetry research. The aim is to demonstrate how the (artistic) narrative transmissions of second and third-generation descendants can portray the individual experience of Indisch-ness. Narratives can be thought of as world recreations, a tool for revisiting the inaccessible past. As Indisch-ness is generally understood as a feeling of belongingness, the photographs involved rather became mnemonic pieces of evidence of their interpreted cultural unity. Therefore, this paper further explores the semiotics of sign recognition in common cultural representations as well. Although Indisch-ness remains largely indefinable, this study suggests a method to capture the narrative environment of the Indisch world in Dutch society.","['Indisch', 'Indo-European identity', 'photographic poetry', 'oral-photographic', 'world recreation', 'narrative transmissions', 'narratological analysis', 'Indisch-ness', 'semiotics']"

Apesar de avanços significativos no ativismo afro-brasileiro e feminista, a questão do lugar social da mulher afro-brasileira fica sendo um ponto atual e pertinente.

Para estudar o ativismo artístico que ambas produzem, a presente pesquisa se enfoca na obra literária Poemas da recordação e outros movimentos (2008) e na exposição A costura da memória (2018). Ambas obras, de maneira crítica, questionam o lugar da mulher negra na sociedade brasileira. Conceição Evaristo é conhecida pelas publicações em Cadernos Negros e da escrevivência. Rosana Paulino é artista visual e se enfoca nas questões sociais, étnicas e de gênero (Paulino). O estudo de caso é original, pois, acrescenta ao debate o uso do conceito lugar de fala, proposto por Djamila Ribeiro. Além disso, o estudo é altamente atual: a situação política no Brasil exige a importância de entender essas vozes.

Where the roads meet: Understanding Sino-European relations through the lens of the Belt and Road Initiative,"Giua, Luciano Mr.",['Lindsay Black'],2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"China and Europe have significantly expanded their economic relations in recent years. However, this cooperation has developed at a slower pace in the political realm. Both actors expressed their willingness to translate their economic ties into a “strategic partnership” which will allow China and Europe to represent more of a building blocks in the international system. The main narrative in the EU-China literature is that China and Europe are too ideologically distant and thus, they will never achieve a strong partnership that goes beyond economic cooperation. Moreover, the literature presents China as an assertive actor that is looking outward just to gain economic and political advantages and the sympathy of like-minded countries. It is not a surprise that when in March 2019 the Italian government decided to join China in the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), The US and other major European countries have highly criticized Italy’s naïveté. Contributing to critical scholarship, this thesis engages in constructivist theory to analyse the different identities and normative drivers underlying European and Chinese BRI discourse. This thesis argues that European and Chinese identities are not fixed concepts and since the establishment of the BRI, Europe and China have presented themselves with divergent identities. This thesis aimed to provide an answer to the question why, and to what extent, Italian participation in the BRI proves that, despite some important normative differences that underline EU-China relations, in reality, EU members can overcome this identity clash and engage in a constructive dialogue with China that is neither detrimental nor dangerous for the EU. This thesis offers a contribution to the realist dominated BRI literature by outlining the constructivist forces that shape EU-China relations.

The Complexity of Alliance Formation: Variations in State Responses in the Middle East to the First Gulf War,"Visser, Andrea Anastasia","['Calculli, Marina']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Despite the fact that Middle Eastern states tend to align in loose and informal ways, rather than form formal alliances with each other, scholars have attempted to apply Western-centric theories on alliance formation in the Middle East. This thesis highlights the limits of Western-centric theories when applied on non-Western regions. In doing so, this thesis focuses on one crucial non-Western region, the Middle East, and asks if the leading Western-centric alliance formation theories (balance-of threat, balance-ofpower and ideological solidarity) can explain the alignments made in the Middle East during the First Gulf War, if so to what extent, and if not what an alternative could be. It researches this question through the systematic exploration of one topical moment of Middle East contemporary history, which caused major regional realignment in the region: The First Gulf War in 1990. The findings of the case study, show that seven of the eight states considered in the case study had to balance the external threat (of Iraq threatening the status quo after invading Kuwait) as well as internal threats (of public unrest, economic difficulties and diminishment of their leadership position in the region). Therefore, this thesis will argue that the balance-of-power, balance-of-threat and ideological solidarity theories cannot explain alignment formation in the Middle East in their current form, as these theories only take external threats into account. Only if the balance-of-threat theory is expanded to include internal threats as well as external threats may it explain the formation of alignments in the Middle East during the First Gulf War. The ‘regime security’ approach of Ryan is, therefore, considered to be a suitable alternative approach, as it examines ruling regimes and their insecurities, considering external as well as internal threats. Nevertheless, this approach needs to be expanded as well, in order to include the external influence coercive diplomacy and the use of multiple strategies have on state behaviour of other states. Every state was externally influenced through these strategies, leading them to join the U.N. coalition or declare neutrality with large repercussions. This has not been discussed in alliance formation literature before. Finally, the strategies balancing and bandwagoning need to be revised as well as the definitions do not hold up in a coalition, especially regarding the Middle East where states have large differences in military capabilities.","['Alliance formation', 'The Middle East', 'First Gulf War']"
Alcoholism in South Korea and Japan: An Evaluation and Comparison of Factors Influencing Alcohol Use,"Pronk, Laura","['Breuker, R.E.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Overconsumption of alcohol is detrimental to one's health, and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, Korea has the highest amount of alcohol consumption per capita in all of Asia, and has notably high rates of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs). The neighbouring country of Japan is similar to Korea in numerous ways, but has significantly lower rates of consumption and AUDs. This poses the question in which ways Japan differs from Korea, and whether they tackle alcoholism in more effective ways. This thesis aims to find ways in which Korea could improve the current situation following the example of a similar country Therefore, both societies are compared by critically analysing secondary literature on factors that affect alcohol consumption: culture, age of onset, availability, affordability, mental health, religion, and restrictive measures. Results show that while both societies heavily emphasize alcohol consumption, Korea could learn from Japan's attention to mental health research and development, and wider variety of sobriety groups. However, any conclusive evidence is yet to be found. More extensive and longitudinal research on this subject is therefore necessary.","['Alcoholism', 'South Korea', 'Japan', 'Mental health', 'AUD', 'Drinking culture', 'Age of onset', 'Religion', 'Sobriety groups', 'Alcohol policy']"

This article mainly argues that, even though we are getting in touch with cultural products such as video games that contain the mixture of global cultures, what attracts most of the people is the ‘exoticism’; which indicates that what seems to erase or blur cultural borders in a globalized world is actually enlarge and emphasize on the cultural differences. By carefully analyzing four otome games that based their stories outside Japan, this article shows how most of the foreign elements are used 'exteriorly' in these Japanese products. The article ends up with an elaboration on similar cases in other cultural aspects, which indicates that the chase of exoticism is rather common all over the world. It is difficult to be certain of whether the cultural gap under globalization is narrower and wider than before, but instead of the convergence, the diversity of cultures is probably more emphasized in the contemporary world.","['Globalization', 'Otome-game', 'Exoticism', 'Glocalization', 'Japanese culture']"
21st Century Territorial Conflict: An Intricate Affair,"Kirk, Ian","['Van der Maat, Eelco']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Interstate territorial conflict has seen a sharp downward trend since the end of the Cold War. This same trend has continued for claim militarization in general. However, the overall number of states since the end of the World War Two has grown. More territorial disputes have come with the increasing number of states but not increasing military conflict over those disputes. This phenomenon is seen as a consequence of a lack of acceptance in the idea of conquest between states and the creation of the Territorial Integrity Norm. The overall trend has continued into the 21st Century but some fatal interstate territorial conflicts do still occur. This thesis asks, what leads to fatal interstate territorial conflict in the 21st Century (2002-2016) despite a strong trend away from fatal conflict over territory between states and how effective is fatal force? A comparative case study examining four fatal territorial conflicts that occurred within the timeline attempts to address this by analyzing the interaction of factors that lead up to a fatal event. It also explores the outcome of such action. This thesis finds that fatal action is the result of a complex interplay of domestic motives and a lack of external costs. When force is used, its effectiveness to assert control over disputed territory is limited but force can be effective in reigniting stalled diplomatic negotiations.","['Territorial Conflict', 'Case Study', 'Force Effectiveness']"

Hong Kildong in North Korea: Entertainment and Ideology in the Cinema,"Linden, Maria van der","['Breuker, Remco']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis closely examines the North Korean film Hong Kildong, which is a film adaptation from 1986, based on the tale of Hong Kildong. It then compares the film version with a pre-modern literary version of Hong Kildong Chŏn. The research field of North Korean cinema lacked a nuanced deconstruction of the ideological message conveyed in Hong Kildong. Consideration of the background motifs and themes was found to be generally overlooked. This thesis aims to provide for this lack. By analyzing the North Korean film version, while using the Confucian Five Moral Relationships and virtues as a yardstick, this thesis identified how close the story followed or deviated from the Confucian ethics. The comparison between Hong Kildong (film) and Hong Kildong Chŏn (pre-modern fiction) pointed out what (ideological) changes had been made, changes mostly found in the character traits and the development of the storyline towards the end of each story, and helped to identify Juche ideological elements. Through the hypothesis, “Hong Kildong reflects the same ideological changes as have been made to create the yunsaek type kodae sosŏl,” I was able to lend credit to the implications that come with the ideological changes I detected, since they then do not apply merely to this film. My research results confirmed that the hypothesis was indeed correct. Art theory in North Korea has taken on a unified form which is broadly applied to every artistic activity, including both film and literary adaptations of pre-modern works of fiction. The same ideological development can be discerned in both types of adaptation. The central theme, or “seed,” of Hong Kildong can be defined as the revolutionary transformation from the old, corrupt Chosŏn society to the new, liberated Chosŏn, which is promised to those who move towards the sun, which is symbolism for Kim Il-Sung and his Juche thought. Elements that suggest ideas contrary to Juche ideology were consistently found within the realm of Confucian thought. Confucian thought however was not condoned, nor completely condemned in the film, but rather improved to make a smooth transformation to Juche ideology possible. This suggests that Confucian thought remains, however limited, a component in the North Korean people’s belief system. However, hidden elements that reflect anti-Juche or anti-Party Line thoughts, which might have been an influence of Shin Sang-Ok’s own ideas, could not be found.","['Hong Kildong', 'Confucian ethics', 'North Korean cinema', 'ideological art']"

Understanding the causes of the underdevelopment in the Nigerian part of the Lake Chad Basin,"Zijlstra, Jan Haaye","['Smith, Karen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The people of the Lake Chad Basin area have been suffering under long periods of violence and bad governance. On top of these problems the region has historically had a lower GDP per person than the rest of Nigeria, which is linked to a vulnerability to civil war. These issues have received much attention over the years, but little progress has been made in developing the region. State presence is low, with local governments abandoning the basin because of the threat of Boko Haram. This thesis argues that how three institutions, the government, Boko Haram, and the traditional authorities interact with each other is at the core of the lack of progress in breaking the vicious cycle of underdevelopment in the Nigerian part of the Lake Chad Basin. For a while the Nigerian state made little effort to assert its hegemony over the Lake Chad Basin. However, neglect of this area gave space to other groups to assert themselves. Nigeria did not feel the need to assert its control over the region because they were not dependent on that area. The discovery of oil which coincided with Nigerian independence made the federal government less reliant on tax income from the northern state which meant there was little to gain for the federal government in the Lake Chad Basin.","['Development', 'Lake Chad Basin', 'competing states', 'Boko Haram', 'Nigeria']"

Highlighting a National Hero: Yu Kwansun (1902-1920) as a Token of the March 1st Movement of 1919 in Contemporary South Korean Society,"Ho, Sammi","['Jang, Se Young']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis researches how the concepts of tokenism and cultural memory are used to explain and strengthen the narrative of patriotic martyr Yu Kwansun as seemingly the sole important Korean female resistance fighter in contemporary South Korean society. By critically analyzing the various South Korean school textbooks, online news articles, governmental weblogs, literature, memory sites, museum labels, cinematic texts and the presidential speech in 2019, it seems that Yu Kwansun has a more highlighted role in society compared to the other female historical figures who are portrayed in the history canon. The portrayal of Yu Kwansun as a token has the purpose of constructing the image of an inclusive society through history. While the narrative of Yu Kwansun in society might give the appearance of inclusivity, the narratives of other important historical female figures in Korean history are literally left in the background. (Korean) women in general are still viewed as a single entity and their accomplishments are often credited to the group instead of their own efforts. Ultimately, this thesis has shown how historical female figures are portrayed in contemporary society by focusing on the case study of Yu Kwansun.","['Yu Kwansun', 'Tokenism', 'Cultural Memory', ""Women's history"", 'Korean History']"

The Road to An Alternative Modernity: Exploring the Lighting in Nagai Kafū’s Works from 1900s to1910s,"Cao, Shumin","['Smits, Ivo']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on Nagai Kafū’s lighting representations (both natural and manmade light) in the first decade of twentieth century, exploring how Kafū manipulates light, as well as the light-shadow contrast in his urban-based texts selected from different time. The analysis follows a timeline divided in roughly three parts: debut years before his journey abroad (1900-1903), journey in America and France (1903-1908) and few years after returning to Japan (1908 and after). Given the technological gap between Japan and the West in modern period and thus reflected in Kafū’s writing, knowledge of the innovations in lighting technology will be mentioned when necessary. This thesis argues that the drastic transition of his lighting passion from manmade light to natural light after his returning to Japan in 1908 shall be examined as a significant message. As an urban writer, his transition in light preference not only reveals his critical thinking of Japan’s modernization after experiencing what had been completed in the West, but also gives his vision in terms of what contributes to a livable modern city in which the inhabitants are deeply resonated with the urban fabrics, especially in a spiritual sense. Last but not the least, to some extent, the transition in lighting representations could be considered as a presage of the writer’s stylistic reverse few years later.","['Nagai Kafū', 'urban lighting', 'modernity', 'stylistic reverse', 'synesthesia city', 'natural light', 'manmade light']"

An analysis of the political relationship between the first ruler of Yogyakarta, Sultan Hamengkubuwono I (1717-92) and the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) reveals how material objects can be appropriated to create an agency for negotiation of greater political hegemony. In particular, the Sultan was able to create new symbolic meanings that legitimised his authority and power as a ruler in the eyes of his subjects through the gift, Kanjeng Nyai Jimat (royal coach), that was gifted by the Dutch after the Treaty of Giyanti in 1755. Despite its apparent foreign origin, the use of traditional concepts of power that are derived from the Javanese philosophy and cosmology had allowed the Sultan not only to carve an agency for himself but also to maintain the political hegemony of the royal family within Java up to this day.","['diplomatic gift', 'global history', 'material culture', 'Indonesia', 'gift-giving']"

Disability in the Japanese education system: a qualitative study on the experiences of students with developmental disorders,"Blom, Britt Caroline Henriëtte","['Ezawa, Aya']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2006, the Japanese government introduced a new special needs education system. One of the reasons for this reform was to promote the inclusion of children with a disability into mainstream schools (MEXT 2006b). However, since the implementation of this new system, instead of attending mainstream education, the number of children in Japan that are receiving special needs support or go to special schools has increased significantly. In the period from 2005 to 2016 the number of children receiving special needs education rose from 199,227 to 327,201, while at the same time the total number of school-going children declined. One of the main reasons for this significant growth is the increased recognition of developmental disorders (hattatsu shōgai発達障害). Developmental disorders are defined by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (hereafter MEXT), and include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disorders and/or other similar disorders of the brain function that usually develop at a young age (Mithout 2016, 171; MEXT n.d.c). Seeing as this recognition of developmental disorders by the MEXT is quite recent, not much research has been done on how these students perceive education and what challenges they face at school. With my research I will contribute to the literature about disability in Japan, especially highlighting the experiences of the students. This thesis will answer the questions: “How do students with developmental disorders in the current Japanese education system experience the available school options? And what insight do their experiences give us in the different models of disability?”. In order to answer these questions, this thesis will first explore different understandings and models of disability (medical and social) that show us different ways in which one can interpret disability. These models will form the basis of the thesis, and will show how policy-making and the education system in Japan are characterized by these models. In order to get a better understanding of how students with developmental disorders experience school, fieldwork was conducted at various schools in the Kansai region to observe the environment and the curriculum. Furthermore, six in-depht interviews were conducted with students with developmental disorders who graduated from special needs education.","['Disability', 'Japan', 'Ableism', 'Social model of disability', 'Medical model of disability', '発達障害', 'Special needs education']"
Effects of classifying game addiction as a mental disorder on the stigma surrounding mental illness in South Korea,"Vries, Didi de","['Breuker, R.E.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In May 2019, the South Korean government has agreed to implement the new ‘gaming disorder’ classification, as instated in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) by the World Health Organization (WHO), into their own Korean Standard Classification of Diseases (KCD) within the next few years. The classification will change how game addiction will be treated in South Korea, in both a medical and societal sense, and will have an especially big impact on how mental illness is perceived. This thesis therefore asks the following question: What are the possible effects of the implementation of the World Health Organization’s classification of ‘game disorder’ into the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases on the stigma on mental illness in South Korean society? Through critical analysis of the relevant parts of the ICD and KCD, exploration of South Korea’s history with the WHO and critical discourse analysis of scholars’ opinions on the subject, this thesis has determined that South Koreans are currently unlikely to get treatment for mental illness due to (perceived) stigma and that the classification of gaming disorder can play an important part in alleviating said stigma if the government uses the opportunity to development anti-stigma programs.","['gaming disorder', 'mental health', 'stigma', 'World Health Organization']"

Met het oog op de toekomst: Een analyse van het huidige antiterrorismebeleid van Marokko,"Kieviet, Maria A.P.","['Seyed-Gohrab, A.A.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Five terrorist attacks in Casablanca on 16 May 2003 alarmed the Moroccan state of the presence of religious extremist ideas in Morocco. As a measure, an anti-terrorism policy was launched to reduce the chances of future attacks. Morocco’s number of attacks is relatively low compared to other North African countries from 2003 onwards. The aim of this thesis is to investigate to what extent Morocco’s anti-terrorism policy explains this low number of attacks. This policy consists of legal, religious, and socio-economic measures. Legislative amendments have strengthened the powers of security services and the police. In addition, the state has provided an alternative to religious extremist ideas by promoting the ‘Moroccan Islam’ in mosques, schools, and media. Furthermore, the state has tried to remove the likelihood of radicalization by reducing poverty and improving housing. As a result of these measures, it is possible that the size and activity of religious extremist groups have been reduced, and less Moroccan citizens are susceptible to religious extremist ideas. Moreover, many extremist cells have been dismantled and arrested since 2003. Although these arrests are criticized from a humanitarian viewpoint, they validate the success of the state in arresting a significant number of possible extremists. Nevertheless, since quantities are problematic indicators to measure effectiveness of anti-terrorism policies, caution should be exercised when attributing Morocco’s number of attacks to its anti-terrorism policy. This thesis is a multidisciplinary historical source research, analyzing a wide range of sources by using the qualitative research method ‘document analysis’.","['Morocco', 'Moroccan Islam', 'Casablanca attacks 2003', 'Anti-terrorism policy', 'Abdelkader Belliraj', 'Salafia Jihadia', 'Groupe Islamique Combattant Marocain', 'Religious extremism']"

Trump as a modern-day 'Cyrus': A Critical Discourse Analysis of the Trump Presidency and his support for Israel,"Villa Lopez, Laura","['Heere, Cees']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"President Trump successfully secured the Republican vote in the US Presidential election of 2016. Donald Trump is notoriously not religious but he is seen as a vehicle to elevate the religious agenda in the political arena. In 2016, Donald Trump run a campaign that engaged with the evangelicals’ desire to restore social and cultural ‘morality’ in the public space and their desire to unwaveringly support Israel. Most of the scholarly debate on Trump’s stance on Israel is angled from a policy perspective, attributing his position to factors such as geopolitics, the influence of Biblical prophecy in American diplomacy, and the increased role of White Christian Nationalism in the political agenda. The research of this thesis will expand on the literature by exploring how Trump’s rhetoric and politics on Israel are used to appeal to his pro-Israel conservative base. The analysis of Trump’s rhetoric and political action using the tool of critical discourse analysis will provide insights between language, ideology, and power. President Trump’s language and political efforts concerning Israel appeal to the Christian evangelical base that makes up most of the Republican Party. Furthermore, Trump has enhanced the role of Christianity in politics, to promote the idea that progressive policies are incompatible with the American identity, and has established America’s relationship with Israel as an inherent value.","['Trump', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Christian Right', 'Israel']"

Regarding Chilean female employability, there is still a wide gap between men and women, with Chile being one of the countries with the lowest female labor participation in the Latin American region. Most studies have focused on understanding this topic, mainly from the perspective of analyzing human capital and the characteristics of the labor market. However, in the last decades, theoretical work began to be produced that considered the cultural factor of this phenomenon. Thus, issues related to the type of society in which they live are considered relevant, contributing to the understanding of the employability patterns of women, especially those who are mothers. Where it is considered that the country context is rooted in traditional culture and has not yet managed to depose current social inequalities. Therefore, motherhood plays an important role when making decisions regarding female employability.","['maternidad', 'empleabilidad femenina', 'maternidad laboral', 'equidad de género', 'deserción laboral', 'maternity', 'female employment', 'gender equaility']"

Advocating for democracy in China: Have democracy and human rights organizations based in the U.S. faced governmental opposition?,"Tran, Lina","['London, Jonathan D.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This year marks the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen protests and their violent crackdown in 1989. Since then, many of the Tiananmen activists succeeded in leaving their home country and settling in the U.S., choosing the country known as one of the most prominent advocators for democracy (Béja 2003:440). In the U.S., individual activists as well as organized groups have lobbied for their interest of democratizing China, forming a movement that is called Overseas Chinese Democracy Movement (OCDM). The OCDM organizations have played a major role in influencing bilateral relations between the U.S. and China (Chen 2014a:1). However, observers around the world have witnessed in recent years that governments have increasingly opposed democracy and rights organizations, constraining organizations’ activities by erecting legal barriers (Wolff & Poppe 2015:i). This phenomenon is called the “Closing Space phenomenon” (ibid.) and describes the growing resistance against democracy and human rights promotion. Closing Space has been mostly studied in authoritarian and semi-authoritarian countries, yet scholars have noted a similar trend in some democratic countries, including the U.S. (Celermajer & Avnon 2019:674). Thus, the question is whether the U.S. government still supports groups promoting democracy in China, or whether it has also started to oppose democracy and rights organizations such as those of the OCDM. Currently, there is a major research gap on a potential Closing Space in the U.S. This means that a potential increasingly hostile political and civil climate is not addressed nor understood by academia. This lack of knowledge can contribute to a fundamental erosion of civil society organizations which provide essential democracy and rights advocacy both within and outside the U.S. With regards to OCDM organizations1, increasing barriers to their work can lead to very tangible deteriorations of human rights in China. By investigating the Closing Space phenomenon in the U.S., we can better understand which challenges U.S. based human rights organizations face. With regards to the current power struggles between the central Chinese government and democracy activists in Hong Kong, as well as continuing human rights violations against Uighur minorities in Xinjiang, the question of democracy and human rights in China is more relevant than ever. Hence, OCDM organizations’ relentless fight for democracy and human rights in China is of utmost significance. By raising this research problem, the thesis aims to target two underserved bodies of literature: first, the Closing Space phenomenon in democracies such as the U.S. (Chaudhry & Heiss 2018), and second, theoretical research on the OCDM and its members (Chen 2018:110). Scholarly literature on civil society organizations reflects three major perspectives, namely Social Movement Theory, Political Opportunity Structure, and the Closing Space phenomenon. These research fields provide valuable insight, especially in understanding social movements as “collective efforts to pursue [common] interests” (Flacks 2004:135), viewing political opportunity structures as ‘filters’ between movement mobilization and the choice of strategies and movement impact (Kitschelt 1986:59, Teräväinen 2010:197), as well as the Closing Space phenomenon that sees the recent assertive pushback against democracy and human rights advocacy as a defensive reaction of mostly authoritarian leaders that fear popular uprisings (Carothers 2016:358, 364). Despite providing key insights, these bodies of literature do not provide a satisfactory understanding of current challenges faced by democracy and rights organizations in the U.S. This master thesis will address this research gap and contribute to an improved understanding of OCDM organizations’ struggles specifically and research on Closing Space and POS more generally. The thesis argues that the Closing Space concept offers a valuable advancement of POS theory as it overcomes the structural determinism of POS and acknowledges organizations’ individual differences and subjective interpretations.","['China', 'U.S.', 'Democracy']"

"The evolution of post-disaster mental health care in Japan: how have the responses by civil society, local and national government changed over time","Smit, Josephine Marian","['Black, Lindsay']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis discusses the initial mental health care response and subsequent development of postdisaster mental health policies after the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji earthquake and 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. It seeks to discover which actors had which roles in the progress, and how responsibility and accountability have shifted. To accomplish this goal, a causal process tracing method was used which analyzes the causal mechanisms that shaped the development of post-disaster mental health policies after the 1995 and 2011 disasters. Afterwards, a comparative analysis was used to compare the policy shaping process from both periods. By doing this, we can ascertain if lessons regarding post-disaster mental health care response have been learned, and if so, in what way these lessons have had an effect on the post-disaster mental health care regulation. After the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji earthquake, the Japanese government was heavily criticized for their delayed action, while in contrast the local government, volunteers from the civil society and NPOs immediately came to action. At that time, there was not as much knowledge regarding post-traumatic stress disorder in Japan, and precautions were scarce. After the initial response and the first studies showing many victims battling mental health problems, the government developed post-disaster mental health policies. The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake triple disaster was unprecedented in scope, and mental health care measures employed since the 1995 disaster were not sufficient. Local governments from across the country, volunteers and NPOs offered their immediate help, while the central government was struggling in Tokyo with inadequate leadership, political power games and inflexible regulations. In the wake of the destruction regulations were again implemented based on the lessons learned, but a real recognition of mental health care still seems far away. A large focus remains on reconstruction of houses, infrastructure and financial revitalization, while the mental health of the victims seems forgotten. The national government should take up more responsibilities to protect not only the physical, but also the mental health of its citizens, and finish large projects such as permanent housing and community building in the affected areas that will provide the victims with a relief of stress and uncertainty.","['mental health care', 'civil society', 'local government', 'central government', 'Hanshin-Awaji', 'earthquake', 'Great East Japan Earthquake', 'PTSD']"

A Competitive Means to a Cooperative End? The Effect of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games on Ethnic Nationalism in South Korea,"Noordermeer, Laura","['Breuker, Remco']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Koreanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The legacies of the 1988 Seoul Olympic Summer Olympics have been widely researched before. They include the impact on domestic policies (among which policies that impacted the relationship with North Korea), national pride and collective memory. However, the political climate between the DPRK and the ROK during these 1988 Olympics could not be in starker contrast than during the Winter Olympics in 2018, which provided an opportunity for formal talks between the two countries. This raised the question of whether or not these events could lead to changes in ethnic nationalistic sentiments in ROK society. The aim of this study is to explore how ethnic nationalism discourses in South Korea have been influenced by hosting the 2018 PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games. As existing literature showed, ethnic nationalism is still used as an argument for unification. Based on this, it was hypothesized that if the wish for unification becomes stronger, notions of ethnic nationalism in South Korean society follow this pattern. Because the PyeongChang Winter Olympics were promoting an agenda of peace and reconciliation with the DPRK, it was expected that they would reignite the flame of ethnic nationalism in ROK society. Critical discourse analysis was used to distinguish whether there were any changes within ethnic nationalism discourses before and after the 2018 Winter Olympics. By comparing studies that captured notions of ethnic nationalism before and after February 2018, it became apparent that there were no clear breakthroughs in the ever-declining importance of ethnic nationalism in ROK society. Because this result is opposite to what is expected on the basis of existing literature, this thesis therefore puts into question the relevance of the current ethnic nationalism discourse paradigm.","['ethnic nationalism', 'South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Olympic Games', '2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics', 'Korean nationalism']"

The Transmission of Trauma in Toni Morrison's 'Beloved' and Yaa Gyasi's 'Homegoing',"Hinfelaar, Iris","['Kardux, J.C.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This MA Thesis discusses the way in which Toni Morrison’s Beloved and Yaa Gyasi’s Homegoing represent the notion of the transmission of the traumas of slavery. Both Beloved and Homegoing represent the notion that traumas need to be narrated, and witnessed by others, or they will continue to have a negative impact on multiple generations, not only the generations of the present, but also those of the future. They do, however, differ significantly in the way in which they portray the notion of transmission of trauma. In Beloved, Denver is mostly traumatized not by being enslaved but by living with a mother who is traumatized by slavery, whilst in Homegoing the recurrent tropes of a black necklace, fire, and fear of water in the stories of the various generations suggest that the collective trauma of slavery is transmitted from one generation to the next. This is a significant difference, because it suggests the novels engage differently with the question central to the scholarly debate on transmission of trauma: can trauma be transmitted or is it the traumatized parent who creates a traumatizing atmosphere for the child?","['trauma', 'slavery', 'Beloved', 'Toni Morrison', 'Yaa Gyasi', 'Homegoing', 'transmission of trauma']"

De-Judaising Islam: Isrāʾīliyyāt Discussions in Turkish New Media,"Metin, Sadreddin Berk","['Bruijn, Petra de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The discussions surrounding the authenticity of the extra-Qur'ānic traditions in Islam has been a prevalent theme in the scholarship for the last six decades. This thesis is about the modern polemics surrounding the parts of the Islamic tradition with supposed Jewish origins, also known as the “Isrāʾīliyyāt”. The term Isrāʾīliyyāt has been the subject of numerous religious-polemical works since the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with Modernist Muslim commentators arguing for the ejection of this material to make way for a return to pristine Islam. Although such arguments against Isrāʾīliyyāt find considerable coverage in the academic literature, the dynamic exegetical scene in Turkey is often neglected. Highlighting the discussions in Turkey, this research aims to bring out the contemporary debates about Isrāʾīliyyāt therein with a study of the ‘new media’, a platform that is widely used by preachers from different ideological camps. This thesis seeks to situate the Turkish case within the larger Middle Eastern context of Modernist Islam by discovering the connections between exegetes from different localities and eras, aiming to locate the intellectual influences of the figures that are studied.","['Judaism and Islam', 'Isrāʾīliyyāt', 'Turkey', 'New Media', 'Islamic Modernism', 'Exegesis', 'Ḥadīth']"

Moroccan Feminists: Agents of Change?,"Kooij, Annet van","['Seyed Gohrab, Ashgar']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Midden-Oostenstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis aims to investigate the influence of Moroccan feminist movements in achieving reform concerning women´s rights both in theory and practice. In order to do so a historical overview is given on the development of feminist movements in Morocco, both secular and Islamic in nature. In this overview some activist campaigns are discussed that were a significant part of the struggle towards progression of women´s rights, both in terms of convincing the political powers, as well as the public. Eventually reforms to the Family law and constitution were implemented, and articles that were reformed appear to vastly improve the position of women. However, numerous articles that were not reformed endure the lesser position of women in society, and at times even contradict newly reformed articles. In practice, reforms seem to have made some impact, providing women with better chances at education and employment, but women continuously face lesser opportunities or conditions when compared to men. This becomes even more evident when looking at women´s marital rights, and the hardships they face in pursuing a political career. Overall, Moroccan feminist movements have been an essential factor in realising policy change, but on a practical level, it has proven to be even more difficult to reach widespread change. Reforms are often not implemented locally, and feminists have not yet managed to encompass all aspects of Moroccan society. Still, the situation of contemporary Moroccan women appears to have greatly improved compared to that of Moroccan women 70 years ago.","['Morocco', 'Moroccan Feminism', 'Gender Equality', 'Policy Reform', 'Family Law', 'Activism']"

Therefore, literature can be analyzed as a case study in order to identify the tendencies of thought in the time that a story is written. The purpose of this study was to ""analyze"" how the scientific discourse in (post)modern detective fiction can be related to the changing scientific and philosophical context of the twentieth century. Through an extensive textual analysis of a detective character’s methodology, a picture could be painted of their scientific beliefs. By going through this process for two detective characters, the Victorian Sherlock Holmes and the postmodern William of Baskerville, a comparison between the two may then reveal how the shifts in the philosophical field of science and theory could have affected their methods of theoretical thought that they utilize to interpret the world and subsequently solve cases. The study showed that Sherlock Holmes never questioned the objective and observable nature of evidence and universal causality, whereas in William of Baskerville’s methodology the elusiveness of any attempt to interpret the world was a major focus. Relating these findings to the philosophical ideas that were most dominant in the beginning and the end of the twentieth century showed that this shift correlates with the manner in which society’s confidence in the objectivity of science and knowledge has diminished.","['Philosophy of Science', 'Epistemology', 'Detective fiction', 'Postmodernism', 'Sherlock Holmes', 'William of Baskerville']"

From Chinese Nationalism and Anti-Foreignism to the Beginning of Hongkongnese Identity,"So, Aholi","['Keijser, Anne Sytske']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the collaboration between the Chinese merchant elite and the Colonial government of Hong Kong during the 1925-1926 Canton-Hong Kong Strike-Boycott. The Chinese merchants played a crucial role in shaping and developing British Hong Kong. At the same time, there was interdependence between the British rulers and the merchants to maintain public order or to recover from instability. This was particularly evident during the 1920s in which China was amid the surge of Chinese nationalism, and anti-foreignism. As the 1925 Nanking Road Incident and the May Thirtieth Movement led to national outbursts against foreign powers, British Hong Kong became the prime example of anti-imperialists protests in South China. From the 1920s onwards, non-violent coercion methods became not only more frequently used but also politicized by the Kuomintang and the communists. To explore the relation between the Hong Kong community and the Colonial government during the sixteen-month long strike, this thesis uses mainly the South China Morning Post as primary resource, and many more secondary resources. At times it will use sources such as newspapers, British archival material, documentation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China. The Colonial government and the Chinese Merchant elite were coping closely to control the outcome and to end of the boycott-strike. In this thesis, I argue that that the emergence of Hongkong identity came in the wake of the Canton-Hongkong Boycott Strike of 1925-1926 by the British.","['Hong Kong', 'Canton', 'Identity', 'Labour movements', 'British Hongkong', 'Canton-Hong Kong Boycott Strike', 'Canton–Hong Kong strike', '1925-1926']"
The use of ‘I mean’ as a discourse particle in ELF business communication,"Lewis, Bruno","['Ameka, Felix']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Linguistic literature addressing the roles of discourse particles in English Lingua Franca (ELF) settings currently remains scarce. Research has shown that ELF communication presents different rules and structures than native English conversations. This study aims to explore the use of the particle I mean in ELF business communication. Building on general work in the subject, it asks two main questions: What are the functions of I mean as a DP used by ELF speakers in business settings? To what extent is I mean employed to pre-empt communicative misunderstanding? Based on the review of previous findings and the analysis of empirical data from a corpus of ELF business meetings, this thesis demonstrates the multifunctionality of I mean executing 15 functions. The results indicate that speakers in such contexts stay engaged in discourse, anticipating any potential source of misunderstanding. On that basis, it is recommended that further research should concentrate in the study of the influence situations involving hierarchical structures like business meetings have on the behaviour of I mean.","['Discourse Particles', 'ELF communication', 'Misunderstanding', 'Conversation Analysis', 'Corpus Linguistics', 'Englis Lingua Franca (ELF)']"

Turkish Public Support for the European Union: Its individual-level determinants and association with EU-Turkey relations,"Sürmen, Ecmel Aysu","['Broad, Matthew']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Public support for the EU in Turkey has been widely recognised as one of the main drivers of the improvement in EU-Turkey relations, especially in the early 2000s. Although the existing literature mostly focuses on the individual-level determinants of the public support for EU, it somewhat fails to provide a comprehensive analysis of one of the most notable features of this support: its volatility. This volatility has been qualitatively associated with the oscillations in EU-Turkey relations, however the formal evidence is lacking in this direction. In this thesis, using both qualitative and quantitative research methods, we provide a unified framework to examine the support levels for the EU both in the cross section and over time. We first put forward the most notable individual-level determinants of public support by leveraging on the existing literature. Then, we present an overview of the EU-Turkey relations in order to identify the milestones in the last decade, which may have affected the support levels. Finally, we conduct a regression analysis on a pooled sample of Standard Eurobarometer surveys between 2012-2019, which enables us to disentangle the effect of time factor from individual characteristics. Our results reveal that the revitalisation efforts of EU-Turkey relations and increasing cooperation did not translate into an increase in the Turkish public support. However, the public opinion took a positive turn after the constitutional referendum in 2017. On the determinant level, utilitarian considerations remain one of the most important determinants for support, with a growing importance of political stances (left-right).","['Turkish public support', 'public support for the EU']"
Magical Morthbrood and a Mythical Moon - Cheshire folklore and landscape in Alan Garner’s The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Moon of Gomrath,"Houdijk, Renate","['Newton, Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I argue that the folklore in Alan Garner’s The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Moon of Gomrath is an active part of the landscape in which the protagonists live (Alderley Edge, Cheshire). I use Jung and Macfarlane to define the concepts of mythology and ecocriticism. Chapter 1 focuses on locality and the concepts of time and place. Bakhtin’s chronotope links archaeology to the imagination and to literature, which results in an analysis of the development of magic through place and time. This leads to the conclusion that Garner uses maps as time-machines. Chapter 2 applies my research to The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and discusses how the book uses landscape descriptions to create an awareness of local folklore and nature. All mythical creatures have their own place in the landscape, and the protagonists are pulled into the magical world through exploring this landscape. In chapter 3 applies these concepts to The Moon of Gomrath, in which not only the mythical creatures live in the landscape, but the landscape itself comes to life as the Old Magic, based on moonlight and natural energy, is woken. Both novels allow readers to be immersed in the landscape of the area without being there, and confirm that nature speaks to the imagination.","['children', 'ecocriticism', 'landscape', 'mythology', 'folklore', 'nature', 'Cheshire', 'Garner', 'fantasy', 'local']"

Pearson won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for creating the first peacekeeping force. However, upon closer inspection of Canada’s record on peacekeeping, contradictions emerge between the promise and practice of this national tradition. Why does peacekeeping persist as a tenet of Canadian identity and strategic culture when it no longer plays a prominent international role in peacekeeping? While perplexing, the theories of strategic cultural change and competing strategic subcultures provide the framework for addressing this question. This thesis finds that contradictions persist in the promise and practice of peacekeeping because while the Pearsonian Internationalist subculture that grew out of Canada’s peacekeeping achievements is no longer a dominant worldview, it endures as a potent vestigial influence that continues to strike at the heart of what it means to be Canadian and helps contextualize the efficaciousness of the new Robust Western Ally hegemonic subculture’s policy preferences. Through employing a Foucauldian Discourse Analysis to reveal the mechanisms of power employed by the competing subcultures in academic, media, and political discourses, this thesis sheds light on how norms, narratives, and cultural factors that have clandestinely and conflictingly influenced strategic preferences on peacekeeping in Canada from 1991 to 2017.","['canada', 'strategic culture', 'peacekeeping', 'foreign policy', 'narrative']"

The Staged Paradise: the Effect of Social Media on the (Staged) Authenticity of Balinese Culture,"Tahitu, Maia Puteri","['Arps, Bernard']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Tourist destination Bali is internationally known for its dynamic culture and the resilience it has shown over the years with the increase of mass tourism from all corners of the globe. The Balinese people are often praised for their ability to adapt perfectly and at the same time not losing grip over their own cultural identity, despite the demanding environment due to the large influx of foreigners. The relatively new, yet popular philosophy of Tri Hita Karana (aspiring harmonious relationships) lies at the basis of the versatile attitude towards tourism of the Balinese people. The now omnipresent and most famous brands Facebook, Twitter, Instagram have worked their way into everyday life and have become a vast medium for the spread of information, entertainment and various other forms of content and are therefore widely represented in the tourist industry. It is through these social media networks that representations about a certain tourist destination are created and shared with a mass audience. Tourists often seek authentic experiences of traditional culture that are intensively promoted by government institutions, local tourist offices and other social media platforms such as travel blogs made by tourists from all over the world. “How does social media contribute to the construction of (staged) authenticity within Balinese culture and what is the significance of this in light of the Balinese philosophy Tri Hita Karana?”. The answer is best seen in the creation of the Kecak dance and the developments of the Tirta Empul temple. While the Kecak dance has been created as entertainment for tourists, it is very often presented as a traditional, cultural and historic performance, which becomes evident through the Instagram and travel blogs of tourists. The Balinese are thus effectively staging the dance as something authentic to their culture. However, it serves as good example of the Balinese Tri Hita Karana, by adapting in order to create a harmonious relationship between tourists and Balinese. Thus, one could in turn suggest that the Kecak dance can be seen as something authentic Balinese. The Tirta Empul temple is subject to the same process of harmonization, where tourists are allowed to enter and partake in the temple’s rituals. However, this temple is something inherently authentic, traditional, cultural, historic and sacred to Bali from the start, making the acceptance of unknowing tourists, who prioritize the aesthetic over substantive meaning, into this place a source of de-authentication. This also becomes clear when looking at the Instagram posts and travel blogs. Nevertheless, the same process of Tri Hita Karana that allows these tourists in this place, can be argued to turn such adaptation to foreigners into something authentically Balinese.","['Bali', 'Authenticity', 'Cultural Tourism', 'Social Media', 'Staged Authenticity', 'Tri Hita Karana', 'Tirta Empul', 'Kecak Dance', 'Bali Tourism']"
The Intentions behind a Proposal to Paraphrase Western Loanwords in Japan and a Comparison of its Effects on Two Newspapers,"Erdkamp, Niels","['Yoshioka, Keiko']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Between 2003 and 2006, the Gairaigo Committee, part of the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL), released the Proposal for paraphrasing loanwords, which advocates the usage of Japanese paraphrases for 176 poorly understood loanwords. In the creation of this proposal, the committee prioritized an emphasis on the function of language (i.e., communication problems caused by loanwords) rather than an emphasis on tradition (i.e., ideological issues caused by loanwords). While this is true on an official level, an interview with a key member of the former committee suggests the conceivability that some of its members personally feared the corruption of the Japanese language and culture by loanwords. This outcome has led to an analysis of how Yomiuri Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun, two ideologically distinct newspaper companies represented in the committee, have dealt with the loanwords in NINJAL’s proposal. The research mainly involved a diachronic study of the words between 1995 and 2019 and a comparison of the two newspapers in this regard. The target words show significant differences according to newspaper, as there is an overall tendency of increasing usage in (the more progressive) Asahi Shimbun, while (the more conservative) Yomiuri Shimbun shows a decrease. However, in many cases, it is difficult to associate these changes with NINJAL’s proposal directly. The analysis concludes that there is no clear indication for a relation between the implementation of loanword policy and political ideology.","['loanword', 'gairaigo', 'language policy', 'sociolinguistics', 'newspaper', 'Japan']"

The object of this research is to look at three ways in which the kimono was introduced and subsequently integrated into the Western artistic, material and imaginary landscape of the turn of the 20th century: as a collectible material object, a theme in paintings and photographs as well as an influencing force in the realm of female fashion. The main idea of this paper is understanding why the kimono had such an immense popularity across these fields and audiences in the West as well as to point to the high adaptability of the garment. It is capable of undertaking several, sometimes contradictory, meanings and its simple shape, yet intricate esthetic, made it the ideal recipient of global and local dynamics of the 19th and 20th century int he West. In material culture it was presented as an Oriental accessory enabling fantasist imaginary spectacle. In art and in visual mediums, it framed the female, white body: domestic, exotic and erotic. In fashion, its slow assimilation into female dress participated into a still Orientalist but nonetheless modernizing dynamic, motivating the invention of practical and simpler garments for women living in a new world.","['Japonisme', 'Orientalism', 'Exotic', 'Material Culture', 'Fashion', 'Kimono', 'Collecting', 'Gender', 'Domestication']"

For many years, Asian people were portrayed as the Yellow Peril, the model minority, the perpetual foreigner and several other stereotypes related to gender. In the recent years, Asian Americans have become more vocal on this topic and they have been asking for more representation in Hollywood, with The Joy Luck Club having been the only film with a fully Asian cast for 25 years. In the last two years, two new American films came out with fully Asian casts, namely Crazy Rich Asians and The Farewell. Not much academic research on Chinese people’s opinions on these films has been done, therefore, in this thesis I went into depth and analyzed the reviews on the Chinese website Douban, to see what the Douban audiences thought of these three films. In this thesis I answered the question: How do Douban users perceive the portrayal of (overseas) Chinese people in American films? Through a discourse analysis on the reviews taken from Douban, I found that the majority of Douban users is content with the representation of Chinese people in these films, however, there are critical notes about stereotyping and the Western perspective on China that they feel is present in these films.","['Asian Representation', 'Stereotypes', 'Douban', 'Hollywood', 'Overseas Chinese']"
Tarsila do Amaral and Fernand Léger: the adoption of urban decolonial aesthetics,"Berg, Debora van den","['Brandellero, Sara']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"As the Brazilian modernist painter Tarsila do Amaral (1886-1973) studies several times in Paris with European avant-garde artist Fernand Léger (1881-1955), it is often claimed that Amaral’s visual style tends to cubism. However, throughout Amaral’s career as a painter, she sought ways to distinguish herself and to break away from European dominance. She dedicated herself to painting the local Brazilian landscape aiming at the revaluation of Brazil’s cultural and social features. Due to rapid industrialization and urbanization, urban life became a dominant topic among modernists. To embody the process of Brazil’s search for breaking away from European dominance, Oswald de Andrade excogitated the theory of Anthropophagy. The use of anthropophagy as a cultural metaphor is a way to visualize the process of the elimination of colonial domination. The present study is a visual analysis of paintings from Amaral and Léger which depict objects from urban life analyzed through the lens of the Anthropophagic theory. The research question is: How does Tarsila do Amaral adopt a decolonial aesthetic in relation to Fernand Léger in the representation of urban life?","['Brazilian modernism', 'Cubism', 'Anthropophagy', 'European avant-garde', 'Decolonial aesthetics', 'visual analysis']"

It argues that Shah Jahan’s flowering plant motif played a crucial role in the development of the nascent buta pattern. Consequently, this thesis argues that the development of the nascent buta may have been shaped as much by contemporary Iranian and European stylistic influences—as is often argued—as by the Mughals' own Islamic and Central Asian heritage. This thesis also makes an iconological contribution. Following the aesthetic development of the shawls—still plain, under Akbar—I aim to investigate how each Mughal emperor articulated his quest for royal identity. In this context, I study this royal pattern—and its success—as a symbol of the Mughal garden, which is an expression of the Qur'anic al-janna (the Paradise Garden), as well as of the Timurid garden. Additionally, my purpose is to highlight how Kashmir shawls, and the nascent buta pattern, came to be considered extremely valuable and sophisticated items, by focusing on Islamic gift-giving practices.","['Mughal', 'Textiles', 'Kashmir shawls', 'Buta']"

The Art behind Appropriation: Japanese-style Tattoos or Irezumi during the Modern Japanese Period (1868- present),"IJmkers, Ian","['Crandol, Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"A negative and controversial stigma shrouds the notion of tattoos globally. As of recently, societies globally have increasingly become more tolerant of the exposure of tattoos in public and in particular, professional environments or workplaces. This increased tolerance can predominantly be found in Western society. Often times, this increased tolerance is perceived to be applicable globally, credited largely to Western-dominated mainstream media. However, the negative stigma associated with tattoos persists in many East Asian societies and is largely regarded as taboo. These notions of taboo are largely attributed to associations with gangs, violence and criminal activities represented through different mediums like movies, newspapers, and word of mouth (see Figure 2). Despite this, East Asian societies like that of Japan's, still possess dedicated tattoo artist that practice tattooing, whether this is in ""Japanese-style"" tattooing or numerous other styles. The idea of Japanese tattoos is a largely sought-after style of tattooing not only within Japan but also in numerous Western societies, such as the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). It would not be in the wrong to presume that in fact, Japanese-style tattoos are in greater demand outside of Japan than within and are seen in less-controversial limelight than that of Japan, which leads us to a possible inquiry and the investigation of this thesis, how can there be such a difference of perspective of tattoos between Japan and Western nations like the US and UK in Japan-style tattoos? I use aspects of Edward Said's notion of Orientalism (1978) and Primitivism as the theoretical framework into three distinct periods: Meiji era (1868-1912) and the Contemporary era (1945-2020), and implement Richard Rogers' theory of cultural appropriation (2006) as a methodology to dissect ukiyo-e art, diaries from royal ""western"" figures, interviews and documentaries that depict experiences with Japanese tattooing practices. In the postwar era (1945-) Japan underwent tremendous political, cultural, and economic change under the Allied powers as a result of World War II. It is for this reason that the contemporary era is framed from 1945-2020 to portray the approach Japan took when it came to Japanese-style tattoos. As well as how Western society, in particular the United States, exported Japanese-style tattoos to audiences globally, due to American tattoo artists coming in contact with Japanese tattoo artists first. The overall aim of the investigation will shed light on how the previous mediums have historically engaged with cultural appropriation and orientalism in Japan, to create what we know of today as Japanese-style tattoos.","['Japan', 'tattoo', 'irezumi', 'appropriation', 'art', 'culture', 'society', 'modernism', 'modernization', 'modernity', 'orientalism']"

A New Understanding of Submission and Women's Place in the Salvation Narrative: Female Religious Experiences in Lucy Hutchinson's Order and Disorder & Aemilia Lanyer's Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum,"Van Dongen, Maatje Elizabeth","['Fikkers, Lotte']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"With suspended disbelief as opted by Trill, in this thesis, I have examined and revisited Hutchinson and Lanyer’s professions of faith. I have attempted to look at their works from a religious angle and interpret their motivations to write their texts accordingly. In conclusion, both Lucy Hutchinson in Order and Disorder and Aemilia Lanyer in Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum produced a new Genesis narrative with emphasis on the female presence. In rewriting the Genesis narrative with such an emphasis, they acknowledged the religious suppression of the female gender by the existing patriarchal society and addressed the need for a revival in personal religious experiences for women. To achieve that, they wrote about their own personal religious experiences and the religious experiences of their characters as an example for other women. Both Lucy Hutchinson and Aemilia Lanyer have felt this calling to guide their female readers to a new understanding of submission leading to a personal responsibility for their soul's salvation. Hutchinson and Lanyer have similarly interpreted submission to be a total, personal subjection to God. In Order and Disorder, Hutchinson shows that the notion of Biblical submission does not equal the silencing of the female gender and does not come from a place of authority. Instead, submission comes from a place of humility and servitude towards God and others. In Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum, Lanyer brings down patriarchal hierarchies as she calls her readers to a common subjection to God. In both Hutchinson and Lanyer’s accounts, there is no difference between men and women experiencing God’s grace. Lanyer underlines that both men and women have sinned and that both men and women can receive God’s grace. She uses the image of Christ as the Bridegroom and the Church as His Bride as the epitome of submission to one another. As Christ sacrificed himself for the Church, the Church should submit to Him an each other in return. Hutchinson confirms that submission to Christ results in a servitude towards others and an actively practiced faith. Furthermore, Hutchinson and Lanyer both describe the personal responsibility for women’s religious welfare. As described in the first chapter of this thesis on the Reformation, the religious landscape changed from a collective Christianity to an individual religious experience. As a result of this individualisation of faith, women are called to a personal, religious relationship with Christ. in Order and Disorder and in On the Principles of Religion, Hutchinson depicts how both she and her character Eve experienced salvation and transitioning from guilt into grace, and from grace into gratitude. In contrast, Lanyer interlaces the experiences of guilt, grace, and gratitude throughout her narrative. She engages the reader by showing that both men and women are subject to sin and need God’s grace. As a result, she depicts the reward of subjecting to God: as His Bride, the Church lives a joyful eternal life in His presence. At last, indeed, this thesis this thesis demonstrates that by writing and publishing their personal religious experiences, Lucy Hutchinson and Aemilia Lanyer guide their female readers to a new understanding of submission leading to a personal responsibility for their soul's salvation. Both Hutchinson and Lanyer present the way to salvation according the Reformed notions of guilt, grace, and gratitude.","['submission', 'salvation', 'female religious experience']"
The European Commission: a Champion in Gender Mainstreaming?,"Procoli, Michela","['Richard, Anne-Isabelle']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,,,en,"Is the European Commission effectively a champion in gender mainstreaming? The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the existing literature on feminist institutionalism, by attempting to give a comprehensive explanation as to why the gender mainstreaming strategy has not fulfilled its promises within the EU, and finding answers in its uneven application on the institutional level – in particular, on the level of the European Commission, major promoter of gender equality among the EU institutions. In order to do that, this thesis seeks to analyze a variety of factors which hindered the correct implementation of gender mainstreaming in the European Commission, and in particular: the problematic institutionalization of gender mainstreaming within this institution (both theoretical and empirical); the ineffectiveness of soft policy tools employed by this institution to manage the implementation of gender mainstreaming; the position of the Commission as a role model for other institutions in the implementation of the strategy and the problematic intra-institutional dynamics on gender.","['Gender Mainstreaming', 'European Commission', 'Gender Equality', 'Feminist Institutionalism']"

In order to conduct this research properly, the literature on political participation, political apathy and relative deprivation were studied. Furthermore, this study provides an in-depth analysis on the history of student activism in South Korea since the Korean War which showed the long-lasting history of political participation under younger generations in South Korea. This tradition was further highlighted during the impeachment vigils against president Park Geun-hee, as student protests ignited the investigation into her and her allies. Moreover, this study researched he approval rates of Park Geun-hee during her time as president of South Korea, and looked into the connection between its fluctuation and student movements during her regime. This study shows the strength and long history of student movements in South Korea, as well as emphasizes how the nature of student movements has changed over the last few decades. Finally this study highlights the importance students had in the beginning of Park’s investigation and the start of country wide protests against the former president.",

China’s New Role as a Peacemaker: Assessing China’s Engagement in Afghanistan Through a Combined Approach to Peacebuilding,"Zimmer, Verena","[""d'Hooghe, Ingrid""]",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The 2001 war in the Islamic State of Afghanistan has devastated the lives and livelihoods of millions of Afghans, and drew in the international community in the pursuit of establishing a peaceful Afghanistan. On the 29th of February 2020, the US and the Taliban signed an agreement to bring peace to Afghanistan, the Doha Agreement. While the peace developments remain in uncharted territory, China has been taken on a more prominent role in supporting the peace processes in Afghanistan by facilitating peace talks, fostering regional cooperation through the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan (RECCA). Then, how is China’s broader engagement in Afghanistan contributing to the peacebuilding processes in Afghanistan? By using a combined approach to peacebuilding, this research reviews China's contribution in the dimensions of jump-starting the national economy, re-establishing the framework of governance, repairing key transportation, communication and utility networks, rebuilding key social infrastructure, assisting local population, demine where applicable and normalise financial borrowing and the Chinese behaviour toward the non-state armed actor, the Taliban. This research concludes that China's involvement does not conclusively contribute to, nor hinder, the peacebuilding efforts. Rather, China’s contributions to the Afghan peace occur largely in the economic sphere, through investment in Afghan infrastructure and the normalisation of financial borrowing, and by posing as a mediator between parties involved in the Afghan conflict, notably the Taliban.","['China', 'Afghanistan', 'BRI', 'Peace Process in Afghanistan']"

The Law of Perjury: Theories of Lying in Practice,"Aalders, Vivian","['Pilgram, Roosmaryn']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research is aimed at characterizing the Dutch law of perjury with theories of lying as described by philosophers of language. In American law various inconsistencies of perjury cases led to research on the topic. Those studies all have concluded that lying and perjury differ greatly in several notable areas. Often discussed is the well-known perjury case of former US President Clinton. Research states Bill Clinton obviously was not speaking the truth, but he was never impeached with perjury. Possible explanations could be a political agenda or the lack of adequate evidence. This research paper will discuss the differences between the Dutch and American legal systems, as well as offering a critical analysis of why these systems differ. The central question in this research answers in what ways the Dutch law of perjury can be characterized by the pragmatic theories of lying. Four court cases, all different in outcome, will be linguistically analysed. The linguistic analysis performed in this research is based on Grice’s maxims of Cooperation, Searle’s Speech Act theory, the provided definition of lying and the analytic tools as described by Shuy. This will provide various insights in the interpretation of the Dutch perjury law. Based on the results, this research paper concludes that lying cannot perfectly characterize the Dutch law of perjury, however, they cannot be fully separated from each other either. What this analysis clearly shows are the possibilities of a linguistic analysis when discussing perjury lawsuits. The discourse analysis can provide insights in someone’s intentions, as well as the weaknesses in someone’s statements. This paper strongly promotes the statement that using linguistic analyses is beneficial to the legal system, especially in court cases concerning crimes of language.","['perjury', 'lying', 'linguistic analysis', 'law', 'legal systems']"
Corporate Management of Host Communities in Renewable Energy Infrastructure Projects in South Africa,"Sidhoum Hassaïne, Anissa","['Awuh, Harrison']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Engaging in a just energy transition implies the equitable participation of all stakeholders. The successful development of renewable energy infrastructure projects relies on a strong social support. Companies must implement ambitious community engagement practices to gain a social license to operate (SLO) and, thus, mitigate social acceptance risks. This study aims at investigating the interactions between involved companies and host communities of such projects in South Africa, where firms must engage in local economic development activities. It focuses on the construction phase of third-party EPC projects (when Engineering, Procurement and Construction services are offered by an actor that is not the original developer). Based on a comprehensive literature review, field research was conducted. Thorough observations were recorded. Questionnaire surveys were disseminated to the company’s employees and local workers. Semi- structured interviews and discussions were conducted with company’s representatives, local workers, and other community members. A comparative case study approach is adopted to evaluate corporate management strategies. Two projects located in the North West province, Bokamoso and Waterloo Solar Parks, and overseen by the same EPC company, are analyzed. The SLO concept is utilized to assess actual community responses and frame elements of corporate management that might have influenced the positive observed levels of SLO. Results show that: • There is a slight mismatch between the reality on site and its perception by the company. • The company maintains a negative approach to communication, both internally and externally, which negatively influenced local communities’ responses. • Community responses are also shaped by external factors that the company acknowledges but difficultly navigates. These results suggest that host communities and local rules of the game should be better understood by corporate proponents. Practical recommendations to improve community engagement and better mitigate social acceptance risks in renewable energy infrastructure projects, solely during the construction phase, in South Africa are offered.","['energy transition', 'renewable energy infrastructure', 'social risk management', 'community engagement', 'social license to operate', 'REIPPPP', 'corporate social responsibility', 'South Africa', 'renewable energy']"

Latin American Active Role in Human Rights Theorization: The Larreta Doctrine,"Iannuli, Federico","['Rodriguez Idarraga, Nicolas']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The reassessment of Global South contribution to International Relations both in the past and present time, is a crucial challenge for academic research nowadays, constituting an issue that is worthy of interest and analysis for its implications on History and International Relations. This work aims to decentralize International Relations and make it less Eurocentric. To do so, the author reassessed the role of Latin American thinkers and diplomats in Human Rights theorization in the 1940s, to show that crucial theoretical developments were made outside the Global North. In detail, this thesis argues that the region has actively participated in the construction of the language of human rights instead of simply receiving ideas and concepts from the Global North. It focuses on the Larreta Doctrine, a doctrine developed in Uruguay that tackled multilateralism, sovereignty and the violation of human rights. Eduardo Rodriguez Larreta, then Uruguayan Foreign Minister, theorized this Doctrine in 1945, in response to the dualism between sovereignty and international Rights protection hardly felt in the Latin American Region. So, Larreta thought that the idea that non-intervention in states’ domestic affairs is conditional to the respect for citizens’ fundamental rights. Moreover, the Uruguayan Foreign Minister stated that a precommitment regime and collective intervention are not a violation of sovereignty.","['Larreta Doctrine', 'Human Rights', 'Global South', 'Latin America', 'Uruguay', 'Democracy', 'Rodriguez Larreta', 'South America']"

"Gender, Taal en Politiek","Duinen, Isabelle van","['Jong, J.C. de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Naar aanleiding van de toenemende aandacht voor de vrouwelijke retoriek in de politiek en de publicatie van Grebelsky-Lichtman (2017) is er in deze scriptie onderzoek gedaan naar het gebruik van vrouwelijke communicatiekenmerken door acht Nederlandse fractieleiders, vier vrouwen en vier mannen. Door van iedere fractieleider één toespraak te onderzoeken op het gebruik van zes verschillende aan de vrouwelijke spreekstijl toegekende communicatiekenmerken, zoals opgesteld door Grebelsky-Lichtman (2017), is er getracht om een antwoord te geven op de volgende hoofdvraag: In hoeverre gebruiken Nederlandse vrouwelijke en mannelijke politici communicatiekenmerken toegekend aan de vrouwelijke spreekstijl in hun toespraken gegeven tijdens de Algemene Beschouwingen in de Tweede Kamer, gebaseerd op het model van Grebelsky-Lichtman (2017)? De deelvraag die in dit scriptieonderzoek geadresseerd wordt is als volgt: In hoeverre kan er een sterk verband aangetoond worden tussen communicatiekenmerken en gender in een beperkt corpus? Grebelsky-Lichtman heeft haar onderzoek gefundeerd op verschillende theorieën, zoals IMT, PIM en AAT. De theorieën zijn afkomstig uit relevante literatuur op het gebied van communicatie en politiek. Centraal in het onderzoek staat de analyse van een corpus bestaande uit 24 toespraken gegeven door 12 invloedrijke vrouwelijke politici, afkomstig uit verschillende Westerse landen, waarin wordt onderzocht welke communicatiekenmerken door deze vrouwen gebruikt worden. De conclusie van het onderzoek van Grebelsky-Lichtman (2017) is dat de geanalyseerde vrouwen allemaal gebruik maken van een zogenoemd gemixt communicatiemodel, bestaande uit het gebruik van voornamelijk mannelijke communicatiekenmerken en een minimale hoeveelheid kenmerken gekoppeld aan de vrouwelijke spreekstijl, en vrouwelijke non-verbale communicatiekenmerken. Door te onderzoeken in welke mate de Nederlandse fractieleiders gebruik maken van vrouwelijke communicatiekenmerken kan de conclusie getrokken worden of er in Nederland ook sprake is van het gebruik van een gemixte communicatieset of dat de Nederlandse fractieleiders zich vasthouden aan de kenmerken die worden gekoppeld aan hun gender vanuit gevestigde wetenschappelijke inzichten. De conclusie van dit scriptieonderzoek is dat de Nederlandse fractieleiders communicatiekenmerken gebruiken die onafhankelijk zijn van hun gender. De geanalyseerde mannelijke en vrouwelijke fractieleiders gebruiken beide een minimale hoeveelheid vrouwelijke kenmerken in hun toespraken. Ook is er geconcludeerd dat vrouwen significant meer gebruik maken van het aan de vrouwelijke spreekstijl toegekende communicatiekenmerk verzoeken doen aan medepolitici, en dat de mannen significant meer gebruik maken van het aan de vrouwelijke spreekstijl toegekende communicatiekenmerk stellen van vragen. Om aan te tonen in hoeverre de verschillen in gebruik van alle zes communicatiekenmerken significant zijn is er gebruik gemaakt van log likelihood, een berekening die geschikt is om te gebruiken voor verschijnselen die weinig voorkomen in een corpus. Er kan in dit corpus niet aangetoond worden dat er een verband bestaat tussen communicatiekenmerken en gender. De reden dat ook de mannelijke fractieleiders gebruik maken van vrouwelijke communicatiekenmerken is dat de kenmerken wellicht niet gender gebonden, maar genre gebonden zijn.","['Gender', 'Taal', 'Politiek', 'Toespraken', 'Algemene Beschouwingen']"

Numeral Systems: Three South American Case Studies,"Minderaa, Laura","['Crevels, Mily']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In this thesis, I discuss the range of numerals in South American languages, the strategies that languages use to form their numerals, and what cultural and historical causes can be given to the range of the numerals. The Quechuan languages consistently possess an infinite decimal system. This could be the result of the preservation of the high numerals after colonization that were used to keep track of administration in the extended Inca Empire. In the Arawakan family, both the range and the internal structure of the numerals differ. Just as for the Quechuan, the Arawakan people were involved in trade and war which could indicate a need of high numerals. However, unlike for the Quechuan numerals, they have not been preserved. During colonization, Arawakan groups fled from their original settlements and adopted other groups into their communities, which indicates substratum influence and explains the diversity of the Arawakan numerals. In the Guaporé-Mamoré linguistic area, numerals are mostly concentrated around a maximum of 20. The body-part system and a connection to company or loneliness are common in the numerals in this area.","['South America', 'Numerals', 'Base forms', 'Typology', 'Quechuan', 'Arawakan', 'Guaporé-Mamoré', 'Culture', 'History']"

Zie jij ze vliegen? Een retorische analyse van ufodiscussies vanuit vernaculair en institutioneel perspectief,"Vording, Marlies","['Burger, Peter']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De vraag op welke manier journalisten en deelnemers op webfora in Nederland discussiëren over het bestaan van ufo’s, staat centraal in deze scriptie. Welke logos- en ethostechnieken zetten de institutionele media enerzijds en gebruikers van het vernaculaire web anderzijds in om hun publiek te overtuigen als het gaat om verhalen over ‘unidentified flying objects’? Bij logos gaat het om de inhoudelijke argumentatie van de redenaar, bij ethos om de indruk die de spreker maakt. Het onderzochte corpus bestaat uit 38 forumdiscussies uit de periode vanaf 2011 en 10 krantenartikelen uit de periode van de eerste grote ‘ufowaarneming’ van de Amerikaanse piloot Kenneth Arnold in 1947 tot en met 2019. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de logostechnieken van fervente gelovers en debunkers op elkaar lijken. Het ‘argumentum ad ignorantiam’, oftewel het argument van de onwetendheid, wordt door deze twee geloofsgroepen in zowel krantenartikelen als online discussies veel gebruikt. Verschil is wel dat forumdeelnemers dat uit de eerste hand doen, terwijl journalisten de verhalen optekenen uit de mond van een ander. Aan de hand van het ‘niet zeker weten van iets’ en het ontbreken van bewijs concluderen zij dat het fenomeen wel of juist niet bestaat. De bewijslast komt bij dit type argumentatie bij de tegenpartij te liggen. Believers steken dit argument wel in meer verschillende jasjes dan debunkers. Twijfelaars trekken uit de redenatie een andere conclusie. Zolang er geen bewijs voor of tegen het bestaan van vliegende schotels is, laten zij zich door de andere twee geloofsgroepen niet overtuigen. Een vierde geloofsgroep, de personal experiencers, valt in essentie uiteen in believers en twijfelaars. Deze groep begint vaak een discussie op het Ufomeldpunt, een van de onderzochte webfora. Ook in krantenartikelen staan de verhalen van de groep waarnemers dikwijls centraal. Journalisten spotten niet met het onderwerp, maar laten het vellen van een oordeel aan de lezer over. De krantenkop boven het artikel vertelt meestal wat de strekking van het verhaal is. Forumgebruikers maken gebruik van veel meer ethostechnieken dan journalisten. Beide groepen willen deskundig overkomen, maar doen dat op een eigen manier. Verslaggevers halen gevestigde autoriteiten aan en benadrukken hun eigen kennis. Forumgebruikers doen dat ook, maar anticiperen daarnaast volop op tegenargumenten. Met het benadrukken van de eigen eerlijkheid zijn journalisten niet bezig. Voor forumdeelnemers geldt het tegengestelde. Zij geven constant aan waarom ze niet over beeldmateriaal beschikken van hun ufowaarneming, benadrukken dat ze ‘normaal echt niet in ufo’s geloven’. Daarnaast geven ze enorm gedetailleerde beschrijvingen van hun ervaring om in te spelen op het gevoel van de lezer. Ook op het gebied van welwillendheid gebruiken forumdeelnemers meer technieken dan verslaggevers. Ze delen complimentjes uit aan anderen en maken gezamenlijke tegenstanders zwart. Als ze niet reageren op een vraag van een andere forumgebruiker, tast dat de ethos duidelijk aan. Journalisten benadrukken enkel de gemeeschappelijkheid van een eigenschap van het onderwerp. Juist die gemeenschappelijkheid maakt de dynamiek van ufo-verhalen uniek. Mensen van alle culturen, rangen en standen hebben al eeuwen de behoefte hebben om te praten over vreemde schouwspellen aan de hemel worden waargenomen. Wat de oorsprong is van deze ongeïdentificeerde, vliegende objecten is vooralsnog lang niet altijd te verklaren. Deze scriptie zegt iets over de manier waarop journalisten en forumgebruikers waarheden construeren.","['ufology', 'ufo', 'kwalitatief onderzoek', 'journalistiek', 'vernaculair']"

Het publiek verwacht dat een lokale journalist zowel een kritische waakhond is, als actief deelneemt aan de gemeenschap (Poindexter et al., 2006). Ook zijn lokale journalisten grotendeels afhankelijk van hun publiek als bron (Nielsen, 2015). In deze scriptie, een vervolg op het onderzoek van De Jong en Koetsenruijter (2019) naar het medialandschap in ZuidHolland, wordt onderzocht hoe nabijheid het werk van lokale journalisten beïnvloedt. Er is onderzocht welke rol nabijheid als nieuwswaarde heeft, en wat de invloed van nabijheid op de journalistieke functies is. Daartoe zijn er tien semigestructureerde diepte-interviews afgenomen met lokale journalisten uit Zuid-Holland en is er gebruik gemaakt van de bestaande data van De Jong en Koetsenruijter (2019). De belangrijkste conclusies van dit onderzoek zijn dat nabijheid een essentiële factor is als nieuwswaarde en als eigenschap voor een lokale journalist, dat nabijheid de informerende en verbindende functie versterkt, maar mogelijk een gevaar vormt voor de controlerende functie van lokale journalistiek.","['Lokale journalistiek', 'Nabijheid', 'Nieuwswaarden']"

Unity in Diversity? 'Christian Europe' in EU Debates on the Collective European Identity,"Thakoer, Sylvia","['Ieven, Bram']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"With the slogan ‘unity in diversity’, the EU has been striving to promote a European identity that EU citizens can identify with next to their national identity, and to stimulate cohesion between the European member states. This motto expresses an “imagined cultural community of Europe”, which uses history and heritage as a collective identity marker. In the twentieth century, the cultural heritage of Christianity has been viewed to descend as an identity marker. This is due to the increased secularization in Europe. However, secularism in Western European countries and the EU have been contested by other European countries in several cases. Hence, Christianity has reclaimed a critical role in the debates on the European identity. This thesis will study how Christianity, as a cultural and historical characteristic of Europe, plays a role in the debates on the collective European identity in the EU. A close analysis will be done on speeches and statements from EU political actors about the EU Constitutional Treaty and the refugee crisis.","['collective European identity', 'EU', 'Christianity', 'secularism', 'Constitutional Treaty', 'immigration crisis']"

"Trust, But Verify: How do State Actors ‘Contain’ Their Non-State Proxies? Examining the Iran-Hizbullah Relationship","Elias, Tarek","['Englert, Sai']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The research paper analyzes the first decade of the relationship between Iran and Hizbullah, one of the world’s most notable proxy relationships. By applying principal-agent theory to this relationship, the study seeks to illustrate the mechanisms which state actors employ to ensure that their non-state agents do not endanger their strategic objectives. Concretely, it is argued that state actors have three distinct mechanisms at their disposal which work to mitigate their proxies’ harmful behaviors. States can mitigate shirking behavior 1) by building monitoring and reporting structures that reduce information asymmetry, 2) by modifying the proxy’s scope of authority, and 3) by offering incentives or 5 levying sanctions on the proxy based on its activities and behavior. As such, the paper provides insights that serve the international community and security policymakers by illustrating potential avenues for undercutting the relationship between malign state actors and their non-state agents. Moreover, understanding the early decades of the relationship between the Iranian administration and Hizbullah may be crucial to comprehending Hizbullah’s current position within Lebanon as well as its linkages with Iran.","['Proxy Conflict', 'Principal-Agent Theory', 'Hizbullah', 'Iran', 'Containment']"
"""A Union of Europeans""? The European Union's Propagation of a Common Cultural Heritage in Constructing a Collective European Identity","Chin, Amanda","['Ieven, Bram']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis explores the approaches taken by the European Union (EU) in its attempts to construct a collective European identity. Though the Union espouses the motto “united in diversity”, a closer examination of its cultural policies and initiatives reveals a contradictory narrative, wherein the notion of respecting Europe’s “diversity” may be overshadowed by attempts at promoting “unity” through the idea of a cohesive shared heritage. The EU’s politicisation of heritage is therefore the focus of this thesis, as it has influenced the way culture and identity have been promoted following the Treaty of Lisbon in service of fulfilling the aim of an “ever-closer union”. However, the presentation of these concepts is always the result of a process of selection, which is of note in the context of the EU – its promotion of a collective European identity based on a “shared heritage” is also rooted, paradoxically, in the diversity found across its Member States. As such, this thesis seeks to highlight the contestations and contradictions found in the idea of a ""collective European identity"", which is especially relevant in light of the self-declared “existential crisis” faced by the Union today.","['cultural heritage', 'identity', 'Europe', 'EU']"

AN-Komposita in der kontrastiven Linguistik – Deutsch und Niederländisch im Sprachvergleich,"Rörsch, Mirjam","['Audring, Jenny']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,de,"In the field of comparative German-Dutch linguistics, there is a preconception that AN-compounds are much more productive in German than in Dutch (Booij 2019: 10, Hüning 2004: 160). After analyzing a list of German and Dutch AN-compounds, this does not seem true. Both languages have a substantial number of AN-compounds. In the framework of Construction Morphology, the productivity of a pattern is defined as the openness of one ore more ‘slots’ (Booij 2010, Jackendoff & Audring 2020). AN-compounds have two slots: in the first slot we find adjectives, in the second slot we find nouns. A pattern is productive if the slots are open for new words, so new combinations (new AN-compounds) can easily be made and understood. In this MA thesis, the lists of attested German and Dutch AN-compounds, collected from the Celex database (http://celex.mpi.nl), will be analyzed for each variable slot (A and N respectively). The goal is to find out which of the slots in the [AN]N pattern is more open and to identify potential restrictions for each slot. We could assume that some adjectives are more frequent than others, for instance that there are a lot of compounds which start with half-/ Halb- but not so many with the Dutch adjective astraal- or the German adjective achter-. This will raise the question whether the pattern [AN]N is productive or if it is just the subpattern [half-N]N and if those subpatterns influence our perception of the productivity of the [AN]N pattern. It might be possible that those subpatterns are in fact the productive ones instead of the [AN]N pattern itself. In this thesis I will research how productive the compounding of adjectives and nouns is in German and Dutch, what the differences are between the two languages and what the subpatterns tell us about the productivity of a word formation.","['german', 'compound', 'adjectives', 'nouns', 'AN-compounds', 'Komposita', 'dutch', 'kontrastive Linguistik']"

It approaches the advantages and downsides of using PMCs in times of war through the political and economic framework. It engages with several literatures re-assessing the role of PMCs in Iraq. Regarding the economic approach, it targets the cost and logistical benefits of contracting these firms through over-outsourcing, intelligence and logistics, additional costs and expenses, and the differentiation between private and conventional military operators. Furthermore, the focus of this paper is also to analyze whereas PMCs have a political mean. Thus, it explores the concept of depoliticization of war, lobbying and market adaptation and military independence. This paper concludes PMCs were crucial in Iraq to sustain United States military actions. It provided men power, vital logistics and intelligence. However, it was not effectively monitored and appeared to drain many unnecessary ressources. It questions also the role of the U.S government regarding the way it wages war and answer to its citizens.","['Iraq', 'Private military contractor', 'Bush administration', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Advantages and downsides']"
Defining the boundaries of violence: political xenophobia and hate crime in the United States,"Meer, Noor ter","['Maat, E. van der']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis discusses the potential connections between hate crime and xenophobia in the United States during the first two years of Donald Trump’s presidency. Drawing upon the academic debate on violence and the potential connections between different levels of violence, this thesis aims to contribute by researching the potential connections between a form of structural violence and a form direct violence. Through an analysis of White House documents and the FBI’s hate crime statistics, this study has sought to discuss the influence of Trump’s political xenophobia towards Arabs and Latinos on the number of hate crime incidents with either Arab or Latino victims. The case studies have illustrated that there is clear correlation between political xenophobia and hate crime towards Arabs and Latinos in the US, as the number of hate crimes towards these group increased after periods of clear xenophobic sentiment from the Trump administration. This thesis, therefore, argues in favor of a broader approach to the concept of violence, as acknowledging the true width of violence in societies is the only way to eradicate it.","['violence', 'xenophobia', 'hate crime', 'United States', 'Johan Galtung', 'Donald Trump', 'Arabs', 'Latinos', 'racism']"

Long May They Reign. On the Renewal of Kingship in Egypt and Hattie,"Cornelissen, Matthieu","['Müller, Miriam']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Both in Egypt and Hatti the renewal of kingship through festivals played an important role. This raises the question if there are similarities and/or differences between the two. An earlier comparison was drawn by Volkert Haas (Haas 1994) when he briefly compared the Egyptian Heb-Sed and the Hittite Purulliya. A comparison between these renewals of kingship can help us understand this concept in a broader sense, especially, since limited interdisciplinary research has been done concerning this topic. For this study a comparative approach will be taken, which looks for similarities and differences between the Egyptian and Hittite Festival. With the help of data originating from previous work on the Purulliya and the Heb-Sed. This is accompanied by archaeological, textual, and iconographical sources that are related to the festivals. The Egyptian side has a vast richness of sources and material. However, the sources from Hatti are largely textual. This discrepancy of sources poses a problem to this research. Thus, the comparison itself focusses on the underlying aspects of the festivals, rather than detailed aspects of them. Early results of this MA research involve the separate festivals and early stage comparisons between the two. They include a comparison on the core reasons for celebrating both the festivals. This comparison is accompanied by the general rules for celebrating each festival. Using these results, an early conclusion on festivals involving renewal of kingship between Egypt and Hatti is drawn.","['Egypt', 'Kingship', 'Hatti', 'Comperative']"

"The Dichotomy of Public Opinion in Bulgaria- why support the EU, but not the euro?","Dimitrova, Marina","['Broad, Matthew']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Public opinion has become increasingly important when it comes to furthering European integration. This thesis looks into the dichotomy of public opinion in Bulgaria, in which support for the EU has remained relatively high for the period since the country’s accession to the EU, while support for the euro has become relatively low. By employing a benchmarking theory, which posits that people’s attitudes towards the EU and its policies are formed in comparison to national contexts, this thesis seeks to explain this dichotomy. The analysis of Eurobarometer data from the past 13 years combined with analysis of online news media data provides an insight into why Bulgarians support the EU (as a regime) more than the euro (a specific policy). This thesis finds that while distrust in national institutions and the bleak economic performance boosts support for the EU, the same distrust might play a role in the negative perceptions towards the euro. While Bulgarians tend to trust the EU’s institutions and evaluate the EU economy better than the national one, they fear price increase, loss of control over economic policies, and even losing a part of their national identity when it comes to euro adoption.","['Public opinion', 'Bulgaria', 'EU', 'euro', 'regime support', 'policy support']"

However, videographic criticism, although popular has made slow progress in its attempts to assert itself in the world of contemporary film criticism. This thesis seeks to locate videographic criticism in contemporary film criticism by examining the state of contemporary film criticism by using Kevin B. Lee’s 2014 video essay, Transformers: The Premake as a case study. This thesis will begin by demonstrating that videographic criticism is a reflexive and relevant method for the production of film criticism. It will further examine how videographic criticism uses techniques associated with compactness and condensation to create arguments. In examining these methods, this thesis will finally interrogate the relevance of videographic criticism to contemporary media analysis and film criticism. Thus, this thesis finds the videographic criticism to be an effective and innovative way to produce meaningful, rich film criticism.","['videographic criticism', 'video essay', 'contemporary film criticism', 'condensation', 'compactness']"

The appearance, display and promotion of Japanese visual arts and culture are considered in the context of shifting power dynamics in the world that altered according to political changes, military conflicts, economic booms/downfalls, and the globalisation of culture. As a primary goal, this thesis explores the identity of stakeholders who played an important role in importing and promoting Japanese art and culture into the United States. At the same time, the thesis elaborates on the nature of the imported, exhibited and consumed Japanese artistic and cultural products and the variety of the main platforms and events at which these appeared. Finally, in reflection to the various socio-cultural, economic and political events, the thesis examines how the inflow of Japanese art and culture have shaped American public opinion, and vice versa, in the past and the present with assumptions towards the possible future.","['Japanophilia', 'Nihonjinron', 'museum', 'world fair', 'Cool Japan', 'Superflat', 'cultural diplomacy', 'soft power', 'Museum of Fine Arts', 'Boston', 'Takashi Murakami']"
Universality of Human Rights — A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Right to Life in Europe and Japan,"Nishioka, Shingo","['Ieven, Bram']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The European Convention on Human Rights stipulates the death penalty as an exception to the right to life. However, the punishment has been abolished completely in Europe through its subsequent Protocols and jurisprudential development of the European Court of Human Rights. As such, Europe (the Council of Europe and the European Union) insists that the death penalty should be abolished in Japan, while Japan continues to administer the form of punishment. One of Europe’s central arguments is that: (i) Japan has become party to international agreements that include the right to life; (ii) the death penalty violates the right to life; (iii) therefore, Japan should abolish the death penalty. In so arguing, Europe promotes the norm of abolishing the punishment as universal, while Japan does not accept such a claim. Against this backdrop, the thesis is guided by the following question: how do the conceptions of the right to life differ between Europe and Japan? It attempts to answer the question through undertaking a cross-cultural examination of the conceptions of the right to life within Europe and Japan. It does so through close-reading legal instruments and case law, taking into account the views of contemporary authors. In light of European and Japanese behaviours toward the two principal issues of the right to life, namely the death penalty and euthanasia, the study concludes by maintaining that, when concerning the conceptions of the right to life: (1) alienability of life (to take one’s life) is more generally accepted in Japan than in Europe; and (2) in Japan, public sentiments continue to play a significant role, whereas in Europe they do not. While the thesis does not claim for or against the death penalty, these differences suggest that specific understanding of each right within particular social orders should not be neglected in international communications.","['Human Rights', 'European Court of Human Rights', 'International Relations']"

Grammatical Gender in Second Language Acquisition: The Acquisition of Gender Agreement in Dutch by Late Spanish-Dutch Bilinguals,"Borisova, Bonka Zdravkova","['Mulder, Hannah de', 'Parafita Couto, Maria']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper investigates how well adult Spanish-Dutch bilinguals have acquired grammatical gender agreement in Dutch and whether individual speakers apply specific strategies to resolve difficulties associated with gender in Dutch. Both Spanish and Dutch have two-fold gender systems: Spanish differentiates between a feminine and a masculine gender; and Dutch distinguishes between a common and a neuter gender. In Spanish each gender is marked on the determiner and the adjective with a distinct morphological marker (e.g. the indefinite articles un – amasc and una - afem). In Dutch the indefinite article converges into one form for both genders (i.e. een) and the rules of adjectival agreement are less straightforward than the rules in Spanish. To examine how adult bilinguals handle the opaque Dutch gender system, data from four late Spanish-Dutch bilinguals (L1 Spanish, L2 Dutch), seven early Spanish-Dutch bilinguals and six monolingual Dutch speakers were collected by means of elicited production and analyzed for grammatical gender agreement on definite determiners and adjectival inflection. It was found that the four highly proficient late speakers of Dutch show non-target-like performance in their data involving agreement on both definite determiners and adjectives, regularly overgeneralize to the common gender, and tend to produce fewer indefinite than definite phrases in comparison to the monolinguals and early bilinguals. The findings in this study are discussed in light of previous research regarding the different mechanisms of child and adult (second) language acquisition of grammatical gender in Dutch (Blom et al., 2006, 2008; Prevost and White, 2000; White, 2003). The evidence from the current experiment suggests that: a. adults use two different routes for acquiring gender agreement in Dutch - a lexical route for agreement at the determiner, and a rule-based route for agreement at the adjective (Blom et al., 2006, 2008); b. adult speakers may have the knowledge of the rules of gender agreement in Dutch but are not successful in applying the rules consistently in their production (Prevost and White, 2000; White, 2003).","['grammatical gender', 'Dutch', 'L2 acquisition', 'Spanish', 'late bilinguals', 'determiners', 'adjectival inflection']"

Instead of living and training physically with al-Qaeda, more and more individuals are radicalized in their own country. With an average age of 26, al-Qaeda related lone-wolf terrorists are increasingly recruited online. The accelerating use of the Internet to radicalize and mobilize youth has become crucial for al-Qaeda. Not only does al-Qaeda launch, use and engage with several Jihadist websites, forums and social media, the use of gamification to engage with aspiring jihadists and to encourage violence is one of their newest strategies. And a very savvy one as well (Brachman & Levine, 2011). Where gamification is primarily used online, al-Qaeda uses gamification language offline as well. However, little to no research has been conducted considering the use of gamification language in al-Qaeda’s magazine Inspire. Even though al-Qaeda’s power has been weakened ever since the death of Osama bin Laden, a recent UN report of 2019 still warns that “Al-Qaeda senior leaders are strengthening the network’s global command structure and continuing to encourage attacks against the West” (US Intelligence Community, 2019, p.12). This research examines this question using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and gamification theory. Through this multimodal approach, this thesis analyses how al-Qaeda uses power relations through gamification language in order to create social identities and radicalize and recruit lone wolf terrorists.","['Gamification', 'lone wolf terrorism', 'Al-Qaeda', 'Recruitment', 'Inspire magazine', 'critical discourse analysis']"

Este intervalo temporal coincide, por un lado, con el principio de la dictadura de Augusto Pinochet y, por el otro, con el estallido social de octubre del año pasado que perturbó un país que, hasta unas semanas antes, se solía definir como """"un oasis de paz"""" en un continente inquieto como América Latina. Para ello, se analizan factores como un sector manufacturero debilitado y la relación de fuerzas entre grandes conglomerados industriales y PYMEs. Asimismo, se considera la excesiva dependencia de Chile de las exportaciones de recursos naturales - sobre todo cobre - y otras mercancías con muy poco valor añadido a la luz de su elaborado marco de tratados de libre comercio: a tal propósito, se observa como se decidió privilegiar la explotación de las ventajas comparativas del país y la influencia del sector exportador sobre estas políticas. Lo anterior significó que un amplio y duradero desarrollo económico se fue debilitando y que Chile nunca ingresó la liga de los países completamente industrializados.

Factors such as a weakened manufacturing sector, and the unbalanced relationship between large industrial groups (conglomerados) and local SMEs are addressed. Moreover, the flattening of economic development on exports of raw materials - copper in particular - and other products with no particular relevant added value is seen in the light of the establishment of a massive network of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements whose main aims have been exploiting Chile's comparative advantages and pleasing outward-looking economic sectors. As a result, a large-scale and long-term economic progress was undermined making the country unable to join the league of those fully developed.

On Creation-Stories: A Social Network Analysis of Leadership in The Silmarillion,"Kruijt, Eva Lisa","['Porck, M.H.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis studies leadership in J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Silmarillion by way of social network analysis (SNA) methods. I combine the fields of leadership studies and social network analysis by constructing and analysing the social networks in The Silmarillion. I analyse which characters act as leaders in a selection of tales from Tolkien’s Silmarillion, since these tales form the basis for Middle-earth and lay bare the roots of how power and leadership function in Tolkien’s secondary world. In order to do so, I use the social network visualisation software Visone, which also enables users to conduct various calculations on the constructed networks. Social networks can lay bare the key actors in a network and show the ways in which leaders exert their power, which is why I compare the Silmarillion network to networks that depict leaders and leadership types in real life. In doing so, I examine which characters come to the fore as leaders in The Silmarillion, how they exert their power, and how realistic the social networks in Tolkien’s fictional narrative are. The characters that came to the fore as leaders when observing the social networks of The Silmarillion were mostly kings and Valar. In this way, the results indicate that leadership is presented realistically in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Silmarillion, and they also provide information about the ways in which the leaders of the work exert their power. This thesis showed that SNA can be used successfully to study works of fiction, and that it could be further used in order to obtain a deeper understanding of Middle-earth, realistic fiction, and good leadership.","['Social Network Analysis', 'Narrative Sociology', 'Leadership Studies']"
Trade-offs of growth: Smallholder Farmers Inclusion In The Palm Oil Global Value Chain and Sustainability. Indonesia Case,"Manugas, Nicole Jular","['Henderson, Christian']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Smallholders are far from dead. In many cases around the world, smallholder farmers represent the backbone of rural and national economic development and are considered as both “beneficiaries and agents of sustainable development”. The expansion of commodity crops has positively impacted rural livelihoods, providing employment and boosting general well-being among rural communities. This, however, changed the way farmers interact with nature, leading to negative externalities such as deforestation practices, wildlife endangerment and unsustainable working environments. Palm oil (PO) has attracted global attention for its ambiguous and often problematic nature. On the one hand, palm oil’s market rapid growth in Indonesia raised dramatic environmental concerns, as its development has come at the expense of fundamental human rights and biodiverse, carbon-rich tropical forests. On the other hand, it brought rural development and increased the national economy, placing smallholder farmers on a leading position. To investigate this trade-off of growth, the thesis was guided by the research question “how does the inclusion of smallholder farmers in the PO GVC contribute to sustainable inclusive development?” and was supported by the following three sub-questions: 1. What are the socio-economic implications of PO expansion on smallholder farmers in Riau and Jambi provinces? 2. What are the environmental implications of PO expansion in Riau and Jambi and how are these linked to smallholder farming? 3. To what extent has smallholders’ participation in the PO GVC contributed to the shift to the sustainable production of the crop and what facilitates this transition? The thesis was built on the sustainable and inclusive development theoretical framework and shed light on the role of smallholder farmers in enhancing rural livelihoods and boosting national economic growth. The analysis concludes that PO production has played a relevant role in poverty reduction and economic growth in Riau and Jambi, Indonesia. More specifically, its expansion manifested into increased income, access to land and capital, rural development through infrastructure and services and improved household dietary quality and food security. However, because of the strong influence of the Indonesian government's transmigration programme, inequality among farmers arised, as transmigrant smallholder families were given financial and technical support, while autochthonous ones generally were left forgotten. At the same time, palm oil expansion has replaced substantial amounts of tropical forests and led to numerous land conflicts across Indonesia.","['palm oil', 'smallholder farmers', 'global value chains', 'deforestation', 'sustainable and inclusive development', 'agriculture', 'global political economy', 'trade-offs', 'Indonesia']"
The Annexation of Crimea: A Change in Russian Foreign Policy,"Makaske, Milou","['Skalamera, Morena']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"While Russia usually uses soft power to gain influence in the post-Soviet space, it decided to extend its influence in Crimea through an annexation, a strategy that Russia has not used (as of yet) in other post-Soviet areas. This thesis seeks to explain what factors explain Russia’s decision to annex Crimea next to continuing its soft power strategy. This research uses a constructivist approach and argues that culturally and historically constructed relations shape Russia’s foreign policy, and therefore, Russia’s foreign policy varies within the post-Soviet space. This research uses explaining-outcome process-tracing and a most-similar case study comparison to uncover why Russia decided to annex Crimea. The evidence suggests that while the Russian World is an essential aspect of Russia’s soft power strategy, Russia did not annex Crimea because it seeks to unite all compatriots in the Russian World. Instead, the evidence suggests that Russia annexed Crimea because of Crimea’s historical significance to Russia and because Russia seeks to regain its former great power status in the post-Soviet space.","['Russia', 'Annexation of Crimea', 'Soft Power', 'Foreign Policy', 'Post-Soviet Space']"
What do we owe the global poor? The importance of causal connection,"Lit, Fleur van","['Kalf, Wouter']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"What do we owe the global poor? Caney (2007) answers this long-standing philosophical question by arguing that there is a negative duty of justice not to foist an unjust global order on others and a positive duty of justice to eradicate all poverty that did not arise from the imposition of this unjust order. In this thesis, I argue that the first part of Caney’s conception is too narrow, and the second part is too broad. The first part of his conception is too narrow in scope because it attributes duties only to a limited number of people through membership of a relatively fixed shared structure. I argue, instead, that one gains a duty by being causally connected to the harm. This is a more inclusive broader approach that can account for almost all cases of poverty. The second part of Caney’s conception is too broad, I argue, since it is not a perfect duty of justice but an imperfect duty. My claim is that duties must be primarily attributed through causal connection and that for a perfect duty to arise a causal connection is crucial. Therefore, I argue that there is a perfect duty through causal connection and an imperfect duty without causal connection.","['poverty', 'moral duty', 'Simon Caney', 'causal connection', 'perfect duty', 'imperfect duty']"
Het visualiseren van tragedie en schoonheid: Miho Kajioka & analoge fotografie in een digitaal tijdperk,"Marchena, Evita","['Westgeest, H.F.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Recently, many contemporary photographers have started using analogue photography again. This is an interesting occurrence, since we’re living in a digital age where everything is technologically possible. It seems as if contemporary photographers using analog, step out of today's digitized society and into the world of old techniques. This thesis is a study about the use of photography in a digital age. The case study used in this research is the artwork And, where did the peacocks go? by Miho Kajioka. This photographer has created analogue images which are shown on the artist’s website and social media. Analogue and digital photography are widely discussed by media critics whose vision differs from each other. One group of critics advocates for analog photography and its material and indexical characteristics. Whereas, the digital medium has none of these components. The other group of critics advocates a new vision of the contemporary use of the medium photography. Based upon this debate, this thesis explores the relationship between contemporary use of analog and digital photography with Kajioka’s work as an example. Her work has different themes and elements that will provide insight into the complexity of indexicality in various forms. On this basis, it shows how the analog and digital medium has melted into each other and how the process of analog is important for the end result of Kajioka’s series.","['Analog photography', 'digital photography', 'Japanese art', 'peacocks', 'trauma']"

However, despite its successful emergence, 2019 saw the repudiation of the Spitzenkandidaten. Adopting a multi-method approach that speaks to current literature on the EU’s perceived democratic deficit, this thesis highlights that from pluralist, libertarian, social democratic, and deliberative democracy perspectives the 2014 Spitzenkandidaten improved the democratic legitimacy of the Commission Presidency, reducing the EU’s democratic deficit. This thesis further finds that the repudiation of the Spitzenkandidaten in 2019 constituted a retraction of this democratic legitimacy from three of the four philosophical perspectives, expanding the democratic deficit accordingly. Utilising the insights of MEPs further enhances these findings, grounding them in theoretical and practical terms. As one of the initial studies that have analysed the impact of the Spitzenkandidaten following its repudiation in 2019, this research holds significant potential to inform our understanding of the current shape of contemporary European democracy and the EU’s democratic deficit.","['Political Philosophy', 'Democratic Deficit', 'Pluralism', 'Libertarianism', 'Social Democratic', 'Deliberative Democracy', 'European Parliament', 'European Commission', 'European Union']"

Definitieve uitspraken over Van Warmerdams werk zijn vermeden, indachtig diens uitspraak dat hij een 'angst voor betekenis' heeft.

The success of gendered activism in South Korea since 2018,"Naqvi, Ibtisam","['Links, Stacey']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Feminist movements have existed since the late 19th century but the most recent wave of feminism has been particularly significant in South Korea. In 2018 numerous women came forward with allegations of sexual violence against people in power under the MeToo movement. This movement was popularized in the United States on social media and soon reached other parts of the world where it gave marginalized women a voice. The movement gained momentum in South Korea after prosecutor Seo Ji-hyeon opened up about sexual harassment allegations against a high-level prosecutor and spoke of pressure by state bodies to keep silent. The MeToo movement brought sexual violence issues from the private sphere to the public sphere and showed women that the country’s patriarchal system is unacceptable. In the following years there was a rise in gendered activism such as the “Escape the Corset” movement, that rejected South Korea’s rigid beauty standards, and anti-digital sex crime movement. This paper seeks to answer, “how successful has gendered activism been in South Korea since 2018?” The reason 2018 has been selected as starting point for the thesis is due to the start of MeToo movement that particular year. This topic will be analyzed by use of feminist theory due to it being one of the rising frameworks that is growing in importance and relevance. Feminist theory is focused on gender inequality and addresses many issues that the Korean women challenged in their movements. Along with feminist theory, the history of gendered movements is crucial when discussing feminist movements in South Korea and will therefore be examined in the literature review. To further establish the definition of success of contemporary gendered movements, the historical background of gendered movements in South Korea will be explored. By analyzing the history of gendered movements in South Korea dating back to the 1980s up to now, this chapter defines success and how success of feminist movements has been determined in the past. These case studies will be analyzed through a feminist lens to ascertain the degree to which they have been successful","['Feminism', 'South Korea', 'Gendered activism', 'Metoo', 'Escape the corset', 'Nth room case']"

De waarheid onder druk: Het belang van factchecken in tijden van nepnieuws,"Bitter, Jasper","['Sleutels, Jan']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Nepnieuws vormt een groeiend probleem. Op het internet en via social media worden nepnieuwsberichten op grote schaal en met enorme snelheid verspreid. Zulke berichten leiden ertoe dat burgers verkeerd worden geïnformeerd. Het huidige tijdperk wordt ook wel aangeduid met de term ‘post-waarheid’, om te benadrukken dat gevoelens prevaleren boven feiten. Nepnieuws speelt veelal in op gevoelens; of de achterliggende beweegreden nu politiek of financieel is, het mechanisme van nepnieuws is vaak hetzelfde: een zo groot mogelijk bereik bewerkstelligen. Nepnieuws leidt ertoe dat publiek en ook volksvertegenwoordigers slechter geïnformeerd zijn. Wanneer nepnieuws, dat op gevoelens inspeelt en feiten verdraait of volledig ontkent, op grote schaal invloed heeft, gaat de kwaliteit van het publieke debat achteruit, terwijl een kwalitatief hoogwaardig publiek debat onontbeerlijk is voor een goed functionerende democratie. De democratie komt door de verspreiding van nepnieuws daarom uiteindelijk zelf in gevaar. Factchecken is een belangrijke methode om nepnieuws tegenwicht te bieden en het publiek beter te informeren. De stelling die in deze scriptie wordt ingenomen, is dat factchecken van groot belang is om de democratie te beschermen in een post-waarheidtijdperk, waarin nepnieuws alomtegenwoordig is. Het publieke debat kan niet zonder feiten en een correct geïnformeerd publiek.","['nepnieuws', 'post-waarheid', 'democratie', 'publiek debat', 'filterbubbels', 'feiten']"
Branding Saudi Arabia: An Investigation of Tourism and Investment in the Saudi Vision 2030,"Bareiss, Johannes","['Kaptein, Nico J.G.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis has attempted to investigate the progress that the Saudi government has made in fulfilling the goals related to the components of immigration and investment and tourism in Saudi Vision 2030. It has attempted to do so using nation branding theory specifically, making use of interviews, surveys and analysis of primary and secondary sources to investigate this process. The findings of this research indicate that tourism and investment are important sources of potential economic growth that can help the country diversify economically. However, due to instability in terms of the political climate and the authoritarian nature of the Saudi regime, tourism has been negatively affected in the country. In addition, investor worries concerning scandals in the country as well as concern over the government’s ability to deliver on its promises has also cast doubt on whether the goals outlined in the strategic document can be achieved in time. Together, these cases corroborate the findings of other scholars that Saudi Vision 2030 is too ambitious and that the government’s attempts to focus exclusively on improving its image may backfire if it does not undertake other reforms in the country.","['Saudi Vision 2030', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Nation branding', 'Place branding', 'public diplomacy', 'nation brand', 'nation brand equity', 'economic diversification']"

"What does it take to be a citizen? A historical analysis of citizenship, from classical Athens to present-day Europe","Guido, Petra Sofia","['Tsagdis, Georgios']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In classical Athens there used to be a clear separation between those considered citizens, women, and foreigners. This separation used to be recognized and formally accepted in society. The notion of ‘citizen’ was used to legitimize the fact that a small minority of people living in the territory of Athens at that time held exclusive decision-making power. This legitimization was mainly founded on a cultural level but also had ramifications in the social and political realms. In present-day Europe, as well as in classical Athens, people of different social, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds coexist in close proximity, but interact differently. Distinctions between citizens and non-citizens are still present, but their characteristics have changed, and although the differences might appear to be less clear-cut, it is not always the case. In present-day Europe, with waves of migration and populism on the rise, people are trying to define what it means to be a citizen of a country. Although this notion is more distinctly defined from a political perspective, the socio-cultural aspect is not so clear-cut. Following intense migration fluxes in Europe during the past century, and the last decade in particular, the notions of ‘citizen’ and ‘foreigner’ have been questioned repeatedly. Therefore, it might be relevant and useful to look back in history at examples of these two notions, and examine the factors that constituted them and ways in which they were different. In doing so it will be easier to locate patterns in History that have already proven to be harmful for the coexistence of different groups of people within the same territory. Therefore, the purpose and driving question of the present thesis is ‘how can citizenship in classical Athens help us consider the contemporary inclusion and exclusion of individuals in a cultural, social and political sense?’","['Citizenship', 'Ancient Greece', 'Contemporary Europe']"

Invloed van media op Nederlandse politieke besluitvorming tijdens de Griekse crisis (2010-2015),"Zwarthoed, F.J.M.","['De Jong, J.C.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op de invloed van media-effecten op de besluitvorming van Nederlandse politici tijdens de Griekse crisis en de rol van de media in het werk van politici. De Griekse economische crisis woedde van 2010 tot 2015 en dreigde al snel een Europese crisis te worden. Uiteindelijk hebben Europese lidstaten, waaronder Nederland, drie steunpakketten verleend aan het land. In deze crisisperiode was er veel onzekerheid over de te nemen beslissingen. Van journalisten werd verwacht dat zij de crisis van duiding voorzagen. Bekend is dat media voor politici een belangrijke bron zijn. Het is daarom relevant om te kijken in hoeverre media een rol gespeeld hebben rondom de besluitvorming over de steunpakketten. De hoofdvraag is daarom: Wat is de invloed van de media op de Nederlandse politieke besluitvorming rondom de Griekse crisis? Door middel van inhoudsanalyses van Kamerdebatten en nieuwsartikelen en semigestructureerde interviews wordt antwoord gegeven op deze vraag. Allereerst wordt onderzocht hoe parlementariërs hun input leenden van de media in debatten. Daarna wordt in een time series analysis onderzocht of de media positiever zijn gaan schrijven over de steunpakketten toen besluitvorming dichterbij kwam. Als derde wordt onder de loep genomen in hoeverre media en politiek, ten opzichte van elkaar, gebruik maakten van de metafoor van besmetting van het Griekse probleem naar de rest van Europa. Ten slotte worden (ex-)Kamerleden bevraagd over de rol van de media in hun werk tijdens deze periode. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de media een belangrijke rol spelen in het werk van politici. Vooral in crisistijd gebruiken Kamerleden meer media om op de hoogte te blijven. Kamerleden erkennen de invloed van media op de politieke agenda, maar zien dit als een samenspel met de politiek. Hoewel Kamerleden niet vinden dat media een grote invloed hebben op besluitvorming, zeggen ze wel dat de mate van invloed verschilt per onderwerp en stellen ze dat media een grote rol spelen in de manier waaróp politici hun boodschap verpakken. Verder blijkt uit de kwantitatieve resultaten dat meer media in debatten worden genoemd naarmate besluitvorming over de Griekse steunpakketten dichterbij komt. Hoewel Kamerleden De Telegraaf niet noemen in deze debatten, lezen ze het wel om op de hoogte te blijven van het sentiment in deze krant. Daarnaast blijkt dat media, in 2010 en 2012, positiever gingen berichten over de steunpakketten bij het dichterbij komen van besluitvorming. Dit kan duiden op een opleving van enthousiasme over Griekse steun. In 2015 waren de media negatiever, wat ook correspondeert met de geringere politieke steun voor het derde steunpakket en de heftige politieke debatten in die tijd. Ten slotte blijkt uit de resultaten dat ‘kaderkranten’ zoals FD en NRC, vrijwel hetzelfde schreven over Griekse steun (allen meer positief dan negatief), in tegenstelling tot De Telegraaf, die meer negatief dan positief was. Geconcludeerd kan dus worden dat aanzienlijke invloed van media op het werk van politici er zeker is. Duidelijk wordt dat de toon in de media correspondeert met het debat en de besluitvorming in de Kamer. De invloed op besluitvorming is er in bepaalde mate, al is dat moeilijker te kwantificeren. Vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op andere casussen in de crisisverslaggeving, zoals de huidige coronacrisis, de financiële crisis van 2008/2009 of de war on terror in de Verenigde Staten.","['Griekse crisis', 'media-effecten', 'agendasetting', 'media-invloed', 'beleidsverandering', 'financiële crisis', 'Griekse steunpakketten']"

Therefore, this thesis will show that the financialization of the informal economy, especially in Cameroon, undergoes three steps: firstly the financial one, in which communities living in informal economies are approached by financial institutions offering microcredit, secondly through the economic one, in which microcredit is invested in informal business activities to regulate and formalize them, and finally through the social one, in which the economic power gained through the enhanced businesses is reflected on an empowerment of under-promoted categories, and on an improvement in education and healthcare, given the increased accessibility of funds to afford them.","['Microfinance', 'Cameroon', 'Africa', 'Microcredit']"

I use content and discourse analyses of news articles and reports of the 2018 FOCAC to distinguish different versions of the FOCAC story, as well as themes emphasized by the respective news outlets. I also conduct a visual analysis of television items concerning the FOCAC where I examine their source and emphasized discursive elements in the visual materials. By conducting this multifaceted analysis of media discourse of the FOCAC, this thesis adds a new angle to scholarly research on Chinese soft-power and cultural diplomacy in Africa.","['China', 'Africa', 'Soft power', 'FOCAC', 'Sino-African cooperation']"

Discursive Shifts: US Self-Image in Framing Sino-African Relations,"Stolt, Hanna","['Black, Lindsay']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"It is well acknowledged, both in academia and media, that the United States is highly pessimistic of China’s increased presence in international affairs. Often, this Sino-pessimism is expressed through US political discourse on Sino-African relations. However, upon closer examination, the US, starting in the second Bush-era, began from a point of reserved optimism in regard to Sino-African relations. This reveals that the notion that the US has remained static in its negative portrayal of Sino-African relations is inaccurate. This study will examine how the US political discourse surrounding Sino-African relations has evolved through the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations, and more importantly why this evolution has occurred. Using critical discourse analysis, this study examines US elite political discourse to reveal themes and unquestioned assumptions prevalent in the US portrayal of Sino-African relations. This study finds that the discourse used by each of these administrations reveals more about the US than it does about the Sino-African relationship. The Bush administration showed excessive optimism that manifested through coercive liberalism and believed that the Chinese would model their engagement with Africa on US engagement and become an ally in liberalising Africa. The Obama administration attempted to rehabilitate the international image of the US through grand rhetoric and international liberalism, while positioning China as the illiberal ‘other’ that was a threat to African freedom and dignity. The Trump administration represents a shift to realism, spouting Sinophobia in Africa while spouting anti-Africa rhetoric in the United States, with a stated aim of upsetting the liberal order to unclear ends. By tracking change over time, the US discourse reveals more about how the US was attempting to project its self-image at the time than it does about Sino-African relations.","['US Discourse', 'China-Africa', 'Trump Discourse', 'Discourse Analysis', 'Obama Discourse', 'Bush Discourse']"

Onderzoek naar het voorval concludeerde dat het geen ongelukkige samenkomst van omstandigheden was maar een gerichte bomaanslag tegen Letelier. Hij was namelijk de rechterhand van Salvador Allende, de voormalige president van Chili wiens regering ten val werd gebracht in 1973 door de Chileense generaal Augusto Pinochet. De aanslag op Letelier in Washington maakte deel uit van Pinochets internationale netwerk van staatsterrorisme genaamd Operatie Condor, een samenwerkingsverband tussen verschillende autoritaire Latijns-Amerikaanse régimes om linkse dissidenten op te sporen en in een aantal gevallen om te brengen. Een belangrijk aspect van de Junta van Pinochet was de diplomatieke relatie en het de facto bondgenootschap met de Verenigde Staten, wat werd opgesteld na de staatsgreep van Pinochet in 1973. Een belangrijk aspect van dit bondgenootschap was de intentie van beide naties om ‘Communistische invloeden’ op het Amerikaanse continent in te perken. De bomaanslag op Letelier in Washington door de Chileense Junta was echter een schending van de staatssoevereiniteit van de VS en daarmee een bondgenoot. Deze paradox in dit bondgenootschap tussen op het eerste gezicht twee naties met dezelfde ideologische doelen brengt de vraag naar voren welke oorzaken voor de aanslag in Washington te vinden zijn in de desbetreffende diplomatieke relatie tussen de Verenigde Staten en Chili. Een vraag die deze scriptie poogt te beantwoorden.","['U.S.-Chilean Relations', 'Orlando Letelier', 'Augusto Pinochet', 'Operatie Condor']"

Wayana is a Cariban language and this thesis specifically focusses on the language as it is spoken in the village of Apetina in the south of Suriname. My research approaches this subject using a transdisciplinary view in order to broaden the perspective on fauna to include indigenous knowledge which in turn can enlighten us about different conceptualizations of the world. Using the data collected from elicitations and spontaneous speech in the village over the course of two visits, I will attempt to create a semantic network of fauna terms. Issues on the perspective on fauna in Wayana include what their categorizations are for animals (e.g. what animals do they eat/do they not eat? How are the animals categorized, and in what priority?). I also attempt to create a better understanding of the role of fauna in ecological management and the role fauna plays in what could be called the “Wayana calendar”. This traditional ecological indigenous knowledge can lead to a deeper understanding of Wayana and the relation that the Wayana have with their natural world.","['Wayana', 'fauna', 'indigenous languages', 'suriname', 'folk taxonomy', 'constellations']"

Blessing or a Curse? A Critical Reflection on the Strategy for African Mining Paper and Discussion of its Effects on the Political Economy of (Informal) Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining in Sierra Leone,"Gautsch, Christina M.","['Wilson Janssens, Maria Catherina']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Sierra Leone is the perfect example of the resource curse. Despite 80 years of diamond, gold and gemstone mining, the country ranks low on global development. This thesis examines the main recommendations in the World Bank's Strategy for Africa Mining paper (1992) in order to determine how they affected the (informal) ASM sector in Sierra Leone and therefore shaped its political, social and economic structures in the long-run. In the literature review, topics on the distinctive features of ASM in sub-Saharan Africa, informality, formality, hierarchy, gender- and power relations are discussed. Using thematic analysis (deductive approach), this thesis identified four themes on economic growth, African agency, modernisation and formalisation in the strategy report. These re-occuring themes and the focus on LSM gave an incomplete understanding of ASM. This resulted in Sierra Leonean authority grouping all types of illicit mining activities altogether. Economic liberalisation policies and formalisation efforts implemented in the African mining sector paradoxically led to mass unemployment and the proliferation of informal ASM in Sierra Leone. Several trends and patterns in the contemporary (informal) Sierra Leonean ASM sector are examined and linked back to the main recommendations in the strategy report.","['artisanal and small-scale mining', 'Sierra Leone', 'Structural Adjustment Programmes', 'neoliberalism', 'informal sector']"
Towards Equal Sharing of Care? A Review of the Influence of the European Pillar of Social Rights on Work-Life Balance Policy,"Suorsa, Heidi Johanna","['Shaev, Brian']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In 2017, the European Commission, the Council of the EU and the European Parliament came together to agree upon the introduction of a “European Pillar of Social Rights” - the EPSR. It entails a set of 20 social principles already recognized as binding in the EU social acquis, or that are yet to be implemented at EU or the domestic level. A recent deliverable thereof includes the Work-Life Balance Directive adopted in 2019. This thesis seeks to determine whether the EPSR can facilitate equal sharing of care within families and explores alternative approaches to that effect. The thesis argues that whereas the EPSR may have been criticized for merely paying lip service to social Europe, its strengths lie in its flexibility. A non-rigid approach to advancing social rights accommodates a wide diversity of preferences and facilitates enhanced cooperation as well as coordination of policy which both on the long term as well as on the short term may contribute to the advancement of social rights on an EU level, in particular in the field of care sharing in the family.","['work-life balance', 'European Pillar of Social Rights', 'gender equality', 'European social policy', 'social Europe']"
‘Fighting a ghost’. Collecting data and creating knowledge on sex trafficking in the League of Nations between 1921 and 1939,"Post, Emma Johanna","['Schrover, M.L.J.C.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the understanding of sex trafficking in the League of Nations as well as the ways in which the changing international environment influenced the image of sex trafficking in the interwar years, with a focus on how the League collected data, how it interpreted data, but also how it misrepresented sex trafficking. I argue that a shift in the debates within the Advisory Committee on Traffic of Women and Children can be discerned. This committee started off with a focus on mobility, which shifted to abolition and regulation, and finally to prevention and punishment. These shifts were influenced by the immediate post-war environment, the increased role of the state and the economic crisis in 1929. The committee was faced with different challenges and tensions that shaped the knowledge that was produced about sex trafficking. The image of sex trafficking they created is still topical today. Rather than repeating this image, I will critically engage with it and point out how sex trafficking came to embody a variety of issues that were prevalent at that time, such as miscegenation, emancipation and nationalism. By treating this committee as an example of international cooperation, of data collection during the interwar years and of experts gaining a better understanding of a ‘global’ issue, I will add to lively historiographical debates about transnational history, the importance of the League of Nations and the historical study of gender.","['League of Nations', 'Transnational', 'Sex trafficking']"

The present study focuses on crosslinguistic differences of intrusion of the spatial domain within the temporal domain by comparing Native English speakers to Mandarin-English bilinguals. With deviation in linguistic construction of space = time metaphors between the two languages, the main question subject to this study is whether linguistic differences bear influence on the conceptualization of the abstract domain of time. Furthermore, an insight is given in the manner abstract concepts are concreted by the human mind with an emphasis on bilingual processing. As the processing within the bilingual mind has been subjected to much debate over recent year, an attempt to reconcile various views has been laid bare. The present study exists of two replicated tasks which yielded different conclusions in their original state. While the results of the present study remain inconclusive, one task hints at a global difference between Mandarin-English bilinguals' conception of time and English native speakers' conception of time.

It is very extensive and has played a big part in influencing the Thai culture. Migration of Chinese to Thailand is a part of the Thai Chinese relationship that this thesis will be examining. Evidence of Chinese settlers has been dated back to the 12th century. History has shown that through circumstantial reason and cultural similarity Chinese migrants has adapted to the Thai society to the point of becoming a part of it. Despite this, in the modern time, newer Chinese migrants and the host country are facing challenges within a world that has becomes more complicated than the ones in the past. This leads to the question of viability of Chinese assimilation in modern times. This thesis seeks to draw a comparative analysis of two different waves of Chinese migration to Thailand from the year 1918-1955 and the year 1979- present. This will be done through examining the governmental policy and international relation that surrounds the migration from both Thailand and China.","['Thailand', 'Migration', 'China', 'Assimilation', 'International Relations', 'Nation building']"

In order to do so, a structuralist approach to International Relations and nationalism have been combined with a domestic approach to foreign-policymaking. The case study of the Khaleej Times newspaper explores, through a qualitative content analysis, how nation-building and nationalism have been flagged (sign-posted) in news items in the context of the Yemen war. The results show that while the UAE is heavily invested in its military intervention abroad, the news-making is focused on ‘softer’ subjects such as humanitarian aid. On the other hand, the approach of accounting for structural elements proves to be insightful. In a globalised, multipolar world, small states with enough resources can project power ‘above their leagues.’ To sum up, nation-building is certainly a continued effort in the UAE. The UAE relies heavily on its image to fulfil her geopolitical aims. What is apparent from the results of this study is that the UAE relies rather on soft power than “pure” hard power to achieve its foreign policy goals.","['UAE', 'Yemen', 'Nation-building', 'Banal Nationalism', 'Military Intervention', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Soft Power', 'Hard Power', 'Threat Perception', 'Small States', 'Gulf Studies', 'National Identity', 'Security Complex']"

Piketty is right: inequality of wealth is a problem. Now what?,"Lonzieme, Machiel","['Verbeek, Bruno']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Piketty claims the inequality of wealth is increasing and that this will cause problems of justice. Even though he might be right in his first claim, he has been criticized that he lacks the proper moral arguments to defend his second claim. Yet, that does not mean he is wrong. To demonstrate why inequality of wealth is unjust, I will first need to determine what justice requires. To do so, I will examine Dworkin’s and Anderson’s theory of justice. I will argue that following either Dworkin or Anderson, Piketty is right and the current level of wealth inequality is unjust. Therefore, justice requires us to do something to reduce inequality. I will assert that a direct taxation of wealth is the best tool to do so. To examine how this would work out in practice, I will analyse the situation in the Netherlands. I will show that current wealth tax rates are strikingly low, but that merely increasing these rates would not work as a solution as people are poorly informed and use fallacious moral arguments. For that reason, I will follow Prabkahar in my conclusion that as a first step, it is essential to make people aware of the workings of taxation.","['Piketty', 'inequality', 'Dworkin', 'Anderson', 'inheritance tax']"

While the George W. Bush administration has been greatly studied by various scholars and journalists there is little research that combines the ideology of norm decay to President George W. Bush and human rights. Specifically, in regards to the physical and mental human rights violations that occurred during the War on Terror. An in-depth analysis through the use of a theoretical framework that consist of three benchmarks will be applied to two sperate case studies; focusing on the policy tool of extraordinary rendition and the prisoner abuse in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. By analyzing the potential pattern that emerges from the case study analysis it will allow us to determine whether there is a decay in human rights norms. The two aforementioned case studies will be evaluated against three criteria and the outcome of this will determine if there is a consistent pattern of decay. The first criteria, analyzes the number of cases of human rights violations and how these have changed during the George W. Bush administration. The second, analyzes the changes in procedures and polices enabling prisoner abuse and human rights decay. The third, analyzes accountability focusing on how the George W. Bush administration interfered in legal proceedings enabling more abuse. Conceptualizing how a norm, regarding physical and mental human rights could decay. In this context, this thesis examines how the terrorist attacks on the domestic United States resulted in a change in counter-terrorism policies, and how those changes influenced human rights as a social norm leading to a decay.","['Human Rights', 'President Bush II', 'Norm Decay', 'Torture', 'War on Terror', 'Extraordinary Rendition', 'Abu Ghraib']"

The European Migrant Crisis of 2015-2016: Revealing the Failure of the Common European Asylum System,"Schouten, Elisabeth","['Tsagdis, Georgios']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Through an in-depth analysis of the EU's response to the European migrant crisis of 2015-2016, the shortcomings of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) are revealed. This study investigates what factors led EU member states (MSs) to violate the CEAS' principles of solidarity and fair responsibility-sharing in their response to the European migrant crisis of 2015-2016. Whereas a collective response in a spirit of solidarity was expected, MSs implemented unilateral measures driven by their national political interests. Through qualitative research and content analysis of the CEAS' legal setup as well as a case study of Hungary and Germany's responses to the migrant crisis, this study has identified two dominant factors that explain for the lack of solidarity and fair responsibility-sharing in the EU's response to the crisis. Firstly, this study argues that insufficient compliance rates with the CEAS as well as some of its dysfunctional legal instruments, such as the Dublin Regulation, have led MSs to violate the principles of solidarity and fair responsibility-sharing. Secondly, it argues that national political climates and interests have affected the MSs’ willingness and ability to comply with the CEAS' principles of solidarity and fair responsibility-sharing. In order to prevent a similar crisis from unfolding in the future, the CEAS' legal instruments must be revised, however, any attempt at creating a reformed CEAS should take into account individual interests and contexts of MSs.","['European Union', 'Migrant Crisis', 'Solidarity', 'Burden-sharing', 'Populism', 'Hungary', 'Germany']"

This critical juncture created the conditions under which a significant change in Dutch foreign policy towards Russia became possible as institutional constraints were suddenly loosened. By using process tracing this thesis studies the changes in Dutch foreign policy and the causal mechanism behind them following the downing of the airplane. The Dutch government initially took on a cautious position as it was hoping Russia could be convinced to cooperate with the investigation. However as the Kremlin continually spreads disinformation about Flight MH17 and consistently seeks to discredit and undermine the investigations, the Dutch government started to use more confrontational and less accommodating diplomatic tools. This is evidenced by the way in which the Dutch government exposed the foiled OPCW hacking attempt by the GRU as well as how it criticised Russia’s behaviour surrounding the downing of Flight MH17.","['Dutch Foreign Policy', 'MH17', 'Russia', 'Netherlands', 'Ukraine', 'Critical juncture', 'Disinformation']"

The EU and its member states claim to respect human rights in their foreign migration policy. At the same time, European foreign migration policy is characterised by restrictive access to the EU and tight border controls based on the securitisation of migration. This thesis takes a critical stance on European foreign migration policy, not only discussing the area of tension between human rights and state interests, but analysing how a humanitarian discourse like the fight against human trafficking is appropriated to advance state interests. Using a critical framework comprised of neoliberal governmentality and mobility studies, this thesis offers a different perspective to think about human trafficking of migrants. A Critical Discourse Analysis of the Rabat and Khartoum Processes, two multi-lateral policy initiatives that govern migration beyond European borders and claim to fight human trafficking, reveals the necessity to re-think migration policy, include migrants as political agents in the policy process and address questions of unjust global power relations.","['Human Trafficking', 'European foreign migration policy', 'Critical Discourse Analysis']"

The Effect of Different Types of Intra-Sentential Code-Switches on Cognitive Control Costs,"Aristodimou, Nataly","['Pablos Robles, L.', 'Geambasu, A.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"The bilingual brain has the ability to control and switch between languages at any given moment. This alternation between two languages is known as code-switching (Bullock & Toribio, 2009), which requires cognitive control mechanisms to inhibit the first language once the second language is encountered (Green & Wei, 2014). During the process of switching from one language to the other, costs have been observed, which are assumed to mirror the effort required to access the target language schema. With this background in mind, this study examined the influence of intra-sentential code-switch types on cognitive control costs on (N= 70) L1 Greek L2 English bilinguals. We used an executive function task, where participants were presented with code-switched and non-code-switched sentences that were followed by either a comprehension question or a Flanker trial. Comprehension findings showed that higher scores in Accuracy lead to greater cognitive effort, and thus, costs on monolingual conditions, and in the presence of a code-switch, the costs and levels of Accuracy were decreased. Results from the Flanker task demonstrated a significant link between code-switching type and direction: the performance on Alternational Conditions demanded greater levels of inhibition, and entailed larger costs compared to Insertional Conditions, that caused lower costs. However, the overall performance was better when on the direction of the switch occurred from the L2 to L1, in all levels. Lastly, it was observed that after a code-switch sentence, the performance on Flanker Congruency was faster and more accurate in incongruent than congruent trials. These results provide evidence of the processing demands that intra-sentential code-switch types generate in terms of domain-general cognitive control cost mechanisms.","['Bilingualism', 'Cognitive Control', 'Code-Switching', 'Comprehension', 'Flanker Task', 'Processing Costs']"

Extreme climate events are predicted to happen more often in the coming years due to global warming, which may affect issues such as food security. This thesis examines the Mossi population in Burkina Faso, through the Sustainable Livelihood Framework, in order to understand the extent to which culture shapes the vulnerability of Burkinabé rural livelihoods to climate change. Mossi culture is intrinsically related to their resource management. Collectivism is strongly present in the Mossi population in Burkina Faso, expressed in the sharing of vital resources with all members of the household. Ethnographic research has identified the importance of human capital, natural capital and social capital for Mossi livelihoods. Both labour, food, water and land are influenced by social capital which, in turn, is shaped by the culture of collectivism and sharing. Thus, the Mossi are more focused on the well-being of the entire community than their individual well-being. Yet, within these households, inequality based on age and gender is still present, specifically women will be more vulnerable to climate change due to the power relations embedded in the culture, as their adaptive capacity to climate change is more negatively affected.","['Burkina Faso', 'sustainable livelihoods', 'vulnerability', 'climate change', 'culture', 'resource management']"

Significant devices that have been used include digital technologies and creative activism. This paper analyses how digital technologies and creative activism combined together in digital art can serve as a successful framing device for social movements. To do so, it examines the digital art created by Sudanese artists during the Sudanese Resistance Movement of 2019. During this Revolution, the artworks were spread rapidly across the web. They served as a suitable device for the movement, as it was seen as a loophole through which artists and activists could convey political messages, without direct confrontation. Furthermore, the artworks served as vehicles to spread information about the ongoing situation in Sudan, especially when formal media platforms were lacking. And finally, the artworks generated a sense of solidarity and unity amongst the movements participants, through symbolic illustrations and adaptations of iconic images. Due to the characteristic of the artworks being digital, the information was being spread across social media. Consequently leading to more awareness on a domestic and transnational level by challenging the notions of political and social awakening in Sudan.","['Sudan', 'Social Movement', 'creative activism', 'digital art']"

The heavily interventionist and militarist sanitary methods used by each power were masked by the façade of scientific neutrality and colonial efficiency, but each regime encountered resistance to their policies from the Filipino and Indian populations. This thesis explores and compares the plague and cholera epidemics, with an emphasis on what made each outbreak unique within its own context, and on their similarities despite the perceived difference between each colonial power. At the core of this thesis is the question of how colonial governance and indigenous responses to it were conceptualised in the context of the disease epidemics. An analysis of official government accounts of each epidemic demonstrates that, despite their claims to the contrary, colonial thinking and discrimination always undermined the scientific values that the British and American regimes so often espoused.","['Disease', 'Epidemics', 'Colonialism', 'Philippines', 'American Imperialism', 'British Imperialism', 'India', 'Colonial Governance', 'Indigenous Resistance', 'Race']"
