Mozambique: An identity in Crisis,"Brummelhuis, Rafael","['Stathopoulos, Athanasios', 'Gawthorpe, Andrew']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"After more than 400 years of European imperial powers influencing the region of Mozambique and exploiting its population and a 10 years independence war (1964-1974) Mozambique gained independence in 1975. But the country that FRELIMO inherited was a country with divisions along cultural, linguistic and rural, urban lines. The country lacked a national identity as well as a developed state with resilient and established institutions. The idea of self determination and national identity, in an increasingly globalised world, has become more prominent. This has led to different strategies to aid the creation of a national identity being employed by governments of newly independent African nations. Thus, with the help of academic articles as well as the two documentaries Kuxa Kanema and Treatment of Traitors, this thesis will look at the different strategies employed in the creation of national identity and the challenges in the case of Mozambique after it’s independence until the democratic era of Mozambique. This paper will take a multi-disciplinary approach analyzing the strategies used in the domain of media, politics, linguistics and culture.Therefore, arguing that the multicultural nature of Mozambique could be used to form a Mozambican identity based on duality.","['Identity', 'Multi Culturalism', 'Cold War']"

Omani Ibadism: Guide to a peace-seeking foreign policy?,"Hooghwinkel, Jasper","['Schonmann, N.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Undoubtedly one of the much lesser known schools of Islam, Ibadism may also be considered one of the most secretive among the various Islamic sects. Solely to be found in Oman as official state religion, it sets the country apart from any other Arab Muslim state. The same can be said of the Sultanate’s unique foreign policy in the region. Often explained with reference to the alleged tolerance and peacefulness emanating from Ibadism, Oman’s ‘foreign policy of zero problems’ is unparalleled in the Arab world and beyond. A solid foundation for this supposed nexus between the country’s official religion and its peculiar foreign policy, however, remains lacking. On the basis of a social-constructivist role theory, this research paper investigates the soundness of this supposition. Involving a thematic analysis of Oman’s participation in UN General Assemblies over the years as well as a careful examination of its foreign policy in practice, this research paper assesses the role of Ibadism with reference to its main principles in accounting for Oman’s foreign policy behaviour. The conclusion is drawn that the ideational factor of religion in the form of Ibadism does serve as a convincing account by which to make sense of an overall trend in Oman’s distinctive foreign policy behaviour, namely Oman’s efforts at seeking peace with its regional counterparts.","['Oman', 'Ibadism', 'Foreign Policy', 'International Relations', 'Religion']"

"Are They Shaving, Cutting or Shearing the Sheep? A Comparison between the English Lexicon and Pronunciation of Students in Monolingual and Bilingual Education in the Netherlands","Roelofs, Vera","['Smakman, Dick']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this research the English proficiency of two groups of students who attended the same secondary school in the Netherlands are compared. The first group of students followed a monolingual pre-university programme, while the other group attended a bilingual preuniversity stream. After an explanation about the differences between these two programmes and an exploration of earlier research into pronunciation and vocabulary acquisition, this study examined what the differences/similarities were between these two groups in terms of oral proficiency after five years of secondary education. Twenty students, ten of each programme, were asked to complete two tasks. For the first task they were asked to read out a text, and afterwards their pronunciation of pre-selected vowels and consonants was analyzed with the speech analysis program Praat. The second task required the students to first describe a painting by Breughel in their own words and then to describe five specific scenes on the painting. The results showed that there were slight differences between the oral proficiencies of monolingual and bilingual students and that both groups of students had not acquired a set of characteristics that all of them adhered to in terms of vowel and consonant pronunciation. A lot of variation existed between the two groups, even though the agreement was stronger in the bilingual group. When comparing both groups’ lexicon quantitatively, the bilingual group clearly expressed themselves more extensively in their second language than the monolingual group, but qualitatively speaking the bilingual students did not appear to be familiar with more lower-frequency words than the monolingual students.","['monolingual', 'bilingual', 'education', 'Netherlands', 'Praat', 'Speech', 'Lexicon']"

Post-Conflict Interventions in Impunity States,"De Luna, Lorenza","['Gijn, Erik van']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Guatemala and El Salvador experienced instances of destructive political violence in the 1980s that affected the population and the judicial and political systems. Research has shown that international interventions in post-conflict countries have a positive influence in restructuring a long-lasting peace through legal empowerment and reduction of violence. This thesis aims to determine whether postconflict international involvement can be successful in establishing just legal and political systems in a context of culture of impunity. Building on existing literature and on UN reports, it answers the following research question: to what extent has the culture of impunity influenced the degree of success of the post-conflict UN interventions in Guatemala and El Salvador? In this context, culture of impunity is defined as a deep-rooted tradition of political injustice that manifests itself with the incapacity to prosecute perpetrators of atrocities. The analysis of historical facts and their comparison to the recommendations by the UN Commissions indicate that, despite the cultural-specific approach used, international interventions resulted partly successful in Guatemala, yet unsuccessful in El Salvador. The culture of impunity affected both countries in the implementation of recommendations, yet with divergent developments in the two cases. On this basis, it is highlighted the importance of avoiding generalisations when suggesting recommendations in post-conflict settings; considering that all countries have a different degree of responsiveness to international aid as well as unique socio-cultural and political features.","['political violence', 'international interventions', 'Truth Commissions', 'culture of impunity']"

Power through Commerce: Discovering the Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade on the Kingdom of Dahomey,"Van Drimmelen, Bart","['Van der Wal-Remy, A.M.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this master thesis I argue that the Atlantic slave trade had considerable impact on the kingdom of Dahomey. This newly emerging trade network influenced all aspects of their society. The politically fragmented Slave Coast turned out to be vulnerable for the wealth of the slave trade. Endemic warfare caused fierce competition which resulted in stratocracies that tried to gain control over direct access to European merchants. Dahomey became a primary example of such a military-fiscal state. The continuous search for legitimization of power resulted in desire for wealth to strengthen their military. The execution of power through force became the guiding principle of this kingdom. The interaction with European trade organizations clearly show the dependency of Dahomey on slave trade. Acquiring direct access to the slave trade made the consolidation of Dahomey less complicated, although the Slave Coast would never become a peaceful region. Through guns and mercenaries this state managed to maintain control over the Slave Coast and with monetarization and state formation the famous king Agaja succeeded in creating a centralized empire. However, harmful depopulation and the loss of many lives made the acquired wealth came at a high price.","['Dahomey', 'Slavery', 'Atlantic', 'Slave', 'Trade']"

First, the current literature on the ICC’s African bias and the African judicial system will be reviewed. Next, it will be analysed why the African Union (AU) and its Member States see the ICC as biased against Africa. Then it will be analysed what the AU’s judicial response is to the ICC’s African bias and how this response seeks to interpret international criminal law. Based on these reviews and analyses, this research concludes that the ICC’s African bias has affected the judicial system in Africa at regional and international levels by creating a continental human rights and criminal court that has jurisdiction over international criminal law. This research ends with the observation that the African Court on Justice and Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACJHPR) is created to replace the ICC as both Courts have jurisdiction over crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide and the crime of aggression. However, the replacement of the ICC could create an extra layer between Africa and the ICC, once the relationship and hierarchy between the two Courts are established.","['International Criminal Court (ICC)', 'African bias', 'African Union (AU)', 'Malabo Protocol', ""African Court of Justice and Human and Peoples' Right (ACJHPR)""]"
"An unguent container as an Egyptian royal gift: The function and value of calcite-alabaster drop jar during the Late Bronze Age in Egypt, the Levant, and Cyprus","Crabbé, Audrey","['Müller, Miriam']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The Late Bronze Age presents a peak in the cultural interactions between the different empires of the Eastern Mediterranean. Both bulk goods and small quantities of luxury products were exchanged between the kings and the local elite over long distances. In April 2019, one of these luxury products was discovered at the Cypriot site of Pyla-Kokkinokremos. This was an Egyptian calcite-alabaster drop jar incised with geometric and floral decorations. This master's thesis places this unique find in a broader context by undertaking a detailed comparative study of all the decorated calcite-alabaster drop jars discovered in Egypt, the Levant, and Cyprus. By doing this, the function, value, and role of the calcite-alabaster drop jar throughout the Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age will be proposed. For all the calcite-alabaster drop jars discovered in Egypt, the Levant, and Cyprus, the shapes, decorations, find contexts, and associated finds will be described in detail. Furthermore, a closer look will be taken at the faience and bronze drop jars, the iconographical representations, textual sources, and results of the residue analyses of the preserved remains inside of several drop jars. In Egypt, drop-shaped ceramic vessels were starting from the First Intermediate period commonly used as storage jars. This drop shape was starting from the New Kingdom adopted for smaller vessels produced in more precious materials, such as calcite-alabaster, bronze, and faience. The find of these drop jars in a rich variety of contexts, not only in Egypt, but also throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, makes this group of objects exceptional. Eight calcite-alabaster drop jars were discovered in Egypt, originating from mainly royal and elite tombs buried with a variety of other precious objects. In addition to the calcite-alabaster drop jar discovered at the short-lived trading settlement of Pyla-Kokkinokremos, three calcite-alabaster drop jars were unearthed in the royal palace at Megiddo and in a rich tomb in the Kharji cave at Beirut. The finds of the drop jars in a variety of contexts throughout the Eastern Mediterranean constitute of compelling evidence for the function and value of the calcite-alabaster drop jar in Egypt, the Levant, and Cyprus, and its role in the diplomatic exchanges.","['Late Bronze Age', 'calcite-alabaster', 'unguent container', 'Egyptian drop jar']"

More specifically, the language use of 11 practice nurses was investigated on manifestations of so-called ‘mental health care-language’, which is specialistic and contains terms related to mental disorders, and the preferred ‘general practitionerlanguage’, which is a more generalistic and neutral ‘type’ of language use. A total of 28 transcribed consultations were analyzed, applying a combined quantitative and qualitative research design. Firstly, the consultations were coded with the VR-CoDES-P (Del Piccolo et al., 2011). Findings showed the practice nurses responded mainly with non-explicit, space providing reactions, of which most with back-channels. In the second part of the study, the practice nurse’s language use was stylistically analyzed, using the ‘Checklist van Nederlandse Stijlmiddelen’ (Stukker & Verhagen, 2019) and the concept of alternative choices in formulation (Van Leeuwen, 2015). Results indicated, that in over one third of the consultations, the practice nurses spoke in ‘mental health care-language’. Instances in which the nurses spoke in this language ‘type’, were for mainly the result of the nurses merely mirroring the patient’s way of talking or reading out loud a medicine leaflet. Identifying manifestations of ‘general practitioner-language’ appeared to be less straightforward; it was found that the practice nurses used a wide variety of (neutral) formulations with which they rephrased the psychological complaints their patients voiced.","['practice nurses mental health', 'POH-GGZ', 'language use', 'VR-CoDES-P', 'stylistic analysis']"
An Incomplete Revolution in Burkina Faso?,"Radford, Albert","['Wilson Janssens, Catherina']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Burkina Faso is a West African state that continues to experience political troubles that stem from previous colonial rule. For four years in the 1980s there was a possibility that Burkina Faso could develop into a country capable of benefiting the majority of the population. However, following the assassination of Thomas Sankara, this hope did not extend beyond the four years he was in power. The recent uprisings, starting in 2014, have re-ignited past hopes of what Burkina Faso could have been and what it could yet be. The philosophies and actions of Frantz Fanon and Thomas Sankara remain relevant in understanding the reasons why Burkina Faso has not experienced the benefits that independence should have brought. They are also reference points for understanding how a favourable society might come about for the Burkinabé. Political social movements alone have had short term successes with regards to potentially changing the political governance of this West African State. What is important for the future of Burkina Faso is turning these short-term political gains into long-term political reality. It seems that governments, social movements and musicians combined will continue to have the most impact upon the future of Burkinabé civil society.","['Sankara', 'Fanon', 'Independence', 'Social Movements', 'Music', 'Politics', 'Burkina Faso']"

"France Against ISIS: the Far Enemy, the Near One, and the Making of the French Counter-Terrorist Apparatus","Courtioux, Paul","['Berger, Maurits']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Muslim terrorism and radicalization have been topics of increasing concern in the West since the beginning of the 21st century. The rise of the Islamic State, commonly referred to as ISIS, which experienced a rapid and unexpected development after 2014, increased these widespread concerns related to Muslim terrorism and radicalization. This thesis tackles these topics from the perspective of France, a country that has been hardly hit by ISIS since 2014. Thus, the aim of this paper is to analyze how the Islamic State, and Muslim terrorism more broadly, have influenced the making of the French counter-terrorist apparatus. This research provides a detailed overview and analysis of the concrete impact of these phenomena on the French counter-terrorist apparatus, and delves into the role played by key counter-terrorist actors through the preemptive and reactive measures that have been taken in order to counter the Islamic State. Further, this research looks at the implications of the dynamics existing between the Islamic State and France, and investigates the resulting limitations that affect France's counter-terrorist system, in terms of overall efficiency and, more importantly, regarding the respect of fundamental human rights. This paper suggests that further research should be conducted on this topic, in order to gain a proper understanding of the processes and dynamics that are at play in the elaboration of counter-terrorist measures aimed at providing appropriate answers to existing and upcoming threats.","['Terrorism', 'Islamism', 'Radicalization', 'Counter-terrorism', 'Islamic State', 'France', 'Foreign fighters', 'Security']"

His notions of the (dis)embeddedness of markets and the double movement have proven to be useful concepts in the analysis of the origins and effects of the financial crash of 2008. However, currently there is an intellectual debate going on between so called hard- and soft-Polanyian scholars on the understanding of the notion of (re)embedding the market. Soft-Polanyians believe in the possibility of embeddedness and see in this Polanyian idea a call for the social-democratic ideal. Hard-Polanyians on the other hand do not understand Polanyian thought in this way and argue that Polanyi has never believed in the possibility of (re)embedding the market, since attempts to do so can only backfire societally. In addition to an analysis of this ongoing debate Polanyi’s moral and ethical approach in the conceptualization of the economy will be addressed in this thesis, with special attention to the notions of market dependency and human livelihood. Ultimately, the different perspectives present in this discussion are used to make an assessment of the potential(s) of the imposition of the financial transaction tax as it is currently underway in the legislative process of the European Union.","['Karl Polanyi', 'Financial transaction tax (FTT)', 'European Union', 'Market embeddedness', 'Double movement', '(De)commodification', 'Regulation', 'Capitalism', 'James Tobin', 'Global Financial Crisis of 2008']"
The Battle for Democracy in Egypt: Understanding the Imbalance of Power in Post-Revolutionary Egypt,"Visser, Rens","['Henderson, Christian']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"A review of the literature on the political landscape of post-revolutionary Egypt identifies a widening gap between the elite. Scholars highlight the dominance of the Egyptian military’s business empire, a combination of high-ranking government officials and big corporations that together forms the elite. In 2011, the people of Egypt successfully overthrew an authoritarian regime paving the way towards a democratic state and a relieve of economic injustice. To date, the people of Egypt still find themselves in positions defined by inequality of opportunity, why? Contributing to critical scholarship, this thesis builds upon various scholars to gain insights into the different mechanisms and social drivers that keep the elite in a position of dominance and identifies areas in which the public can acquire political power. Three spheres of power; politics, economics, and media, are explored to highlight the social relations that are often hidden in organizational structures. This research provides a new answer to the question why, and how, the elite maintains its dominant position in a state that desires democracy and civil liberty. The implementation of a combination of theories examines the class division and distribution of power to answer this thesis’ main research question: Through which means can the people of Egypt gain political, media and economic power to achieve democratic governance? The findings of this thesis provide a contextualized account of the division of power in Egypt and give attention to the mechanisms that shape the relationship between the elite and the people.","['Egypt', 'Elite', 'Class Division', 'Power', 'Political Participation', 'Democracy']"

In order to do so, two well-known Reggaeton songs were analysed. The analysis was made through the close reading of the denotative and connotative meaning expressed in the lyrics and critical discourse analysis with musical discourse analysis. By using two songs sung by women this thesis explores, through a feminist lens, the appropriation of the musical genre of reggaeton as a subversive tool for commentary on gender stereotypes. This research concluded that Reggaeton is transformed by the relevant artist into a feminist instrument for the dissemination of feminist messages since the female characters have a history of constantly defending themselves from prejudices for instance, whereas males do not.","['Reggaeton', 'Spain', 'Feminism', 'Musical Discourse', 'Lyrics', 'Female empowerment', 'Feminist movement']"

The Fridays for Future movement with thousands of young climate strikers counters these statements. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the facilitating role of social media on youth political participation. This thesis analyses how social media contributes to the formation of a collective group identity of social movements, which in turn could lead to collective political action. To answer this question, content analysis of comments on three Instagram posts by Fridays for Madrid have been used, looking at the four foundations of collective group identity: solidarity, emotional attachment, group cohesion and activist-based identification. The results demonstrate the facilitating function of social media in the formation of collective group identity, by enabling more easily and frequently interaction between participants and the social movement compared to offline social movement activities.","['collective identity', 'political participation', 'social movements', 'social media']"

This paper is concerned with the question how radical right populism relates to a modern day understanding of fascism. This thesis will first answer the question of what populism is and then compare this to a theoretical approach to fascism. Because I will follow the understanding of populism as a political style a special attention will be given propaganda and how it is delivered to a given constituency. The case study used in this these is the Modi led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. Within the context of this case I will focus on Mann Ki Baat, a monthly radio show held by the Indian Prime Minister. Throughout the text of this thesis I hope to show that radical right populism and fascism have too many similarities, in respect to its definition, theoretical approach towards these concepts and performance, to ignore. Furthermore, I will argue that the perceived direct communication that Mann Ki Baat and social media facilitate are closer to propaganda than a genuine political exchange. The research presented here is building on and adding to the growing literature on populism, social media in the political sphere and radical right politics.","['Radical right populism', 'fascism', 'India']"
The Marked Nominative in Dhaashatee - the Language of the Burji in Southern Ethiopia,"Voith, Johanna","['Mous, Maarten']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The Highland East Cushitic language Dhaashatee (often referred to as “Burji”) has two ways of marking the nominative on common nouns: (1) the “long nominative”, marked by the suffixes -ku (m) and -shi (f), and (2) the “short nominative”, marked by the suffix -i (m) or vowel shortening (f). In past publications, the usage of the two forms has been linked to definiteness. However, different authors do not agree as to which nominative is definite and which one is indefinite. The goal of the present study was to shed more light on the conditions that determine the choice of one or the other nominative in stories. For the bulk of the data, previous hypotheses have been confirmed according to which modified subjects are marked by the short nominative, while unmodified ones are marked by the long one. Yet, the choice of the nominative is not only based on syntactic principles, but also on discourse-related ones – i.e. whether a participant is newly introduced or re-appears. Thus, an unmodified subject may be marked by the short nominative if the referent has appeared in the story before, while a modified subject may be marked by the long nominative if it appears for the first time. What requires further research is the question under which conditions the discourse-related principle may override the syntactic one.","['Highland East Cushitic', 'subject marking']"
Exploring Asymmetric Power Relations in a Transboundary River Basin - An Application of the Hydro-Hegemony Framework to the Congo River Basin,"Mlyneck, Donna Marie","['Smith, Karen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The complex and fluid molecule H2O water addresses multiple societal needs. A plethora of water resources, however, are not situated within one single country, which reveals that water crosses static political boundaries and does not respect state sovereignty. Thus, there are water-related scholarly studies, which contain various hydro-political frameworks, which describe and evaluate international hydro-relations within transboundary river basins. The aim of this thesis is to explore the asymmetric power relationships in the Congo River Basin by using the Framework of Hydro-Hegemony, which brings forward a new proposal for the analysis of international transboundary water relations. In order to do so, this thesis operationalises the conceptual framework to put it into practice. The results of the application of the Framework of Hydro-Hegemony to the Congo River Basin show that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the Hydro-Hegemon in this international river basin, which exercises power over the transboundary water resources in the region. More specifically, it has clear geographical, bargaining, and ideational power advantages due to its predominant geographical position in the Congo River Basin and its role in the regional river basin organisation CICOS.

REFRAMING ARGENTINA’S ECONOMIC CRISIS HOW NI UNA MENOS IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE COUNTRY’S CRISIS TO MOBILISE THE POPULATION,"Rio, Coline","['Alves Vieira, Eduardo', 'Churampi Ramirez, Adriana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Recent feminist movements, such as Ni Una Menos, have been protesting Argentina’s gendered social structure since 2015, which has been challenged and evolved over the past 40 years through the actions of other social movements. As Argentina entered a new period of economic uncertainty in 2018, Ni Una Menos emerged as a key actor in opposing the government’s economic policies, seemingly drifting away from its original goal to advance women’s rights in the country. This thesis therefore analyses the movement’s motivations behind its involvement in protesting the current debt crisis in Argentina. It finds that economic crises undoubtedly impact women to a higher extent than men, explaining Ni Una Menos’ involvement. Furthermore, an analysis of the declaration of strike of March 8th, 2020, suggests that the movement might be motivated by a desire to increase its mobilisation base. By using the consequences of the economic crisis and the implications of the debt to foster critical consciousness in the Argentine population, it can increase protests and advocate for deeper structural change.","['Social movement', 'Argentina', 'mobilisation', 'Ni Una Menos', 'Economic crisis']"
"Ethos, Pathos and Putin: How Vladimir Putin weaves a narrative that justifies his foreign policy","Drost, Niels","['Skalamera, Morena']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis analyzes how Vladimir Putin uses ethos and pathos to justify his foreign policy in Syria, Donbas and Crimea. To answer this question, 27 of his original Russian speeches on these topics have been subjected to a Critical Discourse Analysis, engaging with the insights of ancient and contemporary rhetoric scholars. The results show that Putin consistently weaves three narratives that run like a thread through his speeches. First, Putin presents himself as a kind, intelligent, and respectful leader who has an adequate amount of experience and supports the people. Second, Putin persistently shows that Russia only has good intentions for the world. Last, Russia finally stands up for its interests after years of suppression and humiliation by the hypocrite West. These results not just illustrate the rhetorical techniques that underlay Putin’s account of Russia’s foreign policy. They also provide an insight into the worldview of the vast majority of Russians because of a media monopoly of the Kremlin. As such, this thesis contributes to a growing corpus of research that emphasizes how Putin’s words are of importance.","['Ethos', 'Pathos', 'Rhetoric', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Russian Foreign Policy', 'Syria', 'Donbas', 'Crimea']"

Moving Beyond the ‘Foreign’: Transnationalism and Korean Identity in the Films of Bong Joon Ho,"Minderman, Jamie","['Crandol, Michael']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper deals with the correlation between transnationalism and Korean identity in the films of Bong Joon Ho. The aim of this research is to highlight the presence of transnationalism and Korean identity in Bong Joon Ho’s films, by examining specific segments of the films that illustrate this. The research demonstrates the interrelationship or conjunction of both transnationalism, with its influences from other film industries, and the reformulation or re-appropriation of the Korean identity in Bong Joon Ho’s films. The research question reads as follows: “How did Bong Joon Ho develop a transnational style of filmmaking that is successful globally, while still retaining a distinct South Korean identity?” In order to answer this question, the research presents all that has been written previously by scholars on the topic of Bong Joon Ho’s style of filmmaking and the concept of transnationalism in relation to East Asian film. In addition, this paper analyses four of Bong Joon Ho’s films, ​The Host, Snowpiercer, Okja​, and ​Parasite​. This research posits that Bong’s distinctive style of transnational filmmaking has been a worldwide success, due to his ability to accommodate to global audiences by transforming and improving Hollywood genre conventions, while addressing global issues. Furthermore, Bong’s incorporation and expression of Korean identity in his films are perhaps what makes Bong Joon Ho even more successful, due to the renewed interest in globally familiar topics from different cultural perspectives.","['Transnationalism', 'Film', 'South-Korea', 'Korean Identity', 'Glocalisation']"

A community in transit: the lived experience of non- socio-cultural integration of Eritrean urban refugees into the Ethiopian host community in Addis Ababa,"Pusch, Melat","['De Bruijn, Mirjam']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Ethiopia is a popular destination for Eritrean refugees, due both to its close proximity and its since 2010 implemented progressive policy allowing Eritrean refugees to reside out of the camps and in its cities, such as Addis Ababa, granted they would be self-sufficient. However, this scheme did not allow refugees to work. As a result, in 2016, the country vowed to increase its commitment and pledged to improve refugee laws by providing education, employment rights, and basic services. It was thought that Eritrea and Ethiopia’s historical relationship and cultural similarities would support the socio-cultural integration of Eritrean refugees into the Ethiopian host community. However, in reality, the level of integration amongst Eritrean refugees in Addis Ababa is still relatively low. To investigate this phenomenon, the following research question is proposed: “Why are many Eritrean refugees not socio-culturally integrated into Ethiopian host community in Addis Ababa?” This paper uses a qualitative approach to illustrate and analyse the ethnography of Eritrean and Ethiopian communities in two areas in Addis Ababa, Bole Arabsa and Mebrat Haile Gofa. Data was gathered through informal, open interviews and participant observation. A thematic approach was also used to draw conclusions from the data, to engage with the topic in new way and lastly, it offers valuable insights into the socio-cultural integration of Eritrean urban refugees within their host communities. The study’s findings indicate that language plays a key role in the overall process of integration, however, in the case of Eritrean refugees in Addis Ababa, many do not feel incentivized to learn the local language, which is Amharic. Furthermore, refugees’ knowledge of another language spoken in Ethiopia, Tigrigna, leads to discrimination by other ethnic groups. A review of past theoretical approaches to this topic suggests that religion is another key facilitator for integration. However, even though both Eritreans and Ethiopians hold similar religious beliefs, their religious practices are entirely separate. The same holds true for food and coffee ceremonies, to a large extent. This is caused by the marginal interaction between the two communities, leading to both living entirely separate and in parallel to each other. Social integration is made even more complex by the poor treatment of refugees by local authorities, as well as general mistrust from both sides due to a further consequence of their historical past, which still has a significant impact today. More importantly, access to the local economy is close to non-existent for Eritrean refugees and are therefore dependent on remittances from abroad for financial support. Moreover, this paradigm creates a circular problem, as remittances further limit their involvement in the local economy. Lastly, as Ethiopia is a transit destination, refugees are further disincentivized from staying in Addis Ababa.",

Draconian counterinsurgency campaigns: why do authoritarian regimes use mass killings when countering insurgencies?,"Timmermans, Sjoerd","['Maat, Eelco van der']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this dissertation, an integrated theory is proposed in order to test why authoritarian regimes engage in mass killings during counterinsurgency operations. The current state of research is limited, scholars who studied the phenomenon either stuck to explaining parts or lacked the necessary overview of factors that can lead to mass killings in counterinsurgency operations. Within this research, three strands of literature that relate to either mass killings, authoritarian counterinsurgency or counterinsurgency in general are proposed that provide competing answers to the research objective. Subsequently, this integrated body of literature is applied to three cases: Iraq, Guatemala and the Soviet Union. The findings show that the threats stemming from the insurgents, and in this conceptualization more specifically the nature of the insurgency, the regime crisis as a result of the insurgency and the dysfunctionality of previous conventional measures provide the most feasible explanations for why authoritarian regimes engage in mass killings. Additional value is attributed to both veto player interests and elite ideology in determining authoritarian decision-making in the light of draconian counterinsurgency measures. The research moreover shows that the respective reasons to engage in mass killings influence and sometimes enforce each other.","['counterinsurgency', 'Mass killings', 'authoritarian', 'draining the sea', 'elite rivalry', 'elite ideology', 'threats stemming from the insurgents']"

He has been at the head of the largest country in the world for nearly twenty years and has brought autocracy, according to his critics, and stability, according to his supporters. This research will remain focused on Putinism as an influential mechanism on other heads of state, informing the research question: To what extent has Putinism influenced the policies of Viktor Yanukovych and Ramzan Kadyrov from the year 2000? This topic is relevant as Putin’s charisma does play a severely important role in modern geopolitics, which has affected not only political opinions, but also wars and revolutions such as the Euromaidan Revolution, the annexation of Crimea and the war with Chechnya. Putinism is therefore presented as the theoretical framework of this research. For the purpose of this thesis, a comparative case analysis is put in practice, using the cases of Ukraine and Chechnya in order to answer the research question. Lastly, the conclusion will sum up the findings proving that both Yanukovych and Kadyrov were heavily influenced by Putinism.","['Foreign Policy', 'Putinism', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'Chechnya']"

"Qaddafi's Ghost in Libya's Crisis: Authoritarianism, Oil and Economic Development","Fedeli, Francesca","['Englert, Sai']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The thesis critically examines major theories within the debate concerning authoritarianism, resource wealth and economic development in order to explain developments in Libya’s economy in the past 50 years. The literature review presents some perspectives regarding authoritarianism as a factor of economic stagnation and as a requirement for initial stages of economic development. With regard to resource wealth, the paper mainly relies on the resource curse theory and the staple thesis, which conceive resources respectively as a curse and a blessing. The focus of this paper is analysing how these two factors, namely authoritarianism and resource wealth, have remarkable effects on economic development through their debilitative effects on institutions, while arguing that effective and accountable institutions are fundamental in fostering economic development due to their contribution in setting a legal framework marked by a good rule of law, anti-corruption policies and regulations. The institutional question is therefore central to this paper, which presents the developmental prospects of the Libyan economy as being undermined by the country’s statelessness, perpetrated by weak institutions and lack of capacity. The conclusion is that the underdevelopment of Libya’s institutions, fostered by authoritarian rule and resource wealth, was the driving force in undermining Libya’s economic development.","['Resource Curse', 'Authoritarianism', 'Economic development', 'institutional capacity', 'Libyan crisis']"

In/Outside Art History. Self-portraiture and the Canon: Re-reading for Self and Other,"Alting, Julia","['Zijlmans, Kitty']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates various self-portraits by women artists that stand in relation to the structures of the art historical canon: Autoritratto (1969), a book posing as a self-portrait, composed by art critic and radical feminist Carla Lonzi (1931-1982); the painting Self-portrait as Tahitian (1937), made by Indian-Hungarian artist Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941) in Paris, and the photograph Lady in Moonlight (2004) by contemporary Indian artist Pushpamala N. (b. 1956) in collaboration with British photographer Clare Arni (b. 1962); and the interpretations and translations of self-portraits of Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) or “mythic Frida”. These case studies occupy different places on the axes of art historical canonicity: ranging from how a self-portrait attempts to deconstruct canonical structures (Autoritratto), to how citations can show the stage of production of the canonical (Self-portrait as Tahitian and Lady in Moonlight), to how canonical structures approach the most famous self-portraits by a woman artist (mythic Frida). I stage a conversation between these diverging practices of self-portraiture and the dynamics of canonisation they elucidate, and ask how positionings of Self and Other, inside and outside, guide this relationship. Ultimately I argue that the shifting positions of Self and Other are emphasised and mobilised to shape the relations between these self-portraits by women artists and the canon. These positions are assembled in order to reach varying effects: 1) to deconstruct hierarchical art discourse by shaping the Self through Others in order to generate horizontality, and by positioning the art critic inside to attempt a move outside of the canon (Autoritratto); 2) to bodily perform the canon’s gendered structures through a double bind position in which the artist is placed simultaneously in- and out-side the canon, and positing not only the Self as Other, inherent to any self-portraiture, but also the Other as Self (Self-portrait as Tahitian and Lady in Moonlight); 3) to prevent ‘Others’ to the canon from becoming canonical in a universal sense, as when self-portraits by a woman artist enter inside the canon the Self and the private sphere are overemphasised (mythic Frida).","['canon', 'canonicity', 'self-portraiture', 'inside/outside', 'Self/Other', 'feminist art history', 'global art history']"

Nonetheless, the Chinese government decided to implement protectionist export policies since the country faced several issues in its domestic rare earth industry. China started the export restrictions around 2008 but the situation escalated in 2010 when China cut off 40% of its exports. This decision has led to a lot of disagreement between China and the rest of the world since many importing countries depend on China’s rare earth elements. Moreover, there was a lot of disagreement in the academic world as well since some scholars have analysed China’s export restrictions as a policy that supports development in its domestic rare earth industry whereas other scholars argued that China’s protectionist export policies did not support development. This thesis is a study on China’s export restrictions in its rare earth industry and aims to identify if China’s protectionist export policies have contributed to a solution for China’s domestic issues in its rare earth industry.","['China', 'rare earth industry', 'export policies', 'protectionism', 'economic diplomacy']"

I will review different definitions and suggested characteristics of populism and create an overarching definition in order to understand what populism is. In this study, I performed a quantitative research to analyze Wilders’ discourse by focusing on important elements in populist speeches. More specifically, this study focuses on the use of references concerning ‘the people’, what elements influence discursive strategies and the focus on different etymologies in order to arrive at a better understanding of the ideas and rhetorical tactics of populist parties. This led to the conclusions that Wilders’ discursive strategies are affected by the topic of a speech, the audience and the date when the speech takes place. Furthermore, I conclude that the etymologies of references concerning ‘the people’ and ‘the opposition’ are of importance to Wilders because of his preference to use Germanic words to refer to ‘the people’ and loanwords to address ‘the opposition’.","['Wilders', 'quantitative research', '‘the people’', 'discursive strategies', 'etymologies']"

Like a fire, anti-Muslim violence spread across the country. Buddhist monks organised and spread a narrative of Buddhism in danger and a Muslim threat. Through sermons, they incited violence across the country. Hence, this thesis has asked what roles have monks played in the outbreak, and how through these roles they could spread a narrative of Muslim threat- It further discusses which narratives they have spread and why these narratives resonated in Myanmar and incited violence. The thesis will approach the issue from a historical approach by analysing the development of roles of Buddhist monks in Myanmar’s society before approaching it from a socio-political angle, discussing the role of monks within society. Research shows that through the roles as teachers and counsellors, as well as having authority over morality, monks have been able to exert immense influence over the Burmese society and people’s behaviour. Through their access to large parts of society, monks have been able to spread a narrative of a Muslim threat and a vulnerable Buddhist society. This narrative could resonate within the population due to historic preconditions and uncertainty in Burmese identities through the political transition.”","['Myanmar', 'Rohingya', 'Buddhist violence', 'Buddhist monks']"
Into the Future: Youth Participation and the Sustainable Development Goals in China,"Castagnet, Ines","[""d'Hooghe, I.M.A""]",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the last few years, the topic of sustainable development has gained international traction. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) are far diverse and far-reaching. Therefore, for China to achieve the 2030 SDG’s, China needs to take a multistakeholder approach. This thesis focuses on the youth as the primary stakeholder for analysis. The role that youth participation plays towards SDGs in China, however, remains relatively unexplored in academic research. Yet the youth is an important stakeholder, as it holds significant importance for their future. The youth in China represents a significant demographic where 227 million youths account for 17% of the population. This thesis seeks to take an exploratory approach to understand how youth participation (YP) in China plays a role in China’s national and international ambitions to achieving global SDGs. Because of the lacuna in literature which connects youth participation, the SDG’s and China simultaneously, the relevance and current debates that contribute to the context of SDGs in China and youth participation are first explored separately in the first two chapters. Before introducing the case studies, the third chapter outlines the theoretical framework. The theoretical framework has chosen contemporary models of Jans and Backer youth work and social participation1 and the Typology of Youth Participation and Empowerment (TYPE) framework. They are used to understand social context and the influence of the youth-adult power dynamic in youth participation of the SDGs in China. The fourth chapter introduces the methodology, the case studies, and limitations of the research. The fifth chapter highlights findings of youth participation, and the last chapter provides analysis and discussion of the results to answer the research question.","['Youth Participation', 'Sustainable Development Goals', 'China', 'Non-governmental Organization']"

Verloren Op Chinsura: Een analyse van het bestuur van Nederlands-Bengalen tussen 1814 en 1825,"Wiersum, Jolyon","['Bes, Lennart']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Tussen 1814 en 1825 zijn een aantal voormalige VOC-bezittingen in Bengalen geretourneerd aan het Nederlands Koninkrijk. Deze bezittingen waren tussen 1795 en 1814 in de handen van de Britten gekomen, die de regio maximaal wisten te exploiteren. Als gevolg van de korte periode van Britse bestuur waren de bezittingen vrijwel volledig economisch onhoudbaar geworden voor de Nederlanders. Ondanks meerdere berichten over de situatie vanuit Bengalen besloot de Nederlandse overheid alsnog de bezittingen weer in te nemen. Dit onderzoek analyseert de reden voor de teloorgang van de kolonie aan de hand van primaire bronnen over het koloniaalbestuur. De reden voor de ondergang van de kolonie is dat na de Britse teruggave van de regio de politieke en economische omstandigheden te hinderlijk waren voor de Nederlanders om de kolonie nog rendabel te maken. Gedurende de elf jaren van Nederlands bestuur is de kolonie langzaam afgebrokkeld met alle sociale, politieke en economische gevolgen van dien. Uit brieven, rekeningen en andere primaire bronnen uit Nederlands-Bengalen blijkt dat de situatie bij het Nederlandse bestuur van Bengalen bekend was en dat er tevergeefs pogingen gedaan zijn om Nederlands-Bengalen te redden. In deze tijd werd het bestuur van Nederlands-Bengalen gedwongen een steeds wanhopiger financieel beleid te voeren.

The United Nations and the Diplomatic Gift: The Contribution of Artworks to Social Solidarity,"Hurrelbrinck, Wietske","['Scott-Smith, G.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis argues that practice of presenting gifts to the UN by member states constitutes a vital part of the diplomatic discourse at the UN, as the gifts contribute – positively or negatively – to social solidarity by reflecting on the identity of the UN and the gift-giving motives related to instrumentality and power. This argument is substantiated by drawing on Komter’s (2009) theoretical framework, by drawing on Lister and Wells’ (2004) cultural studies approach to visual culture and by the analysis of an American gift, Canadian gift, and Soviet gift. The main findings of the analysis of the historical context, the context of viewing, the context of production and distribution and the material, cultural and social properties of the gift indicate that the gifts donated to the UN contribute to social solidarity irrespective of the political or cultural dispositions of the donating member-state based on the three aforementioned aspects. Nonetheless, the gifts do emphasize different aspects based on the self-interest of the donor.","['Komter', 'Lister and Wells', 'Diplomatic Gifts', 'Social Solidarity', 'United Nations', 'US', 'Canada', 'USSR']"
Lost in Translation? Habermas on religion in the public sphere,"Meester, Jos","['Fossen, Thomas']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates Habermas's approach to the role of religious reasons in public deliberation. A critique of Habermas's theory is developed along three lines. First, it is argued that Habermas's work oversimplifies religious reasons by treating 'religious reasons as a singular phenomenon. Thereby, Habermas underplaying the diversity of ways people practice religion. Second, this thesis argues that the translation of religious reasons to the language of public administration might prove harder than Habermas presents it. Third, Habermas's claim to have developed a 'postmetaphysical' theory fails to convince, as Habermas makes fundamental metaphysical assumptions. This undermines the neutral character of his account of religion in the public sphere. This thesis suggests an alternative approach may be available in the literature: instead of distinguishing between religious and non-religious reasons, we should distinguish authoritarian and non-authoritarian reasons. This preserves the deliberative spirit of Habermas's project, while more accurately filtering out the modes of reasoning that are unhelpful for advancing constructive deliberation.","['Habermas', 'Religion', 'Public sphere', 'Institutional translation', 'Postsecularism', 'Postmetaphysical thinking']"
Kenyan Food Insecurity: The World Bank's Contribution,"Pryor, Jasper","['Williams, Corey']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The World Bank has been increasingly involved in post-Independence Kenya’s agricultural development since the drought of 1973 and the Oil Crisis of the same year. Their stated objectives across these loan agreements and Structural Adjustment Programs have been to liberalise trade and ultimately create a situation of food security in Kenya. In the years that have followed, Kenya has continued to be a major exporter of horticultural goods such as cut-flowers and black tea. Yet Kenya has not emerged as a food secure nation. In fact Kenya is now recognised as a food insecure nation. This is undeniably a highly complex issue with all manner of contributing factors, most notably the worsening climate crisis and internal displacement this has caused. However, Kenya is East Africa’s largest and arguably most stable economy with hugely profitable agricultural exports. Kenya is also a nation unlike many other African nations in that its most valuable natural resource is its soil rather than what lies beneath it. Despite this, more than a third of Kenyan children suffer from stunting meaning chronic malnutrition in pregnant women and children is widespread. This research therefore utilises a theoretical framework based on elements from the Neoliberal Theory of Development, Postcolonial Theory and World Systems Theory to analyse how the World Bank’s loan conditionalities have contributed to Kenya’s status as food insecure. With many of these loans still in the process of being repaid this research focuses on the impacts they have had thus far.","['Kenya', 'Food Security', 'World Bank', 'Neoliberalism']"
Securitizing the Border: The Politics of the Border and the 9/11 Discourse in the US-Mexico Relations,"Ichim, Ioana Ileana","['Regilme, Salvador Santino']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Has the US-Mexico border security been redefined in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks? If so, how is this reflected in US policy and public discourse? This thesis considers the period immediately prior to and after 9/11 and proposes to look into three distinctive policy areas, namely drug enforcement, immigration, and counter-terrorism. Incorporating theoretical insights from constructivism and the Copenhagen School of security studies, as well as conceptual accounts of discourse in post-structuralist understanding, the paper investigates the changing practice and politics of US border security before and after 9/11 and assesses implications on the US-Mexico bilateral relations. This analysis highlights a complex nexus o non-military factors that pertain to security; it contends that the border was discursively framed as a national security threat by turning it into the point of intersection between aspects traditionally perceived as ""threats""- drug trafficking and immigration- and the discourse of the war on terror. Ultimately, it discusses how the US redefined the role played by its Southern border in order to serve its national interests and consolidate influence in the North American region.","['US foreign affairs', 'securitization', 'border security', 'US-Mexico bilateral relations', 'constructivism', 'drug trafficking', 'immigration', 'terrorism']"
The Power of Memory in Augustine’s Philosophy: Tracing Original Christian Philosophy in Book X of the Confessions,"Wezenbeek, Martijn","['Haas, Frans de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"In ancient thought memory has long been regarded as a magnificent instrument of the soul. Up until this point, it has remained a rather open question to what extent Augustine draws from Neoplatonic sources and possibly from Roman mnemotechnics, as well as from developments of contemporary Christian doctrine in in order to structure and formulate his thought on memory. Although Augustine thematises the concept of memory throughout his literary works, book X of the Confessions stands out as a definite and original analysis of memory. In it, we see how Augustine traverses the vast spaces of his memory, retrieving from its hidden recesses all kinds of mental images and objects, his past experiences, himself, his forgetfulness, with the aim to find God, whom he could not find in the world around him. Interestingly, book X presents us not just with an extensive theory of memory as a cognitive function, but as the place through which we attain knowledge of the highest Being, namely God. In this thesis I will attempt to address the extent to which Augustine’s analysis of memory in Book X of his Confessions is influenced by and differs from the Ancient Western philosophical tradition that went before him through three different themes: i) the structure by which we attain Beauty, ii) the objects of memory and iii) the metaphysics of Being in memory. All themes lend themselves for comparative analysis. The Form of Beauty is for Plato, and later for Plotinus not something immanently graspable. We need to go through some process, that is characterized as an ascent in order to attain it. Likewise, Augustine traverses memory in search of God, who is Beauty in an apparently similar fashion. Chapter 2 will engage with the structure of the ascent in order to answer the question whether Augustine views our reconciliation with God as a like-mannered ascent. In Chapter 3, another comparison is made, now on the subject of memory proper, specifically with regard to its function and objects. A classical text by Aristotle, De Memoria, although probably unknown to Augustine, offers nonetheless one of the most comprehensive competing theories on memory. The comparison sets out to establish the key differences between the texts, with which we can more firmly argue for Augustine’s originality. Finally, chapter 4 seeks out the “metaphysics” discussed in book X. Augustine addresses the Being of God in a distinctly Christian manner, which differs extensively from Plotinus’ metaphysical views on the One. The overall picture that emerges from this thesis is that book X of the Confessions contains persisting Neoplatonic traces that Augustine either incorporates into a Christian framework, or discontinues altogether in order to bring into light the Being of God. Memory is set at the core of human cognition, as the place that we traverse in search of God, and in which we predict, imagine, contemplate. In it we find memories that haunt us, but also those that bring delight and hope. Ultimately, happiness can only be attained beyond memory, by finding it in Truth","['memory', 'augustine', 'plotinus', 'christianity', 'confessions']"

How the global neoliberal system facilitates corruption in advanced Western economies? Changes in state capacity in the United States and Germany,"Peciulyte, Marija","['Duzgun, Eren']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Corruption as a systemic phenomenon is usually attributed to developing states and their weak institutional capacity to impose rule of law. However, unlike the predominant view which isolates state affairs to a national domain, alternative view states that when countries are becoming more financially and economically interdependent, they are inevitably faced with transnational issues which infuse their domestic sphere. This thesis continues to research corruption in a global context and particularly studies how neoliberal, i.e. pro-market and de-regulation norms and policies which dominated certain advanced economies’ spheres for the past decades, affect their institutional capacity to impose rule of law to control foreign corruption. A case study between Germany and the United States is conducted to test this theory and finds that the neoliberal policies and norms contribute to these countries’ struggle to impose adequate control even when corruption directly affects their domestic spheres. Yet, due to their institutional differences, their capabilities diverge in an interesting fashion.","['Corruption', 'Neoliberalism', 'Globalization', 'Institutional capacity', 'Transnational corruption']"

Dutch as a Heritage Language in Brazil. A Descriptive Analysis of Language Variation in Paraná Dutch,"Boers, Ivo H.G.","['Parafita Couto, Maria Carmen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Latin American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study deals with morphosyntactic variation in Paraná Dutch, an endangered heritage variety of Dutch spoken in the southern Brazilian state of Paraná. Its original objectives were (i) to describe divergences from Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands (NLD) as well as retained dialectal features (ii) to compare these variations to findings of other studies on Dutch as a heritage language (HL), and (iii) to relate the findings to extralinguistic features. Due to the situation of intergenerational language loss encountered during the fieldwork conducted for this study, it was deemed important to add a fourth objective, namely to assess the vitality of the heritage variety. No previous linguistic research on language variation in Dutch as a HL in Paraná exists, and this study will therefore extend our knowledge of morphosyntactic divergences and dialectal retentions in the Dutch heritage varieties. More than 22 hours of naturalistic speech data of 82 Dutch heritage speakers (HSs) in three communities – Arapoti, Carambeí and Castrolanda – was gathered between November 2018 and January 2019, and coded for morphosyntactic divergence from NLD or dialectal variation. The sample consisted of speakers of different ages (16-91), generations (first till fourth) and with varying levels of exposure to and usage of Dutch. Two models for language vitality assessment (UNESCO, EGIDS) were used to describe the endangerment of Paraná Dutch. According to the models, the heritage variety is definitively endangered (UNESCO), and threatened or shifting (EGIDS). Morphosyntactic divergences from NLD found in the speech of the participants include the overgeneralization of SVO word order, omission of determiners, variation in grammatical gender assignment, variation in nominal plural markers, pronoun drop, and variation in present verb inflection. Morphosyntactic divergences from the standard language that can be attributed to Dutch dialects or regional languages include the merger of the verbs kennen ‘to know’ and kunnen ‘can’, use of heb ‘to have’ for the 3SG.PRES, and the use of periphrastic doen ‘to do’. Of the morphosyntactic divergences found in the data, the six mentioned previously were used by a sizeable part of the sample (at least ten participants). Many of these divergences have also been attested in Dutch heritage varieties in Anglophone countries, Indonesia and in other parts of Brazil. The divergences from NLD are either due to interference from the majority language Portuguese, due to internal development in the HL, or due to a combination of the former two (multiple causation). Participants whose speech contained morphosyntactic divergences from NLD tend to be of the second generation or later and have a lower usage of and exposure to Dutch than the average of the sample. Although most of the dialectal features present in the speech of the first-generation participants have not been attested in the speech of later generations, some have been retained or even spread throughout the community. The three morphosyntactic features that originate from Dutch dialects or regional languages mentioned above have been retained and transmitted to speakers of the second generation or later.","['heritage language', 'heritage speakers', 'paraná', 'dutch', 'language variation', 'language endangerment', 'brazil', 'migration', 'dialect']"
The Desertec Project - Evidence of 21st Century European Colonialism or an Example of African Agency?,"Dutta, Mala","['Smith, Karen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,fr,"Going beyond the Eurocentric perspective that is predominant in the discipline of International Relations (IR), this thesis demonstrates the valuable insights that can be gathered by starting an analysis of an internationally relevant topic such as energy security from the viewpoint of commonly marginalised actors. The term ‘marginalised’ refers to actors geographically located in the ‘Global South’ (in this case North Africa) and previously analytically marginalised actors within IR, such as non-state actors. Moreover, this paper provides an informed response to the allegedly neocolonial character of the controversial Desertec project, a transnational energy partnership between the European Union and Middle Eastern and North African states. To be able to do so, the paper adopts an African (Moroccan) agency perspective based on the analytical framework provided by William Brown and a number of selected determinants of agency such as political bargaining power, image management or popular resistance. The paper finds that in its original form, that is, as Desertec was envisioned by its founding father Gerhard Trieb, the Desertec project cannot be described as a European neocolonial project. Yet, in its attempted realisation, Desertec – both the original large-scale project and the following individual projects – certainly had hegemonic features. Its hegemonic character, however, did not exclude and was even partly based upon African actors’ agency. Thus, while European actors still seem to determine the type of international relations held with African countries, North African state and non-state actors demonstrated significant, yet highly uneven agency in the Desertec context, thereby disproving generally held prejudices about African states’ passivity and inferiority in the international system.","['Desertec Project', 'Energy Security', 'Renewable Energy', 'MENA Region', 'Neocolonialism', 'African Agency']"
Kennis is macht. De rol van wetenschappelijk gezag in het milieudebat (1982-1989),"Solange, Ploeg","['Te Velde, Henk']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,nl,"Deze scriptie onderzoekt de rol van wetenschappelijk gezag in de Nederlandse politiek. De casus die wordt onderzocht is het milieudebat in de jaren tachtig en het kernenergiedebat in het bijzonder. Het onderwerp wordt bekeken aan de hand van een retorische analyse van de debatbijdrages van allerhande politici in de Tweede Kamer. In de Nederlandse politiek is de tendens van fact-free en post-truth politics, en de kritiek op wetenschappelijk gezag in het bijzonder, de afgelopen jaren vooral aan de oppervlakte gekomen tijdens het klimaatdebat. Momenteel lijkt er wat betreft dit onderwerp een hardnekkige spanning te bestaan tussen de ‘waarheid’ van de wetenschap en die van bepaalde politici. Het begin van het klimaatdebat zoals dat nu wordt gevoerd in de politiek ligt in de jaren tachtig. Het milieuvraagstuk was in toenemende mate gepolitiseerd geraakt en een bijzondere rol was weggelegd voor de slepende discussie omtrent kernenergie, die in deze periode tot een kookpunt kwam. Daarnaast zijn de jaren tachtig een interessante periode wat betreft de relatie tussen politiek en wetenschap. De zakelijke politieke stijl van Lubbers en de zijnen zorgde voor een nieuw ideaalbeeld: efficiëntie stond centraal en politiek bedrijven betekende compromissen bereiken door middel van een redelijke discussie, waarin een grote waardering was voor de mening van experts. Dit is de achtergrond waartegen de casus van het milieudebat zich in de jaren tachtig afspeelde. In deze scriptie wordt gesteld dat wetenschappelijke invloed in het politiek debat tot op zekere hoogte gewenst is, aangezien het zorgt voor een redelijke discussie gebaseerd op deskundige kennis en rationele argumentatie. De rol van de wetenschap in de Nederlandse debat- en spreekcultuur is daarmee van groot belang. Desondanks is het essentieel om de wetenschap niet als absoluut te zien en haar kritisch te blijven bevragen. Zowel het wantrouwen van de wetenschap als het portretteren van de wetenschap als absolute waarheid, brengen de politieke discussie gebaseerd op een uitwisseling van redelijke argumenten in gevaar. Voor het beschermen van het ethos van de wetenschap moeten zowel de wetenschap zelf, als politici, oppassen met het presenteren van haar claims als de waarheid. Het erkennen van de relativiteit van de wetenschap houdt daarmee de redelijke discussie in stand.","['Politiek', 'Retorica', 'Debat', 'Milieudebat', 'Kernenergiedebat', 'Lubbers', 'Wetenschap', 'Gezag', 'Autoriteit']"

The institutionalisation of the Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement in European states,"Jansen, Ruben","['Ben Aharon, Eldad']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Founded in 2005, BDS (Boycott Divestment and Sanctions) is a movement that opposes the policies of successive Israeli governments towards the Palestinians and organises protests against Israel in the cultural, economic, academic and political arenas. Since 2009, BDS has seen success in mainly western European states by concentrating its efforts and increasing its activity. Current research on BDS focuses on whether BDS is antisemitic and other studies have focused on the academic and cultural boycott of Israel. The extent of influence of BDS on European politicians and political parties has, however, been largely ignored. Therefore, this research aims to examine the political institutionalisation of BDS between 2009–2020 in the politics of three European states: the United Kingdom (UK), France and the Netherlands. A cross-case analysis is used to compare and analyse the institutionalisation of BDS in the three case states. This thesis found that the BDS movement is not deeply institutionalised in the politics of France, the Netherlands and the UK; rather, this research has found that both the successive governments and national parliaments of each country have rejected BDS. There is a difference however between France and the UK on the one hand, and the Netherlands on the other. France and the UK have advanced anti-BDS legislation while the Dutch government, in contrast to France and the UK, has chosen to allow BDS to continue its operations.","['Israel', 'Boycott', 'EU', 'Europe', 'Israeli-Palestinian Conflict', 'antisemitism', 'Israel-EU relations']"

What is unique about many social movements of the 21st century is that they have started to incorporate information and communication technologies (ICTs) into the core of their fabric. Social media in particular has come to be recognized as an important tool for social movements. Whilst the research on the role of social media in social movements is increasing, it often remains unclear just how crucial social media is to social movement formation. Therefore, this thesis uses the case study of the Black Lives Matter movement, a movement well-known for its use of online-activism, to examine how crucial social media was to its emergence and coalescence. The research question this thesis seeks to answer is: To what extent has social media played a key role in the emergence and coalescence of the Black Lives Matter movement? The aim of this thesis is to understand to what degree social media has played a crucial role in relation to factors such as the socio-political environment, the mobilization structure, political opportunities, and cultural factors. In order to do so the case study is analyzed through a holistic framework, proving a comprehensive understanding of the role of social media in the Black Lives Matter movement in relation to the aformentioned factors.","['BLM', 'Social media', 'Social movements', 'Social movement']"

Moral Limits of Killing in Warfare,"Molenaar, Mitchell","['Kalf, Wouter Floris']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Two bodies of rules can be identified in the laws of war. Ius ad bellum limits the reasons to start a war. Ius in bello limits the means and methods to be used in war. There are four theories of warfare that implement moral norms in war, each in its own way. The four theories of warfare are realism, pacifism, traditionalism, and revisionism. In this thesis I have find the theory of warfare which minimalises collateral damage in hostilities, and describe how the implementation of moral norms works towards minimalisation of collateral damage to innocent civilians in hostilities. The research question is: 'Which theory of warfare is theoretically acceptable and minimalises collateral damage during hostilities, and which moral norms does that theory of warfare implement to minimalise collateral damage?' I argue in favour of traditionalism as the theoretically acceptable theory of warfare to minimalise collateral damage to innocent civilians. Traditionalism’s answer to the problem of collateral damage is the Doctrine of Double Effect. I argue that the Doctrine of Double Effect minimalises collateral damage to innocent civilians against collateral damage caused during hostilities. Doctrine of Double Effect implements deontological moral norms, such as the prohibition on intentionally directing attacks against civilians, and consequentialist moral norms, such as the principle of proportionality and due care. The Doctrine of Double Effect is able to protect the moral right to life of innocents, while at the same time providing combatants a right to kill in warfare. The Doctrine of Double Effect minimalises collateral damage to civilians.","['Ethics of warfare', 'Ius in bello', 'Collateral damage', 'Doctrine of double effect', 'Laws of war', 'Realism', 'Pacifism', 'Traditionalism', 'Revisionism', 'Killing']"
Editorial Coverage of the 2019 Hong Kong Protests: A comparison between the Taipei Times and the Global Times,"Kolonko, Tobias","['Schneider, Florian']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the summer of 2019, over a million people took to the streets of Hong Kong to protest a highly unpopular extradition law. Despite the withdrawal of the law, the protests continued for the rest of the year, throwing Hong Kong into turmoil, as protesters advocated for freedom and democracy. As a result, the 2019 Hong Kong protests became one of the most heavily covered events in the media, both nationally and internationally. The demonstrations received an especially large amount of attention in Taiwan and China, due to their proximity to Hong Kong and the Chinese government’s involvement in the protests. While Taiwanese politicians came out in support of protesters’ call for independence, the Chinese government’s increased involvement in Hong Kong’s inner affairs served as a catalyst for the protests. This study analyzed the discourse of 24 editorials covering the Hong Kong protests from two newspapers; the Taipei Times (Taiwan) and the Global Times (China). An inductive discourse analysis was utilized to see which linguistic and thematic methods were used by the authors to shape the reader's perception of the protests according to their newspaper’s ideology. Results showed that while the two newspapers’ coverage of the Hong Kong protests could not have been more different thematically, using opposing narratives and arguments, their style and rhetoric had a tendency to overlap, using similar rhetorical methods to get their viewpoints across to the readers.","['Hong Kong', 'Editorials', 'Global Times', 'Taipei Times', 'Hong Kong protests', 'Taiwan', 'China', 'Discourse analysis', 'Newspapers', 'protests']"

Basisrecht of Bijzaak? De perceptie van persvrijheid door Turkse Nederlanders,"Şahin, Ali","['Burger, J.P.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Dit onderzoek richt zich op de vraag wat volgens Turkse Nederlanders van de tweede generatie het onderscheid is tussen Turkse en Nederlandse media en hoe dit zich verhoudt tot hun perceptie van persvrijheid. Er hebben tien semi-gestructureerde interviews plaatsgevonden met twee subgroepen: a. respondenten die sympathiseren met de huidige regeringspartij van Turkije, de AKP, en b. respondenten die sympathiseren met een van de oppositiepartijen. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat er verschillen bestaan in wat het begrip persvrijheid betekent voor de doelgroep; soms wordt er geen onderscheid gemaakt tussen de vrijheid waarin media kunnen opereren en de vrijheid van meningsuiting. Respondenten in beide subgroepen stellen dat Turkse media eenzijdig en partijdig zijn en dat – in vergelijking met Nederland – er in Turkije minder sprake is van zowel persvrijheid als vrijheid van meningsuiting. Tegelijkertijd is een groot deel van de AKP-subgroep van mening dat ingrepen van de Turkse overheid in het medialandschap soms genoodzaakt zijn om de Turkse staat te beschermen; de oppositie-subgroep is hier juist kritisch over en stelt dat de Turkse overheid op deze manier meer macht wil. Wat Nederlandse media betreft stellen respondenten in beide subgroepen dat deze een onjuist of onvolledig beeld laten zien van Turkse Nederlanders; dit wordt geweten aan (raciale) vooroordelen en onderrepresentatie binnen de mediawereld zelf. Over het algemeen hechten de respondenten die hebben deelgenomen aan dit onderzoek belang aan het idee van persvrijheid, maar zijn zij vanuit meerdere perspectieven kritisch over de manier waarop (nieuws)media volgens hen opereren, zowel in de Turkse als Nederlandse context.","['turkse nederlanders', 'nieuwsmedia', 'persvrijheid', 'perceptie van persvrijheid', 'turkse media', 'nederlandse media']"

Orthodoxy and Nation-Building in Post-Soviet Russia: A Comparative Analysis of the Textbook Fundamentals of Orthodox Culture by Andrei Kuraev and the Reading Tool Polite Alphabet,"Genevey, Philippine","['Schellens, Dorine']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"While Western countries are facing a phenomenon of De-Christianization, Russian Orthodoxy, after almost a century of partial extinction, seems to be reviving with the Russian population on the path to Re-Christianization. The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) is playing an active role to claim its privileged and historically-rooted position in Russian society. After the collapse of the USSR and consequently the end of a communist ideology, the Russian population suffered from an identity vacuum. The ROC seized the opportunity to help Russians find their national and cultural identity within Orthodoxy. Thus, introducing religious education in the curriculum appears like a suitable way to inculcate Orthodox traditional values in young elementary students. In 2012, a new program incorporating six modules on ethics and religion was introduced in primary schools in the whole Russia. The parents can choose between the different modules and the second most popular and widespread module is the one dealing with the Russian Orthodox culture. In this thesis, I compare two primary sources, one is a textbook for 4th grade student on the Fundamentals of Orthodox Culture written by Andrei Kuraev (an Orthodox theologian) and the other one is an alphabet called “the polite alphabet” taught to students in primary schools in the Irkutsk region (Siberia). I explore how these two school materials construct a national and cultural identity rooted in Orthodox values by using a multimodal discourse analysis.","['Nation-building', 'Russian Orthodox Church', 'Education']"
Verveelder dan we dachten: Een kritische beschouwing van de vervelingsanalyse in Martin Heideggers Die Grundbegriffe der Metaphysik,"Wit, Johannes de","['Jong, J.E. de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Deze studie richt zich op Martin Heideggers vervelingsanalyse uit het eerste deel van de collegereeks Die Grundbegriffe der Metaphysik. Heidegger behandelt de verveling niet slechts als een gevoel of een emotie maar ziet verveling als een fundamentele zijnstoestand: een grondstemming. Metafysica kan volgens Heidegger alleen plaatsvinden vanuit een toestand van gegrepenheid, en deze filosofische gegrepenheid komt tot stand wanneer we de grondstemming in onszelf wekken. Er is echter een probleem: Hoe moeten we deze grondstemming interpreteren? Is de grondstemming een diagnose van onze tijd (oftewel cultuurfilosofie) of is het de mogelijkheid tot filosofie überhaupt? Ik beargumenteer dat Heidegger zowel een tijdsdiagnose geeft en dus niet helemaal kan ontsnappen aan zijn eigen kritiek op cultuurfilosofie maar dat hij ook een fundamenteler filosofisch project heeft: het blootleggen van een verwijderd-zijn van onszelf als Dasein. Om deze interpretatie hard te maken zet ik allereerst uiteen dat Heidegger de mogelijkheid tot filosofie überhaupt ziet in gegrepenheid. Deze gegrepenheid veronderstelt dat we gestemd zijn en dat we onszelf kunnen begrijpen als Da-sein; in de stemming toont ons’ zijn zich als er-zijn. Vervolgens verken ik Heideggers fenomenologische analyse van de verveling. Heidegger onderscheid drie vormen: het verveeld-worden door iets, het zich-vervelen bij iets en de diepe verveling. In deze drie vormen komt geleidelijk steeds fundamenteler de leeggelatenheid en de opgehoudenheid terug die ons op het Dasein wijzen. Het feit dat de diepe verveling hiertoe in staat is, geeft aan dat het onze grondstemming is: het toont ons het ‘hoe en wat’ van het Dasein, en daarmee geeft het ons toegang tot het filosofisch vragen. De diepe verveling is onze grondstemming.","['Verveling', 'Heidegger', 'Grundstimmung', 'Fenomenologie', 'Stemming', 'Metafysica', 'Cultuurfilosofie', 'Ergriffenheit']"
African Agency or Postcolonial Power Relations? A Decolonial Analysis of the African Union and United Nations Relationship in UNAMID,"Schuurmans, Aileen","['David, Maxine']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"As the involvement of regional organizations in peacekeeping has significantly grown over the past decades, the relationship of these organizations with the United Nations has been reconfigured. This is particularly the case for the African Union and the UN, that set up their first peacekeeping mission with joint ownership in 2007 with UNAMID, the UN-AU hybrid mission in Darfur. The UN-AU relationship is not only determined by global-regional power relations, also postcolonial power relations play a role. As a result of these power relations, the AU is often perceived as being rather agency- and powerless. This thesis will counter this narrative, by studying the way in which the AU exercised agency over the set-up of UNAMID. It finds that while the AU was constrained by material capacity and the influence of powerful actors, it was still able to exercise agency and have influence on the UN, by using discursive strategies and the contestation of norms. Following these findings, this thesis advocates for a decolonial shift in the understanding of the AU that makes space for African agency and African contributions in international affairs, particularly, but not only, in peace and security matters.","['African Union', 'United Nations', 'Decolonial Analysis', 'Discourse Analysis', 'peacekeeping', 'UNAMID', 'African agency', 'regionalism', 'postcolonial power relations']"
Conversing A Crisis - A Critical Analysis of Sustainability Discourses in German and Austrian Politics,"Friedrichs, Carl","['Natermann, Diana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the face of complex and interrelated ecological and social sustainability crises, the outstanding responsibilities of Western industrial nations are frequently underlined. As political awareness for these crises has arguably increased in the past decade, political language concerning them has too. However, altered discourses have not led to more sustainable and just policies. The world, and most importantly the largely responsible industrial states, continue to fail in combatting and mitigating global ecological and social hardhships. This thesis uses the young critical theoritcal body of Postcolonial Ecocriticism to scrutinise political discourses of Austrian and German political parties, revealing underlying attitudes and motives regarding sustainability politics, which might explain this inability or unwillingness for counteractions. Finally, it concludes that majorities in both countries show concerningly ignorant and uncritical crisis perceptions. In fact, the analysed parties' discourses often do not reflect the severity and complexity of global crises, and frequently neglect and perpetuate existing exploitative dynamics.","['Sustainability', 'Discourses', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Germany', 'Austria', 'Postcolonialism', 'Ecocriticism']"
"The Europeanization of the Fiscal Compact: How the Fiscal Compact affected the domestic fiscal frameworks in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands","Moje, Jana","['Van Riel, Bart']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"During the European debt crisis it became clear that the European fiscal framework needed to be reformed. Part of this reform process was the Fiscal Compact, which required the signatory states to adopt a balanced budget rule in their domestic legislation ‘preferably’ on constitutional level. The Fiscal Compact thus required change and reform of the domestic fiscal frameworks. However, the degree of change of the domestic fiscal frameworks in the various Member States is very different. This thesis tried to explain why this is the case. Firstly, this thesis determined the degree of change in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands by comparing the domestic fiscal frameworks of these countries before the crisis to the domestic fiscal frameworks after the introduction of the Fiscal Compact. Secondly, this thesis tried to explain the variety in the degree of change in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, by using concepts from Europeanization theory and Historical Institutionalism, such as the ‘degree of misfit’, veto-players and other mediating factors.","['Fiscal Compact', 'Historical Institutionalism', 'Europeanization', 'Veto-players']"
Cross-Linguistic Influence on Third Language Acquisition: the Differences Between Phonology and Syntax,"Versaevel, Lisanne","['Grijzenhout, J.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Models of third language acquisition (TLA) make several claims as to what is most important for transfer, e.g. language status, order of acquisition or typological proximity. Five models are discussed with a focus on what they propose for the acquisition of syntax and phonology. Models such as the Cumulative Enhancement Model (CEM) and the Typological Proximity Model (TPM) propose that L1 and L2 can influence TLA of syntax. The L2 status factor proposes that L2 will override typological proximity, as native and foreign languages are stored in different memories. This would make it easier to access L2 during TLA. Typological proximity and L2 can also impact the acquisition of phonology, although syntax and phonology are acquired in different ways. Syntax is easier to acquire for older learners, as the age of acquisition plays a more prominent role in phonological acquisition. Transfer is also more obvious in phonological acquisition, in which an L2-sounding accent is often found when L2 proficiency is high. Once L3 becomes more proficient, an L1-sounding accent becomes more prominent. Such results are not found in the acquisition of syntax, in which L1 transfer is found in fewer cases. When L1 transfer is found in syntactic studies, it is often attributed to other factors such as language similarity. The models disagree about what factor is most important but acknowledge that the factors all have some influence on TLA, and because of this consideration, they are not necessarily contradictive. Future studies should keep in mind that TLA is an overly complex process in which one factor cannot explain all results and that factors are often entwined. This would allow more consideration for the idea that while one factor might be more prominent in certain circumstances, it may not always be this certain factor that is the main cause of transfer.","['third language acquisition', 'acquisition of phonology', 'acquisition of syntax', 'Typological Proximity Model', 'Cumulative Enhancement Model', 'L2 status factor']"

Is There Such a Thing as More Taboo? An Analysis on the Dutch Subtitling of Offensive and Taboo Words in Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds,"Boumann, Tamya","['Dorst, Lettie']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Offensive and taboo words are becoming more common in audiovisual texts. Consequently, a translator or subtitler is faced with the complexities of transferring this type of language into the target text. This study is a qualitative and quantitative analysis of offensive and taboo words, their function, and the transfer of these components to the Dutch subtitles of Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012). An adapted version of Avila-Cabrera’s (2015a) taxonomy, who differentiates between offensive and taboo words, is used in this study. Pinker (2007) and Dynel’s (2012) typologies of function is used for the classification of function. The results show a frequent use of offensive and taboo words in both movies. There were significant differences in the offensive and taboo words found in the source texts and the target texts. For example, Inglourious Basterds contained offensive words comprised of references to diseases, whereas this was not the case in the source text. However, there were no significant differences in the subtitling of offensive and taboo words between the both movies. Overall, the results suggest that other reasons besides the harshness of the written offensive/taboo words, played a significant role in the translation choices made. Taboo words had more plot-pertinent functions than offensive words, and were therefore retained more often. Also, temporal and spatial constraints and the availability of certain offensive and taboo words in the target language affected the subtitling. In conclusion, the subtitling of offensive and taboo words might not always meet the viewers’ expectations and those of traditional translation, however, there are certain linguistic and cultural justifications associated with the subtitling’s choices.","['Subtitling', 'Taboo language', 'Offensive words', 'Audiovisual Translation', 'Django Unchained', 'Function', 'Inglourious Basterds', 'Collective memory']"

As the debate in global health governance centres on the question whether the West and WHO align on their preferences to securitize infectious diseases, this thesis provides a country-level analysis of the securitization of the 2014 Ebola and 2016 Zika PHEIC declarations by the Dutch government. The findings of this research indicate that the Dutch government does not unconditionally follow the WHO’s preference in securitizing global health crises. The Dutch government’s decision-making process toward securitization was not guided by the WHO’s PHEIC declaration. It was primarily guided by national considerations, such as its own public health, and regional or national actors, such as its national health institute - the RIVM - and the European health institute - the ECDC. It opposed the WHO, because it lacks a policy or strategy toward global health and global health governance. The research showed the Dutch government is sceptical of the WHO because of its lack in transparency, causing the government to react in a self-serving manner when faced by a global health crisis.","['WHO', 'Securitization', 'Global Health Crisis', 'Pandemic', 'Infectious Disease', 'Realism', 'PHEIC', 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern', 'Epidemic']"

What to do with social norms? Exploring the relation between a social norm and actual behavior,"Bleeker, Sandra","['Dekker, Marleen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study investigates the normative framework and the experienced reality of a social norm to enable effective policymaking, which improves the financial situation of the underserved in Eastern Province, Zambia. Social norms are becoming increasingly part of social science research, but working with social norms is not straightforward. This thesis contributes to this field of knowledge by giving in-depth qualitative knowledge of how a social norm influences people in rural Zambia. A previously conducted quantitative research revealed tensions between the desire for individual control over money and social and personal norms prohibiting secrecy, advocating the communal over personal interests. During a fieldwork period of ten weeks, seven group and twenty-two individual interviews were conducted. The group interviews show the content of the social norm and how salient it is in the communities where the interviews were conducted. The individual interviews shed light on how a social norm and its behavioral prescriptions are personally experienced. The main conclusion is that it is context-dependent on how social norms influence people's behavior choices, and this differs with time and personal circumstances. The behavioral prescriptions of the social norm prohibiting saving in secret do not guide all community members' actual behavior all the time. Some people sporadically elude or violate the norm secretly, while others do it openly, and again others never transgress. This norm is dynamically and flexibly interpreted depending on people's living situations. Effective policies should include this variety of households and living situations to improve the financial situation of the underserved.","['Social Norms', 'Zambia', 'Money Saving', 'Hiding Practices', 'Saving in Secret', 'Financial Inclusion']"

In the analysis, the different rationales for each side to the conflict to explain their use and recruitment of child soldiers were examined. Finally, the thesis argued that among the several factors that seem to be valid in explaining the phenomenon of child soldiering in Somalia, only two are found to be true for both the extremist organization al-Shabaab and the government, with their allied forces. First, children may voluntarily join the army because they lack alternatives outside of the armed groups. In fact, they cannot receive a proper education and they suffer extreme poverty, water scarcity, malnutrition and devastation. Second, Somali children were born in a constant climate of violence and insecurity that has ‘normalized’ the concept of fighting, leading them to take up arms in a desperate attempt to put an end to a war they do not understand, but that has been lacerating their country for too long.","['Human Rights', 'Human Rights Violations', 'Child Soldiers', 'Somalia', 'Al-Shabaab', 'War']"

The aim of the present study was to see whether there is a bilingual advantage and whether there is a publication bias in the linguistic scientific world with regards to studies that used the Simon task to research the effect of bilingualism. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted and 40 Simon task studies were included. The findings of the meta-analysis resulted only in weak evidence for the bilingual advantage, since only a small effect size was found for bilinguals showing faster Reaction Times than monolinguals. Furthermore, evidence for a publication bias was found, but the Test for Moderators showed that studies earlier published are mostly contributing to the effect size. An explanation for this can be that these studies were conducted at the time when the common belief was that bilinguals had an advantage, resulting in the publication of only large, positive effect sizes.","['bilingual advantage', 'Simon task', 'meta-analysis', 'publication bias', 'inhibitory control']"

A Study on the Framing of Dutch and Belgian Female Jihadist Militants,"Zwartjes, Katrine","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"My master thesis is a study on the framing of Dutch and Belgian female militants connected to the jihadist organization ISIS in Dutch and Belgian newspapers from 2013 to 2019. The archetypes on militant women is linked to women from Greek mythology: the monstrous Medusa, the magical mother Medea, and the misandrist Amazon Penthesilea. These women are opposites of the peaceful and beautiful Helen of Troy, who is the ‘ideal Western woman.’ From the archetypes I derived seven sub-frames: (1) Medusa brainwashed, (2) Medusa dangerous, (3) Medusa mental issues, (4) Medea supporting mother and wife, (5) Medea religion, (6) Penthesilea committed like men/ emancipation, (7) Penthesilea seeking husband/ romantic notion. From the changes over time and by country and newspaper I concluded that 2017 was a turning point in the framing of female militants. Female militants became more salient and their framing turned more agentive. Gender stereotypes became less dominant in the frame. However, framing in relation to religion stayed in the frames of newspapers. Religion remained essential to ‘other’ female militants from the norm of ‘good Western women.’","['Jihadism', 'female terrorism', 'Framing', 'Gender stereotypes and archetypes', 'Neo-Orientalism', 'Islamic State']"

Law vs Practice: the Obstacles to Abortion Access in Chile after Decriminalization,"Nicosia, Danae","['Churampi Ramirez, Adriana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Throughout the 20th century, the discussion on abortion in Latin America has spurred multiple controversies which persist today primarily due to the significant role the Catholic Church plays in the area. Despite the recent advances achieved through decriminalization, the region’s percentage of unsafe abortions is the highest in the world. Chile’s case appears particularly insightful in analyzing the discrepancy between the law and the practice of abortion reforms due to the recent evolvement of the legislative debate in September 2017. During Michelle Bachelet’s second presidency, the long-awaited Law 21.030 reversed a 28-year ban in place since Pinochet’s regime. Despite the de jure significance of the law, which formally decriminalized abortion in three specific circumstances, many legal, cultural, political and economic impediments persist to undermine the effectiveness of the law, severely affecting Chilean women’s access to safe abortion services. In this manner, women are continuously led to risk their lives by undergoing abortions in clandestine and unsafe conditions. This thesis attempts to gain a nuanced understanding of such trends. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, this thesis presents a legal and cultural analysis of three of the main obstacles to women’s access to safe and legal abortions in Chile: the right of health providers to claim conscientious objection, the legacy of traditional gender roles and abortion stigma, and the impact of socio-economic inequality.","['abortion', 'decriminalization', 'gender roles', 'conscientious objection', 'abortion stigma', 'Chile', 'inequality']"

The role of reproductive rights in the discussion on female marriage migrants in Korea,"Heinsbroek, Sara","['De Ceuster, Koen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Female marriage migrants have been a topic of academic interest due to their influence on the makeup of South Korean society for quite a while. Associated research ranges from the mental health of these migrant women to multicultural education to accommodate this change and anything and everything in between. Studies inevitably mention how the emphasis on their role as wife and mother and reference to their reproductive labour is problematic. However, few studies consider how their specific situation on this spectrum influences their reproductive rights beyond simply pointing this out. Not acknowledging this more meaningfully leads to a gap in research and knowledge as reproductive rights are an important topic in the discourse on women’s rights in general and as such is inextricably linked with the fight for gender equality. Additionally, this blind spot is remarkable as the reason for female marriage migrants joining Korean families and households is foremost their reproductive labour as wives and daughters-in-law, with goes hand in hand with the explicit expectation of them becoming mothers of Korean children. Moreover, in the Korean context, them obtaining formal rights and social acceptance mostly depends on their reproductive labour and their (capability of) motherhood. The aim of this thesis is to take a closer look at this gap and why it is there. I will discuss how reproductive rights are referred to in relation to female marriage migrants, how their specific situation in Korea complicating their reproductive rights is discussed in related research, and what this means for their position as women in Korea. In this thesis I will focus my attention on how the expectation of reproductive labour and motherhood entangles with notions of citizenship and acceptance, combined with an overview of the discussion on human rights protection and how this includes reproductive rights. Ultimately, I aim to highlight an area of interest that will contribute to illuminating the complexity of the situation of marriage migrants and might assist in closing the gap that exists between the perspectives on female marriage migrants in research on the one hand, and the lack of targeted research considering their reproductive rights on the other. More specifically, the following questions will guide this research: Why are reproductive rights not included substantially in the debate regarding female marriage migrants in Korea, and how does marriage migration complicate the reproductive rights of these migrant women? Are reproductive rights included in the expectation of reproductive labour that is placed on female marriage migrants? What is the effect of this expectation on their position as women in Korea?","['South Korea', 'marriage migration', 'marriage migrants', 'reproductive rights', 'reproductive labour', 'motherhood']"
Agents of Change: Exploring Women's Agency in the Saudi Novel,"Egmond, Hannah van","['Strava, Cristiana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Arab women are often portrayed as in need of saving from the conditions they live in. This narrative takes away the possibility of these women to be agents of change in their own lives. This thesis aims to explore how Saudi women push back against societal norms in literary fiction. Specifically, it investigates how Saudi female fictional characters employ different forms of agency in physical and online public spaces compared to private and women-only spaces. The close reading of segments of two fictional literary works was used to showcase how female protagonists employ different understandings of agency. These examples were then linked to real-life examples to demonstrate that fiction is strongly rooted in reality. What became clear is that there is a multiplicity of ways for Saudi women to employ agency to resist and reshape the established order and practices, and different spaces within Saudi society offer different opportunities for employing agency. Moreover, there are different types of agency employed by different types of Saudi women. Thus, Saudi women can be agents of change within Saudi society and their own lives.","['Saudi Arabia', 'Women', 'Literature', 'Agency', 'Public space', 'Private space']"

Moreover, it aims to avoid going along with popular notions and conventional theories on Somalis and entrepreneurs. Henceforth, this research uses literature that fits the context of Somalis in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Furthermore, this study shows that Somalis in Bole Michael do not identify as refugees, which contradicts the simplified paradigm illustrated by existing literature on Somalis in Bole Michael. Nevertheless, it reveals that Bole Michael functions as a transit hub for various Somali migrants moving through Bole Michael to Europe and North America. Additionally, Somali enterprises in Bole Michael are service-based and offer services that assist the journey undertaken by migrants, such as; guesthouses, money transfer operators and restaurants. Accordingly, this research argues that Somali businesses sustain and stimulate international Somali mobility. This thesis concludes with suggestions for further research that studies the stimulating effect of money transfer companies on illegal migration among Somali youth.","['Ethiopia', 'Somali', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Mobility', 'Community.']"
Korean verbs of perception,"Ravenhorst, Jeroen van","['Ameka, Felix K.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Taalwetenschap (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis is a descriptive account of the form, function, and meaning of Korean verbs of perception in the modalities of SIGHT, HEARING, TOUCH, FEEL, TASTE and SMELL. I categorize the perception verbs by means of Viberg’s (1983) dynamic system of perception events, distinguishing ACTIVITIES, EXPERIENCES and STATES for each of the six modalities. Focussing on experiencer-based expressions, I find that Korean verbs of SIGHT, HEARING, FEEL, and SMELL do not lexically distinguish between an ACTIVITY and an EXPERIENCE. Stimulus-based verbs derive from experiencer-based basic verbs by means of middle marking. I also find that Korean obligatorily requires a perceived stimulus rather than a source in the domains of HEARING, FEEL, TASTE, and SMELL. Furthermore, an introductory review of the literature on intrafield ‘polysemy’ reveals inconsistencies in the hierarchical models of perception verbs. I put forward a new model that unifies earlier proposals and includes the extensions from SIGHT to TASTE and FEEL to TASTE found in Korean. Examples were retrieved from the highly contemporary VLIVE (2020) spoken corpus as well as various non-spoken corpora, accessed through the online NAVER Korean-English Dictionary (2020).","['perception verb', 'lexical semantics', 'polysemy', 'typology', 'hierarchy', 'sensory modalities', 'Korean']"
Specialized Language in AVT: The translation of medical terminology in the Dutch subtitles of Grey’s Anatomy,"Ploeg, Hilde van der","['Valdez, S.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyzes the techniques applied to translate medical terminology in the Dutch subtitles of three episodes of the American medical TV series Grey’s Anatomy (2005-present, Rhimes). The model for analysis is based on the taxonomy of Molina and Hurtado (2002), which distinguishes between fifteen different translation techniques. It was found that, as expected, established equivalents are used most commonly, and that most of these established equivalents are literal translations. This can be explained by three factors: medical concepts and culture are similar in English and Dutch, they have both been strongly influenced by Greek and Latin, and Dutch has been influenced by English as the current lingua franca of medicine. The latter was also supported by the high number of borrowings from English found in the Dutch subtitles. Moreover, it was found that generalization, reduction and amplification are commonly used techniques. These techniques can be part of simplification and explicitation strategies, which confirms the hypothesis that medical texts for a lay audience are de-terminologized. Lastly, the relatively high number of inadequate equivalents has led to a twofold recommendation: the development of specialized AVT training and the compilation of term bases.","['AVT', 'medical terminology', 'subtitling', 'translation', 'de-terminologization']"
"The normative dimension of the EU’s trade policy: High expectations, questionable outcomes?","Hoff, Jochem","['Scepanovic, Vera']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In recent years, the European Commission’s trade policy strategy shifted from the multilateral system towards a more bilateral approach with the new generation FTAs. Furthermore, the strategy shifted the underlying incentives for trade from solely economic interests towards an approach that embraced more normative goals, for example standards for environmental and labor market issues. Within the literature, the debate regarding the nature of the EU’s trade policy contemplates this dilemma and seeks to clarify how Trade and Sustainable Development chapters function within trade policy. The dilemma is what has been described within the literature as the norms versus interests debate. Within this debate, the concepts of Normative Power Europe and Market Power Europe play a central role in defining the identity of the EU’s power. Both concepts have been incorporated within studies into the role of norms and economic incentives within the EU’s foreign policy. A large share of these studies agrees that within trade policy, norms are subordinate to economic incentives. The push for a more normative agenda, however, is gaining traction within the EU and has led to more attention from various actors for normative arguments. In recent years, the mobilization of actors and institutional changes in the process have given more weight to the normative argument. This thesis is thus researching how a more recent agreement has been influenced by this process: the EU-Vietnam free trade agreement. In this case study, it will become evident that the extent to which norms are being incorporated in FTAs and the degree of effectiveness of their enforcement is rather absent. The EP and NGOs voiced concerns regarding human and labor rights at various stages during the process. This led to the Commission developing alternate initiatives to address human rights issues within Vietnam, such as a roadmap within which the Vietnamese committed to ratify conventions of the International Labour Organisation. However, the roadmap is not enforceable through the FTA and other enforcement tools remain relatively weak within the eventual agreement. The conclusion can be drawn that there have been attempts to influence the Commission’s normative agenda through various institutional channels. These attempts at influencing the process might have set a precedent for future FTAs that might become more effective compared to this case.","['EU', 'Trade Policy', 'Vietnam', 'Normative Power Europe', 'Market Power Europe', 'Trade and Sustainable Development']"

Op weg naar een deugdzame democratie: Een analyse van democratische deugden als aanvulling op de normatieve gebreken van de moderne liberale democratische samenleving,"Louer, Bibiana Helena","['Haas, Frans de']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Wijsbegeerte (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In “The Dialectics of Secularization: On Reason and Religion” (2006) wordt de discussie tussen Jürgen Habermas en de Paus Benedictus XVI weergegeven, waarin zij naar gemeenschappelijke grond zoeken in hun betrokkenheid met het welzijn van de geseculariseerde liberale Westerse democratische samenleving. Voortbouwend op deze betekenisvolle dialoog breng ik Habermas opnieuw in gesprek met de “belichaming van Katholieke orthodoxie”, deze keer in de persoon van Thomas Aquinas. Het doel van mijn onderzoek is het beantwoorden van de vraag: In hoeverre kan een democratische deugdenleer die gebaseerd is op de Christelijke filosofie van Aquino als aanvulling dienen voor de normatieve gebreken van de moderne seculiere liberale democratische samenleving? Deze vraag beantwoord ik voornamelijk aan de hand van Aquino’s verhandelingen over het koningschap en over de wet, enkele essays van Habermas, het debat tussen Habermas en Benedictus XVI en Jennifer Herdt’s analyse van democratische deugden. Overeenkomstig met Aquino’s waarschuwingen voor tirannie beweert Habermas dat de liberale democratie middels doorgevoerde secularisering onder de heerschappij van het decisionistische model van een verzelfstandigde marktwerking is beland. Dit culmineert volgens hem in een maatschappij waarin de technische rationaliteit in naam van waardevrijheid haar eigen waardesysteem dicteert. Habermas roept daarom op tot de toepassing van politieke deugden als geneesmiddel voor de afbrekende maatschappelijke eenheid. Jennifer Herdt biedt hier een praktische invulling voor in de vorm van democratische deugden, die gebaseerd zijn op Thomistische deugdenleer. Hoewel Aquino geen voorstander was van democratie, hoeft dat volgens Habermas en Herdt niet te betekenen dat zijn gedachtegoed onbruikbaar is binnen de seculiere democratie. Zowel Christelijke als niet-Christelijke burgers kunnen vergelijkbare (burger)deugden inzetten om gemeenschappelijke doeleinden na te streven, zonder elkaars interpretaties van het gemeenschappelijk goede te devalueren. Zodoende kan het gebruik van hun gedeelde normatieve erfgoed democratie bevorderen en normatieve stabiliteit in een pluralistische samenleving in stand houden. Dit verzoek tot civiele samenwerking vormt een eerste stap richting de herwaardering van deugden en een herstel van een gefragmenteerde samenleving.","['Aquinas', 'Habermas', 'Benedictus XVI', 'monarchie', 'liberale democratie', 'Christendom', 'deugden', 'deugdenleer', 'burgerdeugden', 'technocratie']"

In order to collect data to answer the research questions, two recorded scripts, one in L1 Dutch and one in L2 German, from 29 participants between 18 and 25 years old are analysed. The script involves 15 words, five per phoneme, in both languages. These phonemes are measured for their vowel duration and the corresponding formant values for F1 and F2 at 25% and 75% of the vowel duration. In doing so, figures are constructed signifying a line of diphthongisation for each phoneme. Additionally, the data are analysed per word and per participant, and are compared to the average results of all participants together. The results suggest that the phonemes [eː], [oː], and [øː] are diphthongised in L1 Dutch and that phonetic transfer occurs as predicted by Flege’s (1988, 1990, 1991, 2007) Speech Learning Model.","['diphthongisation', 'L1 Dutch', 'L2 German', 'phonetic transfer', 'long midvowels', 'formants', 'F1', 'F2', 'vowel duration', 'audio files', 'speech learning model', 'sociophonetics']"
A new Global South Perspective to Peacebuilding,"Fakkel, Chiara","['Gawthorpe, A.J.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In the past couple of decades, the shared belief in peacebuilding has eroded. The failure from Western countries to deliver peace has led to a lot of criticism towards Western peacebuilding missions. The criticism was aimed at the fact that most Western peacebuilding approaches only focus on the implementation of liberal values. Whereas these values have proven to be successful in Western countries, the implementation of these values will not automatically create a peaceful situation in other countries. Therefore, more countries from the global South have expressed their interest in establishing a new and innovative peacebuilding approach which can be applied to non-Western countries. This thesis will therefore focus on the differences between peacebuilding approaches from the Global South and the Western peacebuilding approach. By looking at different International Relations (IR) theories related to peacebuilding and by analysing peacebuilding mission from the US, The Netherlands and South Africa, this thesis will contribute to exploring the differences between both approaches to peacebuilding and understanding what is the cause of these differences. The origin of these different peacebuilding approaches can be found in the different political and historical context of the countries, which has led to the establishment of Western ideology and a Pan-African ideology in their peacebuilding approaches.",['A comparison of the South African peacebuilding approach and the Western peacebuilding approach']

This thesis aims to investigate if the victim's rights are honoured, not just in practice but most importantly in reality - is justice truly received? The paper seeks to reveal this through feminist literature in understanding justice. Two particularly interesting cases to which gender-based atrocities took place, were the Japanese Imperial Army’s sexual slavery and prostitution of Korean women in The Second World War (hereafter, WWII) and Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo of the Democratic Republic of Congo (hereafter DRC) involvement in war crimes having taken place during the Second Congo War in 2002. Both cases pursued different justice mechanisms. The case of Japan-Korea adopted a reconciliation process they having only recently confronted their war past, while Bemba faced the International Criminal Court being trailed for crimes against humanity. The dominant narrative dealing with sexual crimes in the post-war era are present in both cases of Japan-Korea and Congo, and employ similar motifs where the prosecution rests after charging those accused.

This begs the question: Who actually benefits from the current justice system? To what extent do these opposing techniques ultimately provide justice for the victims and in changing the justice system? And what are the factors prohibiting justice?

US Foreign Policy Change Towards Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,"Martin, Xiaoxue","[""d'Hooghe, Ingrid""]",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis uses Hermann’s (1990) model of foreign policy change to analyse the research question: Why was the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act only adopted into public law in November 2019, despite its introduction into US legislation years earlier in 2014? Through tracking the progress of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (HKHRDA) from its introduction in 2014 to its final signing into law in 2019, it has shown that bureaucratic advocacy and external shocks were the primary change agents driving the foreign policy change. Previous versions of the bill failed to pass the final stages of the decision-making process. However, in 2019, changes in the international context were crucial to the passing of the bill. That year, the external shock of the Hong Kong protests escalated to such an extent that Congressional legislators felt compelled to unite and take action. Rising geopolitical tensions between China and the United States also affected domestic American politics, contributing to the growing bipartisan Congressional support for a stronger stance against China on the issue of Hong Kong and pass the HKHRDA into law, despite resistance from the Trump administration. The symbolic value of the law was greater than its actual changes to US legislation, as it did not grant the government new instruments of statecraft it did not already possess. Still, the law was a clear show of Congressional support for the pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, and a political statement against the central Chinese and Hong Kong government’s policies in the city. This was instrumental in pushing the administration to change its approach towards HK, and with the HKHRDA, US HK policy became submerged in its American foreign policy towards China.","['Hong Kong', 'United States', 'Foreign policy change', 'Human Rights', 'China']"

Banning the Bag: The Effectiveness of the Plastic Bag Ban in Kenya,"Looze, Annemiek de","['Smith, Karen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Plastic carrier bags are a big source of plastic pollution all around the world. To combat environmental degradation, Kenya has adopted a ban on plastic bags in 2017. This action has made Kenya join the forefront of global environmental policy with regards to plastic pollution. Despite the accompanied strict penalties, the Kenyan ban on plastic bags is globally regarded as an environmental success story. Nonetheless, there are various other positive and negative effects of the ban. This thesis examines the social, environmental, and economic effects of the plastic bag ban in Kenya to determine how effective the 2017 ban has been. These three factors are intertwined and affect one another, sometimes leading to indirect negative side effects of an initial positive consequence. Taking all of the effects of the ban into account, this thesis concludes that although the environmental intentions behind the ban were to reach sustainable development in Kenya, there have been many negative consequences of the ban that have lowered its success.","['Environmental policy', 'Political economy', 'Plastic pollution', 'Kenya']"
"Boko Haram and the newspaper-narrative: framing, terrorism and media in Nigeria and beyond","Dassen, Bart","['Williams, C.L.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The main aim of this thesis is to investigate how framing through prominent Nigerian newspapers has an effect on Boko Haram’s narrative. More specifically, it utilizes existing content and discourse analyses to discover in which ways the two Nigerian newspapers ‘the Punch’ and the ‘Daily Trust’ use framing techniques to shape particular narratives surrounding Boko Haram. In addition, the purpose of this thesis is to offer alternative perspectives on dominant components within the ‘newspaper-narrative’ to allow for a more nuanced and diverse consideration of Boko Haram. Lastly, the results are contextualized by situating them in the broader debate regarding the framing of terrorism. This thesis concludes that the negative consequences of terrorism-framing in relation to Boko Haram are similar to the ones exposed by the global debate. Although the range of these issues is broad, this study concluded two particular consequences to be dominant. Firstly, it limits and negatively influences counter-terrorism options by presenting Boko Haram as a force that can only be dealt with in a violent matter. Secondly, unnuanced and disproportionate representations of Islam in relation to Boko Haram and other Islamic terrorist organizations has led to a significant rise of negative Muslim prejudice.","['Boko Haram', 'Framing', 'Nigeria', 'Narrative', 'Terrorism', 'Media']"

The Netherlands is one of these countries. This was in the Netherlands’ own security interests, which are heavily influenced by NATO’s security policies. After the end of the Cold War, there was no direct threat and therefore, no direct need to keep these nuclear weapons. However, the Netherlands has been unable to denuclearize. It will use securitization theory as a theoretical framework to try to understand the denuclearization process. This thesis will analyze the denuclearization debate in the Netherlands and what role nuclear weapons play in Dutch security policy.","['nuclear weapons', 'The Netherlands', 'NATO', 'debates']"

This can be done by looking at the way the European Union has ‘deepened’ and ‘widened’ throughout its existence. The European Union has deepened itself through policies such as the Single European Act and the European Monetary Union. These are key examples of policies adopted by the European Union in order to advance collaboration between its member states. The widening of the European Union has happened through the enlargement of the Union throughout different stages. During these stages of enlargement more countries became members of the European Union. The European Neighbourhood Policy also belongs to the widening approach of the European Union. Through this policy, the European Union has found a way to gain more influence over states that are not a member of the Union. The deepening and widening of the European Union has been felt by the Russian Federation in a number of negative ways. As the European Union continued to deepen and widen, the Russian Federation felt its geopolitical power diminish. This feeling became particularly strong as the European Union began to establish closer ties with Ukraine. Increased activity by the European Union in the Russian near abroad gave the Federation a reason to stand its ground through military action. This was done by annexing Crimea.","['Deepening', 'Widening', 'European Union', 'International Relations', 'Russia', 'Crimea', 'Geopolitics']"
Prisoners of Consociationalism? Between Gender Equality and Ethnic Conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and North Macedonia,"Crevatin, Elisabetta","['Regilme, Salvador Santino']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Consociationalism is a type of power-sharing that has been implemented throughout peace-agreements in several civil conflicts during the last decades and proved to be successful in satisfying the major groups in dispute. Notwithstanding, feminist scholars claim that consociational settlements are detrimental for marginalized communities such as women, that are usually co-opted or ignored by state institutions that are framed to prioritize the main elite constituencies. However, saying that consociationalism is always unfavorable for women is limiting, not only because its features are not inherently against gender equality, but also because there is limited research regarding which intervening variables can induce consociational settlements in promoting women’s rights. The thesis aims at filling this academic vacuum by investigating whether consociationalism promotes women's rights with the conditions of having a feminist civil society and the international community involved in women's empowerment. Bosnia-Herzegovina and North Macedonia are the case studies selected for this analysis, as they are both consociations that experienced a civil conflict and share many socio-historical similarities. Therefore, the research question is: Does consociationalism impact gender equality? If so, under which conditions can consociationalism promote gender equality? Did Bosnia-Herzegovina, a corporative consociation, and North Macedonia, a hybrid consociationalism, promote gender equality between 2005 and 2018?","['gender equality', 'ethnic conflict', 'consociationalism', 'Bosnia', 'North Macedonia', 'power-sharing']"

Gendered Perceptions of Profanity Amongst Adolescents in the Netherlands,"Swillens-Marinus, Aukje","['Jeffery, Jill']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"Despite the increased scholarly attention towards swearing, there is no consensus on the matter of gendered swearing (Dewaele, 2016, 2017; Hughes, 2006; Jay, 2000; Jay & Jay, 2013; McEnery, 2004). Moreover, perceptions of profanity related to adolescence and other than English languages, like Dutch, have received relatively little scholarly attention. Hence, the present research aimed to advance the understanding of gendered perceptions of use and offensiveness of profane language of Dutch adolescents. A mixed-method was employed utilizing questionnaires (n = 352) and interviews (n = 12) amongst Dutch youth to gauge perceptions of swearing in different domains, the offensiveness of swear words and differences in attitudes towards native Dutch or borrowed English swear words. While adolescents are believed to be most prone to swearing, this was not reflected in the findings of the current study, since adolescents did not rate their utterances as frequent. “Kanker” was perceived as most offensive and “kut” as most frequently uttered. Participants also shared opinions on perceived appropriateness of swearing in different domains. Moreover, Dutch profanities were perceived as more offensive than borrowed English swear words. This was mirrored in the perceptions of religious-related words: Dutch religion-related profanities were considered possibly blasphemous depending on the religious beliefs of the hearer, while English religion-related profanities were never perceived offensive. Note that “O my God” was perceived as feminine. Differences in perceptions on profanities between young men and women were found as well. Young men were perceived to swear more frequently, employing stronger swear words and perceived profanities referring to sexual orientation less offensive. Young women perceived swear words as more offensive and felt restrained by society in their swearing behaviour. These results are in line with McEnery (2004), who concluded that men are still on the lead in terms of frequency and offensiveness of swearing.","['Adolescents', 'Gender', 'Perceptions', 'Profane Language', 'Swearing']"

In seeking to explore and understand the growth of the International section of the Black Panther Party (BPP) from its base in Oakland, California to the Mediterranean coast of Algeria, this project will come across a variety of primary and academic sources that address the various influences and actions partaken in this journey. Whilst relatively short lived in its mission, the internationalisation of the BPP involved numerous actors, among whom, many have released autobiographies and memoirs detailing the unfolding of events that occurred between the years 1969-1972, alongside video speeches and declarations pertaining to such events. Yet, in order to truly appreciate this often forgotten part of the Black Panthers’ history, the years of revolutionary struggle dedicated to fighting for the rights of Black people across the world, and in the case of this project notably in the United States, albeit not solely, must also be taken into account. This is particularly important as tracing the influences of Black philosophical thinkers of the 20th Century such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon and Malcolm X on more contemporary movements, such as the Black Panther Party, is often not done so to the extent that such major influences deserve. The usefulness of highlighting the actions partaken by the BPP prove timely in assessing the current political climate faced by members of the African diaspora all over the globe, notably in the United States with the continued growth of the Black Lives Matter movement.","['Black Panthers', 'Algeria', 'Decolonisation', 'Third World', 'Black Power', 'Africa', 'Fanon', 'Malcolm X', 'Pan-Africanism', 'Black Lives Matter']"

Contested Reconciliation: War apology and Yasukuni policy under the Abe administration,"Schmidt, Casper","['Mark, Ethan']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Compared to other recent governments, the Second Abe Administration has been seen as a government with a larger interest in nationalism and patriotic history. According to various scholars, this nationalism is represented in Prime Minister Abe’s war commemoration statements, as in his 2013 visit to the Yasukuni Shrine. What is often overlooked in such discourse, is the fact that the current administration has now lasted for eight years and counting, and that no further visits to the shrine were actually made by Abe, despite his long-standing support for Yasukuni. It could be argued that rather than his actual visit, his restraint on further visits is more conspicuous. This study aims to determine the rationale behind Abe’s Yasukuni policy. Building on existing scholars’ work, it asks: How can the Yasukuni policy of Shinzo Abe be understood beyond the existing personal preference explanations? In this context, personal preference is defined as the affinity that prime ministers have with nationalistic interpretations of Japanese history, and how these are leading in determining their Yasukuni policies. Based on an analysis of previous prime ministers’ war commemoration statements (Murayama, Koizumi) and Abe’s personal profile, it could be argued that the Abe administration represents a shift towards nationalism. In relation to the Japanese publics approval of prime ministerial visits, surveys were held by Japan’s main news organizations which showed a slight increase in Yasukuni support over the last 15 years. While this change is generally attributed to the deterioration of Japan’s relations with neighboring countries over time, results of government surveys showed a drastic deterioration of the public’s perception of foreign relations. What these disproportionate results indicate, is that feelings of social distance between the Japanese people and their neighboring countries do not necessarily increase their support for prime ministerial Yasukuni visits. More convincing majority votes were found on surveys that asked whether the public approved on Abe’s restraint on Yasukuni visits, and whether the public found that Japan’s relations with its neighboring countries should be improved. On this basis, this research argues that restraint on the Yasukuni issue satisfies the majority of the public and is thus beneficial from a perspective of political survival. Further research is needed to adequately assess how the state of international relations will influence prime ministerial visits in the future.","['Japanese history', 'International relations', 'Politics of memory', 'Historical disputes']"

The Sounds of Social Shift: Kwaito and Hip-hop as Forces of Change in Early Post-Apartheid South Africa,"Vries, Jitze de","['Williams, Corey']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"South Africa's transition from an authoritarian, racialized regime to a liberal democracy at the end of the Apartheid period was in all forms radical. Politically, all citizens were suddenly equal before the law, all of whom having the right to vote, and economically the country was open to the rest of the world again, thrusting its economy into a hypermodern globalized system. Both of these changes had significant impacts on the cultural experiences of the nation’s people, who were negotiating ways to manifest their identities in the midst of all these changes, and, through this, renegotiating the power structures at the base of society. This thesis explores how popular culture, more specifically the music genres of Kwaito and Hip-hop, not only reflected this transition, but also helped shape it. Through a lense of cultural studies and political economics, the effects of these genres on power relations in the creation of a new South Africa are studied. Kwaito's evasion of, and Hip-hop's resistance against social control are seen to have effectuated new standards with regards to cultural norms and their inherent power structures, thus portraying the capacity of popular culture to spark change outside of its usual sphere of influence.","['South Africa', 'Popular Music', 'Post-Apartheid', 'Power Relations']"
"Whose ""Me Too"" Matters? Investigating the Origins of Individual Responsibility in American Political Activism","Denis-Senez, Juliette","['Van Kessel, Looi']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"""So then one question arises: who truly is legitimate to say “me too” in any social movement. As it does so, it interrogates: is there truly a way to know who is or isn’t to be the advocate of a cause. In this is the idea that there exists by opposition individuals who are considered to hold a justified role in defending a cause and are drawn as referents and entitled to a responsibility. Perhaps getting at the root of such interrogations then implies understanding how do those individuals define the origin of their responsibility in situations of social unrest. How to pinpoint such ‘responsible’ individuals is a question of first order. Responsibility entails putting something at stake in order to carry charge for a given issue. Its origin, however, is tricky to untangle as it emerges from an idiosyncratic balance between a personal sense of duty and a specific context which thrusts individuals into their engagement with hardly distinguishable degrees of influence.10 Because of how unfathomable this distinction can seem, a time-based comparison of ‘responsible’ agents in different settings yet with similar objectives would allow one to retrace whether beyond specific contexts, intrinsic features unite the process guiding their political involvement. (...) As gathering evidence is a tricky task in social movement analysis, this study cannot avoid stumbling upon its shortfalls if it is to ascertain a metaphysical truth about the origins of individual responsibility in politics. It can, nevertheless, couple representative data with observations made throughout the history of thought to hint at its general teneur and how it sheds light on the perception of legitimate participants of political action. In this attempt, the present work will study whether the mechanisms which trigger individual responsibility in politics can be identified through a time-based comparison of feminist activism in the United-States looking at the movements represented by Angela Davis and #MeToo.","['philosophy', 'political representation', 'responsibility', 'united-states', 'Angela Davis', '#MeToo']"

They also analyze whether Native Americans experienced racial prejudice or discrimination.

The goal is to identify and analyse the impact of Bolsonaro's neoliberal policies on teachers' experiences in the classroom and society. The research is based on six, qualitative, semi-structured interviews with six teachers in Curitiba. The analysis indicates that teachers find it increasingly difficult to realise their ideological aspirations towards transformative education within the framework of Bolsonaro's neoliberal policies. Based on the data, the Bolsonaro regime's neoliberal educational policies that have led further commodification of education and knowledge which deteriorate teachers' professional status, working conditions, support and pedagogical liberty.

Weaving the World: The Role of Landscape in Egyptian Religion,"Smith, Mathijs","['Kaper, Olaf E.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Since the 1990s the field of phenomenological Landscape Archaeology has gained more traction in Egyptology. Since then it has been used to illuminate the experienced landscape(s) of the ancient Egyptians. This thesis seeks to critically examine this approach and further illuminate the experienced landscape in ancient Egypt, specifically its role in religion. To this end, the author poses three primary research questions: 1) Did landscape influence the conception of places of power? 2) Do landscape associations change over time, and if they do: how do they change? 3) Did Egypt’s physical landscape influence conceptions of the landscapes of the afterlife? The sources reveal that the Egyptians experienced the landscape as embodied and meaningful. Iconography and text also support the notion of locations in the landscape which were infused with meaning beyond the mundane. These places of power sometimes held a strong relation with the surrounding landscape. In certain cases it is likely that a landscape-induced hierophany was the direct cause for their inception. Yet, it is difficult to ascribe a single coherent characteristic to these locations. Egypt’s physical landscape did not only influence experiences of religious awe, but also influenced the conception of landscapes of the afterlife. The afterlife reflects a bucolic ideal of Egypt’s physical landscape. Some scholars have proposed specific referents for the landscapes of the afterlife, but it seems imprudent to attribute such specific Vorlage-landscapes to these religious ideas. Phenomenological Landscape Archaeology allows us to further investigate landscape experience in ancient Egypt. Yet, a recurring issues in the implementation of phenomenological Landscape Archaeology is the over-excitement of Egyptologists to attribute a meaning to landscape features which has little or no support in the extant sources. This treacherous pitfall stems from the inability to acknowledge the difference in spatial conceptualisation between us and the ancient Egyptians, and the all-too-easy assumption that our views of extraordinary geomorphology are similar to those of the ancient Egyptians. Therefore, this thesis warns against all-too-quick attributions of the influence of landscape on the inception and meaning of religious locales.","['Landscape', 'Phenomelology', 'dhn.t', 'Dw Wab', 'religion', 'Gebel Barkal', 'Turin Mine Map', 'Egypt', 'el-Qurn', 'Ideational landscape', 'Vulture Rock']"

Cry Wolf or Complete Collapse? European Integration in Crisis,"Onkenhout, Max","['Natermann, Diana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the course of the last decade, the previously confident notion that European integration is a one-way street has been shattered. The successive and concurrent Eurozone, Schengen and Brexit crises have rocked the landscape of European integration discourse. The nature and impact of this “age of crisis” has seen the near collapse of the European Union’s common currency, a migration crisis that caused the temporary suspension of the Schengen agreement and the first case of a European Member State in the history of modern European integration. Since the “original six” members consisting of France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg signed the Treaty of Paris in 1952 the European integration process has never faced such a rapid development of crises before. The resulting flurry of academic discourse has led to a renewed focus on European integration theory and questioned the ability of the three “grand” European integration theories of Liberal Intergovernmentalism, Neofunctionalism and Postfunctionalism to explain this rapid succession of crises. This thesis argues that rather than being in a single state of integrational stability or instability there are in fact “two Europes” at play. Economic Europe is a stable integration process with a strong base and steady support from its Member States. Political Europe, on the other hand, is only marginally integrated, lacking in support, and in constant danger of being either abandoned or “put on the back burner”.","['European', 'integration', 'theory', 'crisis', 'politicisation', 'disintegration', 'Union']"
Continuity or Change: An Analysis of the Kremlin's Counteractive Strategy toward Anti-regime Revolutions,"Dimitrova, Ralitsa","['Skalamera, Morena']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The central objective of this research is to examine the evolution of the Kremlin’s counteractive strategy toward the “color revolutions” in post-Soviet states in light of the most recent case of protest-based regime change, the Velvet Revolution in Armenia. The latter is conceptualized as a successor to the initial interrelated wave of “color revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, which illustrates a changing pattern of opposition movements’ learning-drawing behavior to neutralize Russian interference. The Russian counteractive approach toward the revolutions is analyzed through the use of prospect theory, further revealing that the Kremlin’s strategy has evolved from taking an active to a more passive stance. The findings do not to confirm that Russia has developed a specific strategy or that its approach has evolved through a self-learning basis despite its increasing willingness to take on a more balanced position. To better understand this shift, three hypotheses (“the actor-centered hypothesis,” “the Western support hypothesis” and “the sitting regime hypothesis”) are formulated and tested as alternative explanations through the use of process tracing. The analysis of the evidence reveals that there is, indeed, a causal link between the oppositions’ evolving political agenda and the corresponding passivity of the Kremlin’s approach, which is observed in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. However, there is no solid evidence to confirm that Western support during a revolution or that the active attempts of the incumbents to stay in power have specifically triggered the Russian response. Nevertheless, Russian authorities have actively used the alleged Western interference as a tool to delegitimize the revolutions.","['Color Revolutions', ""the Kremlin's strategy"", 'opposition', 'agency', 'lesson-drawing', 'Western support', 'Incumbent regimes', 'process tracing', 'prospect theory']"
Pursuing Free Trade or Development? The Priorities of the European Commission and the European Parliament during the negotiations of the Economic Partnership Agreements with ACP countries,"Jurado, Felisa","['Richard, Anne-Isabelle']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The EU is one of the world’s largest markets and an important export destination for developing countries. Especially African countries depend on the European market and are greatly affected by its trade policies. Trade relations between the EU and developing countries have existed since the inception of the EU. For a long period, the EU has focused on the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries alone, due to their colonial ties with the EU, disregarding other developing countries. However, since the mid-1990s, the ACP countries have faced the consequences of a shifting paradigm in the EU when it comes to trade policy and development. This research focuses on the recent trade relations between the EU and ACP countries. Once the EU wishes to conclude new international trade agreements, such as the controversial Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament have important roles, which influence the course of the negotiations. This research looks at the behaviour of the Commission and the European Parliament during the negotiations of the new EPAs between 2002 and 2013. The literature on the power identity of the EU in international relations is extensive, but speaks about the EU as if it were a homogenous institution. It therefore fails to distinguish the different power identities of the European Institutions. This research provides an original contribution to existing literature by distinguishing the particular identities of the Commission and the European Parliament in international trade relations. A critical discourse analysis shows that the European Parliament prioritised the concerns of the ACP countries during the negotiations and emphasised the need for development-oriented EPAs. The European Parliament challenged the arguments and negotiation tactics of the Commission, which shows that it did not agree with the course taken and intended to hold the Commission accountable. Moreover, it illustrates that the European Parliament took on the task to represent not just EU citizens, but ACP citizens as well. The Commission, on the other hand, prioritised the opening up of ACP markets, which it claimed would lead to development, and the swift conclusion of the negotiations. The Commission avoided discussing the concerns raised by the ACP countries, tried to convince others of the positive atmosphere during the negotiations, and repeatedly claimed to only have the best interests at heart for ACP countries.","['Economic Partnership Agreements', 'EPA', 'Trade', 'European Parliament', 'European Commission', 'African, Caribbean and Pacific countries', 'ACP', 'Developing Countries', 'Trade Negotiations', 'Development', 'Normative Power Europe', 'Market Power Europe', 'European Union']"

Kamp Erika was tijdens de oorlog een strafkamp in de bossen van Ommen. In juni 1941 trokken de eerste bewakers in het kamp en in april 1945 werd het kamp bevrijd. In de tussentijd werden er allerlei mensen opgesloten. Van juni 1942 tot juni 1943 waren dit vooral overtreders van de distributiewetten. Veel levensmiddelen waren op de bon gegaan maar niet iedereen hield zich daaraan, vooral zwarthandelaars werden opgepakt. In de tijd dat deze zwarthandelaren gevangen zaten in het kamp werd er veel geweld gebruikt tegen de gevangenen. Mishandelingen en slagen met een zweep of stok behoorden tot de dagelijkse gang van zaken. Uiteindelijk werden de bewakers op hun vingers getikt en in juni 1943 werden de bestaande gevangenen overgeplaatst naar andere kampen en namen de mishandelingen af. De nieuwe groep gevangenen bestond voornamelijk uit weigeraars van de arbeidsinzet en mensen die niet terug waren gekeerd van hun verlof. Waarom de bewakers van Kamp Erika zo ver gingen en buitensporig geweld gebruikten wordt in dit onderzoek bestudeert. Hierbij kunnen verschillende factoren een rol spelen, in het historisch debat gaat het vooral om de vraag of dit situationele of dispositionele factoren zijn.","['Kamp Erika', 'Situationeel', 'Dispositioneel', 'Bewakers', 'Tweede Wereldoorlog', 'Ommen', 'Bezetting', 'Daders']"
Inter-Institutional Rivalry and the Spitzenkandidaten Experiment: Analysing the 2014-2019 Inter-Election Period and Understanding the Non-Implementation of the Spitzenkandidaten System in 2019,"Muskus, Alexander","['Van Keulen, Mendeltje']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The mechanism for appointing the President of the European Commission has undergone a significant change in the post-Lisbon era. The introduction of the Spitzenkandidaten system, in the lead up to the 2014 European Parliamentary elections, marked a distinct shift in the inter-institutional power balance between the European Council and the European Parliament. As a consequence of the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as Commission President, the European Parliament had exerted considerable influence, despite not having a clear legal mandate. However, the shift in the inter-institutional balance of power was temporary. The Spitzenkandidaten system did not become codified in the Treaties and the future of the system became a subject of debate. A shift occurred in the 2014-2019 inter-election period, culminating in the non-implementation of the appointment mechanism in 2019. This thesis will trace historically the evolution of the Spitzenkandidaten system, recount the appointment procedure in 2014 and analyse the ensuing inter-institutional power struggle between the European Council and the European Parliament. To explain the non-implementation of the Spitzenkandidaten system in 2019, Müller Gomez, Wessels and Wolters (2019) theoretical approach to inter-institutional relations is implemented. In doing so, the thesis contributes to a wider debate about the institutional architecture of the EU and the balance of power between the institutions, i.e., the interplay between supranationalism and intergovernmentalism.","['European Union', 'European Parliament', 'Inter-Institutional Relations']"

It will examine how the democratisation of the field of Greek and Roman classical scholarship, through an increase of female scholars working in this field and the application of concepts from feminist theory to classical texts, enabled Smith in her retelling of the Iphis myth by providing new interpretations for this myth. It will then be examined how Smith formed this new narrative by working within the scholarly framework of Judith Butler’s theories on gender and sexuality, illuminating and foregrounding the issues of gender ambiguity and same-sex relationships that are already present in the original myth. Finally, the importance of intertextuality and epigraphs in Smith’s work will also be taken into account by considering how she engages with the gender confusion and homoerotic tendencies present in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, The Tempest, Cymbeline, and A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Lyly’s Gallathea, providing a literary context for her novel which she uses to support her own narrative and, sometimes, to change the cultural resonance of Elizabethan plays that deal with gender and same-sex relationships.","['Reception Studies', 'Gender Theory', 'Intertextuality', 'Ali Smith', 'Ovid']"

"""¡No cejaremos hasta que se haga justicia!"": The responses of two Mexican presidents to the accusations of a state crime","Tjin, Cynthia","['Eduardo, Alves Viera']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"On the 26th of September in 2014, 43 students of the Ayotzinapa Normal school disappeared after being arrested by the local police of Iguala in Guerrero, a southern state in Mexico. While this incident is not an isolated case of disappearances in Mexico, Ayotzinapa gained international media attention due to the belief by the Mexican population that then-president Enrique Peña Nieto was involved in the incident. Independent investigations into the case have strengthened these accusations of a state crime, as they were able to gather evidence that contradict the government’s official version of the incident, which holds the Mayor of Iguala and the Drug Trafficking Organization Guerreros Unidos accountable. These contending versions have inhibited the resolving of the case, meaning that the population continues to demand for justice. Peña Nieto finished his term in 2018, leaving his successor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to bring justice for the students and managing the state crime accusations. This thesis explores how both presidents have addressed Ayotzinapa and the question of responsibility for it in their presidential discourses. Seeing as it was Peña Nieto who was in office when it happened, it is expected that he takes a different stance to the accusations, in comparison to López Obrador, who is not directly accused of committing the crime. Using the Critical Discourse Analysis framework, the results of this thesis demonstrate that the presidents take similar approaches when responding to the state crime accusations. However, their discourses differ when addressing structural problems that characterize the status-quo in Mexico, such as corruption, impunity and violence.","['Ayotzinapa', 'Mexico', 'State Crime', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Presidential Discourse', 'Enrique Peña Nieto', 'Andrés Manuel López Obrador']"
Capitalism & Democracy in the Digital Age: Examining How the USA & Germany Enable & Disempower Surveillance Capitalism & Google,"Kelley, Jake","['Duzgun, Eren']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis sets itself within this broader theoretical debate of discussing the relationship between capitalism and democracy. It investigates how capitalism has been able to gain unrivaled power within the global political economy, particularly over democracy, through further developing the separation between what is determined as the 'political' and the 'economic'. Furthermore, it concentrates on the implications of the significant structural changes caused by capitalism and its role in shaping the digitalization of our societies. In the process, the paper analyzes Shoshanna Zuboff's understanding of surveillance capitalism because it is the needed contemporary analytical assessment of how big tech and its surveillance operations produce various adverse outcomes in the global political economy. It primarily focuses on how surveillance capitalists utilize the ideology and mechanisms of capitalism while undermining democracy and increasing epistemological and material inequalities. In its many forms, surveillance capitalism undermines democracy and human rights and creates unequal power structures within our societies. These adverse developments are possible because of the specific historical conditions that allowed surveillance capitalism to thrive and become normative behavior. Existing political and economic structures enabled surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook, and Amazon to become dominant hegemonic forces in the global political economy. These corporations undemocratically extract data from individuals' lives by coercing users to accept their terms and conditions, which can take days to fully understand the implications on their human rights, privacy, and freedoms (Zuboff, 2019). Surveillance capitalists then capitalize on their data by selling it for profit, using it to improve their services, or utilizing it to predict and manipulate future behavior in collaboration with other market actors (Zuboff, 2019). This represents the commodification of human behavior, personal information and digital social interactions. How actors like Google have been able to extract, commodify (or profit from) and manipulate individuals' behavior has severe implications for the individual human rights and foundational principles and values of democracy. All of this depicts a pattern of subordinating human behavior to the logic of capitalist markets for profit while putting at risk the freedom, autonomy, and self-determination of citizens in the market, politics, and everyday life. Democratic countries have enabled and undermined Google and other corporations that create unequal power structures and succeed in exploiting citizens. This thesis identifies and analyses how the United States and Germany have attempted to address Google's intrusive big data operations. Particularly, it focuses on how they have both undermined and protected democracy by addressing surveillance capitalism and its adverse outcomes.","['surveillance capitalism', 'democracy', 'inequality', 'big tech', 'human rights', 'big data', 'google', 'Germany', 'USA', 'historical materialism']"

Niche Diplomacy as a Soft Power Strategy for Small States,"Tunde, Eniola","['Nakamura, Mari']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Small states particularly those in the Global South, have often been relegated to being objects of international relations rather than actors. When discussed by most scholars, much focus is put on their ability to cooperate with big powers or form coalitions in order to achieve their goals. Only a few scholars discuss the ability of small states to independently hold power in international relations. Amongst those who do, only a small number go further than affirming that small states can exist independently in a world dominated by large power states. They often fall short in theorizing ways for small states to acquire and keep this independent power. By focusing on Fiji and its implementation of niche diplomacy, this thesis will argue that small states are not only capable of being independent actors of world politics, but that they can become leaders in a domain of international politics. Although niche diplomacy is a type of diplomacy often associated with middle powers who have the capacity of becoming big powers, this article will argue that it is in fact a strategy that can assist states who have the potential and capacity but not necessarily the window of opportunity needed to establish themselves as international powers.","['Alternative', 'Small states', 'Niche diplomacy', 'Strategy', 'Independent power']"

The legal significance of a high level of environmental protection in the EU,"Kralingen, Rominique van","['Etty, Thijs']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This research aims to find out what the legal significance is of the provision of a high level of environmental protection in the EU. To do so, the paper aims to assess if the ambition can be seen as a rule, a principle, or an ambition in primary and secondary law, and in case law. First, the development and wording of the provision in primary law is outlined. Next, the inclusion of the ambition in secondary law is discussed by examining 24 EU environmental laws. Third, case law is researched by looking at to how the Court of Justice of the European Union explains and uses the provision. From this information, it seems that a high level of protection can be categorized as a principle. Moreover, its legal significance lies in its ability to ensure that harmonization in the environmental field is possible by collectively agreeing to a high level of protection, while maintaining the flexibility for the EU legislature to assess and negotiate the exact level of protection that is necessary. Also, it is legally significant because it provides the CJEU with the power to correct manifest errors of assessment concerning the level of environmental protection by forming an integral part of the arguments used to annul certain EU laws.","['EU law', 'Environmental law', 'Environmental policy', 'High level of environmental protection']"

A blessing or a curse for the relationship with your neighbours? It is precisely this question that this paper is concerned with. Discoveries of enormous natural gas fields in the Eastern Mediterranean are having a paradigm shifting effect on the international relations of the region. Hence, the research question that drives this thesis is the following. What will the impact of the natural gas be on the international relations of the states of the Eastern Mediterranean? This paper will show that natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean has led to greater cooperation and regionalisation and will continue to do so in the future. However, this paper will also show the limitations of the beneficial effects of cooperation over natural resources. The relevancy of this topic stems from it alluding to an important question, whether natural resources are a blessing or a curse. For many countries the discovery of natural resources has led to great wealth and development. However, for many others it has been a burden leading to less development and growth or even weakening democracy. Resources and the competition over them can also lead to conflict and it is this realm of the international political consequences of the resources that this paper is focused on.","['Natural Gas', 'International Relations', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'Turkey', 'International Relations Theory']"
Doopsgezinden en het Pachtersoproer te Harlingen in 1748,"Keizer, Laurens","['Boender, C.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In 1748 vond in de Republiek het Pachtersoproer plaats. Verspreid over de gewesten kwam de bevolking in opstand tegen de in hun ogen onrechtvaardige belastingheffing. In Harlingen sloeg deze woede snel om in een politieke beweging met een breed programma: herziening van het belastingstelsel, bestuurlijke hervormingen en inperking van de invloed van de regentenklasse, en een grotere rol voor Willem IV als stadhouder. Opmerkelijk is dat de Doopsgezinden in deze politieke beweging sterk oververtegenwoordigd waren. Hoe is dat te verklaren? Het belastingstelsel kende een grote impact op de koophandel en zeevaart, een industrie waarvan ruim een derde van de werknemers doopsgezind waren. Daarnaast was er gedurende de achttiende eeuw binnen de doopsgezinde gemeenschap sprake van een toenemende vrijzinnigheid: hierdoor trad de gemeenschap naar buiten en bemoeide zich steeds vaker met politieke ontwikkelingen. Daarnaast werd er toenadering gezocht tot de gereformeerde bevolking. Een groot deel van laatstgenoemde werd door de regentenklasse weerhouden van het vervullen van een politiek ambt. Een samenwerking tussen doopsgezinden en gereformeerden kon in de ogen van hen hier verandering in brengen.","['Pachtersoproer', 'Harlingen', '1748', 'Doopsgezinden', 'Politieke emancipatie']"
Small States and the EU: Methods and Perception of Influence,"Bullman, Jason","['Broad, Matthew']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Small states occupy a minor, yet important, aspect of the study of international relations. While large states and great powers are still accorded the lion’s share of agency in international politics and negotiations, scholars have long recognised that small states are not passive actors and can influence developments on the international stage despite their limited resources. This is accomplished mainly through a variety of strategies that small states apply on the international stage. The effectiveness of these strategies are subject to conditions in the wider international or institutional context, but are still the major avenue through which small state governments exercise agency outside of their national borders. These strategies have been closely examined by scholars, particularly in the context of the European Union, where the highly formalised institutional environment offers both obstacles and opportunities for small states to pursue their agendas at the supranational level. The case study of Ireland, a small state on the periphery of the EU, will be examined in order to determine how peripheral small state governments attempt to affect the development of EU policy. Irish attempts to influence EU foreign and security policy will be investigated, policies that have traditionally been dominated by analyses of large state actors. However, an increasing amount of scholarship argues that small states have the ability to affect the EU in this field as well. This thesis seeks to place the interaction between Ireland and the EU in the wider global context by examining the role a third party international organisation, the UN, has on Ireland’s influence at the EU.","['Small States', 'European Union', 'Influence', 'Security Policy', 'United Nations', 'Ireland']"

This work targets two elements in Chinese foreign politics: the Community of Shared Future for Mankind and the Near-Seas Strategy, each of which has a major role in Beijing’s relations with other countries. Moreover, this thesis proposes that the relation between the two elements is hitherto unexplored and warrants for further investigation, for these topics often recur in IR literature, but only independently. Therefore, it sets to understand the nature of such relation, through an analysis that is both numerical and qualitative – highlighting their meaning, components and implications – as well as an interpretation through the concept of Harmony. The analysis will show that documents and discourses concerning the Community of Shared Future for Mankind focus mostly on peaceful development and (win-win) cooperation, whereas the Near-Seas Strategy expresses and addresses Beijing’s concerns in the South Chinas Sea and towards the ongoing disputes with other countries in the area, namely Taiwan. Finally, the interpretation through the concept of Harmony will shed a light on their coherency towards the goal of a Harmonious society.","[""People's Republic of China"", 'The Rise of China', 'Chinese foreign policy', 'Community of Shared Future for Mankind', 'Near-Seas Strategy', 'South China Sea']"

This research investigates how the artistic-anthropological projects of Leone Contini craft a counter-discourse of migration. Dealing mostly but not exclusively with Chinese migrants in Italy, it explores how the invasive/native antithesis is constantly being deconstructed by the art, both in relation to both vegetation and humans. To do so, it uses a discourse analysis methodology to survey the use of language but also to show how artistic practices can create discourse. The deconstruction relies on an anthropological approach, where multi-sitedness, complexity, long-term processes and collaboration with the Others are seen as the necessary preconditions. The research concludes by showing how the hybrid, nomadic, unsettled subjectivity of the migrants contaminates the identity of all participants in a generative way.",

Body Parts in Hamar,"Wit, Arende de","['Ameka, Felix K.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims at providing a preliminary description of body part terms and their use in Hamar, a language of Ethiopia. Mainly based on elicited data from a native speaker, an overview is given of body part terms in Hamar. Several lexical and grammatical features of body part terms are discussed. It is explained why a body part partonomy could not be established. Going beyond the human body, animal body part terms and their relation to human body part terms are explored. The way in which Hamar denotes the ‘top’ and the ‘back’ of objects is based on anthropomorphic and zoomorphic models. It is argued that body part mapping in Hamar is mainly due to an analogy in shape/appearance, space/position and function. Hamar uses body part terms to express deictic orientation, similar to other African languages. In doing so, the language interacts with case markers and elevation deictics.

Occupational Hazards for Drivers in Colombia’s Illegal Ride-hailing Economy. Employment on the edge of criminality and informality,"Twan Leo Jan, Hol","['Solheim, Håvar']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Ride-hailing platforms have been able to rapidly expand their operations in nearly all countries of Latin America within less than a decade. As in other parts of the world, the new concept of ride-hailing has been received with a certain grade of suspicion by lawmakers and other stakeholders in the traditional transport sector. Especially in Colombia, policies have been implemented that aim to desist workers from supplying rides for the various platforms that are active in the country, while at the same time these workers have reportedly been attacked by their traditional peers active for the taxi industry. While in research many attention has been paid to the construction of labor relations between the platforms and the workers, the way the platforms have impacted passengers’ decision-making process regarding modes of transport and the characteristics of ride-hailing platforms vis-à-vis the taxi industry, little research has been done on the decision-making process of ride-hailing drivers. Noting an increase in police enforcement and violence from taxi drivers towards ride-hailing drivers on the one side and a high amount of drivers that, in spite of the circumstances, remain active on the other side, this thesis aims to gather an insight into the dynamics of the labor circumstances in which these drivers find themselves. By using the framework of the economic theory of crime, restrictive deterrence and occupational hazards, this thesis maps the perceived occupational risks faced by drivers, the way drivers attempt to mitigate these perceived risks and, consequently, how drivers construct their decision to either continue or desist from their occupation. By interviewing 9 drivers in Bogotá, in combination with a discourse analysis, it was found that drivers have a high perception of the risks attributed to their occupation. Depending on their socio-economic status, however, the drivers accept these risks while applying avoidance techniques in order to be able to continue their activities. Whereas not all respondents fit into the profile of lower skilled workers, most of them face exclusion mechanisms from the formal labor market, which leaves them with ride-hailing platforms as the sole alternative of generating a desired basic income. The findings indicate that drivers will be able to continue to manage their perception of risk through avoidance techniques as long as the profit from their activities remains higher than the formal alternative. This will likely remain the case as long as the labor market in Colombia is not able to bring forward decent jobs and the public prefers ride-hailing over other modes of transport. Considering the great availability of both the ride-hailing platforms and its drivers to adapt to changed regulations and policing tactics, this thesis suggest it for policy makers to be more productive to address impediments within the labor market and public transportation rather than aiming at desisting ride-hailing drivers.","['Platform economy', 'Ride-hailing', 'Occupational Hazard', 'Deterrence', 'Choice-making', 'Informality', 'Avoidance techniques', 'Economic model of crime', 'sharing economy', 'Public transport']"
Introducing Global Warming into the Wildlife Documentary Genre,"Daniel, Elisa","['Ross, Julian']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"For the past few decades, nature documentaries have remained a stable genre in the world of television and cinema, evolving at a slow pace towards increasingly spectacular camera performances and the respect of animals. A guarantee of quality, merging beautiful scenery with cinematic music and simple plots. In recent years however, the chain reaction triggered by global warming has accelerated to an extent that increasingly forces news outlets to call it a climate emergency or the climate crisis. A growing movement of activists of all ages and their influential spokespeople, from Greta Thunberg to David Attenborough, are pressing people and governments to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and take radical action. In this climate, it is difficult to imagine how nature documentaries could remain what they had been up until now: seemingly objective images of animals far from humans, whose untold stories are revealed by the voice of a narrator. With a loss of 60% of the planet’s wildlife since 1970 according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), journalists and filmmakers themselves have wondered how much longer documentaries claiming to care about the environment could still avoid showing man’s impact, while landscapes and species continue to disappear. Two series of wildlife documentaries responding to this criticism were launched respectively on the BBC in October 2017 and on Netflix in April 2019. They were both narrated by the most notorious wildlife documentary voice in the UK, Sir David Attenborough. This dissertation identifies the tools used in ​Blue Planet II​ and refined in ​Our Planet t​ o introduce global warming into the discourse of their genre. In doing so, it answers the question of how modern wildlife documentaries can highlight the relationship between animal protection and climate change, while visually maintaining the genre’s codes separating nature from the human world. This paper argues that by systematically reminding the viewers of the connection between all living beings, these series have created a new discourse for the genre. This innovation comes after years of BBC nature documentaries rarely acknowledging climate change, and allows filmmakers to demonstrate accountability and encourage viewers to act against global warming, in a way that is unique to wildlife documentaries.","['Global Warming', 'Wildlife Documentaries', 'Nature Documentaries', 'Our Planet', 'Blue Planet II']"

An Exploration of the Correlation Between Trump’s Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric and the Success of Economic Integration for Latin American Immigrants in the United States,"Kan, Kristel Yuan Ting","['Van Gijn, Rik']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The issue of immigrant integration has become increasingly salient over the last decades in receiving societies. Integration in the economic spectrum is the most important for the overall success of integration in the new society. Unfortunately, economic integration faces challenges. From 2016 onwards, Donald Trump expressed anti-immigrant attitudes through multiple media forms, for instance, political speeches. Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric is mostly focused on Latin American immigrants, which might result in increasing prejudices towards Latinos in the US. This research will explore the possible correlation between Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric expressed in political speeches and the success of the economic integration of Latin American immigrants in the United States. Based upon a theoretical framework that argues that prejudices will develop into discrimination when threats are identified, a connection between attitudes and economic integration will be made. The political speeches will be analyzed with Critical Discourse Analysis based upon six factors of assessment. Economic integration will be measured by analyzing labor participation, labor occupation, income, and poverty levels among the Latino population in the United States. Ultimately, these analyses have not established a clear correlation between Trump's anti-immigrant utterances and the success of economic integration.",

"""I am my own mistress"": Examining the Role of Marriage in the Female Gothic's Quest for Freedom in A Sicilian Romance and Jane Eyre","Bosselaar, Janette Maria","['Van Dijkhuizen, J.F.']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines the role of marriage and gender relations in two influential Gothic novels, namely A Sicilian Romance by Ann Radcliffe and Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë. Both novels belong to the sub-genre of ‘Female Gothic’ and deal with female protagonists who are victims of oppression by patriarchal figures. Female Gothic heroines rebel against their oppressors and are often successful in achieving some sort of freedom or independence. This striving for freedom can be defined as their ‘quest for freedom’. In their oppression, marriage fulfils a central role, as it is used to satisfy the selfish desires of their male superiors without any regards to their opinion. Simultaneously, however, marriage seems to serve as a key in the escape from their oppression, resulting in an interesting antithesis concerning the function and role of marriage in these novels. This raises the question of whether these marriages at the end actually align with the Female Gothic’s quest for freedom and independence. Therefore, this thesis examines to what extent Julia’s and Jane’s marriage in the novels A Sicilian Romance and Jane Eyre align with the overarching theme of freedom and independence of Female Gothic. I will do so by examining Julia’s and Jane’s quests for freedom and independence more closely in relation to the meaning of marriage in both novels. I will argue that Julia’s marriage in A Sicilian Romance is successful in strengthening the novel’s theme of freedom, as it shows that marriage in itself is not the equivalent of imprisonment and that it even catalyses her desire for freedom, causing her to actively oppose her arranged marriage. Jane’s marriage in Jane Eyre, however, undermines the novel’s theme of independence, as it shows her willingness to forgo her principles for the judgemental and possessive love of Rochester. Even though at the end of the novel, they reach equality, neither of them is able to recognize nor accept it, strengthening Jane’s feeling of inferiority.","['Marriage', 'Jane Eyre', 'A Sicilian Romance', 'Freedom', 'Female Gothic', 'Gender']"

Practices pursued by the local government have gained significant international attention. Certain rituals are considered infringements of fundamental human rights by international institutions; however, they could be sought by women and considered important steps in their personal growth. Through a case-study analysis on two main practices under Sharia law, namely caning as corporal punishment and female genital mutilation, this thesis will contribute to the global understanding of women’s rights and their relation to Islamic law and its cultural traditions. It will do so by generating insights into the potential violation of their rights in Aceh. Particularly, it will define how the separation of powers in the region and the incompetence of the law enforcement lead to discrimination against women. Finally, the thesis will suggest future research to focus more on a culturally dependent notion of human rights and analyse its impact on women’s rights.""","['Sharia law', 'women’s rights', 'Aceh', 'caning', 'female genital mutilation']"

Sapologie: The Strive for a Cultural Legacy in the 21st Centruy?,"Musomba, Natalie","['Wilson Janssens, Maria Catherina']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The notion of self-representation can be very polemic in today’s world. It's even more disruptive in post-colonial discourse as scholars question the originality and traditions of current relevant cultures in post-colonial states. An example of these post-colonial states is the Republic of Congo, which was under direct rule of France from 1880-1960. It has been noted that the French ruled by assimilation was much more imposing than the indirect rule employed by the British. Assimilation meant for complete and total adaptation to the French Western culture. Therefore, the notion of self-representation and cultural legacies in post-colonial Congo is very much layered and complex as one needs to understand to what extent one culture begins and where another ends. The complexity of cultures in this day and age cannot be addressed without giving some credit to globalisation. Globalisation has brought about further adaptations and mutations of culture in the global social sphere and therefore identifying the “authenticity” - realness or originality- of customs, traditions or any attributed way of life becomes elusive. Taking the example of the Sapologie phenomenon in the Congo, one could assess the manner in which it has become a cultural legacy in the 21st Century. One can say that the S.A.P.E movement illustrates “how the modern economic practices of the Congolese helps distinguish how disempowered and formerly subjugated groups attempt to use consumer culture to claim their status as citizens and, indeed, human beings.”1 We are in the postcolonial era, and rightly so, cultures have evolved further to not only accommodate the different context but also the different social frameworks. The 21st Century is starkly highlighted as the advent of the super digital era, so one may ask if this cultural phenomenon has created a legacy for itself in the 21st Century, especially among the youth. This essay will examine the Sapologie culture and how it has adapted itself to the current contexts.",

The preservation of Indigenous cultural heritage in the context of Intercultural Bilingual Education,"Louafi, Lea","['Van Gijn, Rik']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Indigenous rights have been at the forefront of Latin American policymakers and the government’s agendas in the last decades. Due to the rapid cultural assimilation of indigenous groups in most Latin American countries, governments have struggled to preserve the cultural heritage of these communities. This was partially due to the lack of recognition indigenous populations faced in Latin America until the 1980s. Due to the rise in threat of extinction to indigenous languages, debates have been sparked about the best way to preserve and revitalize them. Their recognition as part of a society is not enough and active measures need to be taken to adequately ensure the survival of these cultural heritages. These challenges have been tackled through various measures, one of which is the introduction of bilingual education in schools. The introduction of bilingual schools allowed for indigenous children to access education in their own languages. However, these were mostly shaped by the notion of subtractive bilingualism, essentially leading to the suppression of the non - Spanish languages. Still, Latin American governments in partnership with various indigenous representatives and local authorities continue to develop them to better accommodate specific regions and communities.","['Bilingual Education', 'Indigenous', 'Language preservation', 'Cultural heritage']"

Stories from the periphery: African political perspectives on Africa-China relations,"Ashmore, Lauren","['Gawthorpe, Andrew']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Burgeoning Africa-China relations have sparked considerable debate over the past two decades. Many Western academics, politicians, and journalists now see growing Africa-China relations as a form of Chinese neo-colonialism in Africa that is challenging Western efforts to help the continent develop. It is in this atmosphere of competition that the perspectives of Africans themselves have often been overlooked. This research paper attempts to shed light on these perspectives by analysing how elite political discourse in South Africa, Zambia and Angola perceives growing Africa-China relations, and how this discourse differs from common themes found in Western discourse. The paper combines a macro critical political discourse analysis of elite political discourse with a qualitative comparative analysis of these three case studies, within the timeframe January 2018 – January 2020. The research paper reveals that African political discourse often differs from, and indeed challenges, common themes found in Western discourse. In doing so, this research also contests the ‘universality’ of Western perceptions of both Africa and Africa-China relations. And finally, this research problematises the portrayal of non-Western actors in mainstream IR and highlights the need to listen to these voices from the periphery.","['China', 'Africa', 'Political', 'Discourse', 'Agency', 'Non-Western', 'voices']"

The Protest Paradigm and RIA Novosti's Articles on Ukrainian Protesters,"Berg, Stefan van den","['Frear, Matthew']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"On the 21 st of November 2013, the then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych announced his decision to suspend signing an association agreement with the European Union. Discontent about the suspension lead to the eruption of protests at Independence square in Kyiv, where demonstrators insisted the president would sign the agreement as planned. When the president and his administration appeared unwilling to concede, protesters increasingly called for his resignation and for early elections. When the president fled the country in February 2014 after four months of protests, the crisis in Ukraine was far from over. The Crimean peninsula got annexed by Russia, and an armed conflict arose in the Donbas region. The events have been widely reported by international media, although in divergent ways. The western narrative characterised the protests as a revolution of dignity that would make an end to Russia’s dominance in the country. The Russian media however, presented it as a fascist coup sponsored by the West that threatened the population of the Russian world (Szostek 2018, 118-119). This paper will analyse articles that were published by RIA Novosti and later transferred to the website of Sputnik news in order to find out what narrative has been communicated to an international audience. The analysis will be done at the hand of examination of the applicability of the protest paradigm on a selection of articles that are linked to the protests. Firstly however, it will be reviewed what has so far been written on a handful of topics that relate to the topic of this paper. The crisis in Ukraine that started as a result of the protests will be introduced, after which the role of soft power in the conflict is demonstrated. Strategic narrative as a form of soft power, and various analyses of Russian narratives in this context will be displayed thereafter. As protests are oftentimes portrayed in a way that marginalises the protests and the protesters, literature that deals with the protest paradigm will be reviewed as well. The reception of strategic narratives by the audience is key to the perceived credibility of narratives and will be thus be considered as well. In order to contextualise the findings of this paper, earlier analysis of Russia Today will exemplify the current knowledge on the narratives on the Ukrainian pro-European protests in English- language Russian media.","['protest', 'paradigm', 'ukraine', 'maidan']"

Renaming Macedonia: From Conflict to Consensus through Bargaining the Prespa Agreement,"Togooch, Gegeen","['Valk, John-Harmen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"In early 2019, a nearly three decade old naming dispute came to an end between Greece and (North) Macedonia through the Prespa Agreement’s ratification. The dispute started in the early nineties after the former Yugoslav Republic declared itself independent under the name of ‘Republic of Macedonia’. Since Greece perceives Ancient Macedonian history and heritage as part of its national identity, the country refused to recognize its neighboring country’s name. In the time period between 1991 and 2018, domestic politics in both Greece and Macedonia showed mutually exclusive characteristics regarding the ownership of the symbolism of Macedonia. Considering the three decade long non-settlement of the naming issue, it only took a rough six months to come to the Prespa Agreement. Through the use of discourse analysis, speech acts of Greek and Macedonian governments have been analyzed in order to grasp how it was possible to come to such a quick consensus after many years of non-agreement. In this research will be argued that the Prespa Agreement was possible through the shift from arguing to bargaining the naming issue. Furthermore, the Prespa Agreement was strategically used by both nation states to negotiate the boundaries between the two national identities.","['place-name disputes', 'symbolism', 'arguing and bargaining', 'identity', 'Prespa Agreement']"

Fiddling while Juba burns: Why did the implementation of the Responsibility to Protect doctrine in South Sudan from 2005 to 2018 fail?,"Culligan, Kevin","['Smith, Karen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the UN’s Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, specifically focusing on its implementation in South Sudan from 2005 to 2018. Promulgated in 2005, the R2P doctrine aimed to prevent the occurrence of mass atrocity crimes, these being genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing. Most of the public debate about and literature on R2P has focused on the use of coercive measures by the international community in general and on potential military interventions for humanitarian purposes in particular. This thesis instead takes a more holistic approach to analysing R2P, discussing all three pillars of the doctrine. These are the state’s responsibility to protect (Pillar I); international assistance and capacity building (Pillar II); and a timely and decisive response by the international community in a situation where mass atrocities are imminent or are already being perpetrated (Pillar III). After exploring the literature on R2P and explaining the methodology that will be used, the thesis then explores the implementation of the doctrine before and during the South Sudanese Civil War. The thesis finds that the South Sudanese government were ineffective in adopting measures to protect its population from mass atrocities. Indeed, some policies actually increased the risk of such crimes while important government members and political elites were actively involved in the crimes that were perpetrated. It also finds that the international community’s assistance under Pillar II was generally well-intentioned but often misguided, while the timely and decisive response under Pillar III was hamstrung by an unwillingness to utilise or even consider all of the tools available.","['Responsibility to Protect', 'South Sudan', 'UNMISS', 'genocide', 'war crimes', 'crimes against humanity', 'ethnic cleansing', 'Salva Kiir', 'Riek Machar', 'SPLM/A', 'SPLM/A-IO']"

On the one hand the king of Alashiya ‘Cyprus’ is mentioned as an equal to the Egyptian King in the Amarna Letters. Various texts from Egypt, Hatti and Ugarit reveal the increasing activity of the island in the trade networks of the eastern Mediterranean area and its dominant role as a copper supplier. On the other hand, the archaeological data inside the island display a society with simple socio-economic structures. The few signs of economic intensification, surplus manipulation and craft specialization are not enough to prove the “supremacy” of a certain elite or even a king.

Post-Monetarism and Rethinking Finland's Universal Basic Income Trial,"Verheyen, Yelle","['Valk, John-Harmen']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Automation will impact economies in the future by drastically changing the labor market composition, and potentially cause a massive global job loss. In light of this, governments should try to enact policies that can absorb the impacts of automation. One such suggestion is that of a Universal Basic Income, which guarantees individuals a basic monthly income without any conditions. In light of UBI, post-monetarism offers a perspective that connects individuals and social monetary relations, by looking into how elements of society that is connected with money determines the social relationship it has with individuals. Post-monetarism reflects on the interconnections between work, money, and an individual's participation in an economy. Those who attempt to enact UBI policies can benefit from a post-monetarist perspective as it helps to explain the nuances of the elements that connect money and individuals. Work does not only provide monetary compensation for individuals, but they also provide meaning and motivation to participate in society and an economy. UBI has been at the forefront on the political economic discourse regarding automation and its effects on the job market. However, one aspect that is often missing from the discourse is the economic culture that is fostered through the social monetary relations in a society. An example of a case where a post-monetarist perspective is missing and could add more substance to a particular discourse is in the case of Finland's attempt to conduct a study on the effects of UBI. This paper demonstrates that the study in Finland did not provide more substantial results as there was a large knowledge gap between the post-monetarist perspective and the way it sees UBI and the way the UBI policies were enacted in the Finnish study.",

I have selected these video fragments by searching the dataset for the verb ZEGGEN ‘say’ in the corpus NGT, because this is an indicator for a direct or indirect quote (Stec, Huiskes, and Redeker 2016, 5). This is a new method and has yielded many cases of CD. The selected clips already contain time-aligned glosses in ELAN, but I have added annotations concerning CA using the guidelines provided by Cormier, Smith, and Sevcikova (2015).","['constructed action', 'NGT', 'Sign Language of the Netherlands', 'constructed dialogue', 'role shift']"
The Collective Memory of Trauma: How The Experience of Ethnic Minorities in Post WW2-Europe affected European Integration,"Jones, Benjamin","['Natermann, Diana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis looks at the collective memory of trauma and its affect on European integration. It does so by analysing two migrant groups from the first decade after WW2, ethnic minorities surviving the Holocaust, and displaced German migrants reintegrating into West Germany, and how their experience influenced European integration. I discuss trauma theory, with reference to these two cases, to show its significance in relation to the integration of migrants into European multicultural society, providing further scope for analysis in academia. After a section on global perspectives of migration and multiculturalism, this thesis argues that trauma is a fundamental part of the migrant identity, which influences their integration into their new society. As European multiculturalism began to be rethought in Germany after WW2, trauma and memory of the war was the main cultural similarity between these two cases of migrants and local Germans, which began to reform integration perspective. This perspective of collective trauma and the socio-economic gains migrants brought to the economy would mark these reforms in European integration. This research can offer a niche in the debate on modern day political issues, for example populism and anti-globalisation rhetoric, as European states share different experiences on migrant trauma, and contrasting views on integration as a result of their multicultural perspective.","['Trauma theory', 'post-WW2 migration', 'multiculturalism', 'identity', 'integration', 'collective memory']"

Made in Indonesia: A case study on how Protestant values shape the exercise of corporate social responsibility,"Patiño Gómez, Nuria","['Choi, Nankyung']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The interconnectedness of contemporary world politics and economics has led to an increased movement of labour, capital and ideas. Unfortunately, the movement of labour and capital has accumulated in, what the world-systems theory calls, ‘core countries’, while their waste has been shipped to the feet of the ‘periphery countries’. This is the result of a capitalist economic system that has caused ecological imbalance, uneven accumulation and unlimited extension. According to Max Weber’s hypotheses, the ‘core’ of this system is formed by historically Protestant countries whose values of individualism, hard work, revenue pursuit and frugality facilitated the success of the modern capitalist – spirit embedded in multinational corporations. Increasingly environmentally aware consumers are urging MNCs to take responsibility for the environmental harm that they have caused in countries where their outsourcing partners operate. Nevertheless, numerous MNCs have managed to avoid public scrutiny by implementing CSR strategies on the surface level. Therefore, outsourcing partners are still being affected by the negative externalities of the industry’s production processes. This thesis argues that the protestant ethic which allowed for the success of MNCs is also hindering the advance of corporate social responsibility amongst outsourcing partners in countries such as Indonesia. The protestant ethic characteristic of core capitalist countries perpetuates MNCs privileged position at the expense of the environmental degradation and consequent socio-economic well-being of inhabitants of periphery countries.","['Multinational Corporation', 'Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Protestant Ethic', 'Outsourcing partner', 'Indonesia']"

Can art in Japan enhance environmental sustainability? A bottom-up process-tracing explaining the causal mechanism between a Japanese harmonious human-nature relationship and a sustainable society by means of ecoart,"Cataldi, Dalila","['Shibata, Saori']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The Japanese Government, since the establishment of the Kyoto Protocol, has failed in effectively addressing climate change. Research has shown that the Japanese Government’s failure in combination with its control over the media developed a misleading conception among the Japanese population of its efficacy in implementing environmentally-friendly policies, thus different kinds of communication are needed. This study aims to determine how employing art as a surrogate form of communication might raise awareness on the necessity and urgency of tackling environmental issues in Japan. Building on an alternative conception of the human-nature relationship arising from Zen Buddhist and Shinto values, this study asks: “To what extent can ecological art in Japan promote a message of sustainability that raises awareness and enhances the action of everyday actors?” By means of process-tracing combined with a case study analysis, this study illustrates the causal mechanisms between the Japanese religio-cultural inspired conception of the human-nature relationship, ecoart, and the establishment of a more environmentally friendly society. The case study analyses on the Echigo-Tsumari Art Field (ETAF) initiative showed that, by means of ecoart focused on community, locality and emotions, ETAF represents a viable model for Japan to increase ecoart initiatives and stimulate grassroots efforts towards environmental protection by means of art. Further research is needed on the initiatives engaging with the Japanese public aimed at delivering a message of environmental betterment by means of art and culture, as well as to determine the effects of ecoart in other parts of the world.","['Japan', 'ecoart', 'sustainability', 'satoyama', 'bottom-up', 'nature', 'ETAT', 'Zen Buddhism', 'Shinto']"
Returning home – a blessing or a curse? How Nigerian victims of trafficking are affected by the IOM’s anti-trafficking programs,"ter Steege, Evelien","['Khalid, Mourigh']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"“Human trafficking is an increasingly well-recognized human rights violation that is estimated to involve more than 2 million victims worldwide each year” (Ahn et al. 2018, 283). Nigeria in particular has high numbers of human trafficking victims. After economic fraud and drug trade, human trafficking is known as the biggest crime in Nigeria, which includes both internal and transnational trafficking of human beings (Olagbegi 2006, 11).In order to combat this type of crime, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has set up special anti-trafficking programs which are mostly aimed at providing aid to the victims of human trafficking (VoT’s) by helping them to return home and to reintegrate in society, both socially and economically. However, while the IOM known to be very successful in helping VoT’s to return home, numerous sources show that for many Nigerian victims of trafficking (VoT’s) the suffering continues after they have returned to Nigeria. VoT’s face challenges reintegrating in society which sometimes causes them to become retrafficked. This thesis will examine the anti-trafficking and reintegration programs designed by the IOM and analyze reports and primary sources to investigate the following research question: How do the measures taken against human trafficking by the IOM affect Nigerian victims of trafficking (VoT’s) after they have returned to Nigeria? In order to answer this question, secondary sources such as the academic literature and reports have been analyzed as well as primary sources such as YouTube videos and short personal stories posted on various online platforms. In addition an interview with a member of the IOM’s national migration project management team in Abuja has been conducted to give specific insights. The final conclusion shows that that the measures taken against human trafficking by the IOM may positively but also negatively affect the lives of Nigerian VoT’s after they have returned home. The main problem behind these negative affects seems to be the IOM’s lack of funding which prevents the IOM from properly offering and executing various anti trafficking measures.","['IOM', 'human trafficking', 'Nigeria']"

"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: An Investigation into the Operation of the Ugly Body as a Tool for Moralistic Rhetoric within Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s ‘The Fall of the Rebel Angels’ (1562), ‘Mad Meg’ (c.1562) and ‘The Triumph of Death’ (C.1562)","Myners, Talitha","['Den Hartog, Elizabeth']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,en,"Within Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s artistic output exists three paintings in which ugliness is a common theme; ‘The Fall of the Rebel Angels’ (1562), ‘Mad Meg’ (c.1562) and ‘The Triumph of Death’ (c.1562). Other than their identical dimensions and creation during a similar time period, we know very little about the nature of conception of these works. Occasional suggestions have been that they should be understood as a thematic collection due to such similar formal correspondences. Anna Pawlak’s 2008 study ‘Triologie Der Gottessuche’ has been the first to explore this argument at an iconographic level. Pawlak proposes that the paintings should be understood as a collective unit not only due to their formal similarities, but for their identical exploration of the theme of vice and moral guiding of the viewer towards a more virtuous existence. This thesis will bolster Pawlak’s hypothesis by attesting to the unified operation of the ugly body among the three paintings which enables the moralising rhetoric for which she argues. Such research is necessary considering the lack of historiographical and archival documents which could evidence this hypothesis further. The subject of ugliness is extensive and complex. For this reason, this thesis investigates a specific facet of its theory – the abject body – to enable a more focused inspection of Bruegel’s use of ugliness as a tool for moralistic rhetoric. The existence of two distinct features of the abject; the transgression of the body’s boundaries and categorical confusion of the body, will be examined within each of the three works. It will be revealed that the application of these features amongst a contemporary symbolism towards the subject of sin, creates an overriding message that to sin is to find oneself abjectly ugly. Such a message dissuades the viewer from the moral decay which incites this physical decay into ugliness. Although the painting’s specific narratives vary, this operation of ugliness as a tool for moralistic rhetoric ultimately hinges them together, thus providing an additional evidencing layer to Pawlak’s argument that they should be understood as a unified whole.","['ugliness', 'Bruegel', 'Early Modern period']"

Logic of Collective Action versus Logic of Reciprocity - Unconditional Basic Income as a collective action problem,"Tibosch, Rosa","['Verbeek, Bruno']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"The implementation of an Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) would eradicate poverty, reduce inequality, enhance welfare and help us face automatization. However, one of the main objections is that people will free ride on a UBI, making it morally unacceptable and economically unfeasible. The moral objection holds that it is unfair for anyone to receive a UBI at the expense of others who contribute to it, without being obligated to make some proportional contribution in return or be condemned otherwise. The economic objection holds that a UBI is not feasible, because rational people will stop working or attempt to evade taxes; both of which are needed to finance a UBI. Advocates of a UBI have argued that the number of free riders is expected to be limited, but they have failed to offer a theoretical framework of human behaviour which supports these arguments. The so-called Logic of Reciprocity is such a framework. Therefore, we ask the question in this thesis ‘How can we find a solution to the collective action problem of economic feasibility of a UBI if we follow the Logic of Reciprocity? Does this model of human behaviour allow us to overcome the free rider objection of economic feasibility against a UBI?’. Subsequently, we ask the question ‘Can the moral benefits of a UBI outweigh the violation of the reciprocity principle to mitigate the moral free rider objection?’. We defend the claim that a UBI is economically feasible under high levels of trust. In addition, we defend the claim that this mitigates the weight of the moral free rider objection. In the first chapter, we establish that a UBI faces a collective action problem of economic feasibility; a UBI is a desirable collective good which cannot be achieved through collective action due to the rational free riding behaviour not to work or pay taxes. In the second chapter, we discuss two models of human behaviour to review the underlying assumptions of the collective action problem of economic feasibility. The Logic of Collective Action supports the core assumption that humans behave rationally and will always defect. The alternative Logic of Reciprocity argues that humans are moral and emotional reciprocators who defect or cooperate based on the perceived behaviour of others. We conclude that the Logic of Reciprocity offers a more accurate prediction of human behaviour in collective action. In the third chapter, we apply the Logic of Reciprocity to the collective action problem of economic feasibility of a UBI. We conclude that under high levels of trust, the majority of people will be motivated to be seen as good and cooperative and feel reassured that they will not be taken advantage of. Thus, the majority of people will continue to work and pay taxes upon receiving a UBI, making the implementation of a UBI economically feasible. Subsequently, we argue that, once a UBI is economically feasible, the harm caused by the limited number of free riders is minor compared to the harm caused by free riding behaviour in the absence of a UBI. We conclude that the moral benefits of a UBI outweigh the violation of the reciprocity principle, thus mitigating the moral objection. To achieve and maintain a high level of trust, we recommend a positive narrative, transparency of cooperation levels and limited social incentives targeted clearly at dedicated free riders.","['Universal Basic Income (UBI)', 'Logic of Collective Action', 'Logic of Reciprocity', 'Free rider argument', 'Reciprocity principle', 'Collective action problem', 'Trust']"

The Appointment of the High Representative: A Balancing Exercise at the Highest Level of the EU,"Kleinendorst, Sarah","['Cornelissen, Marije']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis will analyze the appointment of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR) after the Lisbon Treaties of 2009. While this position was established in the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty, the Lisbon Treaties (2009) were highly influential in shaping the HR by providing increased competences and powers to the office. Where it had previously, from 1999 to 2009, only been a vague position to navigate with few official competences, the HR gained increased importance and status in the post-Lisbon European Union (EU). Accordingly, it would make sense to appoint an individual with ample experience in the field of foreign affairs to the office in the first post-Lisbon term. However, the desired HR position fell into the lap of a previous Trade Commissioner from the United Kingdom (UK), Catherine Ashton. In the following tenures, similar procedures occurred with the HR appointment over seemingly arcane criteria. This thesis provides evidence for the argument that the HR can be interpreted as a balancing factor at the EU’s highest table. Of the factors that contribute to the appointment of an individual to a leading position at the EU level, this thesis will argue that the balancing grid at the helm of the EU is the most influential factor in the appointment of the HR.","['High Representative', 'EU', 'CFSP', 'Appointment procedures', 'European Union', 'Ashton', 'Mogherini', 'Borrell']"

The Relationship Between Populism and Liberal Democracy,"Agresti De Philippis, Victor Osvaldo","['Natermann, Diana']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the last 20 years, populism has undoubtedly become a prominent political phenomenon in Europe, manifesting itself in almost every one of its states. Indeed, it has been observed how many populist parties in this region have transitioned from being labelled as “political outsiders”, to becoming among the biggest parties in their respective countries. But why has populism grown so much in such a limited period of time? Among other causes, populism is believed to be a symptom of a malfunctioning of liberal democracy. As modern societies have become increasingly complex and diverse, liberal democratic systems are perceived to be unable to conciliate its two main institutional guarantees, that is, the representation of a popular majority and the protection of minority rights. Populism upholds the representation of the popular will, which, according to populists, has been obscured by an excessive appeasement of different group and minority interests. However, scholars and political theorists have indicated how a populist style of politics can lead to the circumvention of constitutional checks and balances in order to achieve a more efficient representation of the vox populi. This thesis seeks to answer the following question: can populism be considered as beneficial or threatening to liberal democracy? To this end, it will start with an analysis of the nature of populism which will be followed by a theoretical discussion of its potential benefits and threats to liberal democracy. This theory will be put in practice through a case study that compares the Five Star Movement (M5S) in Italy and the National Rally (RN) in France.","['Populism', 'Liberal Democracy', 'Western Europe', 'Political Parties']"

Constituencies in Electoral Design. A Response to and an Extension of The Concept of Constituency by Rehfeld,"Bloks, Suzanne Andrea","['Fossen, Thomas']",2020,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (60 EC),Master thesis,en,"Elections provide the primary mechanism through which representatives are authorized to act. This dissertation asks which conditions the authorization must satisfy in order to have legitimate, properly authorized representatives. In particular, it asks which design of the electoral system – the set of rules concerned with the aggregation of votes – best satisfies minimum conditions for authorizing legitimate representatives. The answer to this question lies at the interface of normative democratic theory and electoral design. It is, furthermore, both a response to and an extension of The Concept of Constituency by Andrew Rehfeld. Rehfeld is the first author to show that electoral design defines and shapes the electoral constituency, that group of people who authorize a representative. The objective electoral constituency – i.e., the group of voters who are eligible to vote for a particular representative – should be distinguished from the subjective electoral constituency – i.e., the group of voters who voted for a particular representative. This dissertation responds to Rehfeld by arguing that the purpose of authorizing legitimate representatives requires electoral design to define objective constituencies not as randomly and permanently assigned groups but rather as a single nation-wide group. This dissertation extends Rehfeld’s work by analyzing how three key components of electoral design – the electoral formula (plurality/majority/proportional), the ballot structure (categorical/ordinal vote) and the district magnitude (number of seats per objective constituency/district) – shape the formation of subjective constituencies that are successful in electing a representative of their choice. The analysis shows that, rather than a U.S.-like system with single-seat plurality/majority districts, the Dutch system of proportional representation with a nation-wide objective constituency is the most justifiable for the purpose of authorizing legitimate representatives.","['Representation', 'Constituency', 'Electoral Design', 'Rehfeld', 'Democracy', 'Proportional Representation', 'Authorization', 'Legitimacy', 'Elections']"

With the help of the theoretical framework of Regional Security Complexes and the Spillover Effect, as well as process tracing methods, two country case studies examine how Gulf engagement, in particular the rivalry between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, further destabilizes an already fragile region: In Somalia, the tensions between core and periphery have been exacerbated as a result of Qatar backing the central government in Mogadishu and the UAE supporting the federal states. In Sudan, the complicated transition process is prolonged as a result of Gulf powers pursuing opposing agendas in the post-Bashir political environment.","['Gulf', 'Horn of Africa', 'UAE', 'Qatar', 'Sudan', 'Somalia', 'Regional Security Complexes', 'geopolitics']"
