WHAT MAKES LIFE LIVABLE? ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF SUICIDAL IDEATION AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE NETHERLANDS,"Behar, Defne",['Ronald Bahamondes-Álvarez'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: In order to tackle the persistent increase in suicide rates, there is a need to adopt a comprehensive, prevention-oriented approach that incorporates environmental factors and social determinants, such as experiences of ethnic discrimination. Methods: This study employed an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, utilizing extreme scores purposeful sampling. Data was collected with questionnaires and FANI. In the quantitative part (n=186), Mann-whitney U was run to compare the ethnic groups for ethnic discrimination (GED), a Spearman’s Rho correlation was run for suicidal ideation (SIDAS) and ethnic discrimination (GED) and a hierarchical regression analysis was run to test GED as a moderator for the relation between interpersonal needs (INQ) and SIDAS. In the qualitative part, four participants with high GED of which two with high and two with low SI were interviewed and thematic analysis was conducted. Results: Middle Eastern North African participants had the highest GED scores. A positive correlation was found between GED and SIDAS. GED was found to moderate the relation between INQ and SIDAS, in which INQ became insignificant after the addition of the interaction. Consequences of ethnic Discrimination that relate to SI, like pessimistic change in perception of the world, lower personal and collective self-esteem, and loneliness were identified. Factors such as social support, racial affirmation and perceived help were found to alleviate the psychological consequences of ethnic discrimination. Conclusion: Both quantitative and qualitative measures found ethnic discrimination to be a social determinant of SI that poses a risk for the university students in the Netherlands.","['Social Determinants, Ethnic Discrimination, Racial Discrimination, Suicidal Ideation, Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, Mixed-Methods']"
Does format matter? How different approaches to communicating epistemic uncertainty affect understanding of numerical uncertainty intervals.,"Zrimšek Žiger, Neja","['Willems, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Epistemic uncertainty refers to the doubts surrounding numerical information about past or current events. Communicators may present this information in various formats, with the numerical and visual offering more precision than the verbal. However, previous research has established that even numerical and visual presentations of uncertainty differently influence individuals' understanding, with the former encouraging them to interpret the ranges of possible values in a binary way (i.e., seeing those within a numerical interval that conveys uncertainty around a best estimate as highly possible and those outside as nearly impossible). Conversely, visual displays (e.g., violin plots) promote more graded interpretations. Different magnitudes of uncertainty and differences in numerical abilities may further affect individuals' understanding. Accordingly, we examined the differences in interpreting uncertainty ranges by varying the format of presentation and the magnitude of uncertainty. We also assessed individuals' subjective indications of their own numerical abilities. Our findings suggest that visually, rather than numerically, presented uncertainty ranges encourage binary interpretation. This effect appears less pronounced in conditions with low uncertainty and is not affected by individuals' subjective beliefs about their numerical abilities. These results directly contradict previous findings, where numerically presented ranges are the ones that promote a binary understanding. The unexpected scores on our outcome variable and the underpowered nature of some analyses make it difficult to draw strong conclusions, which warrants further research.","['epistemic uncertainty', 'uncertainty interval', 'violin plot', 'subjective numeracy']"

Blaming Yourself: Biased Expectations Regarding Unexpected Peer Feedback in Social Anxiety,"Patavou, Evangelia Nefeli","['Molen, M.J.W. van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research evidence on social anxiety (SA) argues that repetitive negative social interactions over time contribute to an increased fear and expectancy of negative evaluations. However, current research gaps remain regarding the specific factors that may impact the expectancy of negative evaluations in SA. More specifically, age and maladaptive emotional regulation strategies, such as self-blame have yet to be explored as moderators of the relationship between SA and negative expectations of performance. The present study aimed to examine factors contributing to the pessimism bias observed in SA individuals in a probabilistic learning task with a total of 255 male and female participants aged 12 to 29 years. The learning task examined whether participants would learn from the exposure to negative or positive feedback and showcase an increase in their negative or positive expectations respectively. Participants completed a personality questionnaire from which we created a social profile for them. They were shown a set of same-gender peers’ profiles and were asked to indicate the profiles they liked the most to derive their top four. Participants were told their top four choices had also rated their profiles. During the learning task, they were asked to indicate whether they expected to be liked or disliked based on each statement on their profile for each peer specifically. Immediately after each statement rating, they were shown the peers’ actual feedback. The task was set on specific probabilities of giving positive, negative, or neutral feedback to the participants. Participants’ age, self-reported SA levels, and self-blame tendencies were examined as potential contributing factors to increased negative feedback expectancy. Results showed that participants with higher reports of SA illustrated higher negative feedback expectancies across all trials. Overall, across all participants, negative feedback expectancies increased significantly in trials with the most negative peer compared to trials with the most positive peer. Similarly, across all participants, positive feedback expectancies decreased significantly in trials with the most negative peer compared to the most positive peer. Furthermore, adult participants reported higher levels of SA. Results showed that increased SA was a significant predictor of increased self-blame tendencies. Interestingly, self-blame was found to be a significant moderating variable in the relationship between SA and negative feedback expectancies across all trials. These results may be considered promising evidence for alternate future research directions and treatment interventions for the pessimism bias observed in SA individuals.","['social anxiety, social feedback expectancy, learning task, self-blame, age']"
Militant Democracy Revisited: Why the Theory of Militant Democracy is Liberal,"Bosman, Jamie","['Belic, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Liberal democracies are under immense pressure. Apart from threatening exterior forces, it seems that interior forces are rising and increasingly threatening democracy from inside out. Public officials are receiving more threats than ever and even parliaments are attacked. Within public and academic debate, the question rises how to react. Scholars are referring and reacting to the theory of ‘militant democracy’, a democracy which allows for suspension of political rights, albeit under certain conditions. Specifically, this thesis focuses on the self-limiting theory of militant democracy by Kirshner (2014) as one of the most prominent recent academic accounts to the theory of militant democracy. What makes the theory notable, is that his work aims to offer a framework for liberal democracies on when and how to react to so-called ‘antidemocrats’. This thesis provides for a concrete definition of the term antidemocrat, links the three principles of Kirshner’s self-limiting theory of militant democracy with basic liberal principles, critically evaluates each of the principles and, where needed, expands or adjusts them, and expands the theory by adding a fourth principle.","['liberal democracy', 'militant democracy', 'antidemocrat', 'political rights', 'political equality', 'freedom']"

"Negative Expectancies, but not Stress, are Predictive of Cowhage-induced Itch Ratings and Urge to Scratch in a Healthy Population","Gnauck, Josephine","['Wolters, F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Background: Itch and scratching are distressing symptoms in diverse diseases. Both negative expectancies and stress have been shown to increase symptom severity. However, especially the role of stress remains unclear as it has mostly been tested in pain studies. Methods: To investigate whether the effect of stress on itch is mediated by negative expectancies; cowhage, verbal suggestions and a video fragment were used to induce itch in a within-subjects design of 11 healthy participants. Itch, scratching and negative expectancies were measured on a scale from 0 to 10. Stress was assessed by the DASS-21 questionnaire. Results: Using mediation analysis, results suggested that stress was not predictive of itch symptoms at all, even when taking into account negative expectancies. Nonetheless, negative expectancies on their own were related to itch and scratching. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that negative expectancies should be treated as a key aspect in psychological treatment targeting chronic pruritus, such as rational-emotive therapy (RET). However, future research should still investigate stress in relation to itch, as the current study did not assess the impact of severe stress levels and experimentally-induced stress.","['Cowhage', 'Itch', 'Negative expectancies', 'Urge to scratch', 'Stress']"

‘To Condemn or Not to Condemn: Comparing the Responses of the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation to the Rohingya and Uyghur Genocides’,"Deasy, Gabriel","['Meegdenburg, H. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The norm against genocide is at least as old as the term itself (Lemkin 1944). Yet for all the rhetoric and resolutions, genocide persists, often with impunity, and even without condemnation. This study focuses explicitly on why some genocides elicit more international condemnation than others. Specifically, it analyses the reactions of the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation [OIC] to the ongoing genocides of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar and the Uyghur minority in China. While the OIC has unconditionally condemned the former, it has been silent concerning the latter. Exploring this discrepancy, I qualifiedly endorse the realist/rational choice explanation: where the costs of condemnation are high, states and organisations are less inclined to act on the norm against genocide. However, as the case of Turkey and its support for the Uyghurs suggests, this is not a complete explanation. Thus, I contend that the identity-motivation of ethnic solidarity represents a stronger, more robust counterweight to the realist pressures of economics and security, thus increasing the likelihood of condemnation.","['genocide, condemnation, umma, Uyghurs, Rohingya, ethnicity, identity']"

Does Parental Trait Social Anxiety Moderate Parent-to-Child Transmission of (Stranger) Anxiety via Verbal Information?,"Müller-Langhardt, Elise","['Aktar, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study investigated the transmission of social anxiety from parent to child via verbal information about strangers. Based on previous research findings demonstrating verbal fear learning from parent to child, which often resulted in avoidance behavior in the children, this study tested verbal fear learning in a social performance task with a stranger. Further, it was investigated whether parental social anxiety would moderate child´s avoidance towards the stranger. The current study included a community sample of 71 adolescents aged eleven- to fourteen. The children were accompanied by their primary caregiver to the lab, where the caregiver gave the manipulation by providing either safety or threat messages about two strangers. Multiple questionnaires were filled in by the parents and child, along with several measurements taken during the study, of which this thesis focused on the child´s avoidance behavior during the social performance task. Results indicate no significant differences in avoidance behavior between the safety or threat messages and no moderation effect of parental SAD. It was demonstrated that children of socially anxious parents were overall significantly more avoidant towards the strangers. Even though no support for a parent-to-child transmission of stranger anxiety in this sample was found, the findings contribute to the growing evidence that parental SAD does translate into behavioral avoidance in their children. Future research should try to find reliable measures of avoidance behavior, research a clinical sample and investigate this intergenerational transmission in a longitudinal or observational design.","['Social Anxiety Disorder, verbal fear learning, intergenerational transmission']"
The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine: A critical juncture for EU policy on disinformation online?,"Freiherr von Hodenberg, Jacob","['van Meegdenburg, H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"External events can significantly impact policymaking. This paper explores European Union policymaking processes surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine to understand better the influence of such historic external moments in the EU context. More concretely the paper establishes whether the first year following the outbreak of the war created a critical juncture for EU policymaking on disinformation online. Furthermore, it analyses based on the findings, in more detail, either the impact of this critical juncture or the pathdependence on the EU’s policymaking processes in this policy area. Employing the concepts of critical juncture and path-dependence and by triangulating EU documents and interviews with EU policymakers, the findings suggest that no critical juncture occurred. Instead, this paper goes on to analyse “strategies and choices of political leaders” and “decision-making processes” in the EU and establishes how the policymaking processes following the outbreak of the invasion are best characterised by an activity shift from Covid-19 to the war. Moreover, the analysis indicates that EU policymaking processes continue to follow a path-dependence that has been created progressively since the establishment of EU policy on disinformation online, after the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014.","['Critical Juncture, Path-Dependence, Policymaking Processes, Disinformation Online, European Union']"
The Challenged Authenticity of a seemingly Idyllic Island: Understanding Dutch Immigration on Bonaire through the Lens of Sound,"Meijer, Mandy","['Hölsgens, S']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Bonaire became part of the Netherlands as a special municipality on the 10th of October 2010. Since this institutional change, Bonaire has experienced an influx of Dutch immigrants, leading to significant transformations on the island which has sparked debates about the loss of Bonairian authenticity. This thesis explores these cultural differences through the concept of acoustemology, as proposed by Steven Feld. The perception of noise and sound is culturally dependent. This division between noise and sound contains a hierarchy of sounds, that is parallel to the hierarchy in the dominant meaning-making process that comes from a European Dutch hegemony on the island. What is considered noise on Bonaire is shaped through a Western lens. This implies that immigrants who relocate to Bonaire unknowingly bring their cultural perspectives on noise and sound with them. However, they do this unknowingly, which is the result of what Gloria Wekker calls white innocence. Drawing on two months of fieldwork, this research explains these connections through the lived experiences of several Bonairian Locals. Their realities from the base of the practice of soundscaping that is used to illustrate how perspectives on sound may differ between cultures. These soundscapes were placed on a map to contextualise Bonaire as an interconnected space. The research adopts a multimodal approach in another way, featuring an ethnographic film that highlights the issues faced by local participants and explores the evolving relationship between them and the European Dutch researcher, employing visual ethnographic methods. The study employs self-reflexivity to analyse this dynamic. The argument made is that an understanding of the local Bonairian lived experience can be obtained through the lens of analysing sound and this understanding is essential in the building of relationships between Bonairian locals and Dutch immigrants.","['Anthropology', 'Ethnography', 'Visual Ethnography', 'Film', 'Documentary', 'Soundscapes', 'Sound', 'Caribbean', 'Bonaire']"

The Digital Panopticon: Examining the Impact of Digital Surveillance on Public Protest in Authoritarian Regimes,"Gillert, Wojciech",['Dr. Babak RezaeeDaryakenari'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In a world where authoritarian regimes have become increasingly pervasive, digital surveillance has become a primary tool for maintaining control over citizens. Despite the public's awareness of digital surveillance and its potential to limit freedom of expression and assembly, citizens of authoritarian regimes continue to organize and participate in public demonstrations in order to express their grievances. This paper therefore examines the extent to which digital surveillance influences citizens’ participation in public protests in authoritarian regimes, and how citizens cope with the limits imposed by such technologies. Combining existing scholarship with an examination of the case of China and the development of its ‘Golden Shield’, this study contends that digital surveillance succeeds in reducing public participation in demonstrations through creating a ‘chilling effect’ and causing widespread fear of physical retribution. It finds that citizens make use of a variety of strategies to mitigate the risk of digital surveillance through employing creative methods of censorship circumvention and evasion, although the longevity of such methods remains unclear. Process tracing is used to evaluate the key causal mechanisms associated with the developed “Digital Panopticon” theory. The paper concludes by discussing the wider socio-political implications of the findings.","['surveillance', 'authoritarianism', 'China']"
The Unforeseeable? Assessing the Relevance of Explanatory Factors in Forecasting Terrorist Threats,"von Lampe, Bjarne","['RezaeeDaryakenari, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Can terrorist threats be forecasted in a systematic way? Which variables help to do so in the most accurate way? The present study examines the relative importance of features when building forecasting models on terrorist threats. To do so, it draws on both academic literature and publications by counterterrorist practitioners. This study addresses three key gaps in existing research. Specifically, it allows for comparing the utility of different theoretical models to each other, it puts an explicit focus on machine learning-based forecasting with out-of-sample performance metrics, and it explicitly aims to incorporate knowledge from the practitioner sector, which is understandably less open about their work than the academic community but has still produced several insightful publications on the topic of forecasting terrorist threats. The outcomes of the analysis do not confirm the expectation that variables of interest to both academics and practitioners would have the highest predictive power. Rather, it is the population of a country that scores highest, followed by GDP, data on weapon flows into the country, and religious fragmentation in models with no features based on lagged versions of the outcome variable. In models including such variables, the lag of the terrorist attack occurrence consistently scores second highest, and these models consistently out-perform their counterparts missing these variables. The results obtained in this paper are arguably of most use to academic research, in that they add onto a so far relatively limited body of work on out-of-sample forecasting and provide insight into the relative predictive power of existing theoretical models. Practitioners may be more interested in the methodological approach taken in this piece, which can be of use to them when evaluating the priority list of warning indicators to take into consideration when assessing the severity of terrorist threats.","['Terrorism', 'Terrorism studies', 'Forecasting', 'Out-of-sample forecast', 'Relative feature importance']"

Take the stage! The management and self-presentation of chronically ill patients with inflammatory Bowel Disease and the bootstrap of social awareness,"Verzaal, Matthijs","['Luning, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explores the communication and behaviour of people with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) in social situations. Drawing mainly from three narratives spreading from first on-set to long-term living with IBD and a mother whose son has IBD. Furthermore I will also use vignettes from my own IBD-life. Through these narratives this thesis will follow how medical symptoms are unwillingly transposed into social situations, through which people with IBD become aware of how they should present themselves as healthy, while being sick, to prevent stigma and taboos. Also how social expectations of how an illness looks, makes people with IBD aware they do not have any physical traits, yet paradoxical feel the need to perform sick. The focus thereby lies on the behaviour and thoughts of people with IBD. By using Goffman’s (1990[1959]) dramaturgical approach as an analytic tool to dismantle social situations and communication, this thesis reveals the loyalty and continuity of the performances to a healthy self-presentation, juxtaposed by the search for a mental or physical back stages where they can be loyal to their illness experiences. I suggest that through these performances of healthy and sick self, people with IBD develop a deep awareness of social expectations that are put on them by others and themselves. Through which people with IBD become entangled in a bootstrap of social awareness.","['Dramaturgical Approach, IBD, Patient experiences, medical Anthropology']"

Adviesrapport Ouderbetrokkenheid in het Basisonderwijs,"Boer, Helena","['Vos, H.M.W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Ouderbetrokkenheid is van cruciaal belang voor de academische prestaties van leerlingen, zoals blijkt uit talrijke studies. Toch bestaan er nog onduidelijkheden over de definitie en waardering van ouderbetrokkenheid door ouders/verzorgers en leerkrachten, evenals over de meest effectieve strategieën om deze betrokkenheid te verbeteren. Dit onderzoek verkende ouderbetrokkenheid in het basisonderwijs, specifiek in de groepen 6, 7 en 8, en beoogde praktijkgericht advies te geven aan OOK Pedagogische Expertise Groep over manieren om ouderbetrokkenheid te bevorderen. Het perspectief van ouders/verzorgers en leerkrachten op ouderbetrokkenheid stond centraal in dit onderzoek. Epstein's 'Framework of Six Types of Involvement' fungeerde als het theoretisch raamwerk, waarbij de focus lag op de domeinen communication, learning at home en parenting. De hoofdvraag van het onderzoek luidde: ‘Wat verstaan ouders en leerkrachten onder ouderbetrokkenheid richting school?'. De deelvragen onderzochten wat leerkrachten en ouders/verzorgers het belangrijkste domein van ouderbetrokkenheid vinden, de mate van overeenstemming tussen de opvattingen van beide groepen, en de variatie in opvattingen tussen ouders/verzorgers van verschillende klassenjaren. Voor dit onderzoek is een kwantitatieve enquêtemethode gebruikt. Online vragenlijsten zijn verspreid onder 117 Nederlandse respondenten (59 leerkrachten en 58 ouders/verzorgers) van leerlingen in groep 6, 7, of 8 uit Noord- en Zuid-Holland. De vragenlijsten waren gericht op de perceptie van ouderbetrokkenheid binnen de context van Epstein's domeinen. De resultaten toonden aan dat ouders/verzorgers en leerkrachten dezelfde perceptie hebben over het brede construct ouderbetrokkenheid. Zo was voor leerkrachten en ouders/verzorgers het domein communication het belangrijkst, gevolgd door parenting en vervolgens learning at home. Daarentegen was er enige variatie in de percepties van beide groepen tussen de drie domeinen. Zo was er tussen de domeinen parenting en learning at home voor leerkrachten geen significant verschil, terwijl bij ouders/verzorgers deze domeinen wel significant van elkaar verschilde. Dit benadrukt de complexiteit van de percepties rond ouderbetrokkenheid. Tot slot zijn er geen significante verschillen gevonden over het concept ouderbetrokkenheid als over de drie domeinen tussen de ouders/verzorgers van verschillende klassenjaren. De bevindingen bieden aanknopingspunten voor de praktijk, waaronder de ontwikkeling van strategieën om de communicatie tussen de school en de ouder(s)/verzorger(s) te verbeteren en learning at home en parenting te stimuleren. Het streven van deze aanbevelingen is het verbeteren van de samenwerking tussen ouders/verzorgers en leerkrachten, wat naar verwachting zal resulteren in hogere ouderbetrokkenheid. De maatschappelijke waarde van deze studie ligt in het bijdragen aan kennis over ouderbetrokkenheid. De adviezen naar aanleiding van dit onderzoek kunnen door OOK Pedagogische Expertise Groep worden gebruikt om interventies te ontwikkelen en ouderbetrokkenheid in het onderwijs te bevorderen.","['Ouderbetrokkenheid', 'Epstein', 'rolverdeling ouder en leerkracht', 'leerkracht', 'ouder']"

"Spelend Leren, Maar Eerst Leren Spelen: Het Bevorderen van Zelfstandig Speelgedrag op Kinderopvang SkippyPepijn","Haven, Laura van der","['Vliet, M.S. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Veel pedagogisch medewerkers op de kinderopvang ervaren een hoge werkdruk. De pedagogisch medewerkers bij SkippyPepijn voelen deze hoge werkdruk ook, mede doordat veel kinderen zelfstandig spelen lastig vinden waardoor de pedagogisch medewerkers (veel) tijd kwijt zijn aan het begeleiden van het spel van de kinderen (Riksen-Walraven, 2000). Verondersteld wordt dat de werkdruk van de pedagogisch in enige mate af zal nemen als kinderen zelfstandig kunnen spelen, omdat kinderen dan niet langer de hulp van de pedagogisch medewerkers nodig hebben om bezig te blijven. Zelfstandig spelen kan bevorderd worden met behulp van handvatten die in de literatuur beschreven staan om zo SkippyPepijn advies te geven over de mate waarin pedagogisch medewerkers gebruikmaken van handvatten om zelfstandig spel van kinderen te bevorderen. Het advies zal zich met name richten op aspecten waar ruimte voor verbetering mogelijk is. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: “In welke mate worden de (evidence-based) handvatten die uit de literatuur volgen toegepast door de pedagogisch medewerkers van SkippyPepijn met als doel het zelfstandig spelen van kinderen tussen de 0 en 4 jaar te bevorderen?” Uit het literatuuronderzoek naar (evidence-based) handvatten om het zelfstandig spel te stimuleren zijn drie handvatten gevormd: “Veiligheid en Omgeving” (waarbij de nadruk ligt op hoe een veilige ruimte met gepast speelgoed het zelfstandig spelen kan bevorderen), “Mate van Spelparticipatie door Pedagogisch Medewerkers” (waarbij de nadruk ligt op hoe medewerkers hun eigen gedrag tijdens speelmomenten kunnen aanpassen op de behoeften van de kinderen) en “Kwalitatief Spel” (waarbij de nadruk ligt op ontwikkelingsbevorderende spelactiviteiten). Bij het beantwoorden van de onderzoeksvraag is geanalyseerd in hoeverre pedagogisch medewerkers moeite ervaren met het aanleren van zelfstandig spelen. Verder zijn verschillen in ervaringen van het aanleren van zelfstandig spelen voor en na de coronaperiode onderzocht. Het is namelijk mogelijk dat de coronaperiode invloed heeft gehad op de mate waarin kinderen zelfstandig kunnen spelen, omdat kinderen in de coronaperiode een lange tijd thuis verbleven vanwege gesloten kinderopvangcentra. Daarnaast waren ouders vaker thuis. Bovendien is getoetst of het gebruiken van de handvatten om zelfstandig spel te bevorderen samenhangt met de hoeveelheid werkervaring van de pedagogisch medewerkers. De onderzoeksvraag en deelvragen zijn beantwoord door middel van een literatuuronderzoek en een vragenlijst, ingevuld door pedagogisch medewerkers van SkippyPepijn. Uit de vragenlijst is gebleken dat pedagogisch medewerkers vinden vanuit SkippyPepijn onvoldoende duidelijke richtlijnen te krijgen rondom het aanleren van zelfstandig spelen. De pedagogisch medewerkers geven wisselende antwoorden als het gaat om het ervaren van verschillen tussen het zelfstandig leren spelen voor en na de coronaperiode. Uit de antwoorden op de vragenlijst volgt bovendien dat de pedagogisch medewerkers van SkippyPepijn het minst gebruik maken van handvatten gericht op “Spelparticipatie”, iets meer gebruik maken van handvatten omtrent “Veiligheid en Omgeving” en het meest gebruik maken van “Kwalitatief Spel” om zelfstandig spelen te bevorderen. Er werd geen verschil gevonden voor het toepassen van de handvatten om zelfstandig spel te bevorderen tussen medewerkers met weinig en medewerkers met veel werkervaring. Op basis van de onderzoeksresultaten wordt SkippyPepijn aanbevolen om meer aandacht te besteden aan gepaste participatie tijdens het spel om zelfstandig spelen van kinderen te bevorderen, zoals het spel aanpassen aan de ontwikkelingsbehoefte van een kind, het kind initiatief laten nemen en het speldoel achterhalen en eventueel uitbreiden. De pedagogisch medewerkers passen reeds handvatten toe omtrent het bieden van een veilige ruimte met gepast speelgoed voor de kinderen om het zelfstandig spelen te bevorderen. Op dit gebied valt echter nog enige verbetering te boeken. Met de verbetering van dit construct is de verwachting dat zelfstandig leren spelen bij SkippyPepijn optimaal kan worden bevorderd.","['zelfstandig spelen', 'kinderopvang', 'spelparticipatie', 'veiligheid en omgeving', 'kwalitatief spel']"

Deze voorwaarden omvatten kennis van pedagogisch medewerkers over genderneutrale opvoeding, ondersteuning vanuit de organisatie, ouderbetrokkenheid bij het thema genderneutrale opvoeding op het kinderdagverblijf en de beschikbaarheid van geschikte materialen zoals boekjes en speelgoed. Uit de focusgroepen volgde dat pedagogisch medewerkers de voorwaarden kennis over het onderwerp, de beleving van belang, ouderbetrokkenheid en materialen belangrijk vinden bij het faciliteren van genderneutrale opvoeding op het kinderdagverblijf. In het literatuuronderzoek kwam naar voren dat bepaalde vaardigheden van pedagogisch medewerkers bevorderend kunnen zijn voor genderneutraal opvoeden. Hieronder valt kritisch denken, waarbij pedagogisch medewerkers de heersende genderstereotypen bevragen. Daarnaast is de vaardigheid om een veilige en inclusieve omgeving te creëren voor de kinderen van belang. Daarbij zorgt het bezit van interactievaardigheden, communicatievaardigheden en adequaat taalgebruik ervoor dat deze omgeving ook op verbaal vlak gerealiseerd kan worden. Uit de focusgroepen bleek dat pedagogisch medewerkers de vaardigheden taalgebruik, het hebben van een open houding en het inzetten van pedagogische vaardigheden als essentieel beschouwen bij de implementatie van genderneutrale opvoeding. Op basis van de resultaten zijn verschillende adviezen geformuleerd aan Kibeo Kinderopvang op gebied van kennis, draagvlak creëren en pedagogische vaardigheden. Ten eerste is het belangrijk dat pedagogisch medewerkers beschikken over genoeg kennis over genderontwikkeling en over de definitie van genderneutrale opvoeding. Dit kan de juiste implementatie van de genderneutrale opvoeding bevorderen. Ten tweede is het van belang om draagvlak te creëren onder pedagogisch medewerkers. Weerstand kan worden weggenomen door het onderwerp op een positieve manier te bespreken en te benaderen tijdens overleg met collega’s of met de leidinggevende. Daarnaast werd geadviseerd dat Kibeo het thema genderneutraal opvoeden op de kinderdagverblijven meer zou kunnen laten leven door een meer inclusieve omgeving te creëren. Verder werd geadviseerd om het kritisch denkvermogen van pedagogisch medewerkers te bevorderen door mensen bewust te maken van hun eigen vooroordelen en bestaande stereotypen zodat zij hier minder snel in meegaan. Ouderbetrokkenheid kan worden gestimuleerd door ouders te informeren en voor te lichten over onder andere de definities die Kibeo hanteert over genderneutrale opvoeding. Ten derde werd geadviseerd om de pedagogische vaardigheden op het gebied van genderneutraal opvoeden van de pedagogisch medewerkers te versterken. Dit kan gerealiseerd worden door trainingen gericht op het minimaliseren van genderstereotiepe uitspraken en het omgaan met negatieve reacties van ouders. Ons onderzoek kent een aantal sterke en zwakke punten. Een sterk punt is de waarborging van de trustworthiness, door het inzetten van triangulatie tijdens het analyseren van de resultaten. Een minder sterk punt is het lage aantal deelnemers tijdens de focusgroepen, waarbij de zes deelnemers over het algemeen een positieve houding hadden tegenover genderneutraal opvoeden. Daardoor is het onwaarschijnlijk dat alle verschillende meningen in kaart zijn gebracht.","['Genderneutrale opvoeding', 'genderneutraliteit', 'gendergelijkheid', 'genderstereotypen', 'kwalitatief onderzoek', 'focusgroepen', 'kinderopvang', 'kinderdagverblijf', 'kinderdagopvang', 'secundaire opvoeders']"

The Narcissist in the Presence of Something Vast: The Moderating Effect of Awe on the Relationship Between Narcissism and Self-Esteem.,"Huizer, Marit","['Akyüz, R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Although narcissism and self-esteem are heavily studied topics in the field of personality and social psychology, their association with awe has largely gone unexplored. This study investigated the relationship between the constructs, whereby integration of their respective fields additionally holds the potential to benefit the understanding of socially, morally and ethically aversive traits. Research on the most studied aforesaid traits are indexed by the “Dark Triad” of personality; narcissism, Machiavellianism, and subclinical psychopathy. The moderating effect of awe is explored to whether it affects the positive effect of narcissism on self-esteem. Narcissism was expected to be positively correlated with self-esteem, and awe to be negatively correlated with narcissism. Moreover, awe was expected to negatively moderate the positive effect of narcissism on self-esteem. Respondents included in the analysis were all university students in the Netherlands and between the ages of 18 and 30 years old (n = 206). The data was collected through an online test battery, using validated questionnaires on self-reported experiences with awe (Dispositional Positive Emotions Scale ([DPES]) the Dark Triad traits (Short Dark Triad [SD3]) and the level of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [RSES]). Through conducting simple linear regression analysis and multiple linear regression analysis with IBM SPSS Statistics, results found narcissism to be positively correlated with self-esteem and narcissism to be weakly correlated with awe. Nevertheless, insignificant results were found regarding the mediator and interaction variable of the interaction effect.","['narcissism, dark triad, self-esteem, awe, personality psychology']"

Hiervoor hebben leerkrachten van groep 3 tot en met 8 van drie verschillende basisscholen een vragenlijst ingevuld (N=18). De vragenlijst bestond uit drie schalen, kennis, houding en gedrag, met 14-16 vragen per schaal. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de houding van leerkrachten tegenover rekendifferentiatie het meest positief was. Ook is gevonden dat kennis een significante, positieve voorspeller voor gedrag is. Verder verschillen kennis, houding en gedrag binnen een differentiatiemethode. Opvallend is dat coöperatieve werkvormen, preteaching en het geven van mogelijkheden tot keuzes het minst hoog scoren op de schalen houding en gedrag. Ook is de correlatie tussen het aantal jaar dat een leerkracht voor de klas staat en hun gedrag tegenover rekendifferentiatie onderzocht. Daaruit kwam naar voren dat dit niet significant is. Verder kwam uit dit onderzoek dat er geen significante correlatie bestaat tussen de leeftijd van leerkrachten en hun houding. Vanwege een kleine steekproef kunnen er minder significante resultaten zijn gevonden dan er daadwerkelijk zijn en kunnen de conclusies niet direct vertaald worden naar de populatie leerkrachten in Nederland. Vervolgonderzoek is noodzakelijk om te kijken naar de implementatie van de resultaten van deze studie.","['rekenen', 'differentiatie', 'differentiatiemethoden', 'kennis', 'houding', 'gedrag']"
Israel’s Response to Accusations of Human Rights Violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories,"Heijden, Manon van der","['Macaj, G.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis examines how states try to evade accountability through denying accusations of human rights violations. It aims to fill the gap in the existing literature by analysing which stigma rejection strategies are most applied by states, and how successful these strategies are for evading accountability. This research project consists of an in-depth discourse analysis of the case of Israel and their response to human rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territories. It does so according to a threefold analysis focussed on identifying (1) the accusations towards Israel, (2) Israel’s response to those accusations and (3) the outcome of that response. The analysis shows a consistent engagement of Israel with various forms of denial, which indicates that they do not have a clear preference on which stigma rejection strategies to adopt. The outcome of Israel’s response is unsuccessful in the sense that Israel does not manage to change the narrative of other states and persuade them of their innocence. The use of stigma rejection strategies can thus not be seen as a leading or direct cause for evading accountability.","['human rights violations', 'denial', 'Israel', 'accountability']"
“She is just not that into you”: An investigation into the relationship between sexual overperception bias and self-rated attractiveness as mediated by attachment style.,"Vumilia, Noella","['Samara, I.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Sexual overperception bias is a cognitive bias that is more common in men than women. This bias refers to the tendency of men to misinterpret polite gestures from women as sexual interest. This phenomenon has been replicated in numerous studies, often using speed-dating paradigms to investigate the underlying factors of sexual overperception. In this thesis, I investigated whether attachment style mediates the relationship between sexual overperception bias and self-rated attractiveness. With a sample size consisting of thirty-nine participants (13 men and 26 women), we examined this relationship through video interactions of our participants with actors, during which the participants rated the actors on attractiveness as well as how the actors perceived them. Additionally, we employed surveys to measure self-rated attractiveness and attachment style. The results showed that self-rated attractiveness did not predict sexual overperception bias. Furthermore, I found no significant relationship between self-rated attractiveness and attachment style. These findings contrast with previous findings showing that self-rated attractiveness predicted sexual overperception bias, as well as findings suggesting that attachment anxiety is associated with self-rated attractiveness. One of the potential explanations for my findings relates to the much lower sample size (N = 13) compared to previous research. In this thesis, I discuss my findings in more detail and provide suggestions for future research.","['Sexual overperception bias', 'self-rated attractiveness', 'attachment style', 'mating styles.']"

Empirisch onderzoek van jonge kinderen naar een verrassende bewering: Een Multiverse Analyse,"Smakman, Thomas",['Tom Heyman'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Kinderen hebben verschillende manieren om nieuwe dingen te leren: ze kunnen iets zelf onderzoeken, maar ze kunnen ook de informatie van iemand of iets krijgen, zoals een ouder, docent of boek. Als de informatie komt van een ander of bijvoorbeeld een boek vergt dit wel het vertrouwen dat deze informatie klopt. Wanneer een kind in een boek iets leest over een land ver weg hebben ze geen manier om dit te checken. Ronfard et al. (2021) onderzocht hoe kinderen reageren als ze dit wel kunnen checken. Hierbij vonden ze dat kinderen meer geneigd zijn het feit te onderzoeken als het tegen hun intuïtie ingaat dan wanneer het heel logisch klinkt. Daarnaast hebben ze ook gevonden dat oudere kinderen sneller op onderzoek uitgaan. Omdat dit specifieke idee niet eerder is getest, is het doel van deze multiverse om te onderzoeken of kinderen meer op onderzoek uitgaan als ze iets horen dat tegen hun intuïtie ingaat. In deze multiverse is gevonden dat de bevindingen robuust zijn voor controle op opleidingsniveau van de ouders en voor een alternatieve berekening van deze variabele. De bevindingen waren niet robuust voor het controleren op de autoritaire waarden van de ouders, het gebruiken van leeftijd in plaats van leeftijdsgroep in de analyse, de exclusie van een kleine groep participanten waar het onderzoek niet goed liep en verschillende tests om hetzelfde effect te meten. De resultaten van de multiverse suggereren dat kinderen wel meer geneigd zijn om op onderzoek uit te gaan als ze iets horen dat tegen hun intuïtie ingaat, maar dat er geen sprake is van een interactie-effect met leeftijd hiervan.","['multiverse', 'multiverse analyse', 'psychologie', 'ontwikkeling']"
The ‘Tianxia’ formula for multilateral regime contestation: How China plans to subvert the UN Human Rights Council,"Pekonen, Otso",['Dr. Rutger Hagen'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"As the liberal international order recedes, China has emerged as the principal challenger of global governance institutions that promote human rights. While China used to act as an ostensible norm taker in the sphere of human rights, it is increasingly asserting its own authoritarian human rights norms ‘with Chinese characteristics’ on the global stage. Using Chinese ‘tianxia’ theory and realism, this thesis endeavours to uncover how China is working to subvert international human rights governance with a case study of the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC); the preeminent global forum for safeguarding human rights. A discourse analysis of China’s ‘counter- institutionalisation’ of the HRC, reveals a strategic effort to block criticism, prevent independent monitoring, and change established conceptions about the very meaning of human rights. The robustness of the HRC’s mandate thus appears to be under growing duress. How other states respond to China’s affront may determine the direction of global human rights governance for decades to come.","['China', 'United Nations', 'human rights', 'counter-institutionalisation', 'tianxia theory']"

The study has a 2 (Caucasian Dutch CV vs. Moroccan Dutch CV) x 3 (domain-specific moral condition, domain non-specific condition, control condition) between-subjects design, and participants (N=187) were randomly assigned to a condition. Hypotheses predicted the highest hireability for Moroccan Dutch applicants in the control condition (H1a) followed by the domain non-specific condition (H1b), but no significant moral licensing effects were found for the hiring decision regarding the Moroccan Dutch applicants. Furthermore, hypotheses predicted a higher hireability for the Caucasian Dutch applicant in the moral condition (H2a) with the highest hireability in the domain-specific condition (H2b). Surprisingly, participants were more likely to hire a Caucasian Dutch applicant in the domain non-specific condition. Moreover, no significant differences were found in hireability between the two ethnicities (H3). These results showed that identification with the company and the attractiveness of the applicant could influence the moral licensing effect and gain a more comprehensive understanding of recruiters’ hiring decisions.",

Specifically, the effects brought to attention are employment, wealth, and public finances. Existing literature predominantly focusses on the impact of migration in general on destination economies and differ in opinion as to whether the relationship is positive or negative. Some literature already deepens the investigation into that relationship by including the aspect of immigrant integration policy, to which this thesis contributes by doing a quantitative data analysis. The impact of integration policies is assessed using three different models. The first model is a one-way multivariate analysis of variance. To the second and third model covariates have been added, which are respectively the number of recognized and rejected asylum applications. The analysis shows that states with higher levels of immigrant integration policy are better at ensuring positive relative native employment than states with lower levels of policy. The relationship between higher levels of integration policy and higher individual wealth is partially confirmed. The relationship between levels of integration policy and public finances needs to be researched further to draw conclusions about this.","['Immigrant integration policy, migration, destination country, economy, employment, wealth, public finances.']"
Organizing collective resistance while being internally displaced: The Communities of Population in Resistance during the Guatemalan civil war,"Beneitez Pajares, Sergio","['Masullo, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Among the groups of civilians caught up in civil war, internally displaced populations are often assumed to have little say about their courses of action. In particular, current theoretical accounts of civilian agency in civil war expect that, when facing high levels of violence, civilians can choose between staying or leaving their communities, and only if they stay, they can choose to resist against armed groups. This thesis challenges that these choices are always so clear-cut. Relying on secondary sources, it investigates how populations in northern Guatemala combined displacement and resistance during the most violent period of the Guatemalan Civil War. More generally, this thesis proposes that short-time horizons (civilians’ belief that displacement will be temporary), harsh living conditions that require cooperation during the early moments of displacement, and shared negative perceptions towards one or more armed groups, might lead civilian population towards the organization of collective resistance while being internally displaced.","['civilian agency', 'civil war', 'civilian self-protection', 'civilian non-cooperation', 'non-violent resistance', 'internally displaced', 'Guatemalan civil war']"

Depression and Anxiety do not Mediate the Relationship between Mindfulness and Nocebo Effects in Induced Itch,"Dahler, Marianne","['Wolters, F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The theoretical framework of this research was based predominantly on the itch-anxiety cycle and the role of the HPA axis. This study aimed to explore the role of anxiety and depression as mediators in the relationship between mindfulness and nocebo effects in induced itch on healthy controls. Itch was induced using cowhage spicules, and mindfulness, anxiety and depression were measured using questionnaires which were administered before the experiment. The nocebo effect was calculated using itch ratings which were taken throughout the experiment. This study found that there was no significant association between any of the variables. Previously, mindfulness has been found to reduce anxiety and depression as well as itch. Limitations of this study included a high non-responsiveness to the itch stimuli as well as a low number of participants. Future research should explore how nocebo effects may influence potential treatments of chronic itch and how mediating psychological factors play a role in patients suffering from chronic itch.",
Academische Eisen leiden tot Hogere Vermoeidheidsklachten onder Universitaire Studenten,"Hart, Sophie 't",['Anna van Duijnhoven'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het Study Demands-Resources Model stelt dat academische eisen kunnen zorgen voor een hoger risico op burn-out onder studenten, wat negatieve gevolgen kan hebben voor hun gezondheid. Ook vermoeidheid wordt gerelateerd aan een hoger risico op burn-out. Vermoeidheidsklachten komen veel voor onder studenten, maar zijn niet eerder gerelateerd aan academische eisen. Het huidige cross-sectionele onderzoek beoogde daarom antwoord te geven op de vraag of er een directe relatie is tussen academische eisen en vermoeidheidsklachten onder studenten. Daarnaast is bekeken of academische hulpbronnen als moderator konden werken binnen die mogelijke relatie. Het onderzoek includeerde 171 studenten tussen de 18 en 27 jaar oud, studerend aan 11 verschillende Nederlandse universiteiten, die een vragenlijst invulden. Op de verkregen data zijn een meervoudige regressieanalyse en een moderatieanalyse uitgevoerd. De resultaten wezen uit dat er een positieve relatie bestaat tussen de academische eis werktempo en werkhoeveelheid en vermoeidheidsklachten (β = .404; t(167) = 5.202; p < .001). Er werd geen significant moderatie-effect van academische hulpbronnen gevonden. Op basis van de bevindingen wordt universiteiten geadviseerd om binnen de inrichting van het onderwijs de werkhoeveelheid voor studenten beter af te stemmen op hun beschikbare tijd om zo de negatieve gevolgen van academische eisen te voorkomen of te verminderen. Het onderzoek draagt daarnaast bij aan de verdieping van het SD-R Model. Verder onderzoek naar de rol van academische en persoonlijke hulpbronnen samen in de relatie tussen academische eisen en vermoeidheidsklachten is gewenst.

Research using the biopsychosocial model could find areas of improvement in the treatment of CLBP. This study attempts to find a relationship between Pain Catastrophizing (PC) and trunk movement patterns in CLBP Patients (N = 67) by performing retrospective data analysis on data collected by the Spine and Joint Centre in Rotterdam. Data was gathered from the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and the Objective Back Coordination Analysis (ORCA), a trunk movement measurement method. The analysis was performed through linear regression between the variables, which resulted in small, significant negative correlations between total PCS scores and trunk range of motion (ROM) (r = -.204, p < .05) and total PCS scores and movement pattern abnormality when compared to asymptomatic controls (r = -.244, p < .05). These results indicate that a high PC tends to coincide with lower ROM and a lower level of movement pattern abnormality. No correlations were found between the Magnification subscale of the PCS and ROM or movement pattern abnormality. A possible explanation for these results is that heightened PC could lead to higher levels of compensatory muscle use in the lower back, making patients’ movement patterns approximate that of asymptomatic controls. Further research would be needed to confirm this.","['Catastrophizing', 'Pain Catastrophizing', 'Chronic Low Back Pain', 'Trunk Movement Patterns']"

A threat to oneself or others slows response time on a spatial cueing task and this effect is strengthened for more pro-social and more anxious people.,"Methorst, Nine","['Mulckhuijse, M.G.J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Visual attentional selection is an essential mechanism for processing relevant stimuli in our surroundings. Visual attention can either be directed by environmental factors or be controlled voluntarily. Previous research has shown that attentional performance can be enhanced by punishment based on task performance. However, whether attention can also be influenced by a punishment to another person has not been researched yet. In the current study, we used an exogenous spatial cueing task to assess the effects of punishment in the form of a shock on visual attention. The interaction between social value orientation (SVO-shock and SVO), trait anxiety (STAI) and behavioral inhibition (BIS) with the punishment conditions on task performance was examined. Results showed that response time was slower in both punishment conditions. It was slower for people who are more pro-social and people who are more sensitive to punishment, but not for people who are more pro-social on the original SVO measure. People with a high trait anxiety had a slower response time in the ‘shock to other’ punishment condition. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides evidence that there is a correlation between the degree of pro-sociality and punishment sensitivity of a person and a slowed response to an exogenous target stimulus in a punishment condition when performing a spatial cueing task. It is possible that this effect was found because people experienced distraction from the task as their attention was drawn towards the source of the punishment.","['Visual attention, self, other, social value orientation, social motivation, threat, punishment, shocks']"

The effectiveness of EU sanctions: investigating the key drivers and conditions to reach the desired policy goals,"Verhelst, Femke","['Pomorska, K.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"EU policymakers are increasingly using sanctions as a policy instrument within the framework of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. This thesis aims to identify under what conditions the sanctions of the EU are most effective. Eight independent variables are identified as potential factors that could influence the effectiveness of sanctions, drawing from the International Relations (IR) theories of realism, liberalism and constructivism. Separate multivariate regression analyses are conducted for each IR theory, to assess the significance of the factors proposed by the theories. In addition, a comprehensive multivariate regression analysis is conducted, including the eight independent variables, in order to draw conclusions about the real-world scenario in which the multiple variables could interact. This analysis shows two significant results that influence the effectiveness of EU sanctions and would therefore be relevant for EU policymakers to understand while choosing their policy instrument and designing sanctions. Firstly, sanctions with higher costs imposed on the target demonstrate reduced effectiveness compared to those with lower costs. Secondly, the effectiveness of sanctions decreases when they are imposed on states possessing greater military capabilities. Yet, theoretical significance should not alone be paramount for societal relevance. Therefore, it would be relevant to further examine the variables that were only significant in the IR theory analyses or that indicated a large relation between the independent and dependent variable.",
The Role of Shame Resilience in Establishing Contact between Creditors and Debtors: Investigating the Impact of Shame Resilience Interventions on Debtors' Willingness to Contact Creditors,"Vogel, Dennis","['Seip, E.C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Over 600,000 households in the Netherlands are facing financial difficulties due to debt, which often causes feelings of shame and leads to avoiding creditors. This study looked at ways to help a debtor contact their respective creditor. The researchers wanted to see if increasing debtors’ resilience to shame would make them more willing to contact their creditors. Therefore, first of all, was hypothesized that increasing individuals’ sense of power and decreasing feelings of being trapped will result in a higher willingness to contact a creditor compared to the baseline condition. Additionally, there was hypothesized that the combined intervention condition, incorporating both enhanced power and reduced feelings of being trapped, would be more effective than either intervention alone. Finally, age was explored as a potential factor within the relationship between shame resilience and willingness. The researchers tested this by assigning participants (n = 267) randomly to one of four groups: baseline, power, feeling trapped, or a combined intervention. In each condition, participants received a tailored creditor email designed to elicit feelings of increased power, reduced feelings of being trapped, or a combination of both. In contrast, the baseline condition involved a standard creditor email. Subsequently, participants were asked to indicate their willingness to initiate contact with the creditor agency. The results showed that increasing people's sense of power and reducing feelings of being trapped led to a greater willingness to contact creditors compared to the baseline group.

"De rol van gender tussen woede in reactie op een sibling, als indicator van de kwaliteit van de sibling relatie, en sibling agressie in de adolescentie","Oostveen, Irene","['Berkel, S.R. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Sibling aggression is a common phenomenon which can lead to negative outcomes on the development of children. Aggression between siblings can possibly be explained by the quality of the sibling relationship and gender. The aim of the current study is to investigate whether anger in response to a sibling, as an indicator of the quality of the sibling relationship, is related to sibling aggression and whether gender plays a moderating role. A sample of 18 sibling pairs (oldest sibling: aged 10 to 18 years, M = 14, SD = 1.9) participated. The aggression between siblings was measured with the sibling version of the Conflict Tactics Scale, CTS2-SP. To measure anger in response to provocative behavior of the sibling a Virtual Reality (VR) task was used. The provocative behavior was believed to be controlled by their sibling but was actually an avatar. The participants were also asked if they believed if their sibling controlled the avatar during the VR task. The scores of the oldest sibling of the pairs were included. The results showed that anger in response to the sibling was not related to sibling aggression and that participants showed equal aggression towards their sibling. Also, no gender differences were found between participants in the link between anger and aggression, so gender did not play a moderating role. It seems that gender differences in siblings play a smaller role than in boys and girls for showing aggression. The results suggest that aggression between siblings might be more normal and accepted than aggression between boys and girls and that siblings may be more used to each other compared to non-family related children. However, further research is needed, to understand the phenomenon of sibling aggression even better in order to prevent it, since the consequences of sibling aggression can be profoundly serious.","['sibling aggression', 'sibling relationship', 'quality of the sibling relationship', 'anger towards a sibling', 'gender', 'Virtual Reality task']"

From Respect to Imposition – How Relations between Indigenous Peoples and the British in Canada changed between the 18th and 19th Century: How and why did notions of political authority of Indigenous Peoples in Canada change between 1763 and 1876?,"Kluge, Kira","['Vergerio, C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Canada’s history has been shaped by settler colonialism. The Indigenous populations who had lived on the territory prior to the arrival of European colonists are now marginalized groups. But how did they go from being trading partners to being forced into reservations? This thesis investigates changes in notions of political authority of Indigenous Peoples in Canada in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The findings include proof for a plurality of practices between settlers and Indigenous communities in the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century, this plurality disappeared, and was replaced by the imposition of European practices on Indigenous Peoples. This change was due to a changing political landscape in the colony, with the Canadian colonial government gaining more independence and changing the doctrine on relations with Indigenous Peoples. These changes resulted in Indigenous Peoples being stripped of their political authority and ultimately falling under the authority of the Canadian colonial government, which had gained power in the same century.","['Canada', 'Indigenous Peoples', 'Law', 'Historical International Law', 'Treaties', 'Legal Practices', 'Political Authority']"

The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value was used to determine the best model fit for the positive and negative social learning rate data, after which two multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the influence on both negative and positive social learning rates. Contrary to previous research, the findings of this study suggest that other factors beyond self-esteem, resistance to peer pressure and gender may be more influential in determining social learning rate in adolescents. Further research is required to explore the possible confounding variables that may influence the social learning rates by including additional control variables or by conducting replication studies with larger and more diverse samples, which is crucial in developing effective intervention programs to support the social development of adolescents.","['SELF-ESTEEM, PEER PRESSURE, GENDER, AND SOCIAL LEARNING']"

Impact of COVID-19 and length of intensive care stay on Psychological Post Intensive Care Syndrome,"Snoeks, Julia",['Judy Veldhuijzen'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Because of improved healthcare the chances of ICU survival have increased, but half of ICU survivors continue to have physical, psychological or cognitive problems for months/years after discharge, summarized as Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). This study focuses on whether a COVID-19 contamination and length of ICU stay confers a risk for the development of psychological PICS (depressive, anxiety and PTSD symptoms), as its impact has not yet been widely studied. First hypothesis is that psychological PICS after ICU stay will be significantly worse for COVID-19 contaminated ICU patients than for non-COVID-19 ICU patients. Second is that longer length of ICU stay is significantly related to more psychological PICS in ICU patients. Third is that length of ICU stay positively moderates the relationship between COVID-19 contamination and psychological PICS, meaning a stronger effect of a COVID-19 contamination on psychological PICS for longer length of ICU stay. In this cohort study, COVID-19 (N = 147) and non-COVID-19 patients (N = 127) are compared for depressive, anxiety and PTSD symptoms, measured using the PHQ-9, the GAD-7 and the PCL-5 respectively. H1: a one-way ANOVA analysis was performed: COVID-19 patients experienced more depressive (p < .001), anxiety (p < .011) and PTSD (p < .017) symptoms. H2: linear regression analysis was performed: longer ICU stay was not associated with more depressive (p = .120), anxiety (p = .266) and PTSD (p = .202) symptoms. H3: a moderator analysis was performed using PROCESS Macro 3.5 - Model 1 by Hayes: an interaction effect was found for depression (p = .027), with non-COVID-19 patients experiencing more depressive symptoms for longer length of ICU stay and COVID-19 patients for shorter length of ICU stay. No interaction effect was found for anxiety (p = .50) and PTSD (p = .189). The findings provide insight into the complex interaction of psychological impact of ICU admission, specifically for COVID-19 and length of ICU stay, but also highlight the importance of further investigation of underlying mechanisms. Further research should take into account severity of illness, mental health history, personality traits and social support, and create sub-group for the non-COVID-19 group.","['PICS, psychological impact, depression, anxiety, PTSD, COVID-19, length of stay, ICU']"

Detrás de las Formas: Why do some feminist movements resort to violence? A Case Study of the Ni Una Menos Movement in México,"Evangelista, Stephanie","['RezaeeDaryakenari, B.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study contends for a social-psychological lens to understand why some feminist movements resort to violence. Literature from feminist peace studies has argued that women are most likely to be peaceful, and scholarship in criminology suggests women are more likely to choose nonviolent coping behaviors. A large body of social movement literature has argued for rationalist approach to understanding the choice to utilize violence vis-a-vis nonviolence as a method of resistance. However, literature within the field of political science has not entirely explored underlying individual-level behaviors to explain why women within a feminist movement utilize violence as a method of resistance. Thus, introducing the research question: Why do some feminist movements resort to violence? Cases of feminist movements increasingly utilizing violence is puzzling because it contradicts arguments made by rationalist studies and feminist peace studies. I apply Robert Agnew’s General Strain Theory and argue that some feminist movements resort to violence because of a highly negative perception of the lack of governmental support to address a grievance in gender inequality, which generates negative emotions of anger and frustration that then leads to the likelihood of utilizing violent methods of resistance. I evaluate the argument using qualitative research in the single-case study of the Ni Una Menos (NUM) Movement in México. This study process traces data from semi-structured online interviews to analyze the causal mechanism of negative emotions through language utilized by activists of NUM to answer the research question.","['general strain theory', 'violent methods of resistance', 'qualitative', 'feminist movements', 'negative emotions']"

The influence of the Christian democratic welfare regime on German parties and of the neoliberal regime on UK parties is observed by analyzing the main pension reforms in both countries. Focusing on the parties SPD, CDU, Grüne, and FDP in Germany and Labour, Conservative, and Liberal parties in the UK, this study aims to decipher the influence of welfare state regime types and how they affect party ideology. Regime type influences varied to a fair degree. In Germany, parties presented varying policy ideals on solidarity, contribution schemes, and pension sustainability, with SPD and CDU emphasizing social justice and system sustainability. At the same time, FDP focused on individual responsibility, and Grüne expressed various forms of justice. Similar patterns emerged in the UK, where the Labour Party argued for social and gender equality, the Conservatives stressed economic self- reliance, and the Liberals highlighted the need to allow flexible pensions based on a diverse employment landscape. Despite some limitations, such as the exclusion of extensive parliamentary debates, this thesis underlines the importa0nce of understanding institutional influences to contextualize the parties’ policy decisions, providing valuable insights for comparative policy studies and future welfare state research in the field of pension reform.",

This thesis will explore the role of political ideals on education policy in Southern Cone states: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. The respective shifts to democracy of each Southern Cone state in the 1980s and 1990s created a political shift to the left. Once in government, left-wing parties benefited from an expanded policy space to influence education developments. In this paper, these developments are analyzed in spending and policy objective terms. It is theorized that left-wing ideals encouraged a rise in government expenditure and coverage rates for primary education. Through a qualitative mixed methods approach, trends and possible overlaps will aid to assess the relative influence of left-wing ideals in education policy outcomes. The study’s findings observe that left-wing governments had a significant influence on Southern Cone education developments. This thesis concludes with identifying possible future avenues of research as well as a reflection on the importance of analyzing the politics of classrooms.","['Southern Cone Politics', 'Post-Dictatorship Social Policy', 'Latin American Welfare States', 'Left-wing Ideals', 'Primary Education', 'Education Spending', 'Education Coverage']"

This article describes bird identification activities as arts of noticing, particular ways of seeing things - in this case, bird species - that remain invisible to others. Through qualitative research methods and audio-visual methods, this study explores how different practices of bird identification at the Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen, the Netherlands, shape how bird identifiers perceive, conceive, and value local ecologies. Different bird identifiers have a different idea of what nature is or could be - especially within the Dutch context, where people often say that “real” nature does not exist. Therefore, studying how bird identifiers conceptualise local ecologies is essential for understanding how they see themselves concerning non-human entities and how they interact with and treat the nonhuman. By discussing how bird identification practices shape embodied encounters with nature through skilled vision and listening, this study examines how particular conceptions of Dutch socio-ecological systems and subsequent pro-environmental behaviour arise from a specific art of noticing, i.e., bird identification. Apart from a written output, this study also consists of an audio-visual part. While in the written part of my thesis, I mainly focus on academic literature, applied research methods, and the results arising from those methods, my audio-visual output will focus on how bird identifiers are birding. I.e. in the audio-visual section of this thesis, I aim to show rather than write about how (professional) bird identifiers carry out bird identification and how their ways of seeing birds establish their conceptions and perceptions of local ecologies","['bird identification', 'arts of noticing', 'skilled vision', 'skilled listening', 'nature-culture', 'pro-environmental behaviour', 'embodiment']"

Rather than the typical karyotype XX or XY, people with SCT have three sex chromosomes, resulting in karyotype XXY, XYY or XXX. Executive functions can be defined as mental processes that allow people to control their actions. The BRIEF, BRIEF-P and MEFS were utilized to obtain information about the development of EF. A total of 147 participants between the ages of 2,8 and 7,6 years old took part in the study. 74 participants with SCT (Mage= 4,8, SD = 1,3) and 70 (Mage= 4,5, SD = 1,0) participants without SCT. Analysis methods used were independent samples t-tests, correlations and Fisher-Z transformations. It was found that there are differences in executive functioning as a whole between children with and without SCT. The differences in working memory, inhibition and cognitive flexibility are small. Bigger differences between children with and without SCT were found with regards to their emotional control and cognitive flexibility. The research concludes that developmental delay regarding executive functioning is visible in children with SCT before the age of 8 years old. When children mature these differences become more obvious as the gap between what is expected with regards to EF increases faster than children with SCT improve their EF skills. Additional research is needed in order to discover whether the EF profile found is unique for children with SCT and what implications this has. Future studies should also investigate the ways EF impacts children with SCT and which treatments yields the most benefits for them. Support with regards to the development of EF in children with SCT is crucial in order to enable them to maximize the possibilities in their lives.","['Sex Shromosome Trisomies', 'Executive Functions', 'BRIEF', 'BRIEF-P', 'MEFS', 'Development', 'SCT', 'TRIXY.']"

The therapeutic relationship in an intercultural context: The effect of shared meaning on therapeutic alliance and client insight,"Catic, Lara","['Henkelmann, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Psychotherapy research has recognized the contribution of therapeutic alliance to positive therapy outcomes. However, many factors may interfere with the development of a strong alliance, such as working with culturally diverse clients. Shared meaning reflects the degree of concordance in client-therapist views on suffering and illness. Potentially culturally determined, it could have an influence on the development of the therapeutic alliance. However, it is unclear whether shared meaning as initially perceived is subject to change, and whether client outcomes such as insight are amenable to it. This study aimed to explore the effect of culture on therapeutic alliance and shared meaning, and the effect of shared meaning on therapeutic alliance. It also investigated the first impression of shared meaning as a predictor of client insight. A questionnaire containing a validated instrument assessing therapeutic alliance and added items was distributed among individuals with experience with psychotherapy within the Netherlands. The first analysis yielded non-significant results (p = .160), suggesting that based on our sample, cultural context does not explain the variance in therapeutic alliance and shared meaning. Testing the second and third hypotheses yielded significant results (p < .001), suggesting that shared meaning is a significant predictor of therapeutic alliance, and that first impression of shared meaning is a significant predictor of client insight. The first non-significant finding could be due to the composition of the sample, or the study set-up. The results should be interpreted with caution with respect to limited information about client and therapist characteristics, and the recognized limitations of self-report.","['therapeutic alliance, cross-cultural psychotherapy, intercultural therapeutic context, shared meaning, insight']"
A Methodological Walk: A methodological reflection on an interdisciplinary audio-visual exploration of the Hatertse and Overasseltse fens,"Bekhuis, Maarten","['Hölsgens, S.R.J.J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"For more than twenty years, we have familiarised ourselves with the notion of the Anthropocene as the definition for the (ecological) epoch we currently live in. It acknowledges the irrevocable human influence we try to cope with on the planet. This thesis touches upon contemporary human-nature relationships within the Anthropocene as something under pressure and in a continuous flow of revision. After four months of fieldwork at the Hatertse and Overasseltse fens, semi-structured interviews were conducted, interdisciplinary footage was recorded and sensory walks were performed to study such relations. Thereafter, methodological reflection became the main focus. Based on sensorial anthropology and methodological literature, this thesis scrutinizes the sensory walk as the main ethnographic methodology. It shows how other methods contribute to the epistemological value of this method, discusses the interactive website and mapping as visualization possibilities (the interactive website “Voices in Nature” was developed following this research), and explores the human and nonhuman concepts of pathways, crowdedness, noise and wind as environmental and anthropogenic factors that were distilled from the walks, proving its ethnographic value. As a methodological reflection, this thesis will demonstrate the potential the sensory walk contains for visual anthropological research now and in the future. It will also show how it fits the interdisciplinary approach this research aspires to, contributing to methodological literature on the more-than-human world.","['Sensory walk', 'Anthropocene', 'human-nature relationships', 'pathways', 'more-than-human world']"
‘I Read It On Facebook. So It Must Be True!’: The Effect of Facebook Use on Partisan Perceptual Bias and Political Knowledge,"Verwilghen, Lena","['Robison, J. A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Political knowledge is one of the most important determinants of the political behavior of citizens and their ability to participate in the democratic system. The amount of political knowledge that citizens possess, and the process of political learning has been changed by the rise and use of Facebook. It has affected users’ Motivation, Opportunity, and Ability to learn about politics. Previous research on the effect of Facebook on political knowledge has yielded divergent results, suggesting there might be another aspect influencing the relationship between the two. This thesis argues that Facebook use affects users’ political knowledge through the influence it has on their partisan perceptual biases. Using data from the ANES 2020 Social Media Survey, this thesis shows that partisan bias is strongly present and affects the knowledge level of people. In general, increased Facebook use tends increase knowledge about party congruent information, while decreasing knowledge about party incongruent information. But more importantly, results show that this effect varies for different questions and issues, suggesting that further and more detailed research is needed to isolate the effects of Facebook use on partisan biases and political knowledge.","['Facebook', 'Partisan Perceptual Bias', 'Partisan Bias', 'Political Knowledge']"

The effect of parental verbal information transmission on the development of childhood social fears: The immediate impact on avoidance and fear beliefs during social interaction,"Emilianidou, Irene","['Aktar, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"This study investigated the impact of parental verbal threat (vs. safety) information regarding a stranger on a child’s subjective and behavioral fear responses towards that stranger. As a manipulation, parents were instructed to provide their children (N=79), aged 10-14 years, with standardized verbal threat or safety information about two strangers in the lab. Then, children engaged in a social interaction task with the two strangers (blind to their condition) separately, while child behavioral avoidance was recorded. Following the task, children reported fear beliefs for each stranger. Also, parents completed a self-report questionnaire on social anxiety symptoms. Children reported more fear beliefs for the stranger paired with the threat information, but no significant difference was found in observed avoidance. In addition, verbal threat information did not have a stronger influence on children’s observed avoidance in case of higher reported fear beliefs. Similarly, high parental social anxiety symptoms did not moderate the impact of verbal threat information on the child’s cognitive or behavioural fear indices. However, they did have a significant influence on behavioural avoidance, regardless of verbal information. Overall, this study shows a causal effect of verbal threat messages provided by parents only on child subjective fear and highlightsthe need for further research on the verbal transmission of childhood social fears in the context of family, by examining these processes in various social situations, age groups, and fear indices.","['child', 'social anxiety', 'verbal learning', 'parental influence']"

Toch bestaan er nog onduidelijkheden over de definitie en waardering van ouderbetrokkenheid door ouders/verzorgers en leerkrachten, evenals over de meest effectieve strategieën om deze betrokkenheid te verbeteren. Dit onderzoek verkende ouderbetrokkenheid in het basisonderwijs, specifiek in de groepen 6, 7 en 8, en beoogde praktijkgericht advies te geven aan OOK Pedagogische Expertise Groep over manieren om ouderbetrokkenheid te bevorderen. Het perspectief van ouders/verzorgers en leerkrachten op ouderbetrokkenheid stond centraal in dit onderzoek. Epstein's 'Framework of Six Types of Involvement' fungeerde als het theoretisch raamwerk, waarbij de focus lag op de domeinen communication, learning at home en parenting. De hoofdvraag van het onderzoek luidde: ‘Wat verstaan ouders en leerkrachten onder ouderbetrokkenheid richting school?'. De deelvragen onderzochten wat leerkrachten en ouders/verzorgers het belangrijkste domein van ouderbetrokkenheid vinden, de mate van overeenstemming tussen de opvattingen van beide groepen, en de variatie in opvattingen tussen ouders/verzorgers van verschillende klassenjaren. Voor dit onderzoek is een kwantitatieve enquêtemethode gebruikt. Online vragenlijsten zijn verspreid onder 117 Nederlandse respondenten (59 leerkrachten en 58 ouders/verzorgers) van leerlingen in groep 6, 7, of 8 uit Noord- en Zuid-Holland. De vragenlijsten waren gericht op de perceptie van ouderbetrokkenheid binnen de context van Epstein's domeinen. De resultaten toonden aan dat ouders/verzorgers en leerkrachten dezelfde perceptie hebben over het brede construct ouderbetrokkenheid. Zo was voor leerkrachten en ouders/verzorgers het domein communication het belangrijkst, gevolgd door parenting en vervolgens learning at home. Daarentegen was er enige variatie in de percepties van beide groepen tussen de drie domeinen. Zo was er tussen de domeinen parenting en learning at home voor leerkrachten geen significant verschil, terwijl bij ouders/verzorgers deze domeinen wel significant van elkaar verschilde. Dit benadrukt de complexiteit van de percepties rond ouderbetrokkenheid. Tot slot zijn er geen significante verschillen gevonden over het concept ouderbetrokkenheid als over de drie domeinen tussen de ouders/verzorgers van verschillende klassenjaren. De bevindingen bieden aanknopingspunten voor de praktijk, waaronder de ontwikkeling van strategieën om de communicatie tussen de school en de ouder(s)/verzorger(s) te verbeteren en learning at home en parenting te stimuleren. Het streven van deze aanbevelingen is het verbeteren van de samenwerking tussen ouders/verzorgers en leerkrachten, wat naar verwachting zal resulteren in hogere ouderbetrokkenheid. De maatschappelijke waarde van deze studie ligt in het bijdragen aan kennis over ouderbetrokkenheid. De adviezen naar aanleiding van dit onderzoek kunnen door OOK Pedagogische Expertise Groep worden gebruikt om interventies te ontwikkelen en ouderbetrokkenheid in het onderwijs te bevorderen.","['ouderbetrokkenheid', 'basisonderwijs', 'exploratief onderzoek']"

Het doel van dit onderzoek is de huidige situatie van rekendifferentiatie in kaart brengen op de domeinen kennis, houding en gedrag. Er is een vragenlijst gemaakt waarbij de kennis, houding en het gedrag van leerkrachten bij differentiëren wordt uitgevraagd. Uit de resultaten bleek dat de houding van leerkrachten significant positiever is dan de factoren kennis en gedrag. Verder bleken kennis en houding beiden significant te correleren met gedrag. Een hoge score op kennis en houding zal zich waarschijnlijk uiten in een hoge score op gedrag. Bij de vraag naar differentiatiemogelijkheden is gebleken dat leerkrachten al veel verschillende dingen inzetten. Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd met een relatief kleine steekproef (N = 18), dit kan invloed hebben op de uitkomsten. Een aantal toetsen bleek niet significant te zijn, waardoor de conclusies niet met zekerheid gesteld kunnen worden. Ook vraagt de vragenlijst om zelfinschatting van de leerkrachten, de scores zijn niet objectief. Een vervolgonderzoek zou zich kunnen richten op rekenonderwijs bij de kleuters of kan dieper ingaan op één van de drie domeinen. Ondanks dat leerkrachten momenteel al veel dingen doen op het gebied van differentiatie, zou hier meer uitgehaald kunnen worden. Meer effectieve differentiatie zou bereikt kunnen worden door het behouden van de positieve houding, het vergroten van de kennis van leerkrachten en het aansporen van daadwerkelijk differentiëren in de les.",
"Investigating why and for whom cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder works: Examining the role of self-efficacy, cognitions, age, and sex","Klavers, Annelies","['Miers, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research has shown that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a frequently used effective intervention for social anxiety disorder (SAD) in children and adolescents. However, not much is known about the working mechanisms of CBT. This study examined variables that may play a role in the effectiveness of a CBT intervention for adolescents with SAD. Knowing which variables predict treatment outcome can help to enhance the efficacy of interventions for SAD. Research has shown that low self-efficacy, few positive cognitions and many negative cognitions are associated with SAD, hence the variables that were included were self-efficacy, positive cognitions, and negative cognitions. This study also examined whether age and sex acted as moderators on the relationship between a change in the predictor variables and a change in SAD. With the exclusion of dropouts and missing data, 36 adolescents aged 11-17 years with SAD participated in a group-based CBT intervention called Skills for Social and Academic Success (SASS). Before and after participation they filled out questionnaires measuring self-efficacy, cognitions and SAD. An interview was conducted to assess the severity of the SAD symptoms. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine whether change in SAD could be predicted by change in self-efficacy and cognitions. Results indicated that a change in positive and negative cognitions significantly predict a change in SAD symptoms, but only when using the questionnaire for SAD as the dependent variable. Furthermore, the change in negative cognitions is a stronger predictor for change in SAD for younger than for older adolescents. Sex did not act as a moderator on any of the variables. These results indicate that changing cognitions may be an important mechanism behind why CBT interventions work. Future research on this topic should focus on the role of positive as well as negative cognitions in CBT interventions.",

The main research question was wether differences in ADL and EF existed CSS-patients different types of genetic mutations. The differences between the groups of genetic mutations were examined taking into account the intercorrelation of ADL and EF, and the age of the (groups of) patients. In the study, 73 patients with Coffin-Siris Syndrome participated (N=73), divided into 2 groups: one group with the genetic mutation ARID1B and 1 group with other genetic mutations. The study data was obtained through the de Voorbereidende vragenlijst Coffin Siris Syndroom poli. This study revealed that no distinction could be made between different genetic mutations with respect to EF, F(1,26) = .21; p = .652. The same is true for ADL, F(1,31) =1.29; p = .264. On average, the groups with different genetic mutations did not score significantly different from each other to distinguish between them. It was also found that when corrected for age, no distinction could be made between the different genetic mutations. There were no significant influences of age in either EF (p= .478) or ADL (p= .214). When looking at the entire target group of CSS patients, rather than the groups of genetic mutations, the study found that initially there does not appear to be a relationship between EF and ADL, r = .33, p = .053. However, the study does show a significant positive weak relationship between EF and ADL when adjusted for age, r = .35, p = .049. Thus the study did not find sufficient results to imply a distinction between different gene mutations in ADL and EF in clinical practice. However, there does seem to be a relationship between EF and ADL in CSS patients. Research with larger groups of CSS-patients with the ARID1B- and other mutations is necessary in order to reveal potential differences.",

Yet, little is known about this from a patient’s perspective. The aim of this study is to gain insight in the QoL and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in patients with (early onset) dementia and to examine the possible relationships with openness to discuss concerns (ODC), perceived social support (PSS) and problem-focused coping. The main hypothesis tested if more ODC, PSS and a problem-focused coping strategy were related to higher QoL and IADL. Methods: We studied patients visiting the Amsterdam Alzheimer center for a screening-day, who consented to research in the ADC cohort. Of 206 patients visiting the clinic, 162 patients (35-82 years, M = 63.59, 63,6% male) completed an 88-item self-reported questionnaire. Patients were categorized by their cognitive diagnosis (SCD = 42 , AD = 48, other dementia = 33, psychiatric disorder = 20 or other neurological disorder = 19). Correlations and multiple linear regressions were performed to assess the relationships between QoL, IADL, and the social factors. In addition, we performed a linear regression to track down group differences. Tests with a p < .05 after correction for multiple testing using a False Discovery Rate (FDR), were considered significant. Results: The distribution of the QoL scores was widespread (range 0-96) with a low median (50). Correlations showed that both PSS (r = .41, p = 5.5×10-6), ODC (r = .17, p = .02) and problem-focused coping (r = .19, p =.02) correlated with higher QoL scores. For IADL (median = 15.3) this was, only true for the ODC (r = .22, p = .01). There were no differences found between patient groups. Conclusion: This study indicates that PSS, ODC and problem focused coping are related to higher QoL in patients with (early onset) dementia. There were no group differences, but the average QoL score was lower than expected. Improving patients’ psychosocial factors has the potential to optimize QoL in patients visiting a tertiary memory clinic.","['Quality of life', 'Memory Clinic', 'Coping', 'Social Support', 'Openness to Discuss', 'Patients with Dementia', 'Early Onset Dementia']"

The network of governance comprising the state, civil society organizations, businesses, and other actors, has likewise been impacted by the information age. Integration of digital products into the authoritative institutions and decision-making processes is reshaping how actions within governance are being conducted. The transformative nature of digitalization thus begs the question of how governance practices are being affected by the phenomenon. Dividing governance practices into measures of performance and procedural values gives nuance to how governance actors are weighing the importance of effective policy with public values. As digitalization is a process, observations over the long term allow for trends to be observed. A panel study was thus conducted. In the lack of definitive results of the relationship, critical insights into how the research was conducted are presented. Additionally, paths to be taken in future studies are suggested as the information age will only continue to reshape social and political structures.","['Digitalisation, Governance, Internet, e-Government, Panel Study, Good Governance, Public Administration, Developing States']"

While MSEs seek to promote ideals like peace and equality, there have been numerous occasions where hosts of these events undermine the same values the MSEs strive to foster. This can be seen with the most recent edition of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar with the host accused of undermining human rights controversies related to migrant labor, women’s rights, and LGBTQ rights in the country. Given the phenomenon of state’s reacting differently to norm contestation, the central research question this project assesses is: How did democratic states respond to human rights norm contestations at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar? Building on literature from the schools of human rights, protests, and state responses to norm contestation, this study uses democracy level as an independent variable see its effects on state behavior at the 2022 World Cup. Using a most-similar systems design, a QCA is conducted on Croatia and The Netherlands. This study provides mixed support for realist thought that finds that the closer a state is to being a full democracy, the more likely it is to respond to a norm contesting MSE host.","['MSEs', 'World Cup', 'Qatar', 'Football', 'Soccer', 'HNS', 'KNVB']"

Understanding and gathering data on FIS is essential to enhance long-term therapy results. One variable potentially correlated with FIS is heart rate variability (HRV); however, their relationship is intricate and influenced by moderating variables. To explore this complexity, the present cross-sectional observational study investigated self-efficacy as a potential moderator. Participants included 61 therapists specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy (Mage = 34.4, SD = 8.5), of which 86.9% were female. Therapists responded to the FIS index, a measuring tool of FIS that consists of videos picturing challenging client situations. HRV was analyzed by looking at the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats during the task. Self-efficacy was measured using the general self-efficacy score. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between HRV and FIS and the moderating role of self-efficacy. Contrary to expectations, changes in therapists’ HRV were not correlated with differences in FIS index scores. Neither did self-efficacy explain any variance in the HRV-FIS relationship. Future research should focus on refining the FIS index and implementing alternative HRV analysis techniques. This study provides valuable insights into the intricate relationship between HRV, FIS, and self-efficacy in therapeutic contexts, highlighting the complexity of these factors and paving the way for further investigation and comprehension of therapeutic processes.","['heart rate variability, facilitative interpersonal skills, self-efficacy, therapist variables, multiple linear regression.']"

Draagkracht en draaglast onder Nederlandse jongeren: In opdracht van GGD Zeeland en het Nederlands Centrum Jeugdgezondheidszorg,"Ringeling, Kevin","['Lotz, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Het is bekend dat het mede door de coronacrisis slecht is gesteld met het welzijn van jongeren. Om dit welzijn van jongeren in kaart te kunnen brengen, is het nuttig om inzicht te verkrijgen in de factoren die volgens jongeren bijdragen aan hun draagkracht en draaglast. Daarom is er behoefte aan het ontwikkelen van een balansmeter voor jongeren. Deze balansmeter kan bijdragen aan de vroegsignalering en mogelijke preventie van latere problematiek, om zo het welzijn van jongeren te kunnen verhogen. Dit onderzoek vormt de eerste stap in het proces richting het ontwikkelen van een balansmeter. De vraag die centraal staat in dit onderzoek is welke factoren Nederlandse jongeren van 13 tot en met 15 jaar ervaren als belangrijk voor het definiëren van hun draagkracht en draaglast. Om dit te meten is een online vragenlijst ontwikkeld waarin de domeinen mentaal welzijn, fysiek welzijn, sociale relaties, schoolbeleving, leefomgeving en vrijetijdsbesteding zijn uitgevraagd. Op basis van de resultaten blijken factoren met betrekking tot sociale relaties, met name in de thuissituatie, van belang te zijn voor draagkracht. Factoren met betrekking tot het mentaal welzijn worden als belangrijkst ervaren voor draaglast. Er wordt geadviseerd om aan de hand van voorgaande factoren in te zetten op preventie en vroegsignalering van problematiek onder jongeren. Ook kan aanvullend kwantitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd worden onder een andere representatieve steekproef om zo de resultaten beter te kunnen generaliseren. Daarnaast wordt geadviseerd om door middel van kwalitatief onderzoek het belang van de gevonden factoren uit te laten diepen door jongeren. Ten slotte is het interessant om de onderzochte leeftijdscategorie te vergelijken met de leeftijd van 16 tot en met 18 jaar wat betreft de ervaren draagkracht en draaglast. Daarmee kan onderzocht worden of het nuttig is om voor elke leeftijdscategorie apart een balansmeter te ontwikkelen.","['Draagkracht, draaglast, jongeren, welzijn, balansmeter']"

It is important to know which factors are related to externalizing problem behaviour, so that identifying and treatment can focus on those. Current research focuses on the relationship between gender, age, inhibition and emotional facial recognition with externalizing problem behaviour. Previous research was inconsistent or little research has been done. 232 children and adolescents (𝑀𝑎𝑔𝑒 = 10.51; SD = 1.39), of which 79.3% were boys and 20.7% were girls, completed the Shifting Set Visual (SSV) to measure the level of inhibition and the Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) to measure the emotional facial recognition. The teachers of the children and adolescents completed the Teacher Report Form (TRF) to measure the degree of externalizing problem behaviour of the child or adolescent. The results show that boys have a higher degree of externalizing problem behaviour than girls. A lower inhibition level is related to a higher degree of externalizing problem behaviour than a higher inhibition level. Average emotional facial recognition appears to influence the relationship between inhibition and externalizing problem behaviour, whereas below-average emotion facial recognition did not. Also, age does not appear to be linked to externalizing problem behaviour. The results implicate that focussing on the inhibition level during identifying and treatment of externalizing problem behavior, is useful. They also imply that boys have a higher risk of a higher degree of externalizing problem behaviour than girls. Although expected, below-average emotional facial recognition did not appear to influence the relationship between inhibition and externalizing problem behaviour. This indicates that emotional facial recognition does not have to be taken into account during the signalling and treatment. More research is needed to make the findings more certain.",

In the United States, anti-Asian racism exists and is exceedingly problematic. At the same time, for the past thirty years United States power is relatively declining, and China is a rising power and changing the international world order. The Obama administration and the Trump administration dealt differently with the relative decline of United States power. In this paper, the United States government narrative of China and its effect on national anti-Asian racism in the United States is researched. First, existing literature on government policy tools, racism and narratives is critically analyzed. Thereafter, a narrative analysis is performed on the narratives used by the Obama administration and the Trump administration in a comparative case study. The results demonstrate that during the Trump presidency, the narrative of China was relatively more negative and anti-Asian racism levels were relatively higher. This implies that a more negative narrative of China causes more anti-Asian racism in the United States. Hence, this paper contributes to the academic field of political science by exposing the relation between governmental discursive power and citizen behavior.","['Anti-Asian Racism', 'United States', 'Trump', 'Obama', 'Narrative', 'Narrative theory']"

"De rol van zwakke en sterke verbale vaardigheden in mate van externaliserende problematiek bij kinderen met een verhoogd risico op het ontwikkelen van crimineel gedrag: Een onderzoek naar de combinatie van verbaal geheugen, receptieve taalvaardigheid en verbaal mentaliserend vermogen","Versluis, Anne","['Jong, R. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: Verbal difficulties have been shown to be related to externalizing behavior in children. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between externalizing behavior and difficulties in verbal memory, receptive language ability and verbal mentalizing ability. This helps us to uncover whether this combination of verbal difficulties forms a meaningful profile in predicting externalizing behavior and its treatment. Methods: The sample is derived of the Preventive Intervention Trajectory (PIT) and consists of 215 children aged 6 to 14. Within PIT, children with (sub)clinical levels of externalizing behavior receive a prolonged, preventive intervention tailored to their cognitive strengths and difficulties. Assessment of cognitive abilities includes measures of verbal memory (15-Words test), receptive language ability (CELF-4 subtest Concepts and Following Directions), and verbal mentalizing ability (Social Cognitive Abilities test (SCVT)). Results: Findings showed that verbal memory, receptive language ability and verbal mentalizing ability were not consistently positively correlated among each other. The combination of verbal abilities was modestly predictive of externalizing behavior. This predictive relationship was not significant when children were divided by verbal profile. Children with verbally weak profiles did not exhibit significantly more externalizing behavior than children with verbally strong profiles and both groups showed the same significant decrease in externalizing behavior after six months of treatment for their behavioral problems. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the combination of children’s verbal memory, receptive language ability and verbal mentalizing ability cannot be considered a meaningful profile in relation to externalizing behavior, as no differences emerged in externalizing behavior between children with weak verbal abilities and children with strong verbal abilities. The PIT intervention proved to be effective in reducing externalizing behavior, irrespective of verbal ability.","['Externaliserend gedrag', 'Criminaliteit', 'Verbale vaardigheid', 'Verbaal geheugen', 'Receptieve taalvaardigheid', 'Mentaliserend vermogen']"
Adviesrapport Ipse de Bruggen: Het meten van behandeleffecten bij jongeren met een licht verstandelijke beperking die ambulante zorg krijgen,"Pereboom, Evelien","['Woudstra, M.

Daarnaast wordt onderzocht wat de optimale frequentie van afname is. De set meetinstrumenten meet de behandeleffecten bij jongeren met een licht verstandelijke beperking (LVB) die ambulante zorg krijgen. Deze hoofdvraag is beantwoord aan de hand van literatuuronderzoek naar constructen en de daarbij horende meetinstrumenten die de behandeleffecten bij jongeren met een LVB meten. Ook is er een focusgroep ingezet, waarbij medewerkers van Ipse de Bruggen werd gevraagd naar belangrijke elementen van meetinstrumenten en de gevonden constructen. Op basis van het literatuuronderzoek zijn de volgende vier constructen geformuleerd die belangrijk zijn om behandeleffecten te kunnen meten bij jongeren met een LVB; adaptieve vaardigheden, zelfredzaamheid, emotionele- en gedragsproblemen en cognitieve vaardigheden. In totaal zijn zes meetinstrumenten gevonden die deze constructen meten. Deze meetinstrumenten worden in dit adviesrapport in detail besproken. Uit literatuuronderzoek is over de frequentie van het afnemen van deze meetinstrumenten naar voren gekomen dat er geen eenduidig beleid is, maar de voorkeur is om tweemaal, voor en aan het einde van de behandeling, de ROM-metingen te doen. Nadat meerdere constructen en meetinstrumenten onderzocht zijn door middel van het literatuuronderzoek, werd een focusgroep georganiseerd. Tijdens deze focusgroep gaven de medewerkers hun mening over de gevonden constructen, meetinstrumenten en de frequentie van afname. Daarnaast vertelden zij over hun eigen ervaringen met meetinstrumenten die bij Ipse de Bruggen al worden gebruikt. Tijdens de focusgroep is ook het belang van het afnemen van meetinstrumenten besproken en zijn de beperkingen van het gebruik van meetinstrumenten in het algemeen besproken. De belangrijkste constructen om te meten bij jongeren met een LVB waren volgens de medewerkers: ‘Emotieregulatie’ en ‘Psychische Problemen’. Het advies op basis van zowel het literatuuronderzoek en de focusgroep is om de volgende meetinstrumenten af te nemen in ROM-metingen indien de constructen (adaptieve vaardigheden, zelfredzaamheid, emotionele- en gedragsproblemen en cognitieve vaardigheden) passen bij het behandeldoel van de jongere met een LVB; Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Sociale Redzaamheidsschaal interview (SRZ-i), Adaptive Ability Performance Test (ADAPT), Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern und Jugendlichen (FEEL-KJ), Children’s Depression Inventory-2 (CDI-2) en/of Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Ook is het advies om de meetinstrumenten aan het begin en aan het eind van de behandeling af te nemen. Minimaal één keer per jaar zouden de meetinstrumenten afgenomen moeten worden, en indien dat haalbaar is, dan elke drie maanden. Tot slot worden in de conclusie en het advies aanbevelingen gedaan voor vervolgonderzoek en worden sterke punten en beperkingen van dit onderzoek besproken.",
Psychological Stress and Responsiveness to Immunotherapy for Metastasized Melanoma,"Tijssens, Frederiek","['Hinnen, Chris + Peerdeman, Kaya']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Immunotherapy for metastasized melanoma is effective in approximately 40% of patients, yet research is ongoing to understand what factors influence this effectiveness to improve this response rate. High levels of chronic stress are related to impaired immune response to cancer and worse tumor surveillance. This thesis is part of a larger study aimed to assess the relationship between psychological stress and effectiveness of immunotherapy in patients with metastasized melanoma. For 18 patients with metastasized melanoma, stress sensitivity, distress, depression and anxiety symptoms were measured before the start of immunotherapy. These independent variables were then analyzed in relation to immunotherapy response after three months, overall survival after six months and immune related adverse events after six months. The results showed that responders to immunotherapy and surviving patients had significantly lower stress sensitivity and depressive symptoms, whereas no significant relations were found for the distress and anxiety symptom measures. Furthermore, none of the distress-related variables were significantly related to the amount of adverse events a patient had. A limitation of the present study is that not chronic stress, but stress in the past week was measured. Future research could improve by using a chronic stress measure and increasing the sample size in order to potentially find more about the relationship between chronic stress and immunotherapy responsiveness. If there is a relationship, these stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms could be intervened on before start of immunotherapy to improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy.","['Immunotherapy, Metastasized Melanoma, Responsiveness, Psychological Stress']"
The Temporal Focus of Attention during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Linguistic Analysis of Reader Letters to “The Guardian”,"Fröhling, Jil","['Molendjik, M.L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study aimed to investigate the mediating role of anxiety in the relation of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in the temporal focus of attention (TFA). In order to explore the effects of the pandemic on cognitive processes and mental health, 2876 reader letters to „The Guardian“ from the time before and during the first lockdown were analyzed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). The TFA was operationalized by investigating the use of the verb tenses. It was hypothesized that the TFA on the past and future would be increased during the pandemic, while the TFA on the present would be decreased. Anxiety was hypothesized to be a mediator in these relationships. No hypothesis was fully confirmed. The pandemic was not significantly correlated with the focus on the past, while anxiety was shown to be significantly correlated with a decreased focus on the past. The pandemic was moreover associated with an increased focus on the present and an increased focus on the future, with no mediating role of anxiety. The pandemic was also significantly correlated with an increase of anxiety. This study sheds more light on the effects of the pandemic on cognitive processes and mental health and gives rise to new questions about the TFA.","['Temporal focus of attention (TFA), pandemic, anxiety, LIWC, past tense use, present tense use, future tense use']"

The sample of this study contained of 169 children in the age of 9 to 12 years who were classified in a research group of children (N= 138), who showed externalizing behavior in a clinical range and a control group in a non-clinical range. Social cognitive skills were measured with the Social Cognitive Skills Test. Inhibition and cognitive flexibility were measured with the Shifting Attentional Set (SSV), part of the Amsterdamse Neuropsychologische Taken (ANT). Working memory was measured with the subtest Digit Span from the WISC-III-NL The results showed that children who show externalizing behavior in the clinical range have significant reduced social cognitive skills and working memory. These children also have reduced inhibition and cognitive flexibility, but only when measured in errors and not reaction time. The multiple regression showed that working memory is a significant predictor of social cognition is this sample. Contrary to the expectations, inhibition and cognitive flexibility were not. It can be concluded that children who show externalizing behavior in the clinical range have reduced social cognitive skills and reduced executive functioning (EF), but the direction of the relation between social cognitive skills and EF remains unclear. This study contributed to the ongoing research on the relationship between social cognition and EF and showed that targeting EF in an intervention will not directly influence the social cognitive skills.","['sociaalcognitief functioneren', 'externaliserend probleemgedrag', 'executieve functies']"

Love in times of adversity: attachment style and resilience among sexual minority individuals,"Stal, Maarten van",['Aischa Reinken'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Research has proposed that there is a positive correlation between attachment style and resilience through a mediation of self-efficacy and self-care. This study sought to investigate the relationship between attachment style and resilience in specifically the sexual minority population. As sexual minority individuals tend to experience more hardship and be more insecurely attached, this relationship may be different in this population, thereby making it worthwhile to investigate whether this relationship is different from that in the general population. Taking a dimensional approach with attachment style, Model of Self, Model of Other, and resilience of non-heterosexual participants aged 18 and up (N = 239) were measured by means of a survey. It was hypothesized that more positive scores on Model of Self and Model of Other would be associated with higher resilience scores. From a multiple regression analysis, it was concluded that the model itself (p < .001), Model of Self (beta = .36, p < .001), Model of Other (beta = -.13, p = .024), and the interaction between the two (beta = .19, p = .001) were statistically significant. A positive relationship was found between Model of Self and resilience, whereas Model of Other and resilience produced a negative relationship. The relationship between Model of Self and resilience fits in with literature, although the negative relationship between Model of Other and resilience seemingly contradicts literature. This contradiction may be explained using self-efficacy and self-care. Further research on Model of Other and self-efficacy and self-care may elucidate this paradoxical relationship.","['sexual minorities', 'resilience', 'attachment']"
Consumer Behavior in an Intergroup Context: The Influence of Intergroup Threat on Purchase Intentions of Foreign Products,"Meijer, Lara",['Prof. dr. D.T. Scheepers'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"On the basis of intergroup threat theory (Stephan et al., 2009), the proposition that intergroup threats affect consumer behavior was examined with China as a target group. The intergroup threats entailed realistic threats to the economy, Covid threats to one’s (physical) safety, as well as symbolic threats to a country's values. An experimental study was designed, consisting of four conditions: A realistic threat condition, a symbolic threat condition, a Covid-19 threat condition, and a control condition. As dependent variables, purchase intentions regarding both Chinese and American products were measured among 250 Dutch participants. It was hypothesized that intergroup threats decrease purchase intentions through consumer ethnocentrism, negative emotions, and ideology. However, the main effect of the intergroup threat conditions on purchase intentions was insignificant. Therefore, to test the hypotheses, the scales of the different types of threats were used in regression analyses. These regression analyses showed that realistic and Covid—but not symbolic—threats predicted reduced purchase intentions of Chinese products. In addition, negative emotions and consumer ethnocentrism played mediating roles in this effect, whereas ideology was not a significant moderator of the relationship. Overall, this study suggests that threats from another country may lower the purchase intentions from the respective country. The results are discussed in relation to intergroup threat theory and in the context of marketing and public policy.","['intergroup threat theory, consumer behavior, purchase intentions, consumer ethnocentrism']"

It is important for a reader to make inferences between story elements while integrating background information. In addition, it is important that the reader can apply metacognition in which the reader monitors and regulates his/her own understanding about the text. These cognitive processes ensure that the reader forms and maintains a coherent mental representation about the story and these processes may be similar across different media. Research results from PISA shows a decrease in grades for reading comprehension, reading enjoyment, and competence perception among Dutch 15-year-old students. Following these results and the possible relationship between comprehension skills across different media, such as written text, auditory and visual presentations, this study has been conducted. This study investigated whether the narrative comprehension differed between these media and if the application of story-based and knowledge-based inferences, and metacognition to a story affects narrative comprehension in 8-12 year old children. Three stories in written text, auditory, and visual presentation modes, comprehension questions about these stories, and the think-aloud protocol were used. Narrative comprehension was measured using comprehension questions. Using the think aloud protocol, the relationship between comprehension skills and narrative comprehension was examined. The results indicate a difference between narrative comprehension in written text and visual presentation, with narrative comprehension in visual presentation being higher. Furthermore, the number of story-based inferences is a significant predictor for narrative comprehension in written text presentation and story-based and knowledge-based inferences for narrative comprehension in auditory presentation. Although further research is needed, these findings suggest the importance of using narrative texts across different media. Also these findings may be used for developing interventions in which children practice making inferences and use their metacognition across different media.","['Narrative comprehension, written text, auditory and visual presentations, story-based and knowledge-based inferences, metacognition']"

They spent more time on other media, such as audio and animation video. Therefore it is important to know how children can learn through these media. This study examines differences in online and offline comprehension between text, audio and animation video. So far research about this subject is scarce. Eighty-three children between eight and twelve years old participated in the study. A within-subjects design was used with three stories. A think-aloud protocol was used and after each part of the story participants were asked to say out loud what they were thinking. Children’s statements were categorized into different types of inferences. Online comprehension was measured using three types of inferences: connecting, reinstatement and knowledge-based inferences. Offline comprehension was measured with comprehension questions. Results indicated that there was no difference between the amount of connecting-, reinstatement- and knowledge-based inferences made in the different media. Regarding the second research question children answered significantly more comprehension questions correctly after watching an animation video than after reading a text. In addition, no differences were found in offline comprehension between text and audio and audio and animation video. This study supports the idea that children develop a general inference skill that is similar in different media. This suggests that they can practice making inferences via animation videos and being read to by someone. Regarding offline comprehension, additional research is needed on the effectiveness of using animation videos in the classroom to improve comprehension strategies. These inference skills and comprehension strategies can later be applied in reading comprehension.","['online comprehension', 'inferences', 'offline comprehension', 'animation videos']"

De effectiviteit van lotgenotengroepen voor adolescenten met autismespectrumstoornis en genderdysforie op het gevoel van eigenwaarde en psychische klachten.,"Scheringa, Lisanne","['Meijer, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Abstract: Several studies have reported on the co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and gender dysphoria (GD), especially during adolescence. A specific treatment program for Dutch adolescents with comorbid ASD and GD remains absent, while difficulties with self-worth and psychological wellbeing play a major role for this minority group. The current study investigates the effectiveness of a peer support group on the self-worth and psychological complaints of adolescents, using a pre- and post-test design. A total of 26 adolescents, 16 boys (61,5%) and 10 girls (38,5%) aged 13 to 24 (M = 18,92, SD = 2,30), were included. To assess self-worth and psychological complaints self-report questionnaires CBSA and SCL-90-R are used respectively, prior to and after finishing the intervention. A dependent t-test was used to compare the means of the measurement regarding self-worth and psychological complaints before and after the intervention took place. Results indicated that psychological complaints significantly reduced (t(22) = 2,56, p = ,02), while no effect was found on self-worth. A linear regression was used to test psychological complaints as a predictor of the effectiveness regarding self-worth. A trend was found in the positive direction, F(1,15) = 3,60, p = ,08. A higher level of psychological complaints in the pre-test predicts more overall improvement on self-worth. The results need to be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size and the absence of an experimental study design. Nevertheless, the research on the intervention contributes to the limited knowledge on treatment for adolescents with comorbid ASD and GD and shows significant reduction of psychological complaints after participating in the intervention, while taking the needs of adolescents with ASD and GD in regard.","['Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Gender Dysphoria', 'Peer Support Group', 'Psychological Complaints', 'Self-worth']"
De invloed van het kijken naar geanimeerde prentenboeken op de voorkeur die kleuters hebben voor papieren prentenboeken,"Schreuder, Evelien","['Swart, E.K.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"De afgelopen jaren is de samenleving sterk gedigitaliseerd, ook prentenboeken konden niet ontkomen aan deze verandering. Verschillende onderzoekers hebben onderzocht wat de effecten zijn van deze digitale prentenboeken op de taal- en leesvaardigheid van kinderen. Andere onderzoekers hebben onderzocht of kinderen een voorkeur hebben voor de digitale of papieren prentenboeken. Ondanks dat uit de verschillende onderzoeken bleek dat digitale prentenboeken een positieve invloed kunnen hebben op de ontwikkeling van kinderen én dat kinderen beide type boeken leuk vinden, zijn uitgevers huiverig om prentenboeken te digitaliseren. Dit komt mogelijk, doordat ze verwachten dat het digitaliseren van prentenboeken ertoe zal leiden dat de markt voor papieren prentenboeken zal afnemen. In dit onderzoek wordt daarom onderzocht of het kijken naar een geanimeerd prentenboek invloed heeft op de voorkeur die kleuters voor papieren prentenboeken hebben. Hierbij is ook gekeken naar de redenen die kleuters geven voor hun voorkeur. Deze vraag is onderzocht door middel van een quasi-experiment. In drie experimentele condities werd een geanimeerd prentenboek, ofwel een digitaal prentenboek dat geen interactieve elementen bevat, getoond. In twee experimentele condities is het boek driemaal bekeken, in één experimentele conditie is de animatie slechts eenmaal laten zien en in de controleconditie werd geen animatie bekeken. Vervolgens is in zowel de experimentele condities als in de controleconditie een keuzemoment gehouden waarbij de voorkeur van kleuters voor een papieren prentenboek en reden hiervoor zijn uitgevraagd. In totaal hebben 89 kleuters, verdeeld over zeven klassen van twee scholen, deelgenomen aan het onderzoek. De kinderen waren tussen de drie en zes jaar oud (M = 4.74, SD = 0.69) en er waren ongeveer evenveel jongens (n = 43) als meisjes (n = 46). Door middel van tweezijdige proportietoetsen zijn de verschillen in voorkeur tussen kleuters in de verschillende condities geanalyseerd en met een Chi-Kwadraat toets is gekeken of er verschil is tussen het aantal keer bekijken van de geanimeerde prentenboeken. Verder zijn de motieven voor de boekkeuzes gecategoriseerd. Uit de resultaten voor de boekkeuze bleek dat 45% van de kleuters koos voor het geanimeerde prentenboek dat ze gezien hadden in de klas. Ook werd in twee van de drie condities waarin kleuters een geanimeerd prentenboek hadden bekeken, significant vaker gekozen voor het papieren prentenboek van de animatie dan in de controleconditie. Verder bleek dat wanneer kleuters het geanimeerde prentenboek hadden gezien, er geen effect was van het aantal keer dat kleuters een geanimeerd prentenboek hadden gezien op de voorkeur voor het papieren prentenboek. Kleuters gaven een variatie aan motieven voor hun boekkeuze. 41% Van de kleuters gaf niet-specifieke antwoorden zoals ‘Vind ik leuk’ of ‘Weet ik niet’. Kleuters leken met name te kiezen voor papieren prentenboeken door de karakters op de kaft (26,1%), door andere uiterlijke kenmerken van de kaft (12,5%) of door bekendheid met het geanimeerde prentenboek (10,2%). Tot slot zijn de motieven uitgesplitst naar het wel of niet kiezen voor de papieren versie van het geanimeerde prentenboek. Hieruit volgde dat 24,3% van de kleuters die het geanimeerde boek koos, aangaf dat ze dit deden door de animatie die gezien is in de klas. Op basis van de resultaten van het huidige onderzoek volgt het advies om te blijven proberen om uitgevers te overtuigen meer prentenboeken te laten animeren, aangezien het onderzoek geen aanleiding geeft om aan te nemen dat dit ten koste gaat van de verkoop van papieren prentenboeken. Daarnaast is ook het advies om de invloed van geanimeerde prentenboeken op de voorkeur voor papieren prentenboeken van kinderen op grotere schaal te onderzoeken, gezien de beperkingen van dit onderzoek.","['geanimeerde prentenboeken', 'voorkeur', 'kleuters', 'papieren prentenboeken']"

De hoofdvragen zijn als volgt opgesteld: Wat zijn de wetenschappelijke inzichten over het bevorderen van emotionele veiligheid van kinderen van 4 tot en met 12 jaar op de BSO? Wat voor opvattingen hebben pedagogisch medewerkers en pedagogische coaches hierover? Er is een vragenlijst uitgezet om de opvattingen over de concepten sensitiviteit, autonomie bieden en structuur en grenzen stellen te meten om een beeld te geven van hoe emotionele veiligheid geboden wordt in de organisatie. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat zowel pedagogisch medewerkers als pedagogisch coaches het hoogst scoren op het concept sensitiviteit. Daarnaast komt uit de resultaten dat pedagogisch medewerkers significant lager scoren op het concept autonomie bieden dan pedagogisch coaches. Voor de concepten sensitiviteit en structuur en grenzen stellen zijn geen significant verschillen gevonden tussen pedagogisch coaches en pedagogisch medewerkers. Er is geen significant verschil gevonden tussen medewerkers die op horizontale of verticale groepen werken. Alle resultaten samengenomen kan er geconcludeerd worden dat voor alle deelconcepten verbeteringen behaald kunnen worden. Aan de opdrachtgever is geadviseerd om de interventie VIPP-CC in te zetten om de sensitiviteit bij de medewerkers te verhogen. Voor het verbeteren van autonomie bieden en structuur en grenzen stellen zijn geen interventies gevonden die gebruiksklaar zijn. Er is aan de opdrachtgever geadviseerd om gesprekken tussen pedagogisch coaches en pedagogisch medewerkers over het bieden van autonomie te faciliteren, omdat de coaches hier hoger op scoren. Daarnaast is geadviseerd om samen met de pedagogisch medewerkers een routine op te stellen, zodat zij kunnen aangeven wat haalbaar is binnen de groepen en vervolgens niet van deze routine hoeven af te wijken. Dit zou het concept structuur en grenzen stellen verbeteren.",

It can also withhold people with mental problems to recover. The aim of this study is to investigate the differences in social and psychological wellbeing between adolescents with and without selective mutism. Furthermore, the relationship between speaking behavior and the two wellbeing variables are investigated. Twenty-nine adolescents with selective mutism (f = 23, m= 6, mean age = 12,78) and 45 typical developing adolescents (f = 24, m= 21, mean age = 13.31) participated in this study. All the adolescents in the selective mutism group had a parent-reported diagnosis which presence was confirmed with the SMQ. Adolescents who were in (partial) remission were excluded. An online survey was send to the participants to collect the data for this study. The online survey consisted items from original questionnaires and items with questions about background information. Social- and psychological wellbeing is measured with the KIDSSCREEN-52 and speaking behavior is measured using the SMQ. Results showed that adolescents (10 – 18 years old) with selective mutism have lower psychological and social wellbeing than their typically developing peers. Furthermore, the presence of comorbid ASS above a diagnosis of selective mutism has a more negative impact on social wellbeing, but not psychological wellbeing, in comparison to adolescents with a single diagnosis selective mutism. Results have also shown that there is a positive relationship between the amount of difficulties in speaking behavior and social wellbeing but not for psychological wellbeing. These results implicate that adolescents with selective mutism have not only problems with expressing themselves in a verbal way but also experience a lower psychological and social quality of life than their typical developing peers. National Mental Health services should therefore not only pay attention to reducing the anxious behavior itself, but also look for ways to improve the psychological and social wellbeing of adolescents with selective mutism.","['Selectief Mutisme', 'Kwaliteit van Leven', 'Welbevinden', 'SMQ', 'KIDSCREEN-52']"

Stigmatizing Attitudes towards Parkinson’s Disease: the role of Openness to Experience and Knowledge about Parkinson’s Disease,"Timal, Amber","['Beugen, S. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Stigmatization is an impactful consequence of living with a chronic illness. Previous studies found that people with Parkinson’s Disease (PwP) also suffer from stigmatization due to their visible uncoordinated motor and/or behavioral symptoms, such as a tremor or an expressionless face. Previous studies also found that personality may be a determinant of stigmatizing attitudes, especially the personality trait openness to experience (OtE). However, OtE as a potential determinant of stigmatizing attitudes towards PwP in the general population has hardly been researched. As people who are high in OtE are more likely to be intellectually curious and more accepting of new ideas, they are also more likely to have more knowledge about, for instance, health and illnesses. Having knowledge about an illness is also linked to having less stigmatizing attitudes towards the illness. Taking these past findings into consideration, the objectives of this study were to 1) examine the extent of stigmatizing attitudes towards PwP in comparison to a healthy individual; 2) identify the potential relationship between OtE and stigmatizing attitudes towards Parkinson’s Disease (PD); and 3) investigate whether this relationship is mediated by having knowledge about PD. This study firstly measured whether PwP evoke more stigmatizing attitudes than a healthy person using vignettes. The results showed that a PwP evokes higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes than a person who appears healthy (Wilks’ Lambda = .34, F(1, 138) = 266.84, p < .001), partial η2 = .66. However, the hypotheses which state a potential negative relationship between OtE and stigmatizing attitudes (all p-values > .05), as well as a potential mediation effect of knowledge about PD on this relationship (all all p-values > .05 and all 95% CI include 0), were rejected. Some of the used measures had poor psychometric properties, so reliability and validity tests are recommended for future use of these measures. This study contributes to PD stigmatization research through the fact that, unlike most previous research, it measured stigmatizing attitudes from the perspective of the general population and, 2) it showed that PwP are indeed more stigmatized compared to a healthy individual. However, more research on OtE and knowledge about PD is needed to determine whether the determinants indeed play a role in stigmatizing attitudes towards PwP.",

Wat vast staat is dat er altijd nauwlettend wordt gekeken naar wat voor een kind het beste is. Dit is afhankelijk van het kind en de context waarin het zich bevind. Met andere woorden, het leveren van maatwerk is daarom erg belangrijk. Het betrof een kleinschalig onderzoek met weinig deelnemers. Het was dus onmogelijk om een inclusief beeld te schetsen van alle factoren waar rekening mee gehouden moet worden. Wat uitsluitend kan worden vastgesteld op basis van dit adviesrapport, is dat vervolgonderzoek nodig is om het belang van verschillende factoren in kaart te brengen. Daarover kunnen op dit moment nog geen uitspraken over worden gedaan. Op basis van een vervolgonderzoek zou eventueel een vast afwegingsschema gerealiseerd kunnen worden.","['Kinderbescherming', 'scheiding', 'contact']"

Characteristics of caregivers and care recipients with dementia that predict positive caregiving experiences: Positive caregiving experiences in the Dutch Namaste sample,"Elzinga, Sijbrigje Rinskje","['Smaling, Hanneke', 'Klaassens, Bernadet']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Background: Informal caregivers are increasingly important in the care for people with dementia. When people with dementia live in a nursing home this involvement often continues. The Namaste Family Care program focuses on including the informal caregiver in the intervention for people with dementia that no longer benefit from regularly organized activities in the nursing home. The aims of the current study are to identify characteristics of informal caregivers and care recipients that influence the report of positive caregiving experiences, and identify the influence of the Namaste Family Care program on caregiver burden and positive caregiving experiences. Methods: Nursing homes were randomly assigned to the Namaste (n=107) or the control (care as usual; n=105) condition. Within the nursing homes informal caregivers (n=212) and their relative with dementia were recruited. Measures included positive caregiving experiences, caregiver burden, demographic characteristics and severity of dementia. Positive caregiving experiences were measured using the Positive Experience Scale (PES; De Boer et al., 2012) and Gain in Alzheimer care INstrument (GAIN; Yap et al., 2009). Caregiver burden was measured using Zarit’s caregiver burden scale (ZBI, 7-item; Zarit et al., 1980) and severity of dementia using the Bedford Alzheimer Nursing Severity-Scale (BANS-S; Volicer et al., 1994). Demographic characteristics included age, gender, relationship to the care recipient, educational background, employment, and religiousness and were measured using the Informal Caregivers Survey–Minimum Data Set (TOPICS-MDS; Lutomski et al., 2013). Questionnaires were filled in by the informal caregiver and nursing staff at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Results: Women reported higher PES scores than men (p < 0.01) at baseline. Higher educated people reported lower GAIN scores (p < 0.01) at baseline. People that perceived religion as very important reported higher GAIN scores (p <0.01) at baseline. Higher education (p = 0.025), age (p = 0.007) and employment (p = 0.03) were predictive for positive caregiving experiences. Caregiver burden was significantly lower (p = 0.017) at follow-up (Mean = 12.27, SD = 4.88) when compared to baseline measures (M = 12.93, SD= 5.62). No significant differences in positive caregiving experiences were found between conditions (Namaste vs. control). The mediation analysis showed no significant mediating characteristic between caregiver burden and positive caregiving experiences. Conclusions: Older and employed people are more likely to report positive caregiving experiences and higher educated people are more likely to report less positive caregiving experiences. Future research should include more follow-up moments to get a more complete image of the perceived influence of the intervention. The current conclusions can be used to identify caregivers ‘at risk’ for negative experiences and burden in their role as caregiver. It also contributes to the evolvement of interventions for people with severe dementia in nursing homes. Samenvatting Er wordt een steeds groter beroep gedaan op mantelzorgers in de zorg voor mensen met dementie. Ook na opname in het verzorgingshuis blijven mantelzorgers vaak zorgdragen voor de familieleden met dementie. Het Namaste Familie programma is opgezet om activiteiten te organiseren voor mensen met gevorderde dementie die niet langer kunnen participeren in de georganiseerde activiteiten van het verpleeghuis. Het Namaste Familie programma betrekt de mantelzorgers actief in deze activiteiten om bezoeken aan de familieleden met dementie leuker en gemakkelijker te maken. De 212 mantelzorgers en hun familielid met dementie zijn willekeurig toebedeeld aan het Namaste Familie programma (107 participanten) of de gewone zorg (105 participanten). Informatie over positieve zorgervaringen van de mantelzorgers, mantelzorger belasting en demografische kenmerken van de participanten werd verzameld tijdens een baseline meting en na 3 maanden. Dit onderzoek richt zich op het vinden van karakteristieken die positieve zorgervaringen voorspellen. Daarnaast is het doel om de invloed van het Namaste Familie programma te vinden op mantelzorger belasting en positieve zorgervaringen. Uit de resultaten bleek dat vrouwen meer positieve zorgervaringen hadden dan mannen. Mensen die religie belangrijk vinden in hun leven hadden meer positieve zorgervaringen dan minder religieuze mensen. Mensen met een hogere opleiding hadden minder positieve zorgervaringen dan gemiddeld en laagopgeleiden. Kenmerken die positieve zorgervaringen kunnen voorspellen zijn, een hoge leeftijd en werkzaam zijn. Een kenmerk dat positieve zorgervaringen kan belemmeren is hoog opgeleid zijn. Verder hadden mensen minder mantelzorger stress na 3 maanden wanneer vergeleken met de baseline meting, maar het programma had hier geen invloed op. Het programma heeft geen duidelijke invloed gehad op positieve zorgervaringen. Ook zijn er geen karakteristieken gevonden die een effect tussen mantelzorger belasting en positieve zorgervaringen beïnvloeden. Conclusies uit dit onderzoek zijn dat oudere mensen met een baan meer positieve zorgervaringen, en hoger opgeleide mensen minder positieve zorgervaringen rapporteren. Door deze conclusies kunnen mantelzorgers die risico lopen op negatieve ervaringen tijdens hun rol worden gevonden en beter worden geholpen. Daarnaast kunnen zorgprogramma’s en interventies rekening houden met deze bevindingen om de mantelzorger te ontlasten van hun zorgen en of ze hulp te bieden bij moeilijke zorgtaken.","['Positive caregiving experiences', 'Dementia', 'Namaste Care', 'Caregiver characteristics']"

This study examined out-group rejection of people of East Asian descent among White mothers, fathers and their children, aged 7-12 years (M = 9.30, SD = 0.90), in the Netherlands. The sample consisted of 80 mothers, 40 fathers and 80 children (47 girls and 33 boys). Parents can be children’s main way to acquire socialization experiences. Parental sensitivity has been appointed as a moderating variable to study the intergenerational transmission of explicit interethnic prejudice between parents and their children. Negative explicit interethnic prejudice was measured among children using a task in which they could distribute cards with words, like ‘mean’ and ‘annoying’, among eight pictures of children with four different ethnic appearances. For this study only the cards given to appearances of the children with East Asian appearances were accounted for. Additionally, maternal and paternal explicit interethnic prejudice against people of East Asian descent were determined using a questionnaire. Furthermore, parental sensitivity was assessed during a parent-child task. Results showed no relation between explicit interethnic prejudice of White children and their mothers and fathers against people with East Asian descent. The results also showed no moderating effect of parental sensitivity. However, it is important to note that the sample used for this study is not representative for the White Dutch community. Nevertheless, multiple studies have shown that the corona pandemic has increased interethnic prejudice against people with an East Asian background on a global scale and in the Netherlands. Future research should elucidate if explicit interethnic prejudice against people of East Asian descent is present among a representative sample of White Dutch people.",

No significant relationship was found between moral development and cognitive empathy, nor did the results show a significant relationship between moral development and cognitive empathy in relation to the reduction of externalising behaviour.

There is also only so much research about the possible difference in perspective on behavioral problems of the child according to the mother and according to the social worker. The aim of this study is to examine to what extent there is a connection between the psychopathology of the mother and the behavioral problems of the child reported by the mother and reported by the involved social worker. Method: The research has been administered to fourteen mother-child pairs in a shelter for women and their involved social workers. During three research visits the mothers has been asked to fill out the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18) regarding the mother’s psychopathology and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) regarding the behavioral problems of the child according to the mother. During these three visits the involved social worker has been asked to fill out the Teacher’s Report Form (TRF) regarding the behavioral problems of the child according to the involved social worker. Results: The results indicate no significant difference between the behavioral problems of the child reported by the mother and the behavioral problems of the child reported by the involved social worker (T1: Z = -.30, p = .77; T2: Z= -1.84, p = .07). Other results indicate a significant relationship between the mother’s psychopathology and the behavioral problems of the child reported by the mother during the first research visit (Rs = .65, p<.05), but a non- significant relationship during the second research visit (Rs = .41, p = .21). Results also show no significant relationship between the mother’s psychopathology and the behavioral problems of the child reported by the involved social worker (T1: Rs = -.10, p = .80; T2: Rs = .03, p = .92). Conclusion: The behavioral problems of the child reported by the mother and the involved social worker do not differ. Also, there is no unambiguous result when it comes to the relationship between the mother’s psychopathology and the behavioral problems that are reported by the mother.

Bipolar disorder is an affective disorder that can cause (temporary) disturbances in mood. It has been theorized and investigated how these episodes effect personality and whether or not cause (sustained) impairments. Personality is stated to be a lifelong stable factor and the current study aimed to research if this applies to patients with bipolar disorder. Method. This study has a within subject design and is a sub-project of the larger longitudinal naturalistic BINCO-study. A total of N = 36 participants completed the NEO-FFI, QIDS and YMRS on both baseline and one-year follow-up measurements. Results. Participants reported no significant changes in personality over time on any of the traits; Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Limitations. Results should be carefully interpreted since the research group was small, personality change was investigated over the course of only one year and there were no control groups included. Conclusions. There were found no statistically significant differences in personality for people with bipolar disorder over the course of one year. This is in line with the theory that personality is stable over time and indicates that people with bipolar disorder are no exception. In future research it would be meaningful to integrate a control group and baseline measurements prior to diagnosis and/or start of treatment.","['Bipolar Disorder', 'Personality', 'Traits', 'State or trait']"
Angst en depressieve symptomen van moeders als voorpeller van gedragsproblemen bij kinderen,"Los, Dionne",['Dr. Sabine van der Asdonk'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Domestic violence is a type of violence that occurs in every country and class. Victims of domestic violence are mainly mothers and children. Many of the mothers that have experienced domestic violence will develop anxiety and depression symptoms. It is known that this has impact on the behavior of their children. However, there is still a lot unknown about the relation of anxiety and depression symptoms of mothers, having experienced domestic violence, with the behavioral problems of young children. The current study has investigated the following question: Is there a relation between anxiety and depression symptoms of mothers that have been victims of domestic violence and the behavioral problems of their children? The first hypotheses was that there would be a relation between anxiety and depression symptoms of the mothers and the child’s behavioral problems. The second hypothesis was that depression of mothers would be a stronger predictor of child behavior problems than the mother’s anxiety. The sample consisted of ten victimized mothers living in Dutch domestic violence shelters. The children were between one and six years old. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18) was used to identify anxiety or depression symptoms by the mothers and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for behavior problems among the children. The results show that none of the hypotheses were confirmed. However, the current research is a step towards follow up research in this age group (children between one and six years) and the target group (women and children who have experienced domestic violence). From here further research can be executed on the impact of depression and anxiety of mothers who have experienced domestic violence and its influence on their children's behavioral problems.",
Neuroticism and Attentional Bias Towards Itch,"Kovacs, Ruben","['Becker, J.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Itch is an unpleasant somatic sensation which acts as a danger signal for threatening stimuli on the skin. Attentional bias is the tendency to prioritize the processing of specific types of stimuli over others. The mind prioritizes threat-related stimuli over neutral stimuli, therefore an attentional bias towards itch is expected. Neuroticism is an individual characteristic that might influence attentional bias towards itch and could be defined as emotional instability, resulting in the tendency to ruminate, experience negative emotions and fear. Previous studies found mixed results regarding both the presence of attentional bias towards itch, and the relation between neuroticism and attentional bias towards itch in healthy participants. Therefore, the first aim was to examine the presence of attentional bias towards itch in healthy individuals. The second aim was to identify the relationship between neuroticism and attentional bias towards itch in healthy individuals. The design of this study is a secondary analysis and used the data from seven earlier studies. The 577 included participants were all healthy individuals between 18 and 35 years old. In order to examine the presence of attentional bias towards itch, the dot-probe task with neutral vs. itch-related words and/or pictures was used. Furthermore, the neuroticism subscale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire revised short scale (EPQ-RSS) was used to measure neuroticism. A multilevel analysis showed no attentional bias towards itch-related stimuli in healthy participants, t(4.941)=-1.252, p=0.266. Furthermore, the effect of neuroticism scores was not significant, indicating that higher neuroticism scores were not associated with more attentional bias towards itch, t(382.636)=-0.825, p=0.410. The inclusion of healthy participants only, the low neuroticism scores and the absence of itch-related goals in the current study could be a reason for not finding an attentional bias towards itch and the relation with neuroticism. However, given the fact that this study is a secondary analysis with a large sample size, it also has to be considered that there simply is no attentional bias towards itch in healthy participants. This study could be used as a guideline for future research, in order to further investigate the relationship between neuroticism and attentional bias towards itch.","['Attentional Bias', 'Itch', 'Neuroticism', 'Healthy Participants', 'Secondary Analysis', 'Multilevel Analysis']"

The present study aimed to explore how user specific characteristics, such as neuroticism, extraversion, and gender, are interconnected with social media use and symptoms of depression in a group-level cross-sectional network based on a student sample of young adults (18 to 30 years old). Participants (N = 430) filled in an online questionnaire measuring symptoms of depression, loneliness, social media use, neuroticism, extraversion, and stress. Regularized partial correlation networks were estimated to produce an aggregate network, and separate networks for men and women. The male and female network (n = 66 each) were compared in terms of structure and overall connectivity. Results showed that symptoms of depression and social media use were sparsely connected and if so, weakly positively related, but the relationship was not directly affected by either neuroticism or extraversion. No statistical differences were found between the male and female network. In sum, we found no evidence for personality and gender affecting the relationship between symptoms of depression and social media use. Future research could use temporal networks to discover potential causal relationships, specifically focusing on idiographic networks to reveal individual differences that would otherwise remain obscured.","['social media', 'depression', 'personality', 'network analysis']"

The present study aimed to investigate whether descriptive norms from the community of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial self-efficacy can predict entrepreneurs’ engagement in work-life balance crafting behaviors. Additionally, the moderating role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in the relationship was examined. The online survey was completed by 145 entrepreneurs. Data showed that descriptive norms positively predicted work-life balance crafting behaviors and entrepreneurial self-efficacy moderated this relationship. Interestingly, the moderation showed that when entrepreneurial self-efficacy was high, the effect of descriptive norms decreased and vice versa. The results implied that entrepreneurs either rely on descriptive norms or on their own entrepreneurial self-efficacy in order to engage in their work-life balance.","['entrepreneurs', 'work-life balance crafting', 'descriptive norms', 'entrepreneurial self-efficacy', 'moderation analysis']"

Recognising Climate Migrants in International Law: Towards a Just Protection Framework,"Schmal, Nina","['Belic, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"While the number of cross-border climate migrants is increasing, their legal protection remains fragmented. Examining the idea of expanding the 1951 UN Refugee Convention to include climate migrants, I conclude that their situation is different from those of political refugees in a morally relevant sense, which entitles them to a new kind of protection. Based on that conclusion, I develop a just protection framework for climate migrants, which sets out migrants’ rights and the duties of states that are associated with granting these rights. The proposed framework particularly focuses on migrants’ agency and procedural justice since both highly contribute to the relocation’s success. To mitigate possible feasibility constraints, because of states’ lack of willingness to implement such a framework, I introduce a market system which allows states to trade the responsibility to host climate migrants in the form of “migrant quotas”, thereby giving them more flexibility. However, since such a market approach would undermine migrants’ agency, I propose a matching system, which matches migrants’ preferences about where to move, with states’ non-discriminatory preferences about what migrants they are willing to accommodate.","['climate change', 'climate justice', 'climate migration', 'refugees', 'internatinal law']"

The Role of Individual Motivation and Transparency in the Acceptability of Nudges Stimulating Vegetarian Options,"Meuldijk, Rebecca","['Gestel, L.

Acceptability of nudges – whether the lay public approves of them – is important for their effectiveness, which is why we aimed to gain more insight into two determinants of nudge acceptability. More specifically, we conducted an online experiment to investigate the role of individual motivation, transparency, and their possible interaction effect on the acceptability of nudges. Doing this, we examined the acceptability of a hypothetical vegetarian default option using three conditions with either no transparency, transparency about the presence of the nudge, or transparency about the purpose of the nudge. Autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation were measured. As a secondary aim, we examined compliance with the nudge for choosing a vegetarian lunch. Overall, the average acceptability score was 78.12%, indicating that a majority of the participants highly approved of the nudge. In addition, 82.40% of the sample indicated to stick with the vegetarian option, showing high effectiveness of the default as well. Our study revealed that autonomous motivation (β = .52, p < .001) and controlled motivation (β = .23, p = .001) were positively associated with nudge acceptability. We did not find a significant relationship between acceptability and transparency. However, our analyses showed a possible interaction effect between controlled motivation and transparency on acceptability; the association between controlled motivation and acceptability may only be significant for nudges that are transparent about their purpose. Building on previous findings the current study showed that motivation is associated with acceptability for behaviour showing a wide variation in motivation, namely meat consumption. Moreover, we contributed to the ethical discussion on the transparency of nudges, and we were the first to find a possible interaction effect between controlled motivation and transparency. Future research on individual motivation and transparency should provide more insight into ways to further improve the acceptability and effectiveness of nudges.","['Nudge', 'default', 'motivation', 'transparency', 'acceptability']"
"The Older, the Wiser? Protection of Self-Worth via Biased Self-Esteem Contingency in Adolescent Development","Bayer, Sabrina",['Dr. Melle van der Molen'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Human beings learn about themselves through social information, meaning that their self-esteem is dependent on self-referencing feedback provided by their social environment. While self-esteem has been comprehensively studied, the concept of self-esteem contingency (i.e., how strongly individuals update their self-esteem in response to social ego-referencing feedback) has yet to be investigated systematically. More specifically, while we have a limited understanding of this construct in adults, its expression in adolescents remains a mystery. However, developmental studies indicate that self-esteem dynamics in adults and adolescents vary, emphasising the importance of investigating this construct in all age groups. Therefore, this study examined whether adults and adolescents show differences in self-esteem contingency by investigating whether self-esteem, age, and sex influence this construct. One hundred and six adults and 64 adolescents were tasked with performing a speech in front of three alleged judges. Participants subsequently evaluated themselves and received pre-generated positive or negative feedback about their performance. Computational modelling was used to assess trial-to-trial changes in self-esteem contingency. Results revealed that adults processed positive and negative feedback very distinctly, while only a small inclination towards such two-dimensional strategies was observed in adolescents. Moreover, the data illustrated a positivity bias in adults with high self-esteem, whereas a negativity bias was found in adolescents with lower self-esteem. Furthermore, adolescents and adults did not differ in self-esteem contingency and proved more contingent on positive than negative feedback. Lastly, we found no impact of the participants’ sex on their self-esteem contingency in either age group. Overall, these findings indicate that adults have developed a self-protective strategy that allows them to incorporate positive information more strongly into their self-view, whereas this skill seems less sophisticated in adolescents.","['age', 'bias', 'feedback monitoring', 'sex', 'self-esteem contingency']"
The relation between catastrophizing about itch and attentional bias towards itch,"Freialdenhoven, Gina","['Becker, J.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Itch is an unpleasant sensation serving as a protection against bodily harm. Attentional bias is the tendency to prioritize the processing of certain information over other information. Attentional bias towards itch is shown, when there is a preference to allocate attention towards itch-related information. Earlier studies which investigated attentional bias towards itch in healthy participants have shown mixed results. This could possibly be explained by individual characteristics, especially catastrophizing about itch is promising, because in the closely related field of pain this seems to be the case. Catastrophizing is an overstated negative interpretation of an experience. Research investigating the relationship between attentional bias towards itch and catastrophizing about itch in healthy participants is limited. Firstly, this study aimed to identify if there was an attentional bias towards itch in healthy participants. Furthermore, this study aimed to identify if there was a positive relationship between catastrophizing about itch and attentional bias towards itch in healthy participants. This study was a secondary analysis, which included seven studies and 577 healthy participants between 18 and 35 years. The studies used the dot-probe task with itch-related words and images to measure attentional bias. Five of the studies used the Pain Catastrophizing Scale adjusted for itch (PCS-I) to measure catastrophizing about itch. The statistical method which was used was a multilevel analysis.   The results demonstrated that healthy participants did not show an attentional bias towards itch, t(4.942) = -1.252, p = .266. Furthermore, the results did not provide evidence for a positive relationship between catastrophizing about itch and attentional bias towards itch in healthy participants, t(471.705) = -.540, p = .589.   That there was no relation found between attentional bias and itch could be because of the healthy sample. This study probably did not find a positive association between catastrophizing about itch and attentional bias towards itch, because there were only low scores on catastrophizing about itch. Possible implications for future studies are that both participants with high and low scores on catastrophizing about itch should be included and that other methods to measure attentional bias towards itch should be used, like the eye-tracking method.","['Itch, attentional bias, catastrophizing']"

Does Discrimination Forge Politically Engaged Immigrant Citizens? A Study on the Paradoxical Relationship Between Discrimination and Protests in the EU,"Shahin, Farah","['Robison, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"As the portion of the foreign-born population continues to grow across the European Union, gaps in overall political participation between immigrants and natives persist. This is a cause for concern to European democracies, specifically regarding their representativeness of the entirety of the population that constitutes them and that they are meant to serve. While scholars have focused on more conventional forms of political participation, this research aims to specifically focus on protests as a non-conventional form of political participation while taking both experienced and perceived discrimination as the main motivators and major determinants of this type of political behavior. Using data from the Survey on Minorities and Discrimination in EU conducted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in 2016, this paper argues that both the experience and perception of discrimination are positively related to participation in protest behaviors amongst citizens of immigrant origin. This paper uses a binary logistic regression with experienced and perceived discrimination as predictor variables, and participation in protest as the response variable, while controlling for six key factors: age, gender, income, generation of immigration, interest in politics, and education. Countries were also used as control variables to counter potential biases in the results from the clustering that often occurs with the use of survey data.","['discrimination', 'perceived discrimination', 'experienced discrimination', 'protest', 'political participation', 'immigrants', 'generation', 'natives']"

Can the CBM maze scores reflect reading comprehension?,"Meinert, Sandra","['Espin, C.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The CBM maze task scores must reflect all skills required for reading for it to be used as a measure of general reading proficiency. The main purpose of the current study was to find out whether the CBM maze task scores reflect reading comprehension because, despite evidence for the reliability and validity of the maze task as a measure of general reading performance, there are questions about the extent to which the maze task scores reflect reading comprehension. The second purpose was to find out whether gender is an influential factor affecting the performance on the maze task. The current study had an experimental design because the format of the maze, which was the within-subjects factor, was manipulated. All 44 participants in the study completed both standard and scrambled mazes. The coherence of the scrambled maze texts was distorted by randomly shuffling the order of the sentences. Thus, if the participants score significantly higher on the standard mazes than on the non-coherent scrambled mazes, it would mean that CBM maze scores reflect reading comprehension. A two-way mixed ANOVA was performed to answer the research questions. The study revealed that participants obtained significantly higher scores on the standard mazes than on the scrambled mazes, supporting the hypothesis that CBM maze scores reflect reading comprehension. A statistically significant main effect of gender was found, however, there was no statistically significant interaction between the gender of the participants and the maze format on the maze scores. More research is needed to find out whether gender plays a significant role in the performance on maze tasks. The finding that CBM maze task scores reflect reading comprehension supports the use of the CBM maze as a measure of general reading proficiency.","['CBM', 'CBM maze', 'maze task', 'curriculum-based measurement', 'reading', 'reading comprehension']"

The Thesis undertakes research into Kenya’s history as a recipient of foreign aid and an abuser of human rights. By examining the different independent variables which make up the Interest Convergence theory this study has found that the theory almost perfectly describes the mechanisms in which the donor-recipient dynamic between Kenya and donor states, and the enduring domestic condition of impunity and weak governmental legitimacy, led to a worsening of physical integrity rights for a significant segment of Kenya’s population. This adds reinforcement to Regilme’s own case studies of South-East Asia where the theory showed explanatory power. This thesis thus concludes that the processes described by the Interest Convergence theory have strong explanatory capabilities over the process in which physical integrity outcomes resulted from the reception of foreign counterterrorism aid in post-9/11 Kenya.","['Kenya', 'Foreign Aid', 'Human Rights', 'Interest Convergence']"

Patient Involvement in Medical Decision-Making During Diagnostic Consultations of Patients with Parkinson’s Disease,"Sonneveld, Jasmijn","['Henrich, J.F.', 'Peerdeman, K.J.', 'Hillen, M.A.', 'Kurpershoek, E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Abstract Introduction: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder which has a big impact on patients’ lives. During diagnostic consultations clinicians inform patients regarding the PD diagnosis and the treatment patients will receive. PD patients report dissatisfaction with the diagnostic consultations, which could be due to a lack of involvement in medical decision-making (MDM). More information about the topics of MDM, about the level of trust in the patients’ clinician and more patient involvement in MDM could therefore improve patient satisfaction. Research on patient involvement in MDM and trust in their clinician was still scarce. However, we think that patient satisfaction could be higher if patient involvement in MDM and trust in their clinician were improved. The first step in researching this was to investigate the MDM topics during diagnostic consultations for PD patients. Specifically, this study aimed to assess the level of patient involvement in MDM during diagnostic consultations and the factors affecting patient involvement. Finally, this study aimed to examine if patients who were more involved in MDM, had higher trust in their clinician. Gaining insight on these topics could empower them to implement more patient involvement and might thus lead to higher satisfaction and patients’ trust in their clinician. Methods: This study was a part of the DiaMove-project which had a prospective observational mixed-methods longitudinal design. Participants (N=26) completed questionnaires regarding characteristics before diagnostic consultations and reported trust in their clinicians (TiOS-sf) afterwards. The first and second diagnostic consultations were video-recorded. Researchers observationally coded topics of medical decisions and measured patient involvement regarding PD medication using the OPTION-12. Statistical analyses consisted of (multiple) regression analyses. Results: Most commonly observed MDM during diagnostic consultations regarding PD concerned whether or not to start PD medication and follow-up appointments. Patients mean involvement in MDM was low (M=14.11; 2.08 – 50.00). The level of patient involvement was higher for women (Cohen’sf 2=.24; p=.02). Age (p=.30) and educational level (p=.66) did not predict patient involvement. Moreover, the mean patient involvement was 4.18 on a scale from 1 to 5, and did not predict patients’ trust in clinicians (p=.90). Conclusion: Clinicians discuss decisions regarding PD medication and follow-up appointments were most frequently discussed during diagnostic consultations. The results suggested that patients’ mean involvement is low in medical decisions regarding PD medication. However, women are more involved. The results of this study should be interpreted cautiously because of a small sample size. It is recommended to repeat this study with a larger sample size. For clinical practice clinicians are advised to involve their patients more in the medical decision-making process.",

Eliminating immigration restrictions and justifying open borders: The issue of immigration through the lens of the liberal egalitarian argument,"Koster, Ime","['Verschoor, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Politicologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"The issue of immigration seems to be more and more present in recent years. To illustrate, the number of migrants has more than tripled over the last fifty years. Whereas the number was estimated around 81.5 million in 1970, five decades later it extended to almost 281 million (IOM, 2022). As the world globalizes and the crises at borders grow, the question of how to deal with migration is becoming beyond complex. There are various reasons for individuals to emigrate and leave their country. Some move voluntary, others leave because their interests are violated, and they do not see another way out. Whereas most are on the run for war, violence, or persecution, some seek to find better opportunities for work, starting a family or education. Yet, these migration trends are not secured by a support base, rather governments increasingly impose restrictions on entrance. Hence, it is questionable what are the rights entitled to migrants, and what are the obligations towards them. The moral importance has been politically and societally debated for years and will continue to be of relevance for years to come. On the one hand, advocates for open borders say that there exists an unjust world in which millions of individuals experience poverty or a shortage of basic needs. On the other hand, supporters of closed borders argue that restrictions are required to prevent the economy, public order and culture that are otherwise at stake. Aside from the political and societal debate that received much empirical attention to immigration issues over the past decades, little attention was embraced in the philosophical debate in the first instance. Luckily this changed over recent years, which created a clash of philosophical understandings arguing either for or against the justification of restricting immigration. Though there are many contradicting arguments, this paper will only focus on a subset of arguments, namely those that have to do with the right to freedom of movement and the value of equality of opportunity. Mostly because commitment to these values is disputed to be essential for open borders. Amid this apparent tension, Carens argues that the right to freedom of movement and the right to equality of opportunity are interrelated. So, to protect the value of equal opportunity, one must also have the right to move to places where one can release oneself to the advantages of opportunities provided both domestically and internationally. Simply, this means that open borders are necessary and restricting immigration cannot be justified (Carens, 1987; Carens, 2013). Carens’ position is often criticized and challenged. Some have questioned the need for an international right to freedom of movement, whereas others emphasize the moral significance of citizenship. The first objection relates to the adequate range of options argument presented by Blake (2001), Miller (2005) and Hosein (2013). The second objection shows that there is ambiguity about using moral equality and political equality interchangeably. This misuse should be attended so that it can be prevented (Blake, 2005; Blake, 2020). The aim of this thesis is to assess whether, and if so, to what extent the right of freedom of movement and the value of equality of opportunity can justify open borders. This will be done by analyzing both the international and national line of reasoning regarding the concept of free movement and equality. In line with the aforesaid, the research question is as follows: Can Carens’ liberal egalitarian defence of open borders overcome the criticisms made by Blake, Hosein and Miller? Before this answer can be established, a number of sub-questions should be posed. To start, this thesis will outline the argument of Carens in favor of open borders. In this chapter (II) Carens’ use of the Rawlsian perspective and his original position will be provided as an attachment for international use. Also, the usefulness of the cantilever strategy will be explained. Second, chapter III substantiates the arguments against open borders. Here, these thoughts will be summarized and compared. To end, this thesis will consider to what extent these objections are valid. This will be critically analyzed in chapter IV, to see if the argument made by Carens still holds. Following this review, I will argue that it does. As will be clear, it is in no way justifiable that the freedoms of a citizen that is luckily born in an advantaged position outweigh the freedoms of an immigrant that is unluckily born in a disadvantaged position. We should all be treated equally, regardless of our backgrounds. As such, immigrants are in fact owed as much as citizens.","['Immigration restrictions, open borders']"
Intolerance of Uncertainty indicates Biased Learning.

Understanding the factors that influence negative biases about the self is critical to intervene and prevent clinical effects. In this study we examine how Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) contributes to the emergence of a negative cognitive bias. We examine the neural correlates of this bias by examining the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN). In addition, learning about the self will be assessed through a computational model of affective updating of self-feelings after receiving performance feedback. The objective was to examine the effect of IU on the valence of FRN as well as affective updating. Ninety-eight participants (mean age = 20, 14 males), participated on two testing days in a self-performance task. Results failed to show that IU predicts FRN valence. Second, it could not be demonstrated that IU is more strongly associated with negative affective updating compared with positive affective updating. In addition, the subscales did not provide the expected finding that the relationship between the cognitive dimension of IU and the behavioral dimension of IU predicted negative affective updating more strongly than positive affective updating. A key message may be that further research and methodological changes are needed to make more detailed statements and predictions about the relationship between IU and FRN and affective updating. This would be important for drawing substantive conclusions about how IU maintains a negative cognitive bias toward the self and how potential interventions might be applied.","['Intolerance of Uncertainty', 'Electroencephalogram (EEG)', 'Feedback-Related Negativity', 'Prediction Error', 'Computational Modeling']"

A big group of children is structurally exposed to (severe) child abuse. Several risk factors can contribute to the development of child abuse within families. This study aims to investigate whether several aspects of parenting are able to predict the severity of child abuse within families. The sample consisted of 627 Dutch parents that have recently experienced child abuse within their family. The parents filled in self-report questionnaires about themselves, their children and their experiences with child abuse under the supervision of student-researchers. Topics covered in the questionnaire were, among others, the experience of child abuse within the family, the way situations were handled, the level of experienced parenting stress, the level of warmth and involvement shown to the child(ren) and the professional help that the family received. Results showed that the level of parenting stress that parents experience is a positive significant predictor of the severity of child abuse within families. The level of warmth and involvement that parents show towards their children appeared to be a negative significant predictor of the severity of child abuse. However, the level of parental warmth and involvement did not seem to play a significant role in the relationship between parenting stress and severity of child abuse. Gender of the parent was a nonsignificant predictor of the severity of child abuse and did not seem to play a significant role in the relationship between parenting stress and severity of child abuse. The results of the study show that parenting stress can be an important risk factor for severe child abuse, while parental warmth and involvement may be an important protective factor. It is important to take these aspects into account when offering professional help and in future research.","['kindermishandeling', 'ernst van kindermishandeling', 'opvoeding', 'opvoedstress', 'ouders', 'warmte', 'betrokkenheid', 'ouderlijke warmte en betrokkenheid', 'genderverschillen', 'genderverschillen in kindermishandeling', 'gezinnen', 'families', 'child abuse', 'severity of child abuse', 'parenting', 'parenting stress', 'warmth', 'involvement', 'parental warmth and involvement', 'gender differences', 'gender differences in child abuse']"

This study aimed to enhance insight in brain metastases patients’ ability to fulfil BADL and IADL, and to investigate the degree to which cognitive impairments associate with both categories of ADL. Methods: Differences in BADL and IADL functioning between patients with and without cognitive impairments were determined. In addition, correlations between a change in cognitive functioning and a change in IADL functioning over three months were calculated. Results: A total of 75 patients were included in this analysis, 36 of whom completed follow-up assessment on at least one cognitive domain. As expected, no difference in BADL between cognitively impaired and unimpaired patients was found. Unexpectedly, no differences were found for IADL and overall cognitive status either. Over time, however, deterioration in some specific neurocognitive domains was associated with a decrease in certain IADL performance, although correlations were weak to moderate (range: ρ = 0.338 - 0.475). Conclusion: This study did not provide evidence that overall impaired cognition influences IADL functioning but did indicate a positive association between executive functioning and IADL performance. Further research is needed to better quantify the association between cognitive and ADL functioning in brain metastases patients, and to assess whether this finding holds true for patients with other types of brain tumors.",

Participants included fifty-three children diagnosed with ASD between the ages of 4 and 13 years. Multi-motion receivers measured PA levels and (1) video observations and (2) proximity sensors (RFID) resulted in data for SI. Results showed that, during recess, a significant difference was found between sedentary activity and light-to-moderate and vigorous activity. More time was spent in sedentary activity. Also, according to the proximity sensors, autistic children spent more time in interaction than alone. However, for the video observations, autistic children spent more time alone than in interaction, but this difference was insignificant. A positive correlation was found between vigorous activity and interaction time (RFID). Supporting the notion that PA is positively correlated to SI. Further research is necessary to minimize the limitations and to better understand the needs regarding PA and SA in autistic children during recess.","['autism', 'children', 'physical activity', 'social interaction', 'recess', 'school']"

This study investigates specific profiles of sensory processing difficulties (SPDs) in children with two rare neurocutaneous syndromes, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1); and whether SPDs can be predicted by ASD, ADHD, intellectual/developmental quotient (IQ/DQ) or use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). [Method] SPDs were assessed in 60 children with TSC and 211 with NF1 using the Dutch version of the Short Sensory Profile (SSP-NL), between 2010 and September 2022. Assessments were part of routine clinical care at the Erasmus MC Sophia Children’s Hospital, in the Netherlands. To illustrate the SPDs profiles for each syndrome, children aged 2-18 were compared to the Dutch normative sample of typically-developing children. Then, the prediction of SPDs from the clinical diagnoses, intellectual functioning, and AEDs were assessed using two separate hierarchical regression analyses. [Results] In both syndromes, most SPDs were seen with ‘’Low Energy/Weak’’, ‘’Tactile Sensitivity’’, and ‘’Visual/ Auditory Sensitivity’’. Children with TSC also showed SPDs with ‘’Auditory filtering’’, and children with NF1 with ‘’Taste/Smell Sensitivity’’ and ‘’Underreponsiveness/Seeking Sensation’’. In both syndromes, the presence of clinical diagnoses (ASD, ADHD, or both) and lower intellectual functioning were predictive of more SPDs, as well as the use of AEDs in children with TSC. [Conclusions] Overall, more SPDs were found in children with TSC or NF1 than in the normative sample. A partial overlap in SPDs profiles was found between the two syndromes, with some differences. Findings from this study contribute to the research about sensory processing in general and specifically in neurocutaneous syndromes, potentially helping professionals to improve treatment and adapt advice for caretakers.","['sensory profile, tuberous sclerosis complex, neurofibromatosis type 1, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder']"

Clinical Predictors of Quality of Life in Nursing Home Residents with Dementia,"Heidemann, Jana","['Smaling, H.J.A', 'Ruitenberg, M.F.L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background This study aimed to identify predictors of quality of life (QoL) in nursing home residents (NHR) with dementia, specifically examining the influence of a body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 30, gender, pain severity, and challenging behavior under consideration of the biopsychosocial model. Additionally, it evaluated whether challenging behavior severity mediates the relationship between pain severity and QoL. The study findings can inform targeted interventions aimed at improving QoL in NHR with dementia. Methods Data for this cross-sectional study were derived from the baseline measures of the Dutch Namaste study (NTR5692) resulting in 226 participants (27% male) with a mean age of 86 years (SD=7). Information on QoL, pain severity, and challenging behavior severity was taken from the QUALID, PAINAD, and NPI-Q measures. For the control variable dementia severity, data from the BANS-S measure were derived. Information on gender and BMI were taken from data supplied by the NHR ́s physicians and primary nurses. Three regression analyses were performed to determine whether each higher severity of pain, challenging behavior, and female gender would predict lower QoL. Two multiple regression analyses were performed to determine whether pain was the strongest predictor of QoL and whether a BMI between 20 and 30 would predict higher QoL than values outside the range. To establish whether higher challenging behavior severity was a mediator between pain and QoL, a mediation analysis was performed. Results Higher severity of challenging behavior was a significant predictor of lower QoL in NHR with dementia (R2 = .45, F(2, 212) = 86.04, β = .69, p < .01, 95% CI [-.57, .81]), but it did not mediate the relationship between pain and QoL. Female gender, higher pain severity, and a BMI range of 20 to 30 were not predictors of QoL. Conclusion The findings highlight the importance of intervention programs that target challenging behavior to improve and maintain QoL in NHR with dementia. More research in this area is needed. In addition, it should be established whether different BMI scores can be predictors of QoL.","['Quality of life, nursing home residents, dementia, pain, challenging behavior, gender, BMI']"
"A Test of the Recovery Paradox and Its Alleviation: Bi-Directionality Between Workload, Anxiety, and Physical Activity","Dontsova, Zlata","['Vries, J.D. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Based on the recovery paradox (RP) paradigm, the present study investigated a bi-directional (i.e., “typical” and “reverse”) relationship between employees’ job stressors appraised as threatening, strain reactions, and engagement in recovery activities. Namely, it was expected that there would be a positive relationship between one’s appraisal of workload as a threat stressor and one’s level of anxiety, and a negative relationship between one’s level of anxiety and one’s engagement in physical activity. Furthermore, the present study investigated the potential of job resources to alleviate the RP. Namely, it was expected that the “typical” relationship of the RP would be weaker for individuals who have higher levels of social (i.e., supervisor) support. These expectations were tested in a sample of 227 Dutch-speaking employees by using a weekly longitudinal study design consisting of an intake survey administered once and a subsequent questionnaire administered three times with a one-week time interval. Longitudinal effects were examined by using (moderated) mediation statistical analyses performed with the SPSS-extension PROCESS. Contrary to the expectations, analyses showed that although the relationships between the study’s variables trended in the expected directions, no significant bi-directional relationship was found between one’s appraisal of workload as a threat stressor, level of anxiety, and engagement in physical activity. In addition, no significant influence of supervisor support on the “typical” relationship between the variables was shown. Nevertheless, according to the expectations, analyses showed a significant effect of one’s level of anxiety on one’s appraisal of workload as a threat stressor (p = .012). This finding suggests that employee strain reaction impacts employee perception of their job stressors. With the present study being among the first ones to examine the complete indirect relationships between the RP components and the alleviating effect of supervisor support on the “typical” relationship of the RP, I discuss the contributions of the study’s findings to the existing literature and how it can encourage further investigation of the RP and its alleviation to promote employee well-being.","['recovery paradox', 'workload', 'anxiety', 'physical activity', 'supervisor support']"

Does Itch Catastrophising Affect Men and Women with Chronic Itch Differently?,"Broekhof, Jelline","['Becker, J.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Itch is an unpleasant sensation that induces scratching and is often accompanied by psychological distress. Chronic itch, such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis (eczema), has a lifetime prevalence of 22% and often carries a marked psychological burden. Catastrophising of itch symptoms can inhibit coping, increase scratching and lower mood, which maintains scratching and creates a vicious cycle. The relationship between sex, gender and chronic itch is not well understood. More broadly, sex and gender differences often go overlooked – this is called the gender data gap. Therefore, the first research question was, to what extent does catastrophising affect the quality of life of patients with chronic itch? The second research question was, to what extent is there a difference in how catastrophising affects the quality of life of men and women with chronic itch? 27 patients with chronic itch (psoriasis or atopic dermatitis) filled in the Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS) adjusted for itch and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) online. Contrary to expectations, a simple linear regression analysis showed that catastrophising was not a significant predictor of quality of life. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis showed that catastrophising does not affect the quality of life of men and women differently. Importantly, the results are limited by low sample size, lack of control variables and the use of convenience sampling. Further research into the relationship between itch catastrophising, quality of life and gender could greatly impact the lives of patients with chronic itch.","['chronic itch', 'catastrophising', 'gender', 'gender data gap', 'itch', 'puritus', 'quality of life', 'psoriasis', 'atopic dermatitis']"
Verdwaald? Stress en trait anxiety hebben geen invloed op herkenning en herinnering van landmarks tijdens exploratie,"Gutker de Geus, Daantje",['J.

Een van de manieren om dit geheugenproces in te delen, is door onderscheid te maken tussen herkenning, het hebben onthouden zonder context, waarbij ook de context is onthouden. Eerder onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat stress en trait anxiety invloed hebben op herkenning en herinnering, echter is deze invloed nog niet getest bij landmarks. In de huidige studie werd dit onderzocht door 37 participanten een exploratietaak uit te laten voeren in een virtuele omgeving waarin landmarks waren geplaatst. De helft van de participanten kreeg van tevoren stress opgewekt door een zingtaak uit te voeren in de Sing-a-Song Stress Test. Na de exploratietaak werd middels de Remember / Know paradigm getest in hoeverre landmarks herkend en herinnerd waren en werd de Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory afgenomen. De Sing-a-Song Stress Test bleek een effectieve manipulatie voor het induceren van verhoogde stressniveaus. Er werd geen verschil gevonden tussen de hoge- en lage-stressconditie in herkenning en herinnering van landmarks, als ook geen verschil in herkenning en herinnering tussen lage en hoge trait anxiety. Vervolgonderzoek wordt aanbevolen via fMRI hippocampusactiviteit te meten gedurende het Remember / Know paradigm, om meer grip te krijgen op het al dan niet onafhankelijk optreden van herkenning en herinnering onder invloed van stress en trait anxiety. Daarnaast wordt aangeraden te onderzoeken of meer opvallende landmarks, door bijvoorbeeld emotionele waarde, beter worden herkend en/of herinnerd onder stress dan wel trait anxiety.","['Exploration behavior', 'recognition', 'remembering', 'trait anxiety', 'memory', 'spatial memory']"
Executive functions in typically developing young children: The influence of motor performance on working memory,"Hoogenboom, Lieke","['Houdt, C. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Research on executive functions in young children is lacking and inconsistent due to inadequate tests for this age group, although important since the development of executive functions is critical for behavioral, cognitive, and social development throughout life. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between motor performance and working memory, a core executive function, in typically developing young children. In addition, this study investigated whether age and socio-economic status moderated this relationship. In this cross-sectional study, a test battery developed by Utrecht University was used to measure young children’s working memory (n = 187) during a house visit. Motor performance, including fine and gross motor skills, was measured with ten questions from the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), filled out by the parent. Socio-economic status was measured by asking about the highest achieved education. Children were recruited by master students in their own personal network and via several institutions for young children (e.g. day-care, preschool, etc.). Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were performed to answer the research questions. Results revealed a significant positive correlation between fine motor skills and working memory in typically developing young children. However, no significant correlations between other aspects of motor performance and working memory were found. In addition, there is no evidence for a moderating effect of either age or socio-economic status in the relationship between any aspect of motor performance and working memory in typically developing young children. These outcomes have an important implication in research, offering more evidence for a correlation between fine motor skills and working memory at a young age. Additionally, these outcomes give an indication of how factors can influence the development of executive functions.",
Computational Imprecision in Value-Based Learning and Decision-Making: Investigating the Potential Role of the Noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus System,"Aleksic, Mladena","['Wurm, F.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Human decision-making in the context of value-based learning considerably deviates from the premise to always maximise short-term reward. This sort of behavioural variability has been attributed to exploration during the choice process and has been linked to the locus coeruleusnoradrenaline (LC-NA) system. A recent computational account implementing a “noisy” reinforcement learning (RL) model provides evidence that computational imprecision during the learning process contributes to behavioural variability in decision-making as well. In the present study, the role of the LC-NA system in modulating learning imprecision has been investigated, using a multi-modal approach including the newly developed noisy RL model, a double-blind pharmacological manipulation, and EEG. The responses of thirty participants in a decision-making task were investigated during two experimental sessions in which either atomoxetine, a NA reuptake inhibitor, or placebo was administered, and the model fit of the noisy RL model was tested against the classical RL model without learning imprecision parameter. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find evidence for a modulatory role of the LC-NA system of learning imprecision. However, in line with our expectations, increased NA levels did not impact exploratory behaviour either. Crucially, the noisy RL model outperformed the classical RL model assuming exact learning and learning imprecision led to a significant number of non-maximising decisions contributing to behaviour variability. Moreover, the exploratory EEG analyses on potential underlying mechanisms of learning imprecision suggest learning noise to emerge broadly during feedback processing, rather than within a certain time window. The current study provides further evidence for the importance of computational imprecision during value-based learning.",

Productivity uncertainty refers to a state of not knowing the effectiveness of one's efforts in reaching common goals or producing public goods. It was hypothesized that, under productivity uncertainty, risk seekers would contribute more while risk avoiders would contribute less. Additionally, it was hypothesized that that in uncertain conditions where a potential loss is introduced, the contribution of participants would decrease regardless of their risk preference. We tested the hypotheses by letting participants complete a series of 5 PGG where we had one baseline game without uncertainty and 4 where we added productivity uncertainty by manipulating the possible outcomes. The last 2 games had the potentially of loss added. In conclusion, based on the study results hypothesis 1 was confirmed if there was no potential of loss involved. Hypothesis 2 was confirmed as the possibility of unproductivity of a contribution lowered the contribution by both seekers and risk avoiders.",

Yet, the symptom interrelations between PTSD and dissociation have not been disentangled. The timing and type of traumatic events have been suggested to play crucial roles in the comorbidity between PTSD and dissociative symptoms. Therefore, partial correlations between PTSD, dissociative symptoms, and adverse childhood maltreatment (ACE) were investigated in two regularized partial correlation networks. Online self-report responses from participants (N = 495) of an overarching study on domestic violence were used. Symptoms and maltreatment types were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist DSM-5, the Dissociation Experience Scale-II, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form. The first network analysis included nine nodes (four PTSD symptoms, three dissociation symptoms, two assumed confounders). The second analysis additionally considered five ACE types. The network exploration revealed few and weak connections between PTSD and dissociation. Regardless of the bridge strength, absorption/imagination and hyperarousal showed to be hubs linking PTSD and dissociative symptoms. Adding ACE barely changed the bridges between PTSD and dissociative symptoms. Amnesia appeared to be a hub for connecting dissociative symptoms to ACE. Emotional abuse was the only maltreatment type connected to the PTSD symptoms. These preliminary findings suggest that PTSD and dissociation are largely independent constructs and hint towards separate diagnostic entities. The study was limited by the sample’s subclinical symptoms and maltreatment scores. This limitation may also be partly responsible for the poorly connected network. Prospective studies with clinical samples are needed to further investigate the interplay between PTSD, dissociation, and ACE.","['PTSD', 'dissociation', 'adverse childhood events', 'trauma syndrome', 'regularized partial correlation network analysis']"

The association between the predictors (Condition, PIFS, and Interaction PIFS Condition) and the dependent variable, hard trial performance, was investigated using regression analysis. None of the predictors significantly predicted the variation in hard trials, according to the data (p >.05). Hard trial scores were not significantly explained by the Condition, PIFS, or the interaction of PIFS and Condition (R2 =.019, p =.289). Additionally, the conditional effects study showed that the interaction term (Interaction PIFS Condition) did not significantly contribute to the prediction of hard trials (p >.05).

Investigating the Effects of Nocebo Information and Clinician-Expressed Empathy on Breast Cancer Patients’ Psychological Outcomes,"Gröschel, Lara",['Liesbeth van Vliet'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Background: An innovative approach to improving poor psychological outcomes in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy is via clinician-patient communication strategies such as educating patients about the nocebo effect (i.e., nocebo information) and using reassurance of non-abandonment (i.e., clinician-expressed empathy). Research suggests that nocebo information may improve some outcomes in non-cancer settings, but its effectiveness on psychological outcomes in cancer settings remains uncertain. Clinician-expressed empathy has repeatedly been shown to improve short-term psychological outcomes in cancer patients, although the long-term effects require further investigation. Moreover, potential interaction effects between nocebo information and clinician-expressed empathy observed in non-cancer settings warrant exploration in cancer care. Objective: To investigate the distinct and combined effects of nocebo information and clinician-expressed empathy on breast cancer patients’ psychological outcomes (main outcome: state anxiety) over time and at short term when undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: In this 2x2 clinical proof-of-principle randomized controlled trial, female breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy for the first time viewed 1 out of 4 role-played information videos, wherein the levels of nocebo information (present vs. absent) and empathy (present vs. absent) were varied. Using stepwise multilevel analyses and two-way analyses of variance, we investigated the videos’ effects on participants’ psychological outcomes over time and at short term. Results: Among the 19 participants, over time, nocebo information showed trends (p > .05) to improve state anxiety but worsen self-efficacy and distress, and empathy showed trends to worsen state anxiety, self-efficacy, as well as distress. When combined, nocebo information and empathy significantly and largely worsened self-efficacy (β = -3.21; p = .009). At short term, both nocebo information and empathy showed trends (p > .05) to worsen feelings of satisfaction and trust. Conclusion: Although these unexpected and mixed findings are preliminary, they highlight the need to fully understand the potential benefits and risks associated with clinician-patient communication strategies in cancer care.","['breast cancer, clinician-patient communication, empathy, information videos, nocebo information, psychological outcomes']"

A total of 50 participants engaged in a walk within the Singelpark and provided responses to questionnaires before, during, and after the walk. Results revealed that there was no significant relationship between the naturalness of the park and the potential for psychological restoration or social mindfulness. However, perceived beauty was significantly related to the potential for psychological restoration. These findings suggest that further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms through which beauty and naturalness influence restoration.","['natural environments, social mindfulness, psychological restoratioon']"
Explaining therapists’ advice regarding placement decisions for maltreating families in family residential clinics: the contribution of case characteristics,"Riesen, Celina","['Asdonk, S. van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Decision-making regarding out-of-home placement can be regarded as a high-stake decision with negative consequences for the child when erroneous decision-making occurs, and in some cases even when the non-erroneous decision is taken. Paradoxically, scant research is available on what contributes to decisions regarding out-of-home placement. The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the main factors that contribute to decision-making, specifically focusing on case characteristics. In doing so, the paper draws on two important theories within decision-making, namely the Decision-Making Ecology, and the capacity-to-change model. The sample consisted of maltreating families in Dutch family residential clinics awaiting either a placement decision or a reunification decision (N = 56). Three different case characteristics in the form of overarching factors were investigated. Firstly, the parent factor (psychopathology and parenting stress), which was measured through self-report questionnaires. Secondly, the child factor consisting of active externalizing behavior and disobedient behavior, which was measured through observations. Lastly, the parenting capacity factor (the change in sensitivity, intrusiveness, and disciplining behavior during the residency in the family residential clinic), also measured through observations. Moreover, the role of a previous out-of-home placement measure within the family was researched. Multiple logistic regression models showed that solely the parent factor (psychopathology and parenting stress) marked a statistically significant contribution to the advice regarding the decision of out-of-home placement. The child factor and parenting capacity factor did not make a significant contribution to the advice regarding this decision and neither did previous out-of-home placement moderate the relationship between the case characteristics investigated and this decision. Future research should focus on all factors of the Decision-Making Ecology and their interplay, preferably in a wider sample of families entering the youth protection system.","['out-of-home placement', 'decision-making', 'placement', 'case characteristics', 'parent factor', 'child factor', 'parenting capacity', 'capacity-to-change']"

Following a systematic search, a meta-regression analysis was conducted, including a total of 12 studies. Overall, PMI was found to be an effective intervention for the social, communication, and play skills of children and adolescents with autism. The present study also found that both direct instruction and video modeling are appropriate peer training strategies to employ in PMI, and that the effectiveness of this intervention is not dependent on the type of training that is delivered to the peer workers. Future research is recommended on this area, as several limitations and data inconsistencies were found. Future studies should consider higher sample sizes, reporting follow-up and generalization data, and exploring potential mediators and moderators.","['peer-mediated interventions', 'peer training', 'autism', 'children', 'meta-analysis']"
Detecting subgroups with differently-shaped trajectories using Generalized Additive Model trees,"Marr, Susanne","['Fokkema, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Decision trees are a popular tool for subgroup detection. It is possible to expand these trees by not only predicting a group mean or majority class in a final node, but whole models. This approach has been further developed in the form of model-based recursive partitioning (MOB): Within this framework, every terminal node contains its own fitted parametric model. Parametric models, however, require prior specification of the shapes they are supposed to model. Often, however, the exact shape is not known beforehand and should be learned from the data. A new, semi-parametric method, Generalized Additive Model trees (GAM trees), combines the properties of decision trees to detect subgroups with the ability of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to flexibly model non-linear trajectories. The challenge with this new method is to find the proper parameter stability tests that are part of the MOB algorithm. Our solution to this is using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate smoothing spline models. This allows for a mixed-effects model definition of smoothing splines, where both fixed and random effects can be modelled. In the parameter stability tests, we use mixed-effects model derivatives that have been previously developed for mixed-effects models. These derivatives allow for computing case- and cluster-level scores with respect to fixed- as well as random-effects parameters of mixed-effects models, taking advantage of the fact that smoothing splines can be formulated as mixed-effects models, and REML can be used for parameter estimation. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of GAM trees against that of three types of Generalized Additive (Mixed) Models (GA(M)Ms), and that of Generalized Linear Mixed Model trees (GLMM trees). Using six empirical longitudinal datasets on the development of reading and math skills, depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction over time, we employ 10 iterations of cross-validation to get an average mean square error (MSE) as well as the variance explained in the outcome, R2, for each method per dataset. After examining descriptive differences, we formally test for significant differences with one-way ANOVAs. For five datasets, GAM trees performed better than or equal to the other methods. In two of those cases, the differences were statistically significant. For one dataset, GAM trees performed worse, albeit non-significantly, than the other methods. Overall, these are promising initial findings that speak in favour of the ability of GAM trees to detect relevant subgroups in non-linear trajectories.","['GAM trees', 'Generalized Additive Models', 'Decision Trees', 'MOB', 'REML']"

METHODS: Participants were trained to perform a brain-computer interface (BCI) task, which included a visual oddball paradigm task. Nine participants performed this task during parabolic flight. Statistic analyses assessed the amplitude and latency of the P3 event-related potential (ERP). RESULTS: Results revealed no significant differences for P3 Amplitude nor Latency in the 0G condition versus the 1G condition. The amplitude for oddball stimuli was significantly higher than the amplitude for standard stimuli in both 1G and 0G. CONCLUSION: There needs to be greater consensus and understanding concerning the effects of microgravity on cognitive performance and ERPs. The data presented here does not verify that short bouts of microgravity could enhance nor diminish neuro-behavioral performance. It does confirm that the visual-based oddball paradigm is feasible in microgravity conditions.","['P3', 'P300', 'ERP', 'event-related potential', 'amplitude', 'latency', 'microgravity', 'parabolic flight', 'simulated weightlessness', 'visual oddball', 'oddball paradigm', 'attention', 'cognition']"

This method uses generated data (of size Ngen) based on the training data and the Posterior Predictive Distribution (PPD) of a highly accurate, poorly interpretable Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model to train a new PPD-based BA GLMM tree. When generated sample size Ngen is 1 time the size of the original dataset, BA trees were more accurate or similarly accurate as GLMM trees. Ngen can be increased for more interpretability at the cost of a small decrease in accuracy. When generating data for traditional BA trees, setting permutation parameter palt = 0 provides best results in terms of accuracy and interpretability. PPD-based BA trees were more accurate than traditional BA trees on five out of seven datasets, was outperformed on one, and was equivalent on one, suggesting that PPD-based BA trees generally provide more accurate results than traditional BA trees.","['Born-Again Tree Model', 'BART', 'Interpretable Machine Learning']"

This study fills a research gap by being the first to directly compare two contemporary imagery script procedures to evaluate their feasibility. We hypothesized an audio-scripted imagery procedure to lead to higher fear expression (heart rate, skin conductance, subjective distress) than an imagery-only script. A moderating effect of the vividness of the stressful memory on fear expression was also hypothesized. In a between-subjects design, participants (N = 37) were sorted into two conditions and were interviewed regarding a stressful life experience. Fear expression was measured during baseline and imagery. Contrary to expectations, both procedures led to a similar increase in fear expression. Crucially, the audio-scripted imagery procedure might be especially effective for participants with a high baseline vividness of the stressful memory which has implications for future PTSD research. Upcoming studies should investigate changes to the script procedures to facilitate comparison between scripts and further explore the effect of script procedures on high-vividness participants.","['script-driven imagery, PTSD, vividness, audio script']"
Reciprocal friendships and peer interactions on schoolyards of autistic and non-autistic children,"Cárdenas Ríos, Jimena",['Dr Yung-Ting Tsou'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Socialisation for children and adolescents is fundamental for their well-being and overall development. Schools are where children spend most of their day, so it is important to inquire about their peer interactions and reciprocal friendships in the schoolyard. Autistic children have shown to have smaller social networks than non-autistic children. Therefore, exploring how reciprocal friendships can be beneficial for their peer interactions may deliver opportunities to create more inclusive environments at schoolyards. The current study was a cross-sectional correlational design. It was part of a longitudinal study which aimed to create an inclusive environment for students outside the classroom. The sample consisted of 99 Dutch speaking participants, 47% autistic and 53% non-autistic children with ages ranging between 8 and 14 years old (M = 10.8, SD = 1.2). The sample included 35% females and 66% males, who attended 21 different classes in two special education primary schools in The Netherlands. Data was collected during break time using proximity sensors (RFID) to measure peer interactions on the playground. The variables analysed were the total interaction time and the number of interaction partners. For measuring reciprocal friendships, a self-report to nominate their best friends was used. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) performed showed that autistic children had lower levels of reciprocal friendships (F(4, 94) = 3.98, p = .049) but a higher number of interaction partners (F(4, 94) = 4.19, p = .043) than non-autistic children. Nonetheless, there were no differences between the interaction time for both groups (F(4, 94) = 0.74, p = 0.391). Also, hierarchical regression analysis conducted showed that reciprocal friendship gave a significant contribution to total interaction time (β = .237, t = 2.35, p =.021), but did not influence the number of interaction partners on the school playground. In conclusion, non-autistic and autistic children were different in reciprocal friendships and peer interactions on the playground. As one of the biggest challenges for autistic children is to engage in social interactions, knowing that friend’s support can increase opportunities to interact with others may contribute to create more inclusive environments that enable their overall development.","['reciprocal friendships', 'peer interactions', 'autism', 'children', 'special education']"

Based on research in pain, the genes COMT rs4680, FAAH rs324420, and OPRM1 rs1799971 were identified to investigate their potential role in the extent to which placebo and nocebo effects on itch were induced in healthy individuals. This cross-trial analysis included 58 in the placebo and 127 healthy genotyped participants in the nocebo analysis from three studies. Itch stimuli were elicited electrically or with histamine, and placebo and nocebo effects were induced with specific learning processes, i.e., conditioning with verbal suggestion, or antihistamine was classically conditioned. COMT met/met variants demonstrated significantly higher placebo effects on itch compared to val/val variants, 95% BCa CI [0.026, 1.263]. No other significant differences were found between the variants of COMT, FAAH and OPRM1 and placebo or nocebo effects on itch. Knowledge on genetic predictors of placebo and nocebo effects on itch could help to improve clinical trial design and allow clinicians to tailor itch-reducing treatments such that they optimize treatment efficacy. Future research should focus on a replication study with a larger cohort and homogenous itch-inducing methods as well as learning processes to verify the studied relationship.","['itch, learning, COMT rs4680', 'FAAH rs324420', 'OPRM1 rs1799971, placebome, nocebome']"

Functional Connectivity Changes Following Ketamine Administration: Implications for Understanding Acute Antidepressant Drug Action,"Lucas, Jasper","['Rover , M. de']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (research) (MSc),Research master thesis,en,"Introduction: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’s) are an effective treatment for many depressed patients, but their disadvantages include a wide range of side effects and a delayed treatment response. In contrast, subanesthetic doses of ketamine show acute antidepressant effects. Previous functional connectivity findings implicate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), key areas of the default mode network (DMN), in ketamine’s acute antidepressant effect. In addition, psilocybin has also shown acute antidepressant effects with a potential role for the claustrum, an area functionally connected to the DMN. However, pharmacological fMRI findings concerning acute antidepressant drug action may be moderated by the decision to include or exclude a controversial preprocessing step called global signal regression (GSR). In this study, we investigated ketamine’s acute effects on functional connectivity patterns in the brain in order to probe the underlying mechanism of its acute antidepressant effects. Hypotheses: Ketamine acutely decreases functional connectivity between the vmPFC and PCC and between the DMN and claustrum. In addition, these findings will not be affected by the decision to include or exclude GSR. Method: Twenty volunteers were administered ketamine as well as a placebo on separate days in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. We acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data before, during and immediately after the acute phase of administration. Results: No differences in functional connectivity patterns were found between ketamine and placebo. These results were unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of GSR. Conclusion: It remains unclear which changes in functional connectivity occur in the acute phase of ketamine administration. Future research should investigate the influence of GSR on fMRI findings.","['depression', 'major depressive disorder', 'ketamine', ""SSRI's"", 'antidepressants', 'antidepressant drug action', 'fMRI', 'functional connectivity']"
The Effect of Experimenter Gender on Female Negotiators’ First Offer and Concession Size in a Three-Person Online Negotiation.,"Yaakoub, Esma","['Steinel, W.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Gender differences in negotiation behaviours and outcomes have been widely studied, reflecting societal stereotypes. These stereotypes associate men with assertiveness and women with agreeableness. Such gendered socialization has led to distinct negotiation styles, often influenced by contextual factors like negotiation roles and subjects. Additionally, balancing negotiators’ gender influences behaviours; women tend to be more prosocial when negotiating with women. Research shows that experimenter gender can activate stereotypes in this same way, impacting negotiation behaviours. However, there is limited understanding of how experimenter gender affects female negotiation behaviour. This study examines the influence of experimenter gender and social motive on female participants' first offers and concession size. Employing a 2 x 2 design, female participants (N = 97) engaged in an online, chat-based negotiation, had a pro-social or individual motive, and a female or male experimenter. While no significant effects emerged for the independent variables on first offer, social motive significantly influenced concession size on the first negotiation issue. A significant interaction effect of social motive and experimenter gender was found for the first negotiation issue as well. These findings suggest that experimenter gender alone does not affect female negotiation behaviour, but social motives and their interaction with experimenter gender does. Contextual and demographical factors need to be considered when researching the interplay between experimenter gender and female negotiation behaviour. The results of this study can be used by professionals, as well as negotiation trainers and women in general to increase awareness and decrease the effect of gender stereotypes on female negotiation behaviour.","['experimenter gender, social motives, negotiation behaviour, first offer and concession size, female gender stereotypes, online negotiation']"

Effectiveness of monetary incentives on weight loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Šimundić, Maja Anđela",['Milon Van Vliet'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objectives The previous research suggests that monetary incentives increase the effectiveness of weight loss interventions, however, this data is limited and more research is necessary to make a definite conclusion. This systematic review with meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of interventions based on monetary incentives in promoting weight loss or behavioral change that will lead to weight loss. Methods Online databases (n=7) were searched in order to find (quasi-) randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of interventions based on monetary incentives on weight loss in an adult population. Eligibility of potentially relevant articles was assessed based on title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening. Data was extracted from the study and participants' characteristics, and weight outcomes. Random-effects meta-analysis was done in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, comparing weight change outcome measures between the baseline and the final time point while the incentive was provided. The risk of bias was also assessed. Results The results of the meta-analysis with 18 studies including 21 comparisons show a small but significant effect in favor of incentive intervention (SMD = -0.25, p < .001, 95% CI [-0.39 to -0.11]. These findings show that participants in the incentive groups lost more weight, compared to those in the control group. Statistical analysis indicated that publication bias was not present, while qualitative assessment of the risk of bias was overall low or unclear. Conclusion Interventions based on monetary incentives are found to be moderately effective in encouraging (behavioral change that leads to) weight loss. Therefore, monetary incentives have a great potential for promoting behaviors that ultimately improve the health and well-being of healthy, overweight, and obese individuals.","['weight-loss interventions', 'monetary incentives']"
The effect of chronotype on visuo-spatial working memory performance,"Koot, Dennis","['Band, G.P.H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Studies on chronotype have found a significant cognitive difference between morning and evening types, with evening types generally showing better cognitive performance. These findings are not universally replicated, making further investigation important. Furthermore, smaller subcomponents of cognition have not been researched much before in relation to chronotype. The purpose of this study is to shed light on the underexplored relationship between chronotype and visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM). Moreover, this study examines the effects of age and time of day as potential moderators in this relationship. The study uses the unique approach of using smartphone tappigraphy data, which refers to the timing of day to day smartphone touchscreen events, to infer sleep midpoints on free days as an indicator of chronotype. Data was sourced from an ongoing Age Study, and VSWM performance of participants (N = 299) was measured through the Corsi block tapping test. Results show a significant positive linear relationship of later sleep midpoint times and higher Corsi span scores, suggesting that a later chronotype is associated with better VSWM performance, as predicted in our hypothesis. Moreover, no significant moderation effect of age and time of day was found. Limitations and implications of these findings are more thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, benefits and limitations of the use of tappigraphy data as an assessment tool for chronotype are addressed","['Chronotype, visuo-spatial working memory, tappigraphy']"
The moderating role of depression in the relationship between fatigue and processing speed in multiple sclerosis,"Händel, Letícia","['Hulst, H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system that affects an estimate of 2.8 million people worldwide. Fatigue, impairments in processing speed, and depression are common symptoms reported by People with MS (PwMS). However, the relationship between these symptoms is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate this relationship and examine the (in)stability of fatigue levels over time in PwMS. The study utilized a longitudinal, retrospective cohort design and included participants diagnosed with MS (n= 141) who attended a specialized clinic in Overpelt, Belgium. Seventy-three percent of the sample was female, with a mean age of 51.88 (SD ±13.46). The average disease duration was of 16.94 years (SD ± 8.86), and a majority of the sample had the relapsing-remitting type of MS (RRMS) (n= 43). The median of disease severity, as measured by the EDSS, was of 3.50 (IQR – 3.5). The study hypothesized that fatigue levels would increase over time and that depression would moderate the relationship between fatigue and processing speed. Fatigue levels did not significantly change over time (p = 0.055). A significant relationship was found between fatigue and processing speed impairment (p < 0.05). However, depression did not significantly moderate this relationship (p = 0.215). These findings show that cognitive symptoms may influence each other in MS. Future research should look into the relationship of mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression, and cognitive impairment in PwMS.","['Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuropsychology', 'cognitive impairment', 'cognition', 'mood', 'depression', 'fatigue', 'processing speed']"
The relative age effect: Are the youngest children experiencing poorer peer relations and more social anxiety?,"Baars, Laura","['Klein, A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Different studies have showed that the youngest children in the classroom are disadvantaged in terms of academic performances, social and emotional well-being, and a higher risk to develop mental health problems. These disadvantages are known as the relative age effect. However, the relative age effect on peer relations remains underexamined and no studies investigated the relative age effect on social anxiety. This is surprising as peer relations and social anxiety are highly relevant in the classroom context. Therefore, the current study aimed to 1) examine the effect of relative age on peer relations in more depth by considering perceived social support and peer group affiliation, and 2) to investigate the relative age effect on levels of social anxiety. Furthermore, gender differences in perceived social support, peer group affiliation, social anxiety and in the effect of relative age were considered. In total, 590 Dutch primary school children (6–13 years) completed self-report questionnaires on social support, peer group affiliation and social anxiety. In contrary to our expectations, relatively younger children did not report poorer peer relations and higher levels of social anxiety. In line with our expectations, girls reported slightly more social support and social anxiety than boys, but boys and girls did not differ in their reports of peer group affiliation. Moreover, no gender differences were found in the effect of relative age on peer relations and social anxiety. We further discussed potential explanations for the absence of the relative age effect. Possibly, flexible cut-off dates for primary school entry, a softer transition to first grade and less competitive education systems might contribute to offset the relative age effect. To attain a better understanding of the relative age effect, recommendations for future studies were provided such as cross-national research, the use of a multimethod approach and controlling for possible covariates at the individual and classroom level.","['Relative Age Effect, Peer Relations, Social Anxiety, Perceived Social Support, Peer Group Affiliation, Gender']"
Posttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorder during the coronavirus pandemic: the effects of coping behavior and health fear.,"Langen, Aleid",['Joanne Mouthaan'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The current coronavirus pandemic is related to psychological problems, such as health fear. Health fear is the anxiety of getting ill and is related to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjustment disorder. People use coping behavior to manage psychological demands. Positive coping behavior, such as using humor and planning, was related to less symptoms of PTSD and adjustment disorder in nurses during the current pandemic and the SARS epidemic. The aim of this study was to investigate whether positive coping behavior significantly moderated the relationship between health fear and symptoms of PTSD and adjustment disorder during the current coronavirus pandemic. This study was part of an international longitudinal study. A total of 2141 inhabitants of the Netherlands were included. Health fear was measured using a questionnaire that was developed for this study. Furthermore, the “Adjustment Disorder – New Module 8”, the “Primary Care PTSD screen for DSM-5” and the “Pandemic Coping Scale” were used. The results were analyzed using linear regressions. The results showed that more health fear was related to more symptoms of PTSD and adjustment disorder. No significant effect was found for the relation between coping behavior and symptoms of PTSD and adjustment disorder. Positive coping behavior did not significantly moderate the relationship between health fear and symptoms of PTSD and adjustment disorder. Interventions that reduce fear, including yoga and mindfulness, could be helpful to the population. Future studies could investigate whether health fear is a predictive factor for symptoms of PTSD and adjustment disorder.","['PTSD', 'adjustment disorder', 'covid-19', 'pandemic', 'health fear', 'coping behavior']"

Late Chronotype and the Relation to Suicide Ideation in Borderline Personality Disorder,"Wilhelm, Anouk","['Antypa, N.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is associated with increased levels of suicide ideation, as well as being highly comorbid with depression. Nonetheless, research on sleep characteristics and suicidality in personality psychopathology remains understudied. Hence, this study analyzed the connection between BPD, eveningness chronotype (i.e. delayed sleep-wake pattern), depression and suicide ideation. It was expected that eveningness would significantly elevate suicide risk in the BPD population and that depression would control for some of the variance but not hinder the moderation of eveningness. This research drew upon data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). A subset of 1713 eligible participants was selected, among whom 246 were diagnosed with BPD. Questionnaires included the Personality Disorder Questionnaire (PDQ4+), the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ), the Beck Suicidal Ideation questionnaire (BSI) and the Composite Interview Diagnostic Instrument (CIDI). Multiple tests were conducted, such as linear regressions and two simple moderation analyzes using the PROCESS extension by Hayes. Results demonstrated that: (a) BPD significantly predicted suicide ideation (b = .62, p < .001); (b) eveningness did not significantly moderate the relation between BPD and suicide ideation; (c) eveningness did not significantly predict suicide ideation with or without controlling for depression; and lastly (d) depression contributed to the explained variance in the elevation of suicide ideation (b = .67, p < .001). To explore the impact of sleep disturbances on suicide ideation, future research should focus on Delayed Sleep Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) and insomnia since they have been both linked to BPD, eveningness and suicide ideation.","['Eveningness, Chronotype, BPD, Suicide Ideation, Depression, Insomnia, DSWPD']"

There has been a growing interest in understanding the processes and mechanisms underlying this relationship. The aim of the current study was to explore the extent to which positive and negative indicators of sibling relationship quality mediate the relation between the child personality traits agreeableness and conscientiousness and externalizing behavior in second-born siblings. Data from the Dutch longitudinal study Boys will be boys? were used. Participants included 148 ten-year-old children, their twelve-year-old siblings, and their parents. Children rated their personality traits using the Big Five Questionnaire for Children and parents rated their children’s externalizing behavior and the sibling relationship quality, using the Child Behaviour Checklist and the Sibling Inventory of Behavior. Findings revealed that agreeableness but not conscientiousness was directly related to externalizing behavior. Positive and negative indicators of sibling relationship quality were not significantly related to externalizing behavior nor to agreeableness and conscientiousness. Contrary to predictions, sibling relationship quality did not mediate the relation between the personality traits agreeableness and conscientiousness and externalizing behavior. The present study demonstrates the complex and dynamic interplay between factors underlying the development of childhood externalizing behavior. Further research is needed to learn more about the mechanisms underlying the development of externalizing behavior and the role of sibling relationships.","['childhood externalizing behavior, child personality, conscientiousness, agreeableness, sibling relationship quality, sibling']"
Ready to Change? Readiness and Motivation to Change and Neurocognition as a Predictor of Treatment Outcome during the Acute Phase of Anorexia Nervosa,"Limouri, Hiba","['Bracké, K.F.M.', 'Houdt, C.A. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate among all psychiatric disorders, with approximately 5% of the patients dying within four years of diagnosis. Since AN is influenced by various factors, predicting the clinical course remains challenging. As previous studies have suggested that early intervention for AN may have the greatest potential to reduce harm, it is important to diagnose AN at a very early stage and provide a tailored treatment plan. This study aimed to examine whether readiness and motivation to change and neurocognitive functioning predict treatment outcome during the acute phase of AN. The objectives of this study were to examine whether readiness and motivation to change predicts (1) changes in BMI-SDS and fat percentage after one year of treatment, (2) changes in severity of anxiety, depression, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms after one year of follow-up, and (3) whether neurocognitive functions predict changes in BMI-SDS and fat percentage after one year of treatment. A longitudinal study was conducted in a sample of 79 first-onset AN patients aged from 12-22 years. Readiness and motivation to change was measured using the Dutch version of the Readiness and Motivation to Change Questionnaire. BMI-SDS was measured by calculating BMI-length/weight SDS. Fat percentage was measured using the BOD POD. Anxiety, depression, and OCD symptoms were assessed with the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, the Dutch version of the Beck Depression Inventory, and the (Children's) Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, respectively. Neurocognitive functioning was measured with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and the Rey Complex Figure Test. Simple linear regressions showed that readiness and motivation to change and neurocognition in the acute phase of the disease did not significantly predict changes in BMI-SDS, fat percentage, or changes in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and OCD after one year of follow-up. Future research should aim to examine readiness and motivation to change for each symptom domain instead of a global state, differentiate between intelligence levels, examine treatment outcomes in a multidimensional view, and assess multiple points in time.","['Acute phase', 'anorexia nervosa', 'neurocognitive functioning', 'predictors', 'readiness and motivation to change', 'treatment outcome']"

The decision to place a child out-of- home is complex and has an enormous impact on children and parents. Two different types of professionals are involved in the decision making of placing a child out-of-home, child welfare professionals and children’s court judges. Despite the impact of the decision, there is limited previous research on the relationship between personal factors of professionals and out-of-home placement decisions. There was no previous research about the relationship between the amount of out-of-home placement decisions in the daily work of the professionals and their current decisions. A moderation- effect of the job on the previously defined relations have not been researched before. Therefore, this study examined personal factors of professionals and their out-of-home placement decisions. The sample consisted of 31 child welfare professionals and 23 children’s court judges. Participants received different vignettes based on child protection cases and reported if they would place the child out-of-home. A questionnaire was used to measure attitude towards the effectiveness and harmfulness of out-of-home placements and professionals were asked to report in what percentage of their recent out-of-home placement cases their decided to place a child out of home. Results showed that there was no significant association between the percentage of out-of-home placement decisions in their daily job, the attitude of the professional and their current advice to place a child out of home. Furthermore, there also was no moderation-effect for the job of the professional. This study adds knowledge to a not much researched but very important and complex field. For future research, it is recommended to make the procedure more comparable to the guidelines professionals use in practice, by including an intercollegial consultation in the research design.",

The data was collected at early (spring 2020), mid (spring 2021) and late (fall 2021) pandemic, through an online survey. Instruments included Beck depression inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Law Student Perceived Stress Scale, De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and Parental Bonding Instrument. Mental health in our participants worsened and varied more during the period that the COVID-19 restrictions were in place. The effects of the restriction measures on anxiety were moderated by the attachment styles. We found that students with a fearful maternal attachment style experienced more anxiety as time passed during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions than students with other maternal attachment styles. On average, we found that students with a secure attachment style had lower levels of anxiety than students with other attachment styles. We found evidence that the effects of the restriction measures on social loneliness were moderated by paternal attachment styles. This suggested that students with a dismissive or preoccupied attachment style experienced more social loneliness as time passed during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions than students with a fearful or secure attachment style. The evidence that the attachment styles orient the individual’s modality to respond to times of distress may help the designs of future interventions aimed to improve mental health.","['Parental Bonding, attachment style, COVID-19']"
Therapeutic alliance in an intercultural context: Influence of language use and emotional expression,"Seidakhmet, Adina","['Henkelmann, J.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Alliance is a central aspect of any psychotherapeutic work. With the increasing cultural diversity within therapy encounters, the importance of cultural factors for alliance became more prominent. In that light, the effects of language, as one of the complex cultural aspects, have also been investigated. Available evidence indicates that differences in language use can significantly affect clients' emotional experiences in therapy. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of influence between language use, emotional expression, and alliance in therapy remain under-researched. The current research study, conducted in the Netherlands, investigates the influence of non-dominant language use and emotional expression difficulties on clients' alliance perceptions. 134 Dutch and International clients aged 18 to 59 completed the survey. Three groups were identified based on the language clients used in therapy. The alliance was measured using the patient version of California Psychotherapy Alliance Scales (CALPAS-P). Clients who used a non-dominant language did not experience more emotional expression difficulties than those using dominant or multiple languages. While there was no evidence for the mediation between non-dominant language use, emotional expression difficulties, and alliance ratings, more emotional expression difficulties still predicted lower alliance ratings. Despite the lack of support for the effects of non-dominant language use on emotions and alliance, the current study still adds to the exploration of language-related intercultural differences and their dynamics in therapy. Given the study's exploratory nature, the need for future studies is emphasized.","['therapeutic alliance', 'intercultural context', 'language', 'emotional expression']"
Childhood Trauma and Cognitive Reactivity Profile,"Willemse, Naomi","['Does, A.J.W. van der']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Background: Childhood maltreatment (CM) has been associated with dysfunctional cogni-tions and depression. Cognitive reactivity (CR) is the change in dysfunctional cognitions re-activated by mild dysphoria and is a vulnerability marker for depression. Past research sup-ports the hypothesis that CM is also associated with higher CR. Aim: To assess whether CM associates with higher CR and to identify the relationship be-tween CR subscales and CM subscales. Methods: The data were from a longitudinal cohort study (n=1780) , Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). CM (emotional/physical/ sexual abuse and emotion-al/physical neglect), depression, LEIDS, Neuroticism, and Extraversion were assessed at wave 4. The association between CM and CR was assessed with a linear regression analysis. The association of the CM subscales with LEIDS, Neuroticism, Extraversion, and the LEIDS subscales (hopelessness, aggression, rumination) with multiple regression analysis. Results: Higher CM scores significantly related to higher CR scores, Neuroticism, and Ex-traversion. Though only emotional maltreatment was consistently significant on all varia-bles and the LEIDS subscales (p<.01). RUM associated with the most maltreatment types (emotional/ sexual abuse and emotional/physical neglect), then HOP (emotional abuse and emotional/physical neglect), and then AGG (emotional abuse and emotional neglect). Conclusions: Present study found support for an association between CM and CR, but also Extraversion and Neuroticism. Especially emotional maltreatment was significant for all the variables and subscales. Looking at the LEIDS subscales, RUM associated with the most CM types. Physical abuse was the only type that was not significant on the LEIDS or its sub-scales.",

Eerder onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat stress en trait anxiety invloed hebben op herkenning en herinnering, echter is deze invloed nog niet getest bij landmarks. In de huidige studie werd dit onderzocht door 37 participanten een exploratietaak uit te laten voeren in een virtuele omgeving waarin landmarks waren geplaatst. De helft van de participanten kreeg van tevoren stress opgewekt door een zingtaak uit te voeren in de Sing-a-Song Stress Test. Na de exploratietaak werd middels de Remember / Know paradigm getest in hoeverre landmarks herkend en herinnerd waren en werd de Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory afgenomen. De Sing-a-Song Stress Test bleek een effectieve manipulatie voor het induceren van verhoogde stressniveaus. Er werd geen verschil gevonden tussen de hoge- en lage-stressconditie in herkenning en herinnering van landmarks, als ook geen verschil in herkenning en herinnering tussen lage en hoge trait anxiety. Vervolgonderzoek wordt aanbevolen via fMRI hippocampusactiviteit te meten gedurende het Remember / Know paradigm, om meer grip te krijgen op het al dan niet onafhankelijk optreden van herkenning en herinnering onder invloed van stress en trait anxiety. Daarnaast wordt aangeraden te onderzoeken of meer opvallende landmarks, door bijvoorbeeld emotionele waarde, beter worden herkend en/of herinnerd onder stress dan wel trait anxiety.","['Exploration behavior', 'recognition', 'remembering', 'trait anxiety', 'memory', 'spatial memory']"

Consequently, placebo treatment has gained recognition as a potential alternative to conventional medicine. However, ethical concerns and skepticisms persists regarding the implementation of placebos in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to explore the attitudes of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and healthy adults towards medicine and placebo treatment, as well as to investigate potential correlations between these modalities. The study employed a cross-sectional design and collected data through a survey. Participants were Dutch adults over the age of 18 who had been diagnosed with FMS as well as healthy adults. Two separate questionnaires were administered to assess the attitudes of participants towards placebo and medicine treatments. A total of 185 participants filled out the survey with 86 reporting the presence of FMS symptoms and 99 being healthy adults. The results showed no correlation between attitudes on medicine treatment and attitudes on placebo treatment (p = .961). Furthermore, FMS patients displayed less favorability towards both placebo treatment (p = .003) and medicine treatment (p < .001). Notably, no correlation was found between attitude of both participant groups on placebo treatment when moderated by attitude on medicine treatment (p = .283), indicating that the attitudes on the two treatments do not affect each other. Findings of this study suggested that patients with FMS are less favorable to medical care compared to adults, regardless of whether it involved medicine or placebo-basedintervention. The study contributed to the understanding of attitudes towards medicine and placebo treatment and emphasizes the importance of contextual factors in interventions. Future research could expand on this by further investigating factors that impact patients’ attitudes towards medical treatment in order to improve medical care and provide additional treatment options, particularly for FMS patients.",

Een federatiegemeente is een samenwerking tussen gemeenten waarbij een aantal gezamenlijke taken worden ondergebracht bij een gezamenlijk bestuur. In dit bestuur zitten gekozen volksvertegenwoordigers om de samenwerking democratische legitimiteit te geven. De gemeenschappelijke regelingen en de federatiegemeente worden met elkaar vergeleken op basis van intrinsieke democratische waarden en de mate waarop ze aansluiten op de taken van gemeenten en gemeenteraden. De federatiegemeente is intrinsiek democratischer dan gemeenschappelijke regelingen en sluit beter aan op de taken van de gemeenteraad. De federatiegemeente is echter moeilijker op te zetten en biedt veel minder flexibele inzetbaarheid dan gemeenschappelijke regelingen. Hierdoor is het niet wenselijk om gemeenschappelijke regelingen te vervangen door federatiegemeenten.,"['gemeente', 'federatiegemeente', 'gemeenschappelijke regeling', 'gemeenschappelijke regelingen', 'gemeentelijke samenwerking']"
Rol van Mentoren: Een onderzoek naar de rol van de mentor in het voorzien van sociaal-emotionele behoeften van havo- en vwo-leerlingen in het eindexamenjaar.,"Windhorst, Fleur","['Vogelaar, S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit onderzoek is onderzocht in welke mate de mentor leerlingen in het eindexamenjaar op dit moment in hun sociaal-emotionele behoeften voorziet en welke behoeften leerlingen hierin nog hebben. Het onderzoek is uitgevoerd in opdracht van pedagogisch bureau OOK, zodat ze een effectieve training voor mentoren kunnen (door)ontwikkelen. De sociaal-emotionele behoeften van leerlingen zijn uitgesplitst in drie basisbehoeften; competentie, autonomie en sociale verbondenheid. Deze basisbehoeften zijn gebaseerd op de Self-Determination Theory van Deci en Ryan (2000). De volgende deelvragen zijn onderzocht: “Welke sociaal-emotionele behoeften van leerlingen op het gebied van autonomie, sociale verbondenheid en competentie worden momenteel vervuld door de mentor?”, “Hebben leerlingen het meest behoefte aan mentor ondersteuning op het gebied van competentie, autonomie of sociale verbondenheid?”, “Verschilt de mate waarin leerlingen behoefte hebben aan ondersteuning van de mentor van de mate waarin zij hierin worden vervuld?” en “Verschillen leerlingen op basis van onderwijsniveau en profielachtergrond in de mate waarin zij voorzien worden en behoefte hebben aan autonomie, sociale verbondenheid en competentie?”. Aan het onderzoek hebben 66 eindexamenleerlingen van de havo en vwo deelgenomen. Voor de participanten was een minimale leeftijd van 16 jaar vereist. De onderzoekspopulatie bestond uit 17 mannen, 48 vrouwen en 1 ‘anders’. De verdeling van het niveau van de populatie bestond uit 29 havisten en 37 vwo’ers. Het vakkenprofiel dat wordt gevolgd door de betreffende respondenten is een natuurprofiel of een maatschappijprofiel. In de onderzoekspopulatie volgden 36 respondenten een natuurprofiel en 30 respondenten een maatschappijprofiel. De scholen zijn geworven binnen het netwerk van de onderzoekers en door scholen op het internet te zoeken en deze te benaderen, waarbij alle scholen binnen de provincie Zuid-Holland of Utrecht lagen. De vragenlijst is gebaseerd op de Mentor Evaluation Tool en de Work-Related Scale for Basic Need Satisfaction. In de vragenlijst zijn de drie basisbehoeften van de Self-Determination Theory - autonomie, competentie en sociale verbondenheid - uitgevraagd. Daarnaast zijn ook de achtergrondvariabelen gender, school, onderwijsniveau en profiel en school uitgevraagd. De eerste deelvraag liet zien dat leerlingen op dit moment gemiddeld het meest voorzien worden in autonomie door hun mentor en het minst in competentie en sociale verbondenheid. De tweede deelvraag liet zien dat leerlingen gemiddeld het meest behoefte hebben aan begeleiding bij competentie en autonomie en het minste behoefte hebben aan begeleiding bij sociale verbondenheid. Hieruit volgde dat er een verschil is in constructen tussen de behoefte van leerlingen en mate waarin zij hier huidig in worden vervuld. Er zijn tegen de verwachting in geen significante verschillen gevonden in behoeften van leerlingen van havo of vwo en leerlingen met een natuur- of maatschappijprofiel. Het advies is om als mentor meer aandacht te besteden aan de ondersteuning van eindexamenleerlingen in hun autonomie en competentie en in mindere mate in de onderlinge sociale verbondenheid. Het is belangrijk dat de leerlingen het gevoel hebben dat zij zelf de vrijheid hebben om keuzes te maken en dat zij genoeg zelfvertrouwen hebben om hun eindexamens te halen. Hier kan OOK aan bijdragen door deze handvatten in trainingen aan te bieden aan mentoren, waarbij met verschillende modules kan worden ingegaan op de ondersteuning in autonomie en competentie. Hoewel de meeste leerlingen aangeven dezelfde behoefte voor competentie en autonomie te hebben, zijn er ook mogelijk onderlinge verschillen. Het is daarom interessant om toekomstig onderzoek te richten op de persoonskenmerken van leerlingen, zodat er mogelijk uitspraken kunnen worden gedaan over specifieke behoeften van een eindexamenleerling.","['Mentor', 'Eindexamenleerlingen', 'Eindexamen', 'Basisbehoeften']"
Electoral Politics in Ukraine`s plural society: centrifugal elites competing for median voters,"Bolt, Vijay","['Spirova, M.S.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This paper moves beyond the democratization paradigm in studying post-communist political developments, and investigates how competitive elections affected ethnonationalism in Ukraine’s ethnically plural society (1991-2022). Based on Rabushka’s and Shepsle’s (1972) ethnic outbidding model, this paper hypothesizes that competitive elections incentivize candidates to use ethnonationalist appeals to maximally mobilize electoral support, which fuels centrifugal competition and ethnic polarization. This study has found that ethnolinguistic affiliations did structure electoral behavior in Ukraine. Most presidential election campaigns confirmed expectations based on the outbidding model. However, a comparison of the 2010 and 2004 elections challenges the outbidding theory, as the 2010 election campaign featured centripetal competition for the median voter. The existence of median voters amidst politicized ethnic divisions contradicts the outbidding model’s core assumption that middle-grounds between ethnic groups do not exist. Many voters, particularly among Russian-speaking ethnic Ukrainians, did find themselves in-between two ethnic groups, making centripetal competition not only possible, but even a rational election-winning strategy. Furthermore, contrarily to the rational-choice-based outbidding theory, political elites were able to learn from prior mistakes and became better at co-existing peacefully over time, despite fierce electoral competition. However, without candidates’ commitment not to let competition escalate, centrifugal competition is always around the corner.","['Electoral studies, Ukraine, Ethnic outbidding, Median voter theorem, Post-communist politics, Polarized pluralism, Yanukovych, Tymoshenko']"

Improving student wellbeing through the Caring Universities programmes: Identifying reasons for dropout: Medication and additional psychotherapy as predictors of dropout,"Nicolescu, Ana-Maria","['Luenen, S. van']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"More than a third of students worldwide suffer from psychological problems - a concerning number that could rise in upcoming years. Caring Universities (CU) is an initiative of nine Dutch institutions to combat these issues. With eight evidence-based online programmes, CU strives to improve student wellbeing. The programmes include self-help, psychoeducation, and the weekly tracking of an e-coach. However, there is a large number of dropouts across programmes. Using a mixed-method design, potential reasons for dropout were investigated qualitatively, while medication and additional psychotherapy were researched quantitatively as predictors of dropout. Participants completed a demographic and dropout questionnaire on the CU platform. Results of the qualitative analysis (N = 40) showed that time pressure and a lack of motivation were the most prevalent reasons for dropping out. Experiencing stress and the lack of feedback were recurring themes of the narrative accounts. In the quantitative investigation (N = 4331), neither medication nor psychotherapy significantly affected dropout, meaning that future CU programmes will not have to correct or account for them. Limitations include the measurements based on self-report and the way dropout was defined. Future research should take into account more reasons for and predictors of dropout from eHealth programmes for students, like language.","['Students', 'mental health', 'dropout', 'eHealth', 'medication', 'psychotherapy']"
Physiological Synchrony and Trust: To What Extent Is the Decision to Trust Influenced by Physiological Alignment and Face-to-Face Contact in Real-Life Dyads? PHYSIOLOGICAL SYNCHRONY AND TRUST IN REAL-LIFE DYADS,"Anders, Laszlo",['Fabiola Diana'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"In this research we investigated if physiological synchrony (PS), which is believed to play a key role in emotional contagion and other psychosocial phenomena, is related to trust. We hypothesized physiological synchrony to be higher when participants could see each other and to be positively correlated with trust and perceived attractiveness. 30 participants (Mean Age = 24.3; SD = 4.4) formed 15 dyads of strangers who played a trust game while their heartrate, electrodermal activity, facial electromyography, skin temperature, and pupil dilation were measured simultaneously. A 2x2 repeated measures mixed-design was used with conditions as a two-level within-subject factor (face-to-face, face-blocked) and trust role as a two-level between-subject factor (trustor, trustee). Additionally multiple questionnaires were introduced for exploratory analyses. PS was calculated using windowed lagged cross correlation (WLCC) and trust by obtaining scores from the trust game. Pearson correlations were used to analyze the relationship between trust and perceived attractiveness with PS. A one-way ANOVA was used to analyze differences between conditions. All main effects were insignificant. Nevertheless, the small sample size does not allow us to assume no relationship between the concepts either. Possible confounding factors were discussed, and limitations of the experimental design addressed. Future research should keep the ecological setup but include a larger sample and control for as many variables as possible that could influence the decision to trust somebody.",['#physiological synchrony #emotional contagion #trust #empathy']

It was examined whether there is a difference regarding these factors, within the different gene mutations of the syndrome. Here, mutation on the ARID1B gene was compared with mutations on another gene. The sample consisted of 74 participants between the ages of 9 months and 60 years, with a mean of 18 years. The analyses showed that between a mutation on the ARID1B gene and other types of mutations, no difference was found in the degree of epilepsy, regulation problems, behavioral problems, and problems with independence. However, the analyses did find an association between epilepsy, regulation and behavior, and the degree of independence. Having epilepsy and behavioral problems were found to be strong predictors of low independence in Coffin-Siris syndrome. Having a regulation problem is a weak predictor in this regard. This finding relates to the entire sample and is not gene-specific.",

Leerkrachtgedrag als sleutel tot een positieve groepsdynamiek,"Colombijn, Anne","['Mainhard, M.T.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Groepsdynamiek is in elke groep anders, en verandert met de jaren. Een positieve groepsdynamiek gaat samen met prosociaal gedrag van de leerlingen. Dit prosociale gedrag kan gestimuleerd worden door leerkrachtgedrag te vertonen dat tegemoetkomt aan de drie basisbehoeften (autonomie, competentie en verbondenheid) volgens de Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (Van den Bos et al., 2018; Deci & Ryan, 2000). Om de onderzoeksvraag ‘Wat is de samenhang tussen leerkrachtgedrag en groepsdynamiek in een les in een middenbouwgroep in het basisonderwijs?’ te beantwoorden zijn er observaties gedaan op een basisschool. Aan de hand van twee observatieformulieren zijn acht gedragingen die overeenkomen met de basisbehoeften van de SDT, van negen leerkrachten geobserveerd. Het observatieformulier leerkrachtgedrag ging over empathie/respect voor de leerlingen, inspraak/inbreng van de leerlingen, duidelijkheid en positieve feedback op het gedrag en leren. Het observatieformulier groepsdynamiek ging over de aspecten sfeer, onderlinge betrokkenheid, relatie met de leerkracht en structuur en regels. Na het observeren bleek dat groepsdynamiek als één construct gezien kon worden. Uit de berekende correlaties is gebleken dat alle aspecten van leerkrachtgedrag overwegend positief samenhangen met het construct groepsdynamiek. Duidelijkheid en empathie hebben de sterkste correlatie. Uit de independent t-test is gebleken dat deeltijdleerkrachten meer positieve feedback geven dan voltijdleerkrachten. Wel moet er rekening gehouden worden met het feit dat er maar vier aspecten van leerkrachtgedrag werden gemeten, terwijl leerkrachtgedrag in werkelijkheid uit meer aspecten bestaat. Toch geven de inzichten uit het onderzoek goede handvatten voor leerkrachten om de gemeten aspecten te kunnen verbeteren, waarmee ook de groepsdynamiek zal verbeteren.",
Financial Scarcity and Prosocial Behavior: An Empirical Examination of the Mediating Mechanisms,"Kozlova, Varvara","['Hilbert, L.P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Financial scarcity refers to the perception of having insufficient monetary resources to meet daily demands. There is an ongoing debate on how financial scarcity affects social decision-making, such as the decision to act prosocially. The current study examined the relationship between financial scarcity and prosocial behavior and whether the basic psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, competence, or attentional focus mediate it. The study was conducted on 120 participants using an experimental design with Household Tasks, a Dictator game, and self-reported questionnaires. No direct relationship between financial scarcity and prosocial behavior was found. Nonetheless, participants with financial scarcity acted less prosocially towards individuals with financial abundance. Financial scarcity negatively impacted satisfaction of the basic psychological need for relatedness. The basic psychological need for autonomy and attentional focus on one's own financial situation reduced prosocial behavior. No mediating mechanisms were found. The study further discusses limitations, implications for interventions, and future research.","['Financial Scarcity', 'Prosocial Behavior', 'Basic Psychological Needs', 'Attentional Focus']"
The Importance of Viable Alternatives: Economic Voting and Opposition Configuration,"Lourenço, José","['Spirova, Maria']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Political Science (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The rationale behind economic voting is simple: the citizen votes for the government if the economy is doing all right; otherwise, the vote is against (Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier 2000). However, various studies have found cross-country and across-time variation regarding the intensity of economic voting (e.g., Paldam 1991; Anderson 1995; Duch and Stevenson 2008), leading an increasing number of scholars to discuss and test potential moderators of the economic vote equation (e.g., Anderson 2000; Duch and Stevenson 2008). Nonetheless, only a few authors have regarded the characteristics of the alternative to the underperforming incumbent, the opposition, as potential moderating factors (Anderson 2000; Maeda 2009; Ferrer 2023). Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to understand how the configuration of the parliamentary opposition, regarding its fragmentation and polarization, impacts its viability as an alternative and, consequently, the intensity of economic voting. Using data from 208 elections that took place in 29 European democracies between 1989 and 2021, I found that a more fragmented opposition actually increases the intensity of economic voting. However, I did not reach any statistically significant conclusions regarding the effect of the polarization of the opposition on the intensity of economic voting.","['Economic Voting', 'Political Opposition', 'Fragmentation', 'Polarization']"
Mind over Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Computer-Based Mindfulness-Based interventions for Chronic Pain Management,"Wall, Kathrin","['Zedlitz, A.M.E.E.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Due to the subjective nature of chronic pain, management rather than cure is the primary objective. With the widespread use of the Internet, computer-based psychological interventions provide a convenient and easily accessible alternative for managing chronic pain. The review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of computer-based mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), comparing them with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and investigating their impact on pain acceptance and self-efficacy among chronic pain patients. In accordance with the PICOS criteria, multiple databases were searched for randomised controlled studies involving adults aged 17 to 67 with chronic pain. The quality of selected studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Handbook’s ‘risk of bias’ tool. For the quantitative analysis, R version 4.30 was utilised, and random effects meta-analyses were conducted for each research question to account for heterogeneity between studies. Standardised mean differences (SMD) were computed, and effect sizes were aggregated using the metacont package in R, with Hedges’ g as the effect size metric to account for small-sample bias. In addition, a subgroup analysis was performed to compare the treatment effectiveness of MBIs and CBT interventions. The immediate effects of MBIs on pain management were not statistically significant; however, small to moderate effects were observed during follow-up. Concerning pain acceptance and self-efficacy, no significant differences were observed between MBIs and CBT interventions. However, computer-based MBIs significantly affected pain acceptance, indicating potential benefits in this regard. The review highlights the potential of computer-based MBIs for chronic pain management. The limited number of studies and meta-analyses in this area, however, calls for additional research on intervention durations, moderating factors, and integration with other treatment modalities or the healthcare system.",
Clinical empathic communication: examining its impact on post-operative pain and anxiety in highly anxious patients,"Solkema, Marieke van",['L. M. van Vliet'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Background: Pain and anxiety after surgery are common and can lead to negative outcomes, including impaired immune function, slow wound healing, higher morbidity rates and chronic pain. Empathic communication can generate a placebo effect in clinical settings. Studies show a relationship between warm and empathic communication and reduced anxiety, specifically in highly anxious patients. Empathic communication may be beneficial for those with high anxiety, in reducing pain as well as anxiety. Aim: This study aimed to understand the moderating effect of pre-operative anxiety of patients on the effect of empathic communication on post-operative pain and anxiety. Methods: The study used a 2x2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial. Nurses used an empathy manipulation in communication with participants, standard and enhanced conditions of empathy. Participants’ post-operative pain and anxiety were assessed using NRS and STAI-state. Preoperative anxiety was measured before the surgery in two questions. A regression analysis was used to see what effect the moderator pre- operative anxiety had on the relationship between empathy and pain. We used a Bonferroni correction on the outcome of pain ( p <.025). Results: Empathic clinical communication did not significantly predict post-operative pain scores in highly anxious participants (p = .64, p = .46, p = .25, p = .50, p = .52, p = .42). There was a curious result of an increase in pain on day 3 in the subgroup of highly anxious participants (p = 0.01), but none of the variables in the model were significant so we could not attribute this higher pain score to the empathic communication or subgroup of highly anxious patients. Pre-operative anxiety did moderate the effect of empathy on post-operative anxiety (p = .05, p = .02). Discussion: The results suggest that empathy may be a useful tool for reducing anxiety in highly anxious patients undergoing surgery. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which empathy affects pain and anxiety in this context and identify potential strategies for optimising its impact on patient outcomes.","['empathy, placebo, pain, anxiety, surgery, post-operative pain, post-operative anxiety,']"
The effect of Microdosing on Health Behavior Change,"Henk, Julia Katharina","['Prochazkova, L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Scientific research in the past years progressively examined the effects of microdosing psychedelics on mental health and cognition. However, the effects of microdosing on health behavior change (HBC) remain understudied. This study provides the first exploration of a potential impact of microdosing on HBC, including its psychological mechanisms and possible mediators. The study was composed of two retrospective questionnaires. A total of N = 365 participants reported on their own microdosing experiences in the first questionnaire. Most respondents reported a link between microdosing and HBC, with effects being strongest for sleep, physical activity, and mindfulness practices. Moreover, we examined the impact of three potentially mediating or moderating variables: Prior full-dose psychedelic experience, applying another strategy of HBC, and gender. Results of the first two variables differed on specific HBC-variables. Gender did not impact the effect of microdosing on HBC. Psychologically, mental health and well-being, psychological flexibility, and self-efficacy were most frequently reported as mechanisms of HBC. In the second questionnaire, N = 10 practitioners reported on their observations on clients’ HBC associated with microdosing. Reported effects were mostly in agreement with reports provided by microdosers. Practitioners reported health as an identity, psychological flexibility, and integrated emotion most frequently as psychological mechanisms. Overall, the data obtained through both questionnaires is consistent with prior research on psychedelics and microdosing. Given the novelty of the demonstrated link between microdosing and HBC, more research with different study designs is recommended to support our findings in double-blind, longitudinal contexts.","['Microdosing, psychedelics, health behavior change']"

Endedijk'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Due to the amended education law in 2014, more students with extra needs are included in a regular educational system. Earlier studies have proven that teachers are insufficiently prepared to deal with divergent behavior, which makes them reluctant to act when divergent behavior causes problems in a classroom. This study is researching a cohesion between teachers actively taking the student perspective into account and acting sensitive and responsive towards their students, which could bring an added value handling divergent behavior in a classroom. The fundamental experiment of the research was conducted online with teachers divided randomly in two separate groups, with one group describing a situation from the student's perspective and the other describing the reaction from the teacher’s perspective. The cohesion between adopting the student’s perspective and the teacher’s action strategies within regular primary education can be found by studying the participants. 66 participating teachers contributed to the results of the experiment. Multiple T-tests and a univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) have been conducted to answer the research questions. The results show that there were no significant effects found between the two respective groups (experimental vs. verified) in the degree of, effort to comprehend thoughts and behavior of the students and estimating with certainty that the thoughts and behavior were taken into account, also referred to as taking perspective. Moreover, no significant cohesion has been found between the chosen action strategies by the two respective groups (experimental vs. verified) and there is no direct evidence that more responsive strategies were used. Furthermore, when monitoring the years of teaching experience there are no signs, that there is a significant influence on the chosen action strategies wielded by the teachers. Finally, the role of the intervention, the online experiment and the size of the sample will be discussed as possible explanation.","['perspectief nemen', 'sensitief en responsief handelen']"

Exploring the role of general versus specific outcome expectancies and gender on Wim Hof method training outcome in axial spondyloarthritis patients","Schwarz, Leonie","['van Middendorp, H.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Objective: Expectancies are assumed to influence treatment responses across immune-mediated diseases. In this study, patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) participated in the Wim Hof training method, a treatment with presumed anti-inflammatory effects using cold exposure, meditation, exercise, and breathing techniques. Our aim was to investigate the associations between (1) personality-related generalized outcome expectancies (optimism and neuroticism) and (2) treatment-specific outcome expectancies and (3) their relative and absolute predictive value for changes in disease activity after treatment while considering a potential moderating role of gender in this relationship. Method: We performed a predictive study, using data from the main study by Buijze et al. (2019) that assessed safety and anti-inflammatory effects of the Wim Hof method in axSpA patients. We pooled data from early and late intervention groups into a within-subject design with 19 complete datasets. Outcome expectancies were measured at baseline by questionnaires, while clinical disease activity was assessed pre- and post the 8-week intervention by self-reports and clinical measures. The absolute and relative predictive value of generalized and specific expectancies on disease activity change was examined by correlation and hierarchical regression analyses, respectively. A moderation analysis examined the role of gender in this relationship. Results: Contrary to our hypothesis, neither generalized nor specific outcome expectancies significantly explained the variance in disease activity change (p = 0.10, SD = ±1.05). Yet, more positive specific expectancies showed a moderate negative effect size in predicting greater decreases in disease activity (β = -0.43). Neuroticism displayed a moderate correlation with more positive specific expectancies (rs = 0.35, p = 0.13). Gender differences were insignificant for both outcome expectancies and gender did not moderate any associations between predictors and the outcome (p = 0.63, 0.35, 0.23). Conclusion: Our hypotheses regarding the significant predictive value of generalized and specific outcome expectancies on disease activity change and gender differences were not supported. Yet, more positive outcome expectancies were moderately associated with higher decreases in disease activity. This study offers initial insights into the distinct role of generalized and specific outcome expectancies in the nonpharmacological treatment of a chronic inflammatory condition, emphasizing the potential prognostic value of specific expectancies for outcomes.","['outcome expectanies, Wim Hof Method, axial spondyloarthritis, treatment outcome, inflammation']"

Treading Lightly or Charging Ahead: Exploring Gender and Age Differences in Attack Investment During an Asymmetrical Conflict Task,"Muresan, Diana","['Reddmann, L.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Conflict resolution is an inherent aspect of human interactions, representing an essential skill for achieving desirable outcomes. Moreover, recognizing individual differences during conflict may help understand the origins of different opinions and develop targeted strategies to solve disagreements. This study investigates whether gender and age differences influence attack investment during a conflict task in which both sides compete for different reasons. Based on research showing that women display less preference for competition, I predicted that women invest less in attack than men. Similarly, considering studies on the risk-averse behavior of older generations, I expected older individuals to invest fewer resources in attack than younger people. Three hundred one participants performed an online computer-based decision-making game following the outline of the attacker-defender contest. Participants were randomly assigned to the attacker or defender role. Depending on the role, the tasks involved deciding how to use monetary units (MU) to attack the opponent or protect one’s endowment. Attack investment was defined as the amount of MU assigned to overpower the opponent by obtaining their resources. The results contradicted the predictions, as age and gender were not significant predictors of attack investment. Therefore, this study challenges potential stereotypes claiming aggressive behavior to be more prevalent for a particular age group or gender. I discuss factors such as revising the research design and considering other individual differences that may impact the results’ significance. Altogether, recognizing and leveraging people’s unique characteristics may benefit interactions by encouraging the work toward achieving beneficial results for all parties involved.","['asymmetrical conflict', 'attack investment', 'gender', 'age']"

Deze vragenlijst is beantwoord door elf personeelsleden van de school. Over de scores op de vragenlijst zijn de gemiddelden en spreiding per schaal berekend. Uit deze berekeningen kwam naar voren dat de school de elementen woordenschat en achtergrondkennis, leesmotivatie en leesstrategieën het meest belangrijk vinden voor hun doelgroep. Technisch lezen wordt minder belangrijk gevonden en wordt vanwege grote niveau verschillen nog apart van begrijpend lezen behandeld. Verder blijkt er een grote wens te zijn naar het creëren van een rijkere taalomgeving. Tenslotte wordt ook interactie minder belangrijk gevonden, omdat het voor een deel van de doelgroep niet haalbaar is om samen te werken.

This study aimed to evaluate Dutch translations of these questionnaires (the PIQ-NL, the EBI-NL, and the PIS-NL) on their psychometric properties. Methods: A cross-sectional Internet-based survey was completed by 347 participants. Test dimensionality, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and criterion, concurrent, convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity were assessed. Results: Preliminary evidence was found for unidimensional factor structures of the EBI-NL and the PIS-NL. Several viable factor structures were found for the PIQ-NL. All questionnaires displayed good internal consistency, although subscale scores for the PIQ-NL ought not to be reported due to limited subscale reliability. The PIQ-NL and the EBI-NL displayed good test-retest reliability. All questionnaires showed good criterion validity, good concurrent validity with changes in satisfaction with life, and good discriminant validity with the Dutch Mystical Experiences Questionnaire (MEQ30). The EBI-NL showed poor discriminant validity with the PIQ-NL, and acceptable discriminant validity with the PIS-NL. All questionnaires were better at predicting changes in life satisfaction than the Dutch MEQ30, although the EBI-NL did not contribute unique variance in these predictions beyond the PIQ-NL and the PIS-NL. Implications: These findings suggest the PIQ-NL, the EBI-NL, and the PIS-NL all reliably measure a construct, but the construct validity of these measures needs to be further investigated.",
The Anterior Cingulate Cortex Activity in response to Stress in young adults with Childhood Experiences of Threat and Deprivation,"Boer, Robin de","['Harmelen, A. van', 'Buimer, E.E.L']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Experiences of childhood adversity are adverse experiences during childhood, such as abuse, neglect, poverty, and family dysfunction. These adverse experiences might make individuals vulnerable to mental health problems through their effect on brain development and brain functioning. Different dimensions of childhood adversity could have different effects on the brain and mental health. The exact mechanisms through which childhood adversity is related to the brain are not clear yet. The current study investigated the role of total childhood adversity, threat, and deprivation on anterior cingulate cortex-activity in response to stress in young people of age 16-26 (N=60). A cumulative approach was used to look at the role of total childhood adversity on anterior cingulate cortex-activity, a dimensional approach investigated the separate roles of the two dimensions threat and deprivation. Participants filled out a retrospective questionnaire about childhood adversity experiences (CTQ) and underwent a stressful fMRI task (MIST). Childhood adversity, threat and deprivation were expected to show a negative relationship with anterior cingulate cortex-activity in response to stress. The current study showed no evidence for a relationship between total childhood adversity and anterior cingulate cortex-activity in response to stress, nor for a relationship between the separate dimensions of threat and deprivation and anterior cingulate cortex-activity in response to stress. More research is needed to further study the underlying mechanisms by which childhood adversity is associated with brain development to help improve mental health in young people.","['childhood adversity', 'threat', 'deprivation', 'anterior cingulate cortex', 'ACC-activity', 'functional imaging']"

Learning in Real-Life and Virtual Navigation Games in Mbendjele BaYaka Children,"Thurston, Ellie","['Janmaat, K.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Human navigation is an ability central to many activities. A prevalent hypothesis for different navigation strategies is the cognitive maps hypothesis, which is a complex navigation strategy that relies on survey knowledge of the environment and involves the formation of mental representations, allowing navigators to efficiently and flexibly navigate through different strategies to reach any target location. Learning plays a crucial role in the development of navigation abilities, with individual differences observed. This thesis aims to explore the relationship between learning and navigation performance in real-life and virtual environments among Mbendjele BaYaka children, a hunter-gatherer community from the Congo Basin that relies on daily navigation for collecting food and has little experience with technology. I will focus on travel speed, contributing to our understanding of the suitability of virtual reality (VR) for spatial navigation research. The virtual navigation experiment involved children playing a computer game to find and collect food items in a three-dimensional virtual environment. The real-life navigation experiment included partially the same children participating in a real-life honey-finding game. Both experiments have been set up to investigate different spatial skills and their impact on navigation performance among children ranging in age from 4 to 16. My research took advantage of the fact that certain navigation tasks in this experiment were identical, namely repeated returns to the same location. The research investigates the travel speed of children, using linear mixed models to analyse the effect of trial number on spatial learning while controlling for age and comparing their spatial performances in real and virtual environments. The results showed that trial number and session had different effects in each setting, and there was no correlation between real-life and virtual navigation performance. This shows that more research is needed to improve study design, to make environments more similar, and to make reward moments more congruent.","['navigation', 'travel speed', 'learning', 'virtual reality', 'VR', 'real-life', 'hunter-gatherer', 'Mbendjele BaYaka']"
Nadenken over je toekomst(ige zelf) Een onderzoek naar de toepassing van een app-interventie op de concepten consideration of future consequences en future self-identification,"Dongen, Jolinda van",['Nina Krupljanin'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Consideration of future consequences (CFC) and future self-identification (FSI) play crucial roles in the psychosocial development and well-being of young individuals. Promoting CFC and FSI can lead to positive outcomes, including improved health, better financial management, and reduced likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. This study aims to examine the changes in CFC and FSI resulting from an intervention and their correlation with age. The original sample consisted of 130 participants aged 17 to 39 years (M = 19.51; SD = 2.642) of whom 93.1% were women and 6.9% were men. A multiple linear regression was conducted to investigate whether the level of CFC could be predicted by FSI and age. Additionally, changes in CFC and FSI following an app-based intervention were assessed. The findings reveal a significant effect of FSI on CFC and a significant increase in FSI after the app-based intervention. This suggests that FSI plays a vital role in promoting future-oriented thinking, and the app intervention effectively enhances FSI. Identifying and fostering FSI can be a valuable strategy for improving future-oriented thinking. Although not all results were statistically significant, the substantial effect of FSI following the app intervention indicates promising possibilities for using app interventions to enhance FSI. Future research should involve more male participants, diverse educational levels, and geographical areas to enhance generalizability. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the effectiveness and sustainability of the app intervention in promoting future-oriented thinking. Furthermore, expanding the research to different regions and cultures can provide insights into cultural variations in future-oriented thinking. Further investigation requires a broader age range to better comprehend the role of age in CFC.","['Consideration of future consequences, Future self-identification, Age, App-based intervention']"

Voorkomen is beter dan genezen: Een onderzoek naar de preventie van overlastgevend gedrag in Leiden-Noord,"Claassen, Veerle","['Nas, C.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Rondhangen kan gezien worden als een normale bezigheid onder jongeren en maakt deel uit van de adolescentie, de overgangsperiode in de ontwikkeling tussen de jeugd en de volwassenheid. Toch kan het zo zijn dat rondhangen overslaat in overlast, gedragingen die jongeren vertonen en die door de omgeving als hinderlijk of overlastgevend worden ervaren. In dit onderzoek werd getracht antwoord te geven op de vraag: “Welke interventie- en preventieprogramma´s of elementen ervan zijn mogelijk werkzaam bij het voorkomen van overlastgevend gedrag van jongeren tussen de 12 en 16 jaar?” Deze vraag is ontstaan in opdracht van SOL, een jonge, brede welzijnsinstelling, en werd specifiek beantwoord voor de wijk Leiden-Noord. Er werd antwoord op deze vraag gegeven aan de hand van literatuuronderzoek en acht semigestructureerde interviews die zijn afgenomen bij medewerkers van SOL en ketenpartners die werken met overlastgevende jeugd in Leiden-Noord. In de literatuur is gezocht naar effectieve elementen van interventies. De dataverzameling, in de vorm van interviews, diende voor het scheppen van een realistisch beeld van de praktijk en de praktische onderbouwing in het beantwoorden van de vraag.   Uit het literatuuronderzoek kwam naar voren dat preventieprogramma’s elementen bevatten die effectief kunnen zijn in het voorkomen van overlastgevend gedrag. Bovendien is het belangrijk om bij het kiezen van en gedurende de interventie rekening te houden met de persoonlijke omstandigheden en behoeften een individu. Uit de gevonden interventies bleek dat het opbouwen van een vertrouwensband met professionals, vrijetijdsbesteding in de vorm van positieve activiteiten, het verbeteren van opvoedvaardigheden van ouders en het aanleren van sociaal-emotionele competenties mogelijk effectief kunnen zijn voor de preventie en aanpak van overlastgevend gedrag. Gedragscontacten en modeling kunnen mogelijk ingezet worden om dit doel te bereiken. Uit de interviews met professionals kwamen veelal dezelfde aspecten naar voren, met twee aanvullende onderwerpen die in het literatuuronderzoek niet aan bod kwamen, namelijk groepsdruk en het creëren van meer ontmoetingsplekken voor jongeren. Deze worden door de professionals als belangrijk aspecten voor de preventie en aanpak van overlastgevend gedrag gezien.   Beperkingen van dit onderzoek zijn dat tijdens de interviews niet bij elk gesprek elk onderwerp aan bod is gekomen, er sprake was van een beperkt aantal participanten en dat verschillende onderzoekers de interviews afnamen. Ook zijn niet alle gevonden interventies voldoende getoetst op effectiviteit. Voor eventueel vervolgonderzoek lijkt de ouderbetrokkenheid van de jongeren een belangrijke factor te zijn die verder onderzocht kan worden. Tevens kan een grotere steekproef en mogelijke uitbreiding naar andere steden ervoor zorgen dat er een meer gegeneraliseerd beeld verkregen kan worden van de werkzaamheid van interventie- en preventieprogramma’s ter preventie van overlastgevend gedrag onder jongeren.",

Op basis van deze wens is een onderzoek ontwikkeld met als doel het vergelijken van De Noordwijkse Methode met de Zelfdeterminatietheorie en vast te stellen of er een verband is tussen lesgeef-enthousiasme en het toepassen van elementen uit De Noordwijkse Methode die aansluiten bij de Zelfdeterminatietheorie. Hierbij is specifiek gekeken naar de midden- en bovenbouw: groep 4 tot en met 8. Om antwoord te kunnen geven op deze vragen is middels een deskonderzoek onderzocht in hoeverre De Noordwijkse Methode de drie basisbehoeften van de Zelfdeterminatietheorie stimuleert. Ook is een vragenlijst afgenomen onder docenten van De Noordwijkse Methode. In deze vragenlijst werden de constructen lesgeef-enthousiasme en toepassing van de motivatie elementen gemeten. Uit de resultaten van het deskonderzoek bleek dat de talentontwikkeling, vakaterliers, inzet van leerdoelen, schoolstructuur, koppeling van de belevingswereld, persoonlijke ontwikkeling en het klas -en schoolklimaat een of meerdere basisbehoeften uit de ZDT stimuleren. Het correlationeel onderzoek toonde aan dat de aangepaste vragenlijst een hoge interne betrouwbaarheid had en dat er geen sprake was van nesting op schoolniveau. Na het doen van een Spearman’s Rho-analyse op de 22 valide responses kon geconcludeerd worden dat er geen significant verband was tussen de toepassing van de motivatieelementen en het lesgeef-enthousiasme. De opdrachtgever heeft naar aanleiding van deze resultaten 4 praktische aanbevelingen en een aanbeveling voor vervolgonderzoek gekregen.",
The Link Between Covid-19 Fear and Alcohol Consumption Among University Students: The Potential Moderating Role of Perceived Parenting Styles,"Zimmer, Lisa",['Oana Georgiana Rus-Oswald'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"This study examined the link between Covid-19 fear and alcohol consumption in university students and the moderating role of perceived parenting styles. Participants aged 18 to 41 (N = 153) completed an online questionnaire during the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2021 and answered demographic questions by assessing Covid-19 fear, alcohol consumption and perceived parenting styles. All participants suffered from stress problems and/or mood problems. The results showed a non-significant association between Covid-19 fear and alcohol consumption. A non-significant association was found for none of the perceived parenting styles and alcohol consumption either. Also, results could not find a significant moderating role of perceived parenting styles for the link between Covid-19 fear and alcohol consumption. Thus, most likely due to a reduced sample size and a homogenous sample, this study did not find significant associations. However, results revealed significant positive associations between variables relating to social context and alcohol consumption. Future studies could evaluate a more heterogenous sample to develop strategies to prevent alcohol misuse as a coping style in challenging times and explore the relevance of perceived parenting styles in this context.","['alcohol consumption, Covid-19 pandemic, Covid-19 fear, perceived parenting styles, university students']"

"Exploring the Impact of Prediction-Making on Learning: Age-Dependent Interactions and the Role of the Striatum, Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), and Hippocampus","Hoppen, Eva","['Jolles, D.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Understanding how young adolescents and young adults learn can give important insight to improve education. A way to enhance learning in educational practice is the use of Generative learning strategies (GLS’s), such as generating predictions. The present study aims to investigate whether learning by making predictions or repeating is more effective. It also seeks to examine potential interactions between age and instructional methods and the role of curiosity. Additionally, the neural mechanisms are explored, to gain better understanding of learning processes across ages. In the first study a numerical fact learning task was used to compare learning in two conditions (repeat vs. generating predictions) across young adolescents (11-13 years) and young adults (20-25). In the second study the same paradigm was used in an fMRI setting to explore neural correlates involved in different instructional conditions (repeat vs. prediction). Main findings showed that adults score higher in both conditions compared to adolescents. However, adolescents benefited more from generating predictions compared to adults. For adults no difference between the two conditions was found in the first study, whereas repeating improved learning in the second study. The second study found extended activation in the ACC, hippocampus and striatum in the prediction condition, compared to repetition. No effect was found for curiosity on learning. Together the two studies suggest that generating predictions can be an effective strategy for promoting learning for children, whereas mnemonic strategies such as repetition might be more effective for adults The results highlight the importance of considering age-related differences in instructional strategies related to their underlying meta-cognitive abilities and neural correlates. Further research is needed to investigate to what extend different underlying meta cognitive functions (such as feedback processing, surprise and curiosity) contribute to the effectiveness of generating predictions.","['Generative learning strategies, Prediciton, Learning, Age, Curiosity, Striatum, Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), Hippocampus']"
Online offers: The effect of time pressure on purchase intentions and the evaluation of the provider,"Verdonk, Guillemette","['Wit, A.P.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The present study examines the impact of time pressure on purchase intentions, focusing on several process variables including perceived pressure by the provider of the product, evaluation of the provider of the product, perceived product value, anticipated regret of action and anticipated regret of inaction. Additionally, the study explores whether individual levels of fear of missing out (FOMO) and dispositional reactance moderate these effects. The results indicate that when participants are subjected to high time pressure, they experience heightened pressure from the provider, display less favorable evaluations of both the provider and the product, and have a weaker intention to purchase the product immediately, than under to low time pressure. Participants experiencing high time pressure also anticipate more regret if they were to purchase the product and less regret if they would decide not to purchase the product, which contributes to their reduced intention to purchase the product immediately. Furthermore, the results showed that FOMO and dispositional reactance did not moderate the relationship between time pressure and purchase intentions. A practical implication of the present results is that high time pressure may not always promote immediate purchasing behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion on future research directions.",
Een onderzoek naar het verband tussen de geschiedenis van mishandeling bij ouders en sensitiviteit tegenover hun kinderen met stress als mediator.,"Demirbacak, Serge",['Dr. M. Linting'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,nl,"Child abuse has many different effects on the development of a child. One such consequence is that parents who have suffered from child abuse in their early life are more likely to be less sensitive towards their own children than parents who have not experienced child abuse. A key component herein is most likely the amount of stress that abused children have experienced throughout their life in general. A study has been done regarding the relationship between the sensitivity of a parent who has been subject to child abuse and their sensitivity towards their own children. More specifically this study has looked into whether stress acts as a mediator between these two variables. To provide an answer to the research question 114 parent-child pairs have taken part in this study, ninety percent of which were mothers. On average, the children in these pairs were 19,2 months old. Two at-home visits have been held prior to the gathering of data. Whether the parents had experienced child abuse has been derived from Childhood Trauma Questionnaire that said parents had filled in. Their sensitivity has been indexed through observation with the Ainsworth Maternal Sensitivity Scale. Stress has been indexed based on the negative affect of the PANAS questionnaire. This study implies that parents who have been abused do not display different amounts of sensitivity towards their children as to parents who had not been abused, the same applies for parents who had experienced more stress, indicating that stress does not function as a mediator between the variables. The results contradict the hypotheses, which might be a consequence of protective factors, socioeconomic status and different forms of child abuse. Follow-up research might be focussed on these three factors in order to eventually lessen the amount of child abuse. Sensitiviteit is het vermogen van een ouder om signalen van een kind te ontvangen, deze goed te interpreteren en prompt en gepast op deze signalen te reageren (Ainsworth, Bell, & Stayton, 1974). Wanneer de ouder sensitief is, kan het kind zich veilig hechten aan de ouder. Een kind dat veilig gehecht is aan zijn of haar ouder, leidt mogelijk tot positieve kinduitkomsten (Malmberg et al., 2016). Voorbeelden van positieve kinduitkomsten zijn het ontwikkelen van meer zelfvertrouwen en een positievere omgang met leeftijdsgenoten waardoor zij hechtere vriendschappen kunnen opbouwen (Schneider, Atkinson, & Tardif, 2001). Wanneer de ouder insensitief is, kan dit leiden tot een onveilige gehechtheid van het kind aan de ouder. Een kind dat onveilig gehecht is, heeft een grotere kans om negatieve kinduitkomsten te ontwikkelen (Malmberg et al., 2016). Voorbeelden van deze negatieve kinduitkomsten zijn internaliserende problemen, als depressie en angst (Groh et al., 2012) en externaliserende problemen, als agressie en ongehoorzaamheid (Malmberg et al., 2016). Het is van belang om ouders met een geschiedenis van mishandeling te ondersteunen, aangezien de kans groter is dat zij hun eigen kinderen zullen mishandelen (Jaffee et al., 2013; Madigan et al., 2019; Gibert et al., 2009). De kans is dan groter dat zij insensitief en intrusief zijn tegenover hun eigen kinderen (Fuchs, Möhler, Resch, & Kaess, 2015). Hierdoor kan kindermishandeling overgedragen worden van generatie op generatie. Het fenomeen dat ouders die zelf kindermishandeling hebben meegemaakt en hun eigen kinderen mishandelen, wordt de cycle of abuse genoemd. Zo blijkt dat de sensitiviteit van een ouder verstoord kan worden door het meemaken van kindermishandeling (Fuchs et al., 2015). Feldman (2015) beschrijft dat ouders die in hun jeugd mishandeling hebben meegemaakt, moeite hebben met twee aspecten van sensitiviteit; (1) zij hebben moeite met het gepast waarnemen, ervaren en aanvoelen van de emoties van de kinderen en (2) de ouders ervaren moeite met het cognitief waarnemen van de behoefte van het kind. Het moeite hebben met deze twee aspecten van sensitiviteit, kan worden verklaard door onder andere de methylatie in het brein (Feldman, 2015). Methylatie is het binden van een methyl proteïne aan het DNA dat ervoor zorgt dat een bepaald gebied van het gen niet getranscribeerd kan worden (Feldman, 2015). Hierdoor wordt dit gebied van het gen non-actief gemaakt en kan het zijn functie niet meer uitoefenen. Deze verandering kan ervoor zorgen dat de ouder minder sensitief is.","['Kindermishandeling, sensitiviteit, stress, cycle of abuse']"
De werkzame (en niet werkzame) elementen van OBIC-Ouderbegeleiding,"Baars, Anne-Sophie","['Stoltenborgh, M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Dit adviesrapport richt zich op het onderzoek naar de werkzame elementen van OBIC-Ouderbegeleiding (OBIC), een interventie die zich nog in de beginfase bevindt. Doel: Het doel is om een advies op te stellen dat bijdraagt aan de verbetering van OBIC, met als uiteindelijk doel gezinnen zo goed en passend mogelijk te ondersteunen bij hun problematiek middels deze interventie. Onderzoeksmethode: De data is verzameld door middel van een literatuurstudie naar emotieregulatie, zelfcompassie en mindful parenting en door middel van twee online focusgroepen. In de literatuurstudie worden de drie belangrijkste onderliggende concepten van OBIC onderzocht. Daarbij is gekeken naar wat bekend is over deze concepten, én hoe de bevindingen van de literatuurstudie kunnen bijdragen aan een wetenschappelijke onderbouwing van OBIC. Daarnaast hebben twee focusgroepen plaatsgevonden waarin trainers van OBIC (n=5) werd gevraagd naar welke elementen van OBIC (oefeningen, opzet etc.) volgens hen toepasbaar en bruikbaar waren in de praktijk en welke niet. Resultaten: Uit het literatuuronderzoek is gebleken dat een goede beheersing van emotieregulatie, zelfcompassie en mindful parenting leidt tot een verbetering van de ouder-kind relatie en het welzijn van de ouder. Ook leidt een goede beheersing van deze concepten tot een afname van probleemgedrag van het kind. Tijdens de focusgroepen kwam naar voren dat de trainers een aantal elementen als bruikbaar en toepasbaar ervaren, zoals het Genogram en Poppetje positief & Poppetje negatief, maar ook een aantal niet/minder. De belangrijkste elementen die hierbij genoemd werden, waren de Diagnostische imaginaties en de opbouw van OBIC. Conclusie: Concluderend, volgens de OBIC-trainers en de literatuur bevat de OBIC een aantal werkzame elementen. De Diagnostische imaginatie wordt als bruikbaar gezien door de diepgang die hiermee bereikt wordt bij ouders. In de Diagnostische imaginatie wordt gewerkt aan een hogere zelfcompassie en mindful parenting. Daarnaast wordt het Genogram door trainers als bruikbaar en toepasbaar gezien doordat het op een snelle en duidelijke manier inzicht in het familiesysteem geeft. Ook met het Genogram wordt gewerkt aan zelfcompassie en mindful parenting. Verder werd het Poppetje-positief/Poppetje-negatief ook benoemd als werkzaam element. Dit is ook waardevol volgens de literatuur, want bij dit element wordt gewerkt aan emotieregulatie. Ook is uit het empirisch onderzoek gebleken dat de trainers de elementen Vijfvragen methode en de Video van shark music werkzame elementen vinden. De elementen Brief aan je ouders, de Zon en de Piramide werden daarentegen als niet werkzaam gezien. Dit geldt ook voor de video's in de online omgeving door de lange duur hiervan. Advies: Op basis hiervan is een advies opgesteld betreffende de informatiestroom naar de trainers, een duidelijk stappenplan van OBIC voor de trainers, het inkorten van video’s, een community opbouwen en het inkorten van OBIC en Diagnostische imaginaties.

"The effect of early life stress and parental support on heart rate variability of adolescents with and without depression, during rest and during social interaction with their parents: An exploration within the research context of the RE-PAIR research project","van Geffen, Annelot",['Prof. dr. Elzinga'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Education and Child Studies (MSc),Master thesis,en,"Introduction Low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is associated with depression in adolescents. Early Life Stress (ELS) and social interaction are factors affecting HRV and might play a role in the pathophysiological mechanism through which depression manifests. Objective This study aims to disentangle what role HRV, ELS and social interaction with the parent play in the development of adolescent depression. Specifically, we examine the mediating role of HRV in the association between ELS and depression, and the moderating effect of parental support on this relationship. Additionally, we investigate the effect of parental support on HRV changes during a social interaction task with the parent involving an emotional story sharing. Methods The sample involved 22 adolescents with depression and their parents and the healthy control group consisted of 65 adolescents with their parents. Measures were collected during their visit to the lab, where participants filled out questionnaires and HRV was collected during rest and during the social interaction task with the parent. Statistical analysis involved a moderated mediation analysis and mixed-design repeated measures ANOVA. Results Both ELS and HRV (father) predicted depression. However, HRV did not mediate the association between ELS and depression, and parental support did not moderate this relation. HRV decreased during social interaction from baseline, however this difference was not associated with depression or with parental support during interaction. Conclusion Although the Neurovisceral Integration model proposes that low HRV is linked to depression as a consequence of ELS, our findings did not support this hypothesis. Nevertheless, it is important to note that future research with larger samples should be conducted and should consider other indices of HRV as these form important limitations in our design.","['Adolescent depression, Heart Rate Variability, Parental Support, Early Life Stress, Social Interaction Task, Neurovisceral Integration Model, Polyvagal Theory']"
Unravelling the gut brain axis: associations between gut microbiome and brain volume in the pediatric population-based study,"Troost, Savannah","['Ghita, I.A.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychology (MSc),Master thesis,en,"The gut microbiome is comprised of the bacteria, viruses, and fungi that reside in the gastrointestinal system. These have been linked to a weakened immune system, and the increased presence of negative health conditions like infectious diseases, inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune diseases. Research is increasingly focusing on the relationship between the gut microbiome and the brain. This has facilitated the development of the gut-brain axis concept, which explores how the gut microbiome can affect the brain. Despite the growing attention to this topic, the relationship between the two remains largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate the link between gut microbiota and overall brain volume as well as the volume of specific brain structures. This study used a sample of 9–11-year-old children derived from the Generation R Study (n = 1,531), which has recently become the largest pediatric study with microbiome and neuroimaging data. This study found that lower gut microbiome diversity did not significantly predict total intracranial volume (β = 0.003, p = .904), white matter volume (β = -0.015, p = .530) and gray matter volume (β = -0.001, p = .970). Similarly, the study did not identify any significant predictions between the gut microbiome and smaller brain structure volumes (i.e., structures of the limbic system and prefrontal cortex). Although a microbiome significant, weak regression coefficient was found with the medial orbitofrontal region (β = -0.041, p = .039), it did not withstand correction for multiple testing. These findings were contrarily to previous animal models as well as small human studies providing evidence for associations between gut microbiome and brain structure. In conclusion, using the largest sample to date, we could not identify strong significant predictions between gut microbiome diversity and brain volume in children. Future research repeated measures will be crucial in determining any links between the gut microbiome and brain development from childhood to adulthood.","['gut-brain axis, gut microbiome, brain volume, neuroimaging, pediatric']"

However, using oral contraception (OC) comes with a number of reported side effects, one being significant mood deterioration and depressive symptoms. Research is divided concerning the question of whether such a relationship between OC and depressive symptoms actually exists and points to contradictory research results when investigating said relationship. One explanation for these differing study results is the existence of a moderator. It has been suggested that personality might act as such a moderator. The present study aims to investigate further whether personality indeed moderates the relationship between OC and depressive symptoms. Personality was split into the Big-Five personality factors Neuroticism, Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness. Participants were 515 females aged 18-29 and were divided into two groups. One that stated to take OC and one that only uses physical contraception. They received the Big-Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess their personality and their depressive symptomatology, respectively. Results showed no relation between OC and depressive symptoms and no moderation effect of any personality factor on said relationship. Therefore, the present study shows no signs of personality influencing the relationship between OC and depressive symptoms. However, it has been found that Neuroticism and Conscientiousness were both significantly related to depressive symptoms. Limitations, study implications, and directions for future research are discussed.","['Contraception', 'Gender', 'Sex', 'Oral Contraception', 'Depression', 'Personality', 'Big Five']"
Werken met vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking: De mening van professionals,"Segers, Merel Joanne","['Lotz, A.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Pedagogische wetenschappen (BSc),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking (LVB) worden in onderzoek naar vaders vaak over het hoofd gezien, terwijl de rol van vaders in de opvoeding in de afgelopen decennia veranderd is. Vaders zijn meer betrokken bij de opvoeding en in het leven van hun kind(eren) (Mesman & Vermeer, 2017). Wanneer vaders een LVB hebben, is het van belang dat professionals passende ondersteuning bieden (Van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2022b). Dit onderzoek geeft een overzicht van de ervaringen en knelpunten die professionals ervaren in het werken met vaders met een LVB. De volgende vragen staan in dit onderzoek centraal: ‘Wat is er in de literatuur bekend over de ervaringen van professionals in het werken met vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking?’ en 'Wat zijn de ervaringen en knelpunten van professionals die werken met vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking?'. Het onderzoek omvat een literatuuronderzoek en zeven semigestructureerde diepte-interviews met professionals die werken met vaders met een LVB. De bevindingen van de interviews zijn gecodeerd aan de hand van thema’s die in de transcripten naar voren komen. Uit de literatuur komen een aantal risicofactoren naar voren die aanwezig zijn bij vaders met een LVB. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn een slechte mentale en fysieke gezondheid en een lage sociaaleconomische status (SES) (Emerson, 2015). Ook worden kenmerken van vaders met een LVB benoemd die bijdragen aan de ervaringen en knelpunten van professionals die werken met deze vaders. In de literatuur wordt benoemd dat vaders met een LVB minder vaardig zijn in cognitief en adaptief functioneren en een laag IQ hebben (Pratt & Greydanus, 2007). Negatieve ervaringen die professionals hebben in het werken met vaders met een LVB, zijn gerelateerd aan de samenwerking tussen professional en vader met een LVB, maar ook tussen professionals onderling. Daarnaast worden het hebben van een lage mate van begrip en minder goede communicatievaardigheden van vaders met een LVB als lastig ervaren door de professional (Joha, 2004). Negatieve ervaringen die benoemd worden door vaders met een LVB zijn dat ze zich weggeduwd en buitengesloten voelen. Vertrouwen, positieve aanmoedigingen en goed georganiseerde hulpverlening kunnen deze negatieve ervaringen verminderen (Theodore et al., 2018). In het empirisch onderzoek hebben professionals een aantal ervaringen en knelpunten benoemd. Positieve ervaringen die professionals hebben in de samenwerking met vaders met een LVB, zijn de eerlijkheid en openheid van vaders met een LVB. Ook de emotionele expressie van deze vaders en de liefde en betrokkenheid die vaders met een LVB tonen naar hun kinderen vormen positieve ervaringen van professionals. Negatieve ervaringen die werden benoemd, zijn moeilijkheden in de communicatie, beperkt reflectievermogen, slechte emotieregulatie, lage intelligentiequotiënt en problemen in de samenwerking binnen het gezin. Ook benoemen professionals risico- en beschermende factoren van vaders met een LVB. SES, mentale gezondheid en omgeving kunnen bevorderend of belemmerend werken voor vaders met een LVB zelf en de samenwerking tussen de professional en de vader met een LVB. Daarnaast geven zij aan dat het bevorderen van betrokkenheid van vaders in het gezinsondersteuningsproces een manier is om het competentiegevoel van vaders met een LVB te versterken, waardoor de samenwerking tussen professional en vader met een LVB verbetert. Op basis van het onderzoek is geadviseerd om te kijken naar de rol van de vader binnen een gezin om knelpunten in de samenwerking tussen vaders met een LVB en professionals te voorkomen. Ook wordt geadviseerd om meer educatie te verzorgen voor professionals op het gebied van vaders met een LVB. Daarnaast is het van belang om knelpunten op organisatorisch vlak te voorkomen. Tenslotte is uit dit onderzoek naar voren gekomen dat het van belang is dat de juiste hulp geboden wordt aan vaders met een LVB.","['Professionals', 'Vaders met een licht verstandelijke beperking']"

As children’s gender and adults’ gender-emotion biases predict variation in other socialization behaviours, we explored whether these factors would predict adults’ facial responses to children’s anger expressions in the present study. Furthermore, we investigated whether learning contextual information about the children would modulate adults’ responses using a within-subjects study design. Fifty-five participants (46 women, mean age = 21 years) viewed neutral-to-angry morphs while their facial responses were recorded using electromyography. This task was repeated after they learned to associate the children with internalizing or externalizing behaviours. Gender-emotion bias was measured using a modified implicit association test (IAT). Prior to the learning task, adults showed a pattern of corrugator (frown) activation and deactivation in response to children’s anger. Neither children’s gender nor adults’ bias predicted facial responses. After the learning task, a similar pattern of corrugator activity was nonsignificant in response to girls. Adults showed greater corrugator deactivation in response to boys, although neither their gender bias nor children’s behaviour predicted facial responses. These findings provide more evidence that learning about children’s social context can modulate adults’ facial responses to children’s emotional expressions. The implications for research on gendered emotion socialization are discussed.",

The role of perception of social mobility and system justification in prosocial behaviour: To what extent does system justification mediate the relationship between perception of social mobility and prosocial behaviour?,"Baban, Taro",['Leticia Retorre Micheli'],2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Social mobility has dominantly been termed the extent to which we believe mobility between socioeconomic positions is possible. Researchers have recently been interested in the effect of perception of social mobility, including the general trend of social mobility. Studies have found that the perception of increased inequality between the rich and the poor decreased satisfaction and trust in the government. This suggests a link between perception of social mobility and system justification, which was confirmed by Day and Fiske (2017). People who have successfully moved up in the social ladder, tend to be more ambivalent about the struggles of those in need. I thus expected to find a relationship between perception of social mobility and prosocial behaviour as mediated by system-justification. I therefore recruited 151 participants to answer a questionnaire on Qualtrics. The data of 148 participants revealed a strong, positive relationship between perception of social mobility and system justification; however, no other relationship was found in this study. The paper thereafter continues with a discussion of the results, their implications, and directions for future studies.",

Investigating Parental Sensitivity as a Mediator of the Sex Difference in Aggression among Boys and Girls","Elbers, Joëlle","['Wierenga, L.M.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"While parental sensitivity has been identified as an important factor in the development and maintenance of aggression, it is currently unknown whether parental sensitivity contributes to the sex difference in aggression. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether the sex difference in reactive aggression, with boys exhibiting higher levels of aggression as compared to girls, can be attributed to differential levels of parental sensitivity experienced by boys and girls. As part of this, sex differences in received parental sensitivity and reactive aggression were examined. This study included data from the Leiden Consortium on Individual Development (L-CID) and included 155 children (age range: 10.07 - 12.78 years old, 75 boys; 80 girls) and their primary parents. Reactive aggression was measured with the Dutch Reactive Proactive Questionnaire (DRPI). Parental sensitivity was measured by using the Etch-A-Sketch Task. A sex difference in reactive aggression was observed, with boys showing higher reactive aggression scores as compared to girls. No sex difference in received parental sensitivity was observed. The sex difference in aggression was not significantly mediated by parental sensitivity. The absence of a mediation effect by parental sensitivity in the observed sex difference highlights the need for further investigation of factors associated with the sex difference in aggression, in order to design interventions that promote healthier socioemotional outcomes for boys and thus their families, peers and society.","['reactive aggression, parental sensitivity, sex difference']"
The Role of Trait Anxiety in Biasing Towards Negative Feedback for Structure Learning and Reinforcement Learning,"Samula, Ella","['Wurm, F.R.']",2023,Faculty of Social & Behavioural Sciences,Psychologie (BSc),Bachelor thesis,en,"Anxiety is known to affect cognitive processes and learning. Studies have shown that people with anxiety tend to be biased towards negative feedback and learn better from it. This phenomenon has been studied in reinforcement learning, but its effect on less known structure learning has not yet been studied. Structure learning refers to inferring the structure of an ambiguous environment to which reinforcement learning adds reward values on. This research paper aims to investigate if bias towards negative feedback caused by high level of trait anxiety found in reinforcement learning is also present in structure learning. We measured reinforcement learning and structure learning capacities with three well-known and validated tasks and trait anxiety with the STAI-T questionnaire in 48 students. Negative feedback bias was quantified via the win-stay-lose-shift behaviour. Using simple linear regression analyses, we found no significant effects of trait anxiety on negative feedback bias in reinforcement and structure learning tasks. Using moderation analysis in exploratory data analysis we found no significant results of the level of trait anxiety moderating the relationship between performance in the tasks and various independent variables. This could be due to the limitations of this study, for example using a behavioural instead of a neural measure to measure negative feedback bias, which raises a question of whether behavioural measures are sensitive enough to measure negative feedback bias in trait anxiety.","['structure learning', 'representation learning', 'reinforcement learning', 'value learning', 'trait anxiety', 'STAI-T', 'win-stay/lose-shift']"

Contemporary human rights, in theory, ensure all individuals have an equal opportunity to claims their entitlements, assuming inherent systemic equality amongst all individuals and groups. However, through an analysis of the rights claims put forth by eight Tanzanian and Nigerian ethnic groups, this thesis finds that human rights fail to inclusively account for and protect the rights claims of formerly colonized groups and individuals. That is, human rights’ restrictive individualistic focus, colonial roots, and imposition of Western norms on non-Western societies have perpetuated the violence and human suffering amongst certain Tanzanian and Nigerian ethnic groups. Hence, human rights frameworks should be reconstructed in a manner that acknowledges existing structural barriers to equality and reduces its focus on individualism through improved collective rights provisions. Such reforms may enhance the recognition of an ethnic group, promote social justice, and address systemic inequalities.","['Collective Human Rights', 'Post-Colonialism', 'Cultural Identity', 'Individual Human Rights']"
