"State of the Art: EU Cultural Policy, Researching the value of cultural policy in achieving the EU 2020 targets","Quaedflieg, Sarah","['David, Maxine']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis presents the study of cultural policy and its value for achieving the EU 2020 goals. The research question is twofold: can cultural policy provide a useful addition to strict economic policy? And is cultural policy valuable for achieving the EU 2020 targets? Underlying the research question is the assumption that cultural policy is marginalized in the EU policy domain and underestimated in what it is able to achieve. The methodology consists of document analysis and semi-structured interviews. Document analysis is conducted on EU, national and civil society level, accompanied by academic literature. The outcome of this study is that cultural policy is actually a very useful addition to narrow economic policy because it is vital to creative thinking and general wellbeing. With regard to the value of culture in achieving the EU 2020 targets, it is clear that creativity, innovation, and social inclusion lie at the basis of successfully achieving the smart, sustainable and inclusive targets. The use of cultural policy in achieving the EU 2020 targets can thus be considered highly valuable. Another outcome of this study is the need to apply a more holistic approach to EU policy objectives. The central objective of the EU should be the wellbeing of its citizens, not narrow economic growth. This also includes further integration of cultural policy within the EU. Suggestions for future research are better integration through the OMC, maybe even with introducing country-specific recommendation in cultural policy. Further research should be done on how to increase the financial funds for the Creative Europe programme, the cultural and creative spillover effects and inclusion of civil society in the cultural field.","['European Union', 'Cultural Policy', 'EU 2020 targets', 'culture and society']"

The Role of Cyberspace in Interstate Tensions and Conflicts,"Trueba de Buen, Ana Martha","['Duijvesteijn, Isabelle']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"There are few inventions whose impact on political, economic and social life is comparable to that of the Internet, as an increasing number of functions are conducted online. As the report Cybersecurity Policy Making at a Turning Point highlights: “Cybersecurity strategies recognize that the economy, society and governments now rely on the Internet for many essential functions and that cyber-threats have been increasing and evolving at a fast pace” (OECD,9). Increased reliance on the Internet presents significant security challenges, as the more services that are conducted online, the greater the risks associated with cyber-attacks. This risk is intensified by cyberspace’s disregard for national borders allows cyber-threats to move rapidly across the globe and in that manner cause harm to civilians and governments (Green and Rossini, 4). Therefore, this thesis aims to develop a deeper understanding of cyberspace’s effects on global affairs, especially in regards to situations of interstate tension or conflict. Central to this study, is the question of how inter-state tensions and conflicts are being shaped by developments in cyberspace.","['Cybersecurity', 'conflict', 'tensions', 'interstate', 'cyberspace']"
"Measuring Bisexuality: Historical Methodology, Common Attributes, and a Case Study on Common Claims","Leslie, Helen","['Fynn, Jennifer']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"As research on sexual orientation progresses to new frontiers, the problem of bisexuality as a multifaceted sexual orientation, and difficulties in terms of measuring it, has become a greater issue in pop culture, research communities and political dialogue (Badgett, iv). Sexual psychologists and researchers have struggled to measure multi-sex and/or -gender attractions as they are variable in a way heterosexuality and homosexuality are not. Heterosexuality and homosexuality imply attraction to only one sex and/or gender, and so multi-sex and/or gender attractions have created a discourse on how to measure their variability. Given that sexual orientation is treated as a matter of demographics, it is important to be consistent when discussing sexual orientation; this entails being critical of conceptualizations of sexual orientation and measures used operationally, in order to determine the strengths and weaknesses of various measures in practice (Sell, 355). A central problem in measures of bisexuality in research is two-fold; first, there is literature suggesting that “researchers are often confused as to what they are studying when they assess sexual orientation” (Sell, 355). The second issue follows this claim in that researchers make generalized and thereby essentialist assumptions about bisexuality. They tend to assume that bisexuality as a concept is understood the same way by all research and civilian populations (Tannenbaum, ii). As it happens, researchers tend to make two assumptions: that their methods of measuring bisexuality are valid, and that their definitions are applicable in all social contexts (Tannenbaum, 6). In practice there is no method of measuring bisexuality that is universally applicable in research, which has created problems in terms of lack of continuity across research. Because of this, results are not necessarily comparable because of these often drastic differences. Tannenbaum has reviewed the problem of various terms’ connotations across disciplines; this includes terms such as fantasy, social preference, sex role identity, etc. (ii-iii). Tannenbaum also found that only self-identified sexual orientation label, emotional preference and time (in the context of sexual orientation surveys) maintained their meaning between sexual orientation researchers and laypeople (ii-iii). Due to the lack of continuous measures and meanings of terminology across sexual orientation research, results from these studies are currently not comparable. This paper seeks to address the absence of a universal form of measurement by reviewing the history of measuring bisexuality. It will then examine the core dimensions presented in previous research, and present a case study using a revised Klein Sexual Orientation Grid (KSOG). The case study will be used to demonstrate certain core dimensions used in research and their application in the sexual orientation research community. This paper aims to show, through the use of a case study, that a KSOG can be revised to remove the heterosexual/homosexual binary. This could then be used to measure and display differences in notions of multi-sex and/or -gender attractions, as well as show the variability of different components common in measuring sexual orientation. By creating a grid as opposed to a continuum, the multi-dimensional aspects of the KSOG avoid the dichotomy of bisexuality being somewhere between homosexual and heterosexual. The data used in the case study was collected in previous research entitled “Structural Changes Organizations Can Implement to Provide Bisexuals with Visibility and Social Comfort” (Leslie, 2016). This paper will then address the various core dimensions in sexual orientation research, discussing the positive and negative aspects of each; by doing this, the application of various dimensions in the context of sexual orientation research will be addressed. Following this, suggestions for future applications in measuring multi-sex and/or gender attractions will be discussed. The next section will survey previous literature and the history of measuring bisexuality, in order to review the methods already used, and to discuss the applicability of these measures.","['Bisexuality', 'LGBT']"
"The 'Not Yet' of Society. What does analysis of the main public and private newspapers, The Herald and The Daily News, in Zimbabwe indicate about the role of farm workers in official discourse in the period between September 2001 and September 2002?","Letcher, Georgia","['Dekker, Marleen']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Academic research on the controversial Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) in Zimbabwe during the early 2000s has continuously overlooked or generalised the experiences of farm workers, bar a few key pieces of literature. A similar trend can be found in official discourse, despite the fact farm workers were one of the main groups affected. This oversight can be attributed to their role in Zimbabwean society and the space they occupied within it; from their position under ‘domestic governance’ on Large Scale Commercial Farms (LSCF) as Blair Rutherford has outlined, to their ambiguity in terms of rights to citizenship and perceived ‘foreignness’. This study chooses to enter this discussion through analysis of two of the main print publications at the time: the state-funded The Herald and the independent The Daily News. On a superficial level, these two newspapers have been posited as being at two opposite ends of the political spectrum, with The Herald parroting state rhetoric and The Daily News advocating the views of the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). However, this study finds that these two publications were not so divergent, but instead deployed the same discourse in describing the experiences of farm workers during the height of FTLRP between 2001 and 2002. Farm worker experiences were co-opted for the benefit of those with discursive authority, for different reasons, but to the same effect. This discourse did and continues to shadow farm worker realities on-the-ground. Thus, farm workers were routinely denied space within Zimbabwe because they were not easily definable in the binary construction of the actors involved in FTLRP.","['Zimbabwe', 'farm workers', 'Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP)', 'The Herald', 'The Daily News']"
"Democracy as Historical Legacy: Localization and Contested Political Change in Indonesia, 1900 to 1960","Indriani, Mutiara","['Verver, Michiel J.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"The central theme of this master thesis is how in Indonesia the relationship between the idea of democracy and the resulting political change that can be drawn from the 1900 to 1960. By means of a definition of constitutional democracy and the models of “constitutive localization” of Amitav Acharya (2009), this research has been carried out. This showed that with constitutive localization, the idea of democracy generates indigenous political change. It is necessary to take into account how particular local actors, or “idea entrepreneurs”, adopt foreign ideas to bring about political change. Their role is viewed as an effort to reconstruct foreign ideas to ensure the ideas fit with their cognitive priors and identities, which is identified as “congruence building”. Thus, a dynamic congruence building process, or “localization”, provides opportunity for foreign ideas, which may not initially cohere with local belief and practices, to be incorporated into the local norms. In Indonesian case, “Indonesian-Javanese paradigm” serves as the platform to appropriate and adapted the idea of democracy to local conditions. This analysis can serve as a diagnostic tool to help policy makers understand where and how consolidation of democratic forces could be harmonized in Indonesia. Through gaining a better understanding of the agency role of idea entrepreneur in spreading and defending democracy, this study will hopefully become an interesting case for study of political change in world politics.","['Democracy', 'Indonesia', 'Constitutive Localization', 'Political Change']"

Deze veranderingen zijn ook terug te vinden in de hedendaagse verfilming van (klassieke) sprookjes waar thema’s als feminisme gestalte worden gegeven. De hedendaagse films Snow White and the Huntsman 2012 (Sneeuwwitje en de Jager) en Maleficent 2014 (Malafide) zijn films gebaseerd op de sprookjes Sneeuwwitje en Doornroosje, maar de makers hebben de films aangepast aan de thema’s van de 21e eeuw. Interessant is om deze producties te vergelijken met de eerste Disneyverfilmingen van beide sprookjes uit de vorige eeuw. Immers, op deze Disneyfilms is sinds de opkomst van feministische studies in literatuur en films veel kritiek gekomen en de vraag is of de nieuwe producties als Snow White and the Huntsman en Maleficent moderner en vrouwvriendelijker zijn geworden.","['Sprookjes', 'Maleficent', 'Snow White and the Huntsman']"

To what extent would implementation of Proportional Representation on 2015 UK elections change the level of representativeness in The House of Commons compared to the election outcome under the First-Past-The-Post system?,"Katircioglu, Yusuf Efe","['Duyvesteyn, Isabelle']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Level of representativeness of electoral systems have polarised the academia between the Proportional Representation (PR) and First-Past-the-Post (FPTP). The UK is one of the few examples in Europe that uses FPTP as an electoral system and it has heavily been criticised by the scholars about the lack of representativeness of such system. The 2010 General elections have triggered the debate on the level of representativeness when Liberal Democrats could not obtain the expected number of seats when compared to the vote they have won. The 2015 General election have resulted in the traditional way of having two parties dominating the parliament, but this time UKIP obtained 12% but only 1 seat, which is an example of disproportionality.This paper also calculates the possible outcome of 2015 elections if the UK was using PR as a system. Then the comparison between the two systems are conducted by using diagrams and concrete number of seats under each system. In the end, comparison of each system on the basis of representativeness is discussed with the help of the vote/seat relation.","['Electoral System', 'FPTP', 'PR', 'Proportional Representation', 'UK', '2015', 'General Elections', 'Representativeness', ""D'hondt method""]"

Student Activism in Japan: SEALDs,"Maffeo, Carola","['Mark, Ethan']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since December 2012, with the political comeback of Prime Minister Abe Shinzō, Japan has been shifting its domestic policy in a more conservative direction, while at the same time opting for an assertive foreign policy involving a more resolute and proactive defense stance. Notwithstanding the political victories reported by the Abe government on both fronts, internal opposition to the new bills has been strong and widespread, involving not only the opposition parties, but also the LDP’s coalition partner Kōmeitō and public opinion. A wide range of protests and political activities have been held in Tokyo and in other major cities throughout the country against the government’s policies; among them, those organized by the group known as SEALDs have generated the greatest interest in the media and in the public. Because SEALDs’ relevance in the wider context of civil society in Japan has not been fully investigated yet, this thesis seeks to analyze SEALDs from a comparative perspective, with a view to clarifying the social and cultural roots of the group, and its originality in the context of contemporary Japanese social movements. Such a study would shed light on the political implications of the activities of SEALDs and on their potentiality to affect policymaking and public participation in civil society in contemporary Japan.","['SEALDs', 'Japan', 'student activism', 'social movements']"

El dicho fenómeno está bien vinculado con Argentina y su historia. Hasta el día de hoy el gobierno argentino lo utiliza en cuanto a la reivindicación de las Malvinas pero el clímax del nacionalismo territorial, hasta ahora, ha sido la guerra de las Malvinas en la cual la junta militar argentina atacó a Gran Bretaña que controlaba las islas. Argentina perdió la guerra y sigue reclamando que las islas son suyas lo cual evoca los sentimientos nacionalistas entre los argentinos.

El análisis se enfocará en el punto de vista del gobierno y tendrá en cuenta la situación política de ese tiempo y la opinión publica acerca la junta militar que estaba en poder.","['Nacionalismo territorial', 'Junta militar', 'Argentina', 'Guerra de las Malvinas', 'Conflicto del Beagle', 'Opinión pública']"

Bridging the Post-Soviet and the Postcolonial. How can the Soviet colonies be located within the Postcolonial discourse? A case study of Poland and Romania,"Oleszczynski, Jaroslaw","['Baar, Monika']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis will use qualitative research methods in order to bridge the gap between the Post-Soviet and the Postcolonial studies. Over the past years Postcolonial literature began dominating Universities across the world. The theories presented by Postcolonial scholars are gaining more legitimacy in the international arena, providing an insight into the identity crisis experienced by the global society. This piece will analyse the two main concepts presented by Postcolonial scholars: the Empire and Modernity. The concepts will be examined in the light of Post-Soviet literature. The interrelation of Postcolonial theory with the narrative on Soviet dominance in Eastern Europe will unveil the extent to which U.S.S.R can be considered as a colonial Empire. The Soviet rule did not only have the negative consequences on the material and social infrastructure of Eastern European nations, the colonial power has also contributed to the creation of a stereotype of “Eastern bloc” and the belief in a clear cut divide of Europe, which also is referred as the “Iron Curtain”. Such stereotypes still inhabit the imagination of many across the world. Nevertheless such conception of Eastern Europe is inaccurate as portrayed by the comparison of the historical narratives from Romania and Poland in the later part of the thesis. The article will conclude with the manner in which these stereotypes have been resisted within and outside of the Eastern side of the “Iron Curtain””.","['postcolonialism', 'soviet studies', 'communism', 'poland', 'romania']"

To what extent is Germany’s trade-marking of its Reinheitsgebot a sign of it protecting its cultural heritage following the 1987 European Court of Justice case deeming it illegal and protectionist under EU Law?,"Clack, Zoe","['Duijvesteijn, Isabelle']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Following the 1987 ECJ court case in which the Reinheitsgebot was deemed illegal and protectionist under EU Law, this thesis explores how German brewers responded by labelling their beers as being brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot, as a way of distinguishing their beers from other imported beers. Using Roland Barthes's ideas of Signs and Jason Bosland's theory of trade-marks and culture, it was explored in depth how German beers labelling their beers essentially trade-marked their beers to allow distinction from other beers. It was argued that by doing this, German brewers were essentially protecting their cultural heritage as the Reinheitsgebot is associated with German culture-the Reinheitsgebot is seen to be of great traditional significance in Germany. However, as Germany is renowned for its great beers, it was also explored to what extent this act by German brewers was due to economic (and marketing) reasons and not necessarily for cultural heritage reasons. Other elements were also explored such as the significance of the Reinheitsgebot as well as how it is increasingly challenged by German brewers today, with many arguing that it is prohibiting German brewers from keeping up with global beer markets. Furthermore, it was also considered how the Reinheitsgebot has an international perspective-how it is recognised by international brewers and how the Reinheitsgebot is perceived abroad.","['Reinheitsgebot', 'Germany', 'Culture', 'Beer']"
How Did the American Government’s Use of Private Military Contractors Affect their Efforts in State Building in Iraq during the Bush Administration?,"Cordes, Sira","['Bloemendal, Albertine']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"During the Iraq War the American government used Private Military Companies (PMCs) to a great extent, and in doing so they inserted a previously largely unknown force into a volatile post-conflict situation without knowledge of the possible repercussions. This is especially of concern since PMCs have received a negative reputation for their involvement in Iraq, due to several scandals including prisoner abuse and war profiteering. When considering that the post-invasion mission of the United States was that of state building, it has to be examined if PMCs have affected state building. State building is thought to be one of the most important issues of our time-weak or failed states pose a threat to the international order and their neighbouring countries. This thesis examines how PMCs affected state building efforts in Iraq to provide future policy planners with more extensive knowledge of the possible ramifications of the use of PMCs. This is achieved through an analysis of factors contributing to state building, and an in-depth analysis of trust and legitimacy, as well as the effect that PMCs had upon them in Iraq. Based on these findings, recommendations for a more sustainable use of PMCs are made.","['Iraq War', 'Private Military Companies', 'State Building']"

Ash in de film en de Working Joes en Christopher Samuels in de videogame worden allemaal op verschillende manieren gerepresenteerd en laten zien dat de scheiding tussen mens en niet-mens niet altijd even duidelijk is, omdat androids ook menselijke trekjes kunnen hebben. Ik vergelijk de android ook met de cyborg, omdat beide ingaan tegen het dualistische ordeningssysteem in de Westerse samenleving.

Does Japan’s participation in the TPP create predicaments for China?,"Wei, Dannan","['Black, Lindsay']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,South and Southeast Asian Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The TPP is one of the most well-known FTAs in the world, which accounts for 40% of the world total trade amount. According to some scholars, the TPP is an instrument to contain China led by the US, rather than a high-standard FTA. In addition, Japan, as the traditional alliance of the US and the vital trade partner of China, also participates in the TPP, following negotiations. This thesis focuses on Japan’s participation in the TPP and its impact on China. The problem that this paper will endeavor to solve is whether Japan’s participation in the TPP creates predicaments for China. The studies of the TPP differ from the aspect of various countries. By analyzing and comparing the studies inside and outside of China, I hold the view that China is facing an economic predicament and, because of China’s economic influence, a political predicament that is, by contrast, less severe. However, if China’s economic influence decreases due to the economic problems that it faces, the political predicament will be hard to avoid.",
Emergence of an Alternative Left: The impact of Shinzō Abe’s constitutional reinterpretation,"Ramjiawan, Ashwin","['Wakefield, Bryce']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis will examine Abe’s push to constitutional reinterpretation and how the political left reacted to his argument by focusing on the following question: did the Japanese left-wing political actors reconsider their view on Article 9 and Japan’s current defense attitude? If the extreme political left of Japan has altered their stance on Abe and his push for reinterpretation, it means that the whole debate on Japanese defense policy is changing altogether. Therefore, Shinzō Abe might have had an impact on how Article 9 and Japan’s defense posture are perceived by the political left-wing. This will be analyzed through the model of securitization, as defined by the Copenhagen School of Security Studies. By applying this framework, this thesis will show how Abe attempts to securitize the issue of Japan’s national identity through addressing Japan’s defense capabilities and how the left-wing responds by counter-securitizing the issue of pacifism within national identity. The second goal of the thesis is to present the validity of the Copenhagen School’s framework by showing its applicability to the case of Japan’s constitutional reinterpretation. First, we shall analyze the literature on both Shinzō Abe’s reinterpretation attempt and the securitization model. Secondly, we will examine the nature of Abe’s push to constitutional reinterpretation by analyzing a book he wrote before he became prime minister and a book he wrote while he was prime minister. In this way, we can establish whether his stance has changed on reinterpreting the constitution. Then we will explore if and how Abe’s attempt for reinterpretation has reshaped the views of the political left in Japan. The effect of Abe’s push to reinterpret the constitution on popular opinion will be exposed by analyzing the phenomenon of counter-securitization by Japanese left-wing activists. We will look at in what manner the attempt has affected the left-wing in their rhetoric by examining scholarly articles on the subject. If this is the case, we might conclude that the Japanese extreme left is currently in the middle of a shift towards middle left.","['Japan', 'Abe', 'Politics', 'Constitution', 'JSDF', 'Article 9', 'reinterpretation', 'Copenhagen School', 'securitization']"
Partisan Politics and Foreign Pressure: The Ratification of the 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement in the US Congress,"Falk, Harrison","['Maat, Eelco van der']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis employs Robert Putnam’s concept of foreign pressure (“suasive reverberation”) to analyze the battle in the US Congress over the 2015 Iran nuclear accords. Drawing on the public statements of key players, journalistic sources, and the congressional record, I contend that the most important factor in determining whether undecided lawmakers voted for or against the agreement was lobbying by other states. Specifically, the survival of the deal can be credited to appeals from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, as well as to a lesser degree from Russia and China. Working in close conjunction with the Obama Administration, representatives of these states successfully pressured wavering members of Congress to support the agreement. I also argue that, counter-intuitively, the government of Israel’s suasive reverberation in opposition to the Iran accords probably contributed to the deal’s survival. The methods and rhetoric used in Israel’s lobbying were perceived as partisan and sparked a backlash among Democratic members of Congress, leading them to close ranks and vote to approve the deal. Through examination of these divergent outcomes, this paper provides empirical support for the importance of suasive reverberation and sheds light on the conditions underlying its use, success, and failure.","['suasive reverberation', 'two-level game', 'domestic politics', 'ideology', 'partisanship']"

"De legalisering van Cannabis sativa in Uruguay: Het beeld dat de Verenigde Naties, UNASUR en de Argentijnse media schetsen van het nationale imago van Uruguay","Loukes, Charlotte","['Valdivia Rivera, Soledad']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Latijns-Amerikastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In Uruguay is sinds 10 december 2013 de drug Cannabis sativa, onder het bewind van president José Mujica, gelegaliseerd. Volgens de nieuwe wet mogen gebruikers van 18 jaar en ouder daar 40 gram Cannabis sativa kopen in door de staat aangewezen winkels. Gebruikers mogen thuis tot zes planten telen en verenigingen mogen tot 90 planten per jaar telen en oogsten. Voorstanders van deze nieuwe wetgeving op het gebied van Cannabis Sativa zijn van mening dat de gereguleerde teelt en handel van deze drug zal helpen de georganiseerde misdaad te bestrijden. De Verenigde Naties kijken anders aan tegen de decriminalisering en regulering van Cannabis sativa in Uruguay; door het ondertekenen van de 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs door alle VN‐lidstaten moet deze drug als onomstotelijk illegaal worden beschouwt. De VN heeft niet alleen kritiek op de gezondheidsrisico’s van deze drug, zoals verslaving en geheugenproblemen, maar vooral op de illegaliteit als zodanig. De 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs is door alle VN‐lidstaten getekend en het is daarbij niet toegestaan zomaar unilateraal een drug te legaliseren; dit wordt gezien als een overtreding. De VN dreigt daarbij ook met sancties tegen Uruguay, maar kan deze niet opleggen door legale restricties. UNASUR probeert de VN ook te nuanceren in de vijandelijke houding die de VN aanneemt. Het beeld dat wordt geschetst door UNASUR en de VN van het nationale imago van Uruguay is overwegend negatief. Echter, door het feit dat alle UNASUR landen overwegend positief zijn, vindt dit negatieve beeld vooral plaats buiten de Latijns‐Amerikaanse regio. Het beeld dat door de Argentijnse kranten Clarín, La Nación en Página 12 in de media wordt geschetst van het nationale imago van Uruguay is overwegend positief. Uit deze kranten komt veel positief en neutraal commentaar naar voren. Zo wordt er geschreven dat Argentijnse bedrijven erover denken om Cannabis sativa te gaan produceren voor Uruguay en wordt er gespeculeerd dat Argentinië mogelijk het tweede land kan zijn dat deze drug gaat decriminaliseren. In deze kranten komen veel positieve woorden naar voren, zoals ‘la otra cara de la guerra’, ‘la hora de empezar a escuchar’, ‘otros caminos posibles’. Deze titels suggereren dat Argentinië mogelijk ook aan het kijken is naar alternatieven zoals decriminalisering en dat zij de legalisering van de drug in Uruguay ook zien als een sociaal experiment, zoals UNASUR. De negatieve kritiek kwam uit een andere hoek; de Uruguayaanse krant El País geeft aan dat zowel Argentinië als Brazilië bang zijn voor een spillover van Cannabis sativa over de grenzen.","['Cannabis sativa', 'legalisering', 'Uruguay', 'UNASUR', 'Verenigde Naties', 'Argentijnse Media', 'Nationaal imago', 'Legaliteit']"
"Mambo Ya Zamani? Current Reasons Behind Sacred Forests' Conservation in North Pare, Tanzania","Alvarez, Agustina Soledad","['Dijk, Han van', 'Kronenburg-García, Angela']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This study focuses on sacred forests in the North Pare Mountains, Tanzania, and questions the reasons behind their current conservation. In spite of not being gazetted by the State, studies show that sacred forests in North Pare have a wider variety of endemic flora and fauna and are better preserved than national forests reserves. Although they are small in size, sacred forests are thus important globally. Some scholars suggest that the reason of such high biodiversity is the local culture and religion, or traditional conservation methods, which are decelerating the process of diminishing of these small forest patches. However, these aspects are not studied in depth. This thesis seeks to investigate these ‘traditions’. Sacred forests are in fact being considered a new type of (modern) conservation model. They are considered ideal also because of local caretakers, who enable to organize conservation with low economic expenditures. I argue, however, that the environmental ethics of people in North Pare emerge from a fusion of local Pare worldviews and modern discourses of Christianity, Islam and formal education. Therefore the assumed traditional/modern dichotomy that the new conservation agenda wants to reconcile does not reflect the reality on the ground and, by misunderstanding these dynamics, policies are likely to fail. The findings of this research also clarify that sacred forests and people constitute each other. The forests, in other words, symbolize a group of people. So, new ways of linking the community and the forests can complement recent conservation efforts, which typically neglect environmental values and moral meanings that are at stake in environmental practices and are fundamental for long-term positive results.","['Sacred Forests', 'Local Ecology', 'Conservation', 'Nature-Society Dichotomy', 'Pare Worldviews', 'Tanzania']"

Brian Evenson: A movement from a position of faith to a position of unbelief,"Wagner, Isabelle","['Wall, E.G.E. van der']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Theology and Religious Studies (Master),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to document how the development of faith can be seen in the literary work of a person, who moved from belief and participation in a certain religion to skepticism and excommunication. In what follows the focus will be on Brian Evenson, author of Horror and Science Fiction, who was an active member of the Church of Latter Day Saints until he asked for his excommunication in 2000 in order to pursuit his art. Evenson’s literary output ranges over a time when he was faithful, holding a church office as a lay bishop and working for the Mormon Brigham Young University until the present day where he is very critical towards specific aspects of the LDS church and of the concept of religion in general. Brian Evenson has published 15 works of fiction in the genre of Horror and Science Fiction, thereby providing a big body of work to concider. The work of Evenson will be divided into three different parts, to better track his development; the writing published before his decision to leave the LDS church, the book that was written alongside Evenson’s choice to be excommunicated and everything written thereafter. In the pursuit of the question, how Evenson’s position to his religion and faith is displayed in all his writing a very particular focus is placed. His conflict with the church and his struggle with faith can be traced through specific reoccurring topoi in his stories and the themes, which dominate his writing. Further Evenson has repeatedly discussed how his personal life influences his writing in interviews, essays and epilogs of his books; thereby allowing to draw a connection between his religious development and writing.","['Horror Literature', 'Mormon', 'Brian Evenson', 'American Literature']"
European Union: Defence Integration,"Talman, Guido","['Cusumano, Eugenio']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"After years of integration in other sectors, the member states decided to include foreign and defence policy to EU cooperation. Therefore, it is now, after a few decades, a good moment to look critically at what has been achieved in this sector of EU defence cooperation. With this reason, this thesis will approach the question, why do the member states want defence integration to happen in smaller groups? This question can be split in multiple sub-questions. Firstly, could reaction of the member states be out of discontent of how cooperation is functioning on a EU-level? Secondly, does the EU allow the member states to continue in smaller groups, instead of moving forward as a Union? These question will be approached by using a variety of documents. For example, not only the EU perspective but also the national interests of member states and the vision of experts on defence integration should be taken into consideration as well as useful sources for this thesis. Furthermore by looking at theories of defence integration in the EU, such as, Institutionalism, constructivism and realist theory, this thesis will try to find the motives for defence integration. Using the patterns of the theory will make it easier to analyse and compare the cases that will be included in this thesis. The three selected cases are from a different scale. From cooperation on a Union-level to bilateral cooperation and integration. As a result, this thesis has to add additional information and perspectives on the integration of defence within the EU.","['Common Security Defence Policy (CSDP)', 'Defence integration', 'German defence', 'Dutch defence', 'European Defence Agency (EDA)', 'Multi-speed Europe']"

DEGUCHI NAO’S KAMIGAKARI AS FOUNDATION FOR CHARISMA AND RITUAL EFFICIENCY.,"TRIOLA, LUIGI IVAN","['Veere, Henny van der']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"The intent of this thesis is to use a case study for possible new approaches to shinshūkyō 新宗教　(“new religions”) in Japan. In particular, this thesis aims at investigating the nature of kamigakari　神懸り, loosely translatable as “divine possession”, for Deguchi Nao 出口なお　(1837-1918), foundress of the ritual organization in Japan called Ōmotokyō大本教. A close-up on the origins of kamigakari is given in order to understand better the personal circumstances around Deguchi Nao’s experience and how it functioned for her. Kamigakari was the experience through which Deguchi Nao wrote down the Ofudesaki　お筆先, a book inspired by the deity she claimed to be inside her, Ushitora no Konjin　丑寅の金神. In the book she called for radical spiritual change for people as well as for kami 神　(deities). The second chapter is dedicated to the book and its worldview. While the third chapter investigates the connections between shamanism and shinshūkyō, the last chapter analyzes the particular features of Deguchi Nao’s kamigakari, which, including the co-founder of Ōmotokyō, Deguchi Onisaburō 出口王仁三郎 (1871-1948), worked through the dual principle based on the notions of “male with a transformed nature” (henjōnanshi 変性男子), which refers to Deguchi Nao, and “female with a transformed nature” (henjōnyoshi変性女子), used to describe Onisaburō’s role.","['charisma', 'deguchi nao', 'omoto', 'japanese religions', 'shinshukyo', 'kamigakari', 'possession']"

Dutch and Swedish Again: On Interaction between Object Movement and Again-Ambiguities,"Lo, Roger Yu-Hsiang","['Cremers, Crit']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This study attempts to devise a unified account for three linguistic phenomena -- object type, object movement, and again-ambiguities -- that can be observed in Dutch and Swedish. Specifically, this study tries to untangle the interaction between theses three phenomena, as illustrated in the following Dutch sentences (in their literal reading): (1) a. Jan heeft weer de deur geopend. (repetitive/*restitutive) John has again the door opened `John opened the door again.' b. Jan heeft de deur weer geopend. (rep/res) John has the door again opened (2) a. *Jan heeft weer hem geopend. John has again it opened b. Jan heeft hem weer geopend. (rep/res) John has it again opened `John opened it again.' (3) a. Jan heeft weer een deur geopend. (rep/*res) John has again a door opened `John opened a door again.' b. *Jan heeft een deur weer geopend. John has a door again opened Comparing these three sets of sentences, it seems that the availability of the repetitive/restitutive ambiguity associated with the adverb weer `again' lies in both the type of the object and its position relative to the adverb. The unified account developed in this study has as its backbones the Mapping Hypothesis proposed by Diesing and Jelinek (1995) and a structural theory on again-ambiguities advocated by von Stechow (1995, 1996). The Mapping Hypothesis partitions a syntactic tree into the Nuclear Scope and the Restriction Clause and handles the interpretation of different object types by the object's syntactic position at LF. When the object is moved to the Restriction Clause by some object movement rule, it receives a specific reading, whereas when the object remains in the Nuclear Scope, it gets a non-specific reading. The structural theory on again-ambiguities claims that the repetitive/restitutive opposition has a syntactic origin. This theory relies heavily on a semantico-syntactic decomposition of verbs into an action and a state component, with the repetitive reading resulting from again modifying a syntactic constituent that represent an action and the restitutive reading from again a constituent that denotes a state. The current study argues that either the Mapping Hypothesis or the structural theory alone can explain only part of the data, and that only by integrating the two can we have a unified account that justifies the whole data. This unified account allows the position of the object (i.e., whether object movement applies or not) and the dual readings of again to be govern by two different mechanisms, but it also permits the two mechanisms to interact with each other so that ungrammatical constructions can be successfully ruled out. To explain the Dutch data above, we first move the objects that have a specific reading, as is often the case for definite descriptions like de deur `the door' and definite pronouns like hem `it', to the Restriction Clause and leave the objects with a non-specific reading, such as the indefinite een deur `a door' in the Nuclear Scope. Then we let weer `again' adjoin to different constituents that map onto either an action (which leads to the repetitive reading) or a state (the restitutive reading). The whole derivation just described can be represented as follows (NS stands for Nuclear Scope): (4) a. Jan heeft weer [NS de deur geopend ]. (rep/*res) John has again the door opened b. Jan heeft de deur_o [NS weer t_o geopend ]. (rep/res) John has the door again opened (5) a. *Jan heeft weer [NS hem geopend ]. John has again it opened b. Jan heeft hem_o [NS weer t_o geopend ]. (rep/res) John has it again opened (6) a. Jan heeft weer [NS een deur geopend ]. (rep/*res) John has again a door opened b. *Jan heeft een deur_o [NS weer t_o geopend ]. John has a door again opened (5a) and (6b) are rejected because the objects in them are in the wrong domain. Although (4a) is grammatical, this sentence does receive a slightly different interpretation than (4b) due to the position of the definite de deur in the Nuclear Scope. The same principles can be applied to Swedish as well, albeit only at LF instead of at S-structure as in Dutch. In future research, it will be useful if more data, especially from Icelandic, can be brought in and if we consider verbs beyond a simple open.","['Dutch', 'Swedish', 'object movement', 'Scrambling', 'Object Shift', 'again', 'ambiguity']"

It presents an analysis of the paradoxical case of the ‘samosely’, the ‘self-settlers’ that re-settled themselves back into the highly contaminated exclusion zone illegally after the incident. The analysis of the studied case and the conclusions of this research are based on a theoretical framework of philosophical and psychological literature around the notions of identity and trauma, with a specific focus on the dimension of temporality. Perceived from our perspective as paradoxical and irrational, the study of the reasons underlying the behaviour of the ‘samosely’ aims to generate a new and multifaceted understanding of trauma. Furthermore, this thesis advocates for a complexification of the notion of survivor identity that ought to be disconnected from the misuses through political agendas and biopolitical interests.","['Chernobyl', 'Trauma', 'Identity']"

MSc,"Dannhauer, Pia","['Verver, Michiel']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This paper set out to examine how successful ASEAN was in making its regional governance more inclusive and “people-oriented”, as aimed for in its charter. This rhetorical shift towards greater people empowerment can be seen as a response to such external pressures as the rising civil society, international normative pressures as well as diminishing credibility due the regional challenges faced in the 90s, an attempt to regain ground domestically as well as internationally. It must be acknowledged that by adopting rhetoric of people empowerment slow but steady successes have been achieved. Notwithstanding the progress and benefits ASEAN’s change of course and following interactions have brought, in reality rhetoric is decoupled from ASEAN’s political practices. While attempting to regain ground, the association’s intergovernmental nature and on-going tensions between more and less democratic member states prevented it from actually embracing this course. Despite its expressed goals, ASEAN has so far failed to establish clear formal interfaces for the interaction with civil society. The conflict between the principle of sovereignty and the clear advantages of adhering to global trends and domestic pressures towards integration and democratisation that ASEAN faces is important to understand this discrepancy between expressed aspirations and political reality. Within ASEAN, ever increasing regional economic integration in the region stood in contrast with nationalistic sentiments and socio-economic developmental pressures. Indeed, existent consultations with civil society seem largely to be aimed at giving greater legitimacy to the charter- that ultimately only consolidated ASEAN’s state-centred nature. Facing competing institutional logics of the more democratic and traditionally more illiberal or even authoritarian member states, a situation of institutional complexity, decoupling rhetoric from practice enabled maintenance of the stability of the ASEAN community while retaining organisational efficiency. The association remains largely inaccessible to those rendered unsuitable to its reform agenda, making it not “people-oriented”.","['civil society', 'ASEAN', 'Southeast Asia', 'decoupling']"
“House of Bureaucrats”? A comparative analysis of media-framing as predictor for EU-attitudes in the UK and Germany,"Ossmann, Luisa","['Oster, Jan']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"Since the advent of the 2014 EU Parliamentary Election, the rise of nationalist parties and growing Euroscepticism is highly visible across the continent (European Commission, 2014b). Several studies have tried to find reasons for the increased concern and distrust towards EU policies, among which are the euro-crisis, strict austerity measures and insecurities towards immigrants (Treib, 2014). It is however worth to “look beyond traditional explanations” and look into the role the media might have played and still plays (De Vreese 2007, p. 272). There is a general agreement that the media are an important source of information for the public and therefore also contribute to shaping views on EU politics. Despite this common wisdom, academic literature in that area is scarce and rather fragmented (Hawkins, 2012; De Vreese 2007). The few existing studies, however, suggest that framing in news coverage has a significant impact on people’s opinion and is key to understand Euroscepticism (e.g. Van Spanje and De Vreese, 2014; Hawkins, 2012). Since EU’s citizens and their attitudes are crucial for the future support of the project (Van Spanje and De Vreese, 2011), the topic of this thesis focuses on the role of frames, used in media coverage on EU topics as potential predictors of people’s opinions on the EU. Since journalistic cultures are different across countries and might therefore influence EU citizens differently, findings will be compared across nations. Awareness of these effects can be of practical relevance not only for academics but also for EU policy makers wishing to bridge the communicative gap between the EU’s institutions and its citizens, a starting point to enhance democratic legitimacy.","['Euroscepticism', 'Blogging', 'Framing', 'EU-attitudes', 'EU public opinion', 'EU-coverage', 'Brussels press corps', 'Eurocrisis', 'Brexit']"

An Unresolved Past in the Heart of the Caribbean: The Role of the U.S. in the Dominican-Haitian Conflict,"Storms, Sjors","['Vries, Mark de']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In the heart of the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic and Haiti occupy opposite ends of what before Columbus’s arrival in 1492 was known as Quizqueia. What has become a sun-drenched destination for globetrotting travelers, news of the harsh human rights violations in the capital and the border areas mostly goes unnoticed by many. The current humanitarian crisis is the result of a deep-rooted historical and cultural conflict pestering the two island nations ever since the arrival of the European conquistadores. The vast majority of subsequent Dominican and Haitian recorded history has been characterized by foreign domination, political turbulence and chaos-inflicting dictatorships. The native peoples of the Arawak and Taíno tribes were soon decimated by Spanish colonization and its coercive implications. Populated mainly by Spanish and French colonists and later African slaves, colonial era struggles and territory disputes have developed into nearly constant conflict between Dominican and Haitian governments. In recent years, they have culminated in a controversial Dominican Constitutional Court ruling essentially stripping citizenship from all immigrants born to undocumented parents since 1929. As a result, four generations of supposed illegal Haitian and Dominican-born Haitian immigrants are left in a worrisome legal limbo. Apart from transportation to the newly built “Welcome Centers” in the border areas, these stateless people are left in social isolation without any rights and have to fear forcible removals that take place on a constant and ongoing basis (Abiu Lopez n.p.). Amnesty International, the UN Human Rights Council and online petitions call for international intervention in stopping arbitrary deportation and racial profiling (Mathurin n.p.). More specifically, pressure is put on the U.S. government to employ its hegemonic influence to alleviate the tense political and social situation in its Caribbean backyard. Those requesting Washington’s support seem to forget its controversial role in a not so distant past. Mostly through political and economic relations, the White House has employed a vast array of foreign policy measures towards the Dominican Republic and Haiti. One of these was having the back of what may have been one of the most murderous dictators of the Americas. The U.S. both publicly and privately supported the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo throughout the Eisenhower and Kennedy administration until 1961, who developed a nationalist idea of antihaitianismo: a policy of racial discrimination and prosecution towards black inhabitants. Vestiges of this institutionalization of anti-Haitian sentiment still remain in today’s Dominican political culture and greatly backfire on the humanitarian crisis at hand.","['U.S. foreign policy', 'Dominican Republic', 'Haiti', 'Caribbean', 'Conflict', 'Dictatorship', 'Trujillo', 'Duvalier', 'Military occupation', 'Good Neighbor Policy', 'Antihaitianismo', 'Genocide', 'Anticommunism', 'Cold War']"
The Postmodern Concept of the Monster in the Contemporary Horror Film,"Nubakht, Parisa","['Leeuwen, Evert van']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Literary Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Chapter 1 – Introduction & Methodology Such modern classic horror films as The Exorcist (1973), Rosemary’s Baby (1968) and Don’t Look Now (1973) probe deeply into our fears, playing on them to provoke genuine re- sponses of terror. Beyond that, fictional horror has an impact on modern culture through con- sumption. It is a common belief that overconsumption of horror leads directly to real-world vio- lence and terror (Cooper 8). Others feel that critical arguments “that find violent fictions culpable for real-life violence are problematically deterministic: they strip agency away from the vio- lence’s human perpetrators and assign it to inanimate causal factors” (Cooper 8). As such, it is necessary to analyze works of modern horror in order to understand this blurring of reality and fiction within the genre, not only to understand horror’s place within the creative context of film but also to understand the role that horror plays in understanding ourselves and the world around us. The type of horror that is most associated with this blurring of reality and fiction is found nestled within postmodernism. Postmodern horror succeeds at playing on our fears as the “uni- verse of the contemporary horror film is an uncertain one in which good and evil, normality and abnormality, reality and illusion become virtually indistinguishable” (Pinedo, “Postmodern Ele- ments” 85). Postmodern horror plays on the viewer’s fear that they are themselves a monster – they see elements of their personality reflected in the character of the villain on the screen. This thesis focuses on the blurring of the distinction between being human and being a monster, or between good and evil, in postmodern horror cinema and critically explores the creation of the postmodern monster, which is not the “Other” but contains recognizable elements of ourselves.",['The Postmodern Concept of the Monster in the Contemporary Horror Film']

The booming economy during the Song Dynasty stimulated the recreational consumption, especially the development of comedies and dramas. Such trend contributed to the emergence and improvement of theatrical spaces. As the thriving performances boosted the dividing hierarchies of the theatrical spaces, the most talented folk artists and performers presented performances in the central stages and had opportunities to serve the court. The mutual influences between court bureau and folk artists promoted the development of the theatrical spaces, attracting merchants and vendors to do business in the theatrical spaces. In the urban literature, the related recordings were enriched with the descriptions narrating the transformation of theatrical spaces. Repeated in the urban literature with different representations, the images of theatrical spaces were represented as commercial centers or part of urban spaces. Such representations made the theatrical spaces gradually become the symbol of the dynamic urban life and the memory of urban prosperity.","['theatrical spaces', 'pleasure precincts', 'performance', 'representation', 'urban life', 'Southern Song Dynasty']"

Effects of Financial Deregulation on Vertical Keiretsu Networks: Forcing Japan’s Industrial Behemoths to Change Their Ways,"Groot, Jeroen","['Shibata, S.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This research has identified relevant financial reforms in Japan and its effects on vertical keiretsu networks. It utilized a literature review to investigate vertical keiretsu networks, financial deregulation, and keiretsu networks’ contemporary relevance. Moreover, it utilized three different case studies focused on 1) foreign direct investment, 2) changing corporate finance methods, and 3) vertical keiretsu networks. The results show that especially financial deregulations in the period ’96–’06 have affected Japan’s financial markets and vertical keiretsu networks. It demonstrated how the financial reforms have increased foreign direct investment and diminished the role of Japan’s banking industry. It demonstrated that successful vertical keiretsu networks such as Toyota and Honda continue to pursue strong buyer-supplier relationships in the form of cross-shareholding, while at the same time they adopted a market-based global sourcing strategy and utilized the international financial markets. Financial deregulation increased keiretsu networks’ foreign ownership ratios, affected their intra-network cross-shareholding, and led all ‘parent’ firms to adopt market-based purchasing strategies. Therefore, the research claims that financial deregulation forced vertical keiretsu networks to change their ways by ‘hybridizing’ their business model, and that the networks seem to continue to exist as a relevant form of industrial organization in Japan, despite its drastically changing economic landscape.","['Japan', 'vertical keiretsu', 'keiretsu', 'financial deregulation', 'cross-shareholding', 'production networks', 'big bang reforms', 'foreign direct investment', 'Toyota', 'Honda', 'Nissan', 'main bank system']"

Testing the possibility of artificial bilingualism.

Because of the many benefits of bilingualism, a start-up company developed a program called TuMi Mundo that attempts to make it possible for infants to acquire a second language via non-live exposure only. This study reflects on the first experiment to test if this is indeed possible. A Head Turn Preference Procedure was conducted to test the language preference of the infants after two months of near-daily exposure. Previous studies showed that monolinguals prefer their native language and bilinguals prefer both languages equally. We compared the babies exposed to the app with a monolingual control group and found that the exposed infants indeed showed no preference, but the monolinguals did neither. This lack of expected preference in the monolinguals makes the bilingual-like behavior of the exposed infants uninterpretable. The results of this study are therefore not enough to answer the question whether non-live exposure is enough to make an infant perceive the language as native.",

Gorbachev came to power and implemented new policies such as Glasnost and Perestroika. These policies had an enormous effect on the Russian economy and among other things food shortages appeared. When Gorbachev came to power, people believed in him and the promise of a better future he brought. However when the reforms turned out to have negative economical consequences, people were left disappointed. This national feeling of disappointment was later used by the state to legitimize the change in political course of the new president Putin. This demonizing of the nineties sparked a form of countermemory called ‘Flashmobs’. ‘Flashmobs’ are personal pictures of the nineties posted on social media accounts. This thesis will look at Flashmobs as an expression of reflective nostalgia for the nineties.

Taiwanese-Japanese Fishery Agreement of 2013 Changing the Dynamics of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Disputes,"Groenewoud, Melanie","['Black, Lindsay']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Chinastudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"Since the Japanese government purchased three of the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku islands in 2012 and subsequently nationalized them, relations with China and Taiwan sharply deteriorated. After a year the Chinese government was still cancelling important meetings with Japanese officials, while the Taiwanese East Asian Relations Association had managed to sign a fishery agreement with the Japanese Interchange Association in April 2013. This fishery agreement extended to the seas around the disputed islands, but the agreement did not touch upon sovereignty. The fact that the Chinese government still cancelled important meetings with Japanese officials showed that even after a year Sino-Japanese relations were still affected by the dispute of the 2012 and that the Chinese government did not take official measures to solve the dispute. However, Taiwan acted differently than China and signed a fishery agreement with Japan in April 2013. This shows that Taiwan took another approach regarding the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands than China. This is remarkable, because most academic sources had worked on the assumption that Taiwan and China would be taking a similar approach to handling these disputes and thus only Japan and China were ever considered to be main actors within the dispute. Through the fishery agreement of 2013 however Taiwan has proved to be an equally significant and independent contribution in the attempt to reach a solution for the disputes. This thesis will argue that the fishery agreement of Japan and Taiwan can significantly change the dynamics in the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands disputes.","['Diaoyu/Senkaku islands disputes', 'China', 'Japan', 'Taiwan', 'fishery agreement']"

Dit wordt in de regel onderscheiden van technieken, als zijnde alle manieren waarop klachten, gedragingen en herstel begrepen worden en al de interventies die hieruit volgen. Deze scriptie beschrijft drie benaderingen die de kracht van de relatie in onderscheid van technieken pogen te verklaren, vanuit de stellingname dat het belang van de relatie relevant is voor de verantwoordelijkheid die de therapeut ten overstaan van de patiënt heeft. Door gebruik te maken van verschillende plaatsen die door filosofen aan de ethiek zijn toegekend, worden verschillende mogelijkheden zichtbaar. De faciliterende relatie, ten eerste, leert dat de kracht van de relatie gelegen is in haar ondersteuning van de technieken. De atechnische relatie, ten tweede, stoelt op Bubers begrip van de ethische tussenruimte en beschrijft de relatie op haar krachtigst wanneer technieken slechts een geminimaliseerde rol spelen. De asymmetrische relatie, ten slotte, stoelt op Levinas’ begrip van de ethiek als eerste filosofie en leert dat de confrontatie met een ander oproept tot verantwoordelijkheid en dat dit (in beide richtingen) de kracht van de therapeutische relatie verklaren kan. Deze laatste benadering wordt als de meest plausibele verklaring voorgesteld.

Deze enactivisten verwerpen hiermee de gangbare opvatting in de cognitiewetenschappen dat cognitie het best kan worden begrepen als het verwerken van mentale representaties. Het probleem van het enactivisme is dat het succesvol wordt bevonden in het begrijpen van online cognitie zoals waarnemen, maar niet in het begrijpen van offline cognitie, zoals bijvoorbeeld herinneren en verbeelden. In hoeverre dit opgaat heb ik onderzocht door waarnemen, net als Varela, Noë en Gibson, te operationaliseren als sensorisch geleide act. Daarna heb ik de veronderstelling van Gibson getoetst die stelt dat herinneren en verbeelden kunnen worden begrepen als het offline in werking treden van sensomotorische contingenties van bepaalde sensorisch geleide acts die al eigen zijn gemaakt. Aan de hand van een fragment uit het dagboek van Cocteau laat ik zien dat procedureel en episodisch herinneren nog goed kunnen worden begrepen als sensorisch geleide acts, maar semantisch herinneren, oftewel herinneren bemiddeld door externe representaties niet. Ook voor verbeelden geldt dat die vormen die worden bemiddeld door externe representaties niet goed kunnen worden begrepen als sensorisch geleide act. Om deze vormen van offline cognitie ook te kunnen begrijpen in termen van sensorisch geleide act moeten ze worden begrepen als tweede-orde sensorisch geleide act.","['enactivisme', 'herinneren', 'verbeelden', 'belichaamd', 'sensomotorisch']"
“We worden ten onrechte gecriminaliseerd” Een onderzoek naar het framegebruik van outlaw motorcycle gangs,"Schutte, Roderick Alexander","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"De afgelopen jaren zijn de outlaw motorcycle gangs in Nederland veelvuldig in het nieuws geweest. Het feit dat in dit nieuws vaak het verband gelegd werd met criminele activiteiten, heeft ervoor gezorgd dat er een negatief beeld over deze groep motorclubs is ontstaan. Dit beeld strookt echter in veel gevallen niet met het beeld dat de outlaw motorcycle gangs over zichzelf hebben. Om zich te verdedigen tegen de beeldvorming in de media zijn de outlaw motorcycle gangs steeds vaker zelf de media op gaan zoeken om hun beeld van de werkelijkheid naar buiten te brengen. In de documentaire De macht van de Hells Angels van Zembla zegt Harry Ramakers, toentertijd een van de leiders van de Hells Angels bijvoorbeeld dat ze: “niet anders kunnen” (2004). Volgens Ramakers hebben de outlaw motorcycle gangs zoveel ellende en onzin moeten vernemen uit de media, omdat het volgens hem allemaal maar vanaf een kant belicht wordt. Zij voelen zich genoodzaakt om zelf de media op te zoeken, om zo hun kant van het verhaal aan het publiek kenbaar te maken. Hierdoor is er sinds 2004 in Nederland een unieke situatie ontstaan waarin een groep die weg wordt gezet als criminelen, een stem krijgt in de media. Zowel in televisieprogramma’s als in de kranten krijgen outlaw motorcycle gangs de gelegenheid om hun kant van het verhaal te vertellen. Dit is een interessant gegeven, omdat geen enkele criminele groepering of individu op deze manier een podium geboden krijgt om zich te verweren tegen de beeldvorming in de maatschappij. In deze masterscriptie wordt, aan de hand van het concept framing, onderzocht op welke manier de outlaw motorcycle gangs zich verdedigen tegen de heersende publieke opinie. Het concept framing kent vele verschillende definities die vaak betrekking hebben op de eigen discipline of toepassingsgebied, zoals de economie, psychologie of sociologie (Van Gorp, 2006. p. 45). In dit onderzoek wordt gebruikgemaakt van de definitie van Baldwin van Gorp, omdat deze definitie betrekking heeft op nieuwsberichten van de massamedia, de productie ervan en de relatie met hun publiek (2006, p. 45). Hij stelt dat framing een proces is waarbij enerzijds bij de productie van een nieuwsbericht bepaalde elementen uit de waargenomen realiteit geselecteerd worden en anderzijds de ontvanger van context en betekenissuggestie voorziet (2006, p. 46). De relevantie van framingonderzoeken ligt hem in het feit dat verschillende beelden die geschetst worden van een persoon, groep of maatschappelijke kwestie, blootgelegd worden. Door eenzijdige berichtgeving en het gebruik van frames kan het publiek onvolledig geïnformeerd raken en daardoor een gekleurd beeld van de werkelijkheid ontwikkelen. Dit onderzoek poogt om de verschillende mediaframes omtrent de outlaw motorcycle gangs in kaart te brengen, om zo het publiek, maar ook beleidsbepalers en journalisten verschillende kaders en invalshoeken aan te reiken om hun meningen, beleidsvoorstellen of nieuwsberichten op te baseren. Om te onderzoeken hoe de outlaw motorcycle gangs framing toepassen om zich te kunnen verweren tegen de negatieve beeldvorming in de media, is er een database van Nederlandse krantenberichten over outlaw motorcycle gangs samengesteld. Deze database beslaat een periode van 24 jaar (19902014) en is zorgvuldig samengesteld aan de hand van bepaalde zoekwoorden en criteriapunten (zie hoofdstuk 3). Uit deze database van bijna 17000 krantenberichten is voor dit onderzoek een apart corpus geconstrueerd, met artikelen waarin de outlaw motorcycle gangs zelf aan het woord komen. Uit dit corpus van 791 krantenberichten zijn counterframes gedestilleerd. Dit zijn de ‘tegenframes’ die de clubleden via de media inzetten tegen de gangbare mediaframes. In dit onderzoek zal allereerst, aan de hand van eerdere onderzoeken van Bakker (2016) en Fuglsang (2003), een beeld geschetst worden van de dominante frames omtrent outlaw motorcycle gangs in de media . Door zowel de framing als de reasoning devices te benoemen, zal duidelijk worden om wat voor soort frames het gaat en waarom deze als dominante frames omtrent deze groep motorrijders gezien kunnen worden. Vervolgens zal er via een inductieve framinganalyse onderzocht worden welke (counter)frames deze groep motorclubs hanteren om hun beeld van de werkelijkheid te presenteren en zich op die manier verweren tegen de dominante frames in de media. In dit onderzoek zijn er zeven verschillende frames gedestilleerd, die weer onderverdeeld kunnen worden in twee verschillende groepen. Aan de ene kant de frames met een probleemdefinitie en aan de andere kant de frames waarbij een probleem uit de weg wordt gegaan. Deze frames zullen in dit onderzoek aan de hand van framing en reasoning devices geanalyseerd worden en teruggekoppeld worden naar de theorie van onder andere Baldwin van Gorp (2006) en Robert Entman (1993). Tot slot zullen deze gedestilleerde frames afgezet worden tegen de dominante frames over outlaw motorcycle gangs in de media. Door verschillende theoretische kenmerken met elkaar te vergelijken zal het onderlinge verband tussen de frames duidelijk worden en kan er worden geconstateerd of de notie van counterframes, zoals van Gorp en Vercruysse (2011) deze in hun onderzoek toelichten, hier van toepassing is. Door de focus te leggen op de counterframes die afkomstig zijn van de outlaw motorcycle gangs, biedt dit onderzoek een aanvulling op eerdere framingonderzoeken over dit onderwerp (Bakker, 2016; Fuglsang, 2003). Door een beeld te schetsen van de manier waarop outlaw motorcycle gangs zichzelf verweren tegen de beeldvorming van de media, wordt de weg vrijgemaakt voor verder onderzoek binnen dit actuele thema, waarbij het interessant kan zijn om het samenspel tussen journalisten en de leden van de motorclubs te analyseren en de invloed van de counterframes op het publiek te onderzoeken.","['Framingonderzoek', 'Journalistiek', 'Outlaw motorcycle gangs', 'counterframing']"

I think the answer lies in the nature of Dutch policy in Maluku, monopoly, and the character of Chinese trade in Maluku, arbitrage, as well as their special relationship: strange monopoly vis-à-vis elusive arbitrage. By reading both Dutch and Chinese sources, I argue that, before Coen became the Governor-General of the VOC in 1618, Chinese traders, like many other Asian traders, made arbitrage between different counterparties in the world of Maluku, such as the Dutch, the Spaniards, and the local rulers, because their rivalry distorted commodities prices in local and global markets. After Coen became the Governor-General, he initially tried to expel all of Asian traders from the Maluku Islands, but, as this policy turned out to be impractical, he chose to leave the Chinese as “regulated arbitrageurs” to replace other “unregulated arbitrageurs” in order to maintain his strange monopoly policy.","['Maluku Islands', 'Clove Trade', 'Spice Trade', 'Chinese Traders', 'Dutch Company', 'VOC', 'Selden Map', 'Monopoly', 'Arbitrage']"

Sacralised cosmopolitanism in progressive spirituality,"Neven, Johannes Joris","['Davidsen, Markus Altena']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Theology and Religious Studies (Master),Master thesis,en,"In recent years the discipline of sociology put the topic of religion back on its research agenda. Among them was Ulrich Beck who introduced his theory of modern religion in the work 'A God of One's Own' (2010). This thesis critically discusses this work and adds further theoretical reflection, partly with the help of other scholarly research. An embedding of the work in Beck's general theory of modernity is included as well. The research question of the thesis concentrates on two of Beck’s characterized forms of modern individual religion: ‘post-modern religiosity’ and ‘cosmopolitan religiosity’. In regard to ‘post-modern religiosity’ it is argued that Beck’s depiction of self-directedness, relativism and incoherency is based on a view that flattens out the characteristics of ‘spirituality’. It is argued that this is the result of Beck's broad brush theorizing, of normative intentions and of a Protestant bias. Informed by the theoretical notion of 'lived religion' it is showed with the help of Woodhead's and Heelas's works that aspects of Beck's depiction of spirituality must be nuanced. The critique in particular aims at the asserted incoherence by showing that the there is nevertheless an underlying belief-structure at work. Furthermore Heelas's arguments are included on how spirituality relates to Simmel's notion of ‘life’ and how this informs Enlightenment values and ethics. In continuing the argument, with new theoretical possibilities at hand, Lynch's work on 'progressive spirituality' is involved in the discussion. This form of spirituality exemplifies the public, political, relational sides and agendas of (particular expressions of) spirituality. A comparison between 'progressive spirituality' and 'cosmopolitan religiosity' is drawn to conclude that they show strong similarities. Lynch's research thus shows that some forms of 'post-modern' religiosity are much more indebted to 'religious cosmopolitanism' than Beck presents, and that 'progressive spirituality' provides an answer to Beck's desired form of modern religiosity.","['Ulrich Beck', 'Second Modernity', 'Religious cosmopolitanism', 'Progressive spirituality', 'Religion', 'Spiritualities of life', 'Lived religion', ""A God of One's Own""]"

The Problem of Sovereignty in the Marquis de Sade,"Harrington, Samuel Ernest","['Sneller, Rico']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Philosophy (MA) (120 EC),Master thesis,en,"This thesis intends to use The 120 Days of Sodom to contribute to a reflection upon sovereignty in political philosophy. The overarching aim is to determine the extent to which Sade’s conception of transgression in The 120 Days can illumine the problem of sovereignty. The thesis will argue that this novel presents a sustained revelation of a particular paradox evident in sovereign theory. This paradox is explicitly dealt with in the political philosophy of the German jurist Carl Schmitt (1888-1985). It is the contention of this thesis that the political philosophy of de Sade, as outlined in The 120 Days, contains precise affinities with Schmitt’s theory of the exception. Like Schmitt, Sade articulates the transgressive capacity of sovereign power. Sovereignty rests upon mere attribution, not moral or normative considerations. Sovereign authority, once attributed, is legitimate because the sovereign has the power and authority to decide that it is legitimate. This ‘decision’ creates our paradox: the transcendent preserver of law is ultimately not bound to the law that is ordered. Consequently, the sovereign power alone is capable of legitimate transgression, going beyond the normal order with the aim of sustaining the normal order. Any suspension of law on behalf of the sovereign is an act of transgression. In the suspension of law, the sovereign transgresses the limits of the juridical order, with the aim of sustaining the legal order, hence the paradox. This thesis will focus on The 120 Days of Sodom as a philosophical novel about the possibility of absolute sovereignty. In the ‘real world’, the suspension of law sustains the juridical order, the transgression ultimately serving a practical purpose which is to uphold juridical normalcy. In Sade’s fictive space, however, he details no such bounds. The 120 Days is a wildly destructive exercise; it imitates the justification of sovereign power found in the decision to create a situation of infinite transgression of boundaries and limits. Sade forms an impossible universe wherein the exception becomes a normative principle. Sade accelerates the principle of sovereign power – the decisionistic aspect of the law – portraying seemingly endless attempts to sustain the “miracle” moment.","['Sovereignty', 'Marquis de Sade', 'Transgression', 'Carl Schmitt', 'Political Philosophy']"

Translating the Subtle Powers of English: A Study of Ideological Triggers in English Syntactic Structures and Their Translations to Dutch,"Heezen, W.I.","['Dol, P.H.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis aims to compile a collection of descriptive guidelines for the translation of ideological syntactic structures in texts from English to Dutch. The notion that there ""is not (...) any possibility that any discourse is free of ideas, and thus of ideology"" (Jeffries 8) has prompted the ambition to choose texts that demonstrate the subtle powers of English and Dutch. These hidden forces are manifested in conscious or unconscious linguistic choices which lead to implicit ideological conveyance. There are numerous studies on ideology in texts, and many cultural or socio-political linguistic, or purely linguistic models of analysis have been developed over the past decades. However, little research has been done on the actual translation of implicit ideology in texts and its potential, yet concealed, manipulation of the reader. On the basis of Jeffries’ Critical Stylistics model a set of linguistic tools will be applied on a corpus of English op-ed articles and analysed to identify their ideological influence on the text, only including socio-political or contextual analysis to a small extent. This largely linguistic approach enables subsequent analysis of the techniques that have been used to translate the ideological structures in these articles. By means of Vinay and Darbelnet's model of direct and oblique translation (Munday 86), and the translation procedures they comprise, this thesis ultimately intends to serve as a stimulus to set guidelines for the translation of ideological syntactic structures from English to Dutch.",['Translation Syntactic Ideological Triggers']

De herdenkingscultuur rondom de treinramp bij Harmelen Dit bachelor eindwerkstuk verkent de herdenkingscultuur rondom de grootste treinramp uit de Nederlandse geschiedenis. Vroeg in de morgen van 8 januari 1962 botsten twee treinen frontaal op elkaar vlakbij het dorpje Harmelen, zo’n 30 kilometer ten westen van de stad Utrecht. 93 mensen overleden als gevolg van de botsing. De treinramp werd opgevolgd door een lange periode van stilte. Een herdenkingscultuur werd niet gestimuleerd. De oprichting van een herdenkingsmonument vond 42 jaar na de treinramp plaats. Dit monument was niet speciaal bedoeld voor de herdenking van diegenen die omkwamen als gevolg van de treinbotsing bij Harmelen, maar voor alle slachtoffers van spoorwegongevallen. Precies 50 jaar na de treinramp bij Harmelen werd er een monument opgericht speciaal bedoeld voor de herdenking van de slachtoffers van deze treinramp. In dit bachelor eindwerkstuk ligt de focus op de functie en betekenis van dit laatste monument. Waarom werd er gekozen voor de oprichting van dit monument speciaal voor de herdenking van slachtoffers van de treinramp bij Harmelen?

Sharpened Stakes and Lingering Touches: the Depiction of the Female Vampire in Modern Media Adaptations of J Sheridan Le Fanu’s Carmilla,"Zwaan, Anne de","['Leeuwen, Evert Jan van']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"In recent years, vampires have been prominently featured in (young adult) literature, film and television, including the Twilight franchise, as well as popular TV series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, These well-known examples feature heterosexual romance, and are specifically geared toward a heterosexual audience. Next to these popular, ideologically affirmative incarnations of vampire mythology, and more in the margins of contemporary vampire culture, there exists also another type of vampire, which has its origins in the lesser-known female vampire who first came to existence in the nineteenth century: Carmilla Karnstein. This particular vampire, the title character of J Sheridan Le Fanu’s 1871 novella, is a female vampire whose primary goal it is to pursue young aristocratic women in hopes of feeding on their blood and transforming them into vampires. This thesis researches the depiction of the female vampire in Le Fanu’s novella as well as three of its modern media adaptations. In constrasting the film The Vampire Lovers (1970), the television film Carmilla (1989), and the web series Carmilla (2014) with the original novella, this thesis reflects on the ways in which an overarching social structure such as the patriarchy can determine the representation of female characters in film and literature.","['Carmilla', 'lesbian vampire', 'patriarchy']"

Formal linguistic approaches such as the Chomskian approach consider ambiguity as a fault in language design. This view is challenged by functional linguistic approaches, which recognize that ambiguity has a communicative function. Ambiguity can create greater communicative efficiency (Piantadosi, Tily & Gibson, 2012); it enables us to say more with fewer words and to keep information vague if we want the listener or reader to decide what we mean (Chen, 1992). I will discuss which of the two approaches is on the right track by analysing several cases of ambiguity, such as the structurally ambiguous Elizabeth saw the man with the binoculars. In chapter 1 I will define the notions ambiguous and ambiguity. I will contrast ambiguity with similar linguistic phenomena and discuss different subtypes of ambiguity. In chapter 2 the two linguistic approaches to ambiguity will be discussed: Chomsky’s formal approach and several functional approaches. In chapter 3 I will put these approaches to the test by analysing three different instances of structural ambiguity.","['Linguistics', 'Ambiguity', 'Chomsky', 'Vagueness', 'Fuzziness', 'Generality', 'Structural ambiguity']"

Deregulering, schadow banking, derivaten en subprime leningen.","Diekhuis, Diederik Johan","['Touwen, Jeroen']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Geschiedenis (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"In dit werkstuk zal ik de volgende onderzoeksvraag behandelen; Wat waren de voornaamste beweegredenen van de Federal Reserve onder het voorzitterschap van Alan Greenspan (1987-2006) voor het varen van een laisser faire koers en hoe kunnen we verklaren dat de financiële markt zo weinig gereguleerd werd? Om deze vragen te beantwoorden is er voor de volgende methode gekozen; de belangrijkste factoren voor de crisis zullen eerst gespecificeerd worden om de lezer een duidelijk beeld te geven van de invloed en/of mechanismen van het desbetreffende onderdeel. Vervolgens zal er voor elk onderdeel afzonderlijk gekeken worden hoe de FRB binnen de FOMC vergaderingen dacht over de ontwikkelingen omtrent deze factoren. Dit wordt gedaan door middel van het bestuderen van de notulen van de FOMC. In dit stuk zal aandacht worden besteed aan de aanloop van de crisis, waarmee de jaren van het voorzitterschap van Alan Greenspan 1987-2006 de datalimieten zijn voor het onderzoek. We kunnen de conclusie trekken dat de voornaamste beweegredenen van de Federal Reserve voor het varen van een laisser faire koers samenhangen met het neoliberale gedachtegoed. De primaire argumenten van de Fed voor het nalaten van verdere regulering bij zowel de derivatenmarkt als de subprime markt waren de volgende: 1) Regulering zou de marktdiscipline aantasten. 2) De rechtsgeldigheid van uitstaande derivatencontracten zouden negatief beïnvloed kunnen worden. 3) Regulering van de OTC derivatenhandel zou de financiële markt een belangrijk middel ontnemen voor het managen van financiële risico’s. 4) Regulering van de subprime markt zou consumenten met een laag inkomen de mogelijkheid voor eigenwoningbezit ontnemen. Ten slotte waren er voor de Fed nog een aantal secundaire argumenten die meespeelden, te weten: 1) De hypotheekmarkt was na 2000 de voornaamste reden van economisch herstel en groei. De Fed wilde deze groei niet belemmeren en een eventuele recessie veroorzaken. 2) De Fed had in het geval van de derivatenmarkt niet de middelen om on- the-ground toezicht te houden, dit zou ook niet passen bij het idee van een zelfregulerende markt.","['Federal Reserve', 'shadow banking', 'subprime leningen', 'vrijemarktideologie', 'Alan Greenspan', 'financiële crisis']"
Deciphering the Aim of Translation Studies: Examining the Five Translation Studies Perspectives,"Walraven, Marlijn","['Zeven, Katinka']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis tries to answer the question of what constitutes ‘good’ translation in order to help translators (and translator students) gain insight into the various academic perspectives on the nature of a high-quality translated text. It seeks this answer by way of examining the work of renowned translation theorists from across the five perspectives found in Translation Studies. The distinction and definitions of these perspectives are made by Hurtado Albir (1994) in his work Perspectivas de los Estudios Sobre Traducción. This thesis uses Ordóñez-Lopez’ (2008) English translations of these definitions. The five perspectives are named as follows: the Philosophical and Hermeneutic perspective, the Textual perspective, the Communicative and Socio-cultural perspective, the Cognitive perspective,and the Linguistic perspective. Each perspective approaches the field of Translation Studies in a different manner, which is the cause for many different interpretations and idea regarding translation practice. As this thesis seeks to unite opinions from across the academic field, and a number of perspectives only deal with written texts, multimodal translation will only lightly be touched upon. It will be shown that no more than three aspects are shared by more than one perspective, and none are shared by all.","['Translation Studies', 'Translation', 'Perspectives', 'Linguistic', 'Cognitive']"

Metaphor and illness experience: A comparative analysis of metaphors in male and female cancer patient narratives,"Huijbrechts, Olga","['Dorst, Lettie']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the use of WAR and JOURNEY metaphors in male and female cancer patient narratives. The narratives were analyzed to see whether the use of these metaphors could reveal a difference in the way men and women experience illness. The metaphors were analyzed to see whether they were used in a positive/negative or empowering/disempowering way. The results of the study revealed that both men and women used JOURNEY metaphors more frequently than WAR metaphors to describe illness experience. Overall, relatively speaking, men used WAR and JOURNEY metaphors as frequently as women to describe illness experience. However, the female narratives were generally longer than the male narratives, which caused women to use more metaphors absolutely speaking. Positive and empowering WAR and JOURNEY metaphors were used most frequently in the narratives to describe illness experience for both men and women. Contrary to findings of previous research, the results revealed that both men and women use WAR metaphors more frequently in a positive and empowering way than in a negative and disempowering way to describe illness experience. The results of this study contribute to existing research and also provide new findings in this topic area. The findings of the research could benefit both patients and healthcare professionals and create an awareness of the differences between men and women in the way they experience illness in relation to metaphor use.","['Illness experience', 'Male and female cancer patients', 'WAR metaphors', 'JOURNEY metaphors', 'Positive and empowering metaphors', 'Negative and disempowering metaphors', 'MIP', 'Conceptual Metaphor Theory']"
Journalistieke beslissingen bij complex nieuws,"Wolters, Sanne","['Koetsenruijter, A.W.M.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In de Nederlandse kranten is veel geschreven over de video van IS waarop de onthoofding van de Amerikaanse journalist James Foley te zien is. De motivatie voor de onthoofding en het naar buiten brengen van de video door IS is evident. IS wil wraak nemen op Amerika, angst zaaien en aandacht krijgen van de westerse wereld en westerse jihadisten. Ofwel, IS heeft propagandistische bedoelingen bij de onthoofdingsvideo. Propaganda of niet, veel Nederlandse media besteedden er aandacht aan. Later komt er echter in kranten, opinietijdschriften en actualiteitenprogramma’s een discussie op gang over hoe de journalistiek is omgegaan met het nieuws. Had er nu wel of geen aandacht aan besteed moeten worden? Het blijft een nieuwswaardige gebeurtenis, maar daarbij zijn er ook propagandadoeleinden. Een aantal journalisten reflecteert op het eigen gedrag of op de journalistiek in het algemeen ten opzichte van de onthoofdingsvideo. Journalistieke waarden, naar Deuze (2004) en nieuwswaarden, naar de kennistheorie van Galtung en Ruge (1965), vormen een interessant verklaringskader voor het gedrag van journalisten. De waarden worden hierin als universeel en algemeen geldend gezien. Maar wordt ook aan de waarden gedacht wanneer gereflecteerd wordt op de redactionele beslissingen die genomen zijn naar aanleiding van complex nieuws over de onthoofdingsvideo? Dit is onderzocht aan de hand van de volgende onderzoeksvraag: Op welke journalistieke waarden en nieuwswaarden beroepen journalisten in de Nederlandse media zich in de discussie over de eerste onthoofdingsvideo van IS en hoe krijgen deze waarden vorm? Uit de onderzoeksresultaten blijkt dat journalisten zich beroepen op alle vijf journalistieke waarden en een aantal nieuwswaarden. Deze waarden krijgen vooral vorm in omschrijvingen van de onthoofdingsvideo en het type nieuws. Er lag een focus op een bepaald aantal nieuwswaarden, waardoor het vooral leek te gaan over de nieuwswaardigheid van de gebeurtenis. Het meest opvallend was de ruime aandacht voor ethiek in de discussie. Deze journalistieke waarde diende vooral als onderbouwing voor hoe het niet moet binnen de journalistiek en niet altijd als verdediging voor de keuzes die gemaakt zijn.","['journalistieke waarden', 'nieuwswaarden', 'IS', 'onthoofdingsvideo', 'journalistieke praktijk']"

Nieuws als Aristotelisch drama,"Terwilliger, Cristiana","['Jong, Jaap de']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Door de jaren heen is (televisie)nieuws steeds meer overeenkomsten gaan vertonen met drama en is er sprake van sensationalisering, waardoor men spreekt over global soap opera of Foxification. Grabe en Zhou hebben dit verschijnsel bestudeerd in “News as Aristotelian Drama: The Case of 60 Minutes” (2003), door te onderzoeken op welke manier 60 Minutes – het langstlopende onderzoeksjournalistieke programma in de Verenigde Staten – dramatische (stijl)middelen en/of kenmerken toepast door middel van visuele en narratieve inhoud. In deze masterthesis wordt met de methode van Grabe en Zhou onderzoek gedaan naar de manier waarop Zembla – een televisienieuwsdocumentaire die al twintig jaar grondig onderzoek doet naar ontwikkelingen en gebeurtenissen in de samenleving – informatie visualiseert. Hiervoor is de uitzending over de bouwfraude geselecteerd, ‘Sjoemelen met Miljoenen’, welke door programmamaker Jos van Dongen wordt gezien als een van de meest invloedrijke uitzendingen in de geschiedenis van Zembla. Na analyse blijkt dat de visuele en narratieve inhoud, structurele kenmerken, personages en ethos, pathos en logos overeenkomsten vertonen met de eisen die Aristoteles aan drama en overtuigende communicatie heeft gesteld.","['Zembla', 'Bouwfraude', 'Grabe & Zhou', 'Aristoteles', 'Drama', 'Nieuws', '60 Minutes']"

The Exhibited Documentary - The Current State of Documentary within Contemporary Art,"Morgane, Brun","['Bruyn, E.C.H. de']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"Given the growing number of important works over the past two decades that have used the medium of film to produce pieces that can be labeled as documentaries, this study examines recent contemporary artists’ use of this approach as well as its impact on contemporary art. This study lays out the different regimes of truth through which the documentary form has evolved throughout film history, as well as their effect on the use of the approach within contemporary art during the past 15 years. In order to examine the current state of the documentary form within contemporary art, an analysis will focus on two recent works: the “Cardboard Walls” video installation by Aernout Mik (2013) and the “Crude Economy” film program by Florian Wüst (2013). Mik’s work is crucial to this study because of its use of reenactment and the documentary strategy, both of which have become increasingly popular among artists since the advent of the new documentary movement in the early 1990’s. By associating this particular work to Jacques Rancière’s concept of the emancipated spectator, it is possible to observe the relation to images that the documentary offers to its viewer and its possibilities to be an alternative to other media sources by combining individual and collective memory. The second case study introduces the film program as a new art form by a questioning of the contemporary role of the curator, as well as the influence of the documentary form in such works created by film montage. The two case studies establish the main esthetic and social characteristics of the current documentary approach by questioning its relation with history and demonstrating its potentiality to be a reflexive artistic form that can rethink and assist in the development of the position of the film medium in contemporary art.","['Documentary', 'Video Art', 'Aernout Mik', 'Film program', 'Curator', 'The Documentary Turn']"

Stromingen kennen vaak overloop, en vaak zijn er ook voorlopers. Gezien de grote hoeveelheid vrouwelijke titelpersonages in zijn repertoire, lijkt Rodenburgh op feministisch vlak de meesten van zijn tijdgenoten vooruit te zijn. Ik wil dan ook graag vanuit een genderperspectief naar een van zijn stukken gaan kijken, met behulp van bovengenoemde talige aspecten. Zo kom ik tot mijn hoofdvraag: is er een correlatie tussen een vrouwelijk taalgebruik en een vrouwelijkere inhoud bij het titelpersonage in Rodenburghs Aurelia?

Drie Tweede Kamerdebatten, die plaatsvonden in maart en april 2015, vormen het corpus van de scriptie. De metaforen worden allereerst geïdentificeerd, en vervolgens geïnterpreteerd met behulp van de conceptuele metaforen-theorie (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) en verschillende analyses van migratiemetaforen door meerdere auteurs (onder anderen Van der Valk 2003, Laarman 2013), waarvan sommigen ook de conceptuele metaforen-theorie hanteren. De geïnventariseerde metaforen zijn ingedeeld op brondomein (de letterlijke betekenis van een woord) en vervolgens ingedeeld in metaforen waarmee gepleit wordt voor een ruimhartig asielbeleid en metaforen waarmee gepleit wordt voor een restrictief asielbeleid. Voorstanders van een ruimhartig asielbeleid gebruiken metaforen die een framing geven van de huidige en toekomstige rol van ontvangende landen, een framing van hoe het asielbeleid zou moeten worden ingericht en opvallend veel metaforen die een negatieve framing geven van vluchtelingen. In de metaforen van voorstanders van een restrictief asielbeleid worden vluchtelingen uitgebeeld als een dreiging voor Nederland en/of Europa. Er wordt met onder meer de watermetafoor, verkeersmetafoor en de containermetafoor een dreigend verlies van controle over de aantallen vluchtelingen geschetst die naar Nederland of Europa komen.","['Metaforen', 'Retorica', 'Vluchtelingen', 'Asielzoekers']"

Indonesia is not an exception. The traces of whitening methods, portraits of ideal woman could be found in Indonesian literary works, legends as early as in ninth century as well as in modern literature and women’s magazines. Given the obsession of being white priority, the number of TV advertisements for skin-lightening products flooded the market and the need for them is intensely growing. The Indonesian beauty market is one of the fastest-growing beauty markets in Asia. Indonesian women follow the trend of being white shown in TV ads, but what can the content of these ads teach us about the reasons why people want to be whiter, or about the advertisers’ assumptions about those reasons, is still not well researched. This current study will try to contribute to the scientific knowledge in this field. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible ways of explaining the desire for whiteness by looking at the various positive associations which whiteness has for Indonesians. These positive associations include genetic excellence, hygiene and health, wealth and status, race, cosmopolitanism, the power of looks - “lookism” (discrimination or prejudice on the grounds of a person’s appearance), culture, social conformism, tradition (old cultural ideas in written and oral literature), modernity and try to trace them in four selected (two local brands and two international ones) contemporary TV whitening advertisements in Indonesia. The majority of these positive associations have their roots in antiquity and are not products of colonialism or modernity. Nevertheless, most of the TV skin whitening commercials in Indonesia (here, based on four examined ones) are constructed around modern ways of reasoning.","['Indonesia', 'whitening', 'beauty', 'whitening techniques', 'advertisement']"
Grown-up Dolls: An Analysis of Professional Critics' and Reader's Reviews of Three Beauty Writers,"Tavoni, Giulia","['Keijser, Anne Sytske']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis analyses the reception of three Chinese women writers (Mian Mian, Wei Hui and Chun Shu), part of a group of female authors known as Beauty Writers, by professional critics and popular readers. The reception of the Beauty Writers by the public in the People’s Republic of China, their native country, has been the focus of very few researches. I seek to add to the existing corpus of research by analysing two different types of reviews: the comments of intellectuals, such as professional critics, fellow writers, editors and professors, and the reviews of general readers who published their remarks on the internet. I will base the examination of the comments on the theory of reader-response criticism, which was born in Western literature and states that the reader shapes the meaning of a text, and that the text is thus not an isolated and self-standing work. By considering the external elements that help the readers judge a work, I seek to understand the reasons behind the positive or negative comments on the Beauty Writers’ works, which have drawn much media attention soon after their publications in the early 2000s. I propose that despite the early heated discussions about the literary worth of the Beauty Writers, in the end the perception of their writing style has reached normalisation, with the inclusion of the writers in the history of Chinese literature.","['Mian Mian', 'Wei Hui', 'Chun Shu', 'Reader-response criticism', 'Beauty Writers', 'Chinese literature', 'Chinese women writers']"
Is the Tide Turning? - Xi Jinping’s One Belt-One Road Initiative and the Shift in Chinese Foreign Policy,"Römer, Maximilian","['Schneider Black, Lindsay Florian']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The One Belt-One Road (OBOR) initiative, also referred to as the ‘New Silk Road’, is possibly the single most impactful foreign policy initiavite of the coming decades. Launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, it aims at reconnecting various regions of Eurasia from China to Germany and from Russia to Iran and India. At first glance the idea of a silk road evokes the romantic sentiment of a historic symbol that brought prosperity to Eurasia and overcame borders and dichotomies between ‘East’ and ‘West’. Yet, some foreign scholars and media outlets have been quick to interpret OBOR as a competitive, geopolitical grand strategy, or a Chinese Marshall plan that is guided by China’s domestic, economic and security interest to help China disrupt the current global order. I will provide a somewhat different narrative for making sense of Xi Jinping’s ‘New Silk Road’ initiative in the context of China’s rise. Hence, I ask the question whether or not the ‘tide is turning’, or more concretely: Does the OBOR initiative represent a change in Chinese foreign policy, and if so: What kind of change? I will outline major arguments of US realist and Chinese scholars on the debate about China’s rise. I will then critically outline how this debate is framed by how traditional IRT analyse China’s foreign policy. Taking this as the context to my argument I will describe how OBOR reflects a change in the way that the Chinese government conducts its international affairs under Xi Jinping and how the discourse on IRT affects the analysis of OBOR, which is still in its conceptualisation phase. I offer two interpretations of such change: One critically acknowledges more realist domestic and self-interested factors that motivate OBOR; the other argues that OBOR is more complex and could facilitate responsible engagement with global challenges such as global economic imbalances, cultural heritage, and international security. Finally, I conduct a short case study on the rise of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in the context of OBOR and international security to build on the narrative of a more globally responsible China that increasingly uses multilateralism. I find that particularly examining transnational factors of the initiative helps to understand the New Silkroad in the context of a possible peaceful rise that improves human connectivity, exchange, and has the potential to tackle global challenges.","['China', 'International Relations', 'One Belt-One Road', 'IR Theory', 'Discourse', 'Shanghai Cooperation Organisation', 'Multilateralism', 'Foreign Policy']"

Originally Polish, he came to the Netherlands as the principle of the Dutch Rabbinic seminary and in 1874 he became the chief rabbi of Amsterdam. His attitudes towards Judaism and Jewish studies hugely influenced the course of the seminary and indeed Dutch Jewry in general. In his opinion, Jewish tradition was to be studied in a modern academic, historical critical way, although he did not question the authority of the Jewish Bible and the rabbinic tradition. His teachings were of great influence especially for his students, and during his life an entire generation of ‘students of Dünner’ arose. After their graduation they were in higher functions in Dutch Jewry and in this way Dünners teachings and methods also spread through the country. Not everyone was in favour of Dünner: this thesis also describes several conflicts concerning Dünner. But no one could doubt his influence on Dutch Jewry.","['Joodse studies', 'geschiedens', 'Joodse geschiedenis', 'geschiedenis van het Rabbinaat', 'geschiedenis van het Nederlandse Jodendom']"

Desde o tratado de Tordesilhas que o território brasileiro vem vivenciando transformações e alterações que o acompanham ao longo da história. Podemos dizer que mais de metade do território brasileiro foi adquirido através de tratados e convenções internacionais, sendo uma parte mínima obtida através de guerras e conquistas. No século XXI há quase um século depois de o Barão do Rio Branco ter traçado as últimas linhas de fronteira a Oeste, abrem-se novas fronteiras a Leste onde a terra acaba e o mar começa. A delimitação da soberania brasileira no mar e as questões geopolíticas e geoestratégicas que delas levantam, constituem o próximo passo no ainda não delimitado Brasil que parece perpetuar uma tradição de expansão através de meios pacíficos. Este estudo tentará perceber como a defesa de uma área marítima que corresponde a metade do território brasileiro emerso tem relevantes implicações para a defesa de todo o país. Apesar de documentos oficiais como a Estratégia Nacional de Defesa afirmar que o Brasil é um país pacifico sem inimigos, não podemos deixar de considerar a existência de uma força militar pronta para defender toda a área soberana brasileira água, terra e ar.","['South Atlantic', 'Blue Amazon', 'Strategy', 'Defence', 'Brazil']"

Where is Home? The Conflict of Belonging for American-Salvadoran Deportees',"Brotherston, Billy","['Carmody, Michelle']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"This thesis takes part in the discussion of citizenship in an age of migration and transnational identification. It argues that traditional conceptions of citizenship, that view legal and national membership as singular, are becoming increasingly inadequate to reflect the the reality of our globalised world. Through transnational and migration theory, it is now understood that migrants, or transmigrants, are able to foster multiple identities and connections with the countries to which they travel, whilst maintaining ties with their countries of origin. The case of 1.5 generation Salvadoran deportees, who migrated to the U.S. as young children, provides a significant example of a group whose complex social and national identity did not correspond with their exclusive legal status as Salvadoran citizens. This group came to identify strongly with the U.S., having been socialised their from a young age, only to be later removed on the grounds of their lack of legal affiliation with the country. The contradictions inherent in the rationale behind their removal were later revealed through the groups continued identification with the U.S., and also their social alienation on return to El Salvador. Therefore, as opposed to conventional belief, this group shows that citizenship and national identity are not inextricably intwined, and can often conflict when the former is restricted to the jurisdiction of a single nation-state.","['Deportees', 'Citizenship', 'Transnationalism']"

Na de Tweede Wereldoorlog verloren de rijkere klassen hun macht en rijkdom. Tijdens de periode van economische groei die op de oorlog volgde, streefde de bevolking na om ‘gemiddeld’, en daarmee ‘net als anderen’ te zijn. Waar de Japanse maatschappij eerst op een verticale manier in te delen was (in hoge en lage klassen) kunnen we vanaf deze periode spreken van één horizontale klasse waarin men op basis van culturele voorkeuren gecategoriseerd kan worden. Een manier waarop mensen zich toch van elkaar onderscheidden, was door middel van kleding. Op welke manier onderscheiden groepen mensen zich van elkaar binnen een horizontale klasse? Voortbordurend op Soichiro Matsutani’s essay over differentiatie wil ik in deze scriptie onderzoeken hoe huisvrouwen en werkende vrouwen zich door middel van kleding van elkaar afzetten binnen de horizontale klasse in Japan.

A Spoonful of Sugar Helps the Medicine Go Down: Poison Use by Slaves in Antebellum Virginia.,"Cleveland, Alexcia","['Pargas, Damian']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This paper offers an in-depth study into slaves using poison as a form of resistance in antebellum Virginia. Although much attention has been given to sensational and bloody slave resistance such as Nat Turner’s Rebellion and more recent scholarship has focused on “everyday resistance,” this paper attempts to bridge the gap between the two as poisoning is simultaneously violent yet hidden. While previous scholars have given some study to eighteenth-century poisoning, the nineteenth century is perhaps of more interest as advances in forensics and the rise of paternalism created an environment vastly different from, and in many ways more conducive to, poisoning than that found in the previous century. To try to gain a more complete understanding of poison practices this paper presents cases that involve slaves of different genders, occupations, and ages. Contrary to some historians, this paper presents poisoning in the context of its practicality and is critical of the view of poison being spiritually tied to Africa; as such, this paper explores the many varieties of poisons slaves utilized. Using newspaper articles and other primary sources, this paper dissects the poisoning practices of slaves as well as the white reactions to it.","['slavery', 'slave resistance', 'antebellum virginia', 'poison']"
One Chinese Nation? Promoting the notion of 'Zhonghua Minzu' as a means for the solution to ethnic problems in the People’s Republic of China.,"Kloes, Sander","['Pieke, F.N.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"With the demise of communism as a unifying ideological force, the contemporary Chinese leadership is in a rather dire situation. As economic performance alone proves insufficiently capable of binding all citizens in the PRC territory to its political center, China's leaders have turned to nationalism for the solution. A major problem with promoting nationalism as a state-sponsored and state-guided ideology is that it too easily slides down to just being chauvinism for and by the majority Han ethnicity. The danger here is that this will alienate China's numerous so-called ethnic minorities. This thesis looks at one of the possible solutions to this existential problem to the Chinese nation state. The promotion of ""zhonghua minzu"" as a method of detaching ethnic connotations, and attaching more political connotations, to Chinese nationalism is the focus of the present work. It deals with efforts by the Chinese leadership since the rise of Xi Jinping to the position of Chairman to instill a sense of being Chinese in all China's citizens without depending on rhetorics of common blood, language, or religion. The author has tried to assess, and to an extent predict, the meassure of success these policies may have in keeping the PRC a unified nation and state.","['nationalism', 'national identity', 'zhonghua minzu', 'nation building']"

Lifestyle televisie draagt bij aan de keuzes in levensstijlen die bij ons passen. Maar wie bepaalt wat bij ons past? En op basis waarvan? Over de productie van lifestyle televisie is nog weinig bekend. Door middel van etnografisch onderzoek op de werkvloer van productiebedrijf STIMS is de productiekant van het lifestyle programma Nederland Heeft Het (NHH) onderzocht. De constructie van een uitzending blijkt per afdeling op de werkvloer afhankelijk van verschillende factoren. In het ‘format’ van NHH komen enkele eisen terug waaraan een aflevering moet voldoen: nadruk op de bereikbaarheid van een product, een geromantiseerde weergave, sluipverkoop en de aanwezigheid van een gewone of een autoritaire burger in het item. Hoe een aflevering verder wordt geconstrueerd, is afhankelijk van de expertises van de medewerkers per afdeling. Binnen alle afdelingen zijn de werkdruk, de creativiteit van de medewerker en de focus op lage productiekosten herkenbaar als belangrijke factor in het productieproces. Gedurende het gehele proces is de klant de gatekeeper. Zolang de klant voldoende geld betaalt, bepaalt hij wat er in het item komt. Met geld kan daardoor vrijwel ieder product of dienst gepromoot worden die een klant maar wil. De invloed die een klant kan uitoefenen op de promotie van het consumentengedrag is hierdoor aanzienlijk. Groter dan eerder werd aangenomen. Het debat rondom de productie van lifestyle televisie krijgt hiermee een nieuwe wending, namelijk een grotere nadruk op bottom-up televisie in plaats van top-down: de klant bepaalt voor een groot deel de inhoud, in plaats van de producent.","['Lifestyletelevisie', 'productieproces', 'commercialisering']"

A cinema of resistance: subversive cinematographic practices under political repression and propaganda during the first “25 years of peace” in Francoist Spain,"Cabrera Revilla, Laura Cristina","['Hesselberth, Pepita']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis provides a study of the subversive cinematographic practices in Spain during the period of political repression under Francoism (1939-1975). In foregrounding the non-conformist cinema of the time, it is my hope that this thesis contributes to the reconstruction of an immediate past in order to fight against the loss of memory, instigated by the dominant accounts of the history of that period, including that of the Spanish cinema. This thesis aims, then, to bring to light the repression that was encouraged by the state within the purview of film in order to hinder freedom of speech, and to revive a period of Spanish film history in which some films must be seen, I argue, as an instrument for social criticism. Against this background of repression I have, firstly, drawn attention on the institutional mechanisms and administrative procedures of censorship and propaganda – through which the state exercised control over the film making practices –, and the propaganda films made by directors who followed the principles of the regime, particularly focusing on the case of José Luis Sáenz de Heredia. Secondly, I have focused on two different lines of dissidence, i.e. internal and external, through the works of Falangist director José Antonio Nieves Conde, and the collaborative works of Luis García Berlanga and Juan Antonio Bardem, respectively.","['Francoism', 'Propaganda', 'Censorship', 'Dissidence', 'Cinema', 'José Antonio Nieves Conde', 'José Luis Sáenz de Heredia', 'Luis García Berlanga', 'Juan Antonio Bardem', 'Salamanca Conversations', 'Subversion']"
A Posthumanist Neo-Slave Narrative: Dismantling the Humanist Subject in Lilith’s Brood,"Op de Beke, Laura","['Kardux, Joke']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,North American Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis takes as its subject Octavia Butler’s science fiction trilogy Lilith’s Brood which it reads in the context of the neo-slave narrative, using the theoretical framework of posthumanism as its angle of inquiry. Most criticism concerning Lilith’s Brood fails to adequately address the discursive tension in the work between these two competing discourses: posthumanism and the neo-slave narrative. The alien invasion in Dawn for example is figured in highly contradictory terms. On the one hand it is cast in the historically grounded and emotionally charged, racialized terms of American slavery and oppression, on the other hand it is embraced as an occasion for a long overdue, radical transformation of the humanist subject into a posthuman one. The question of how these two discourses conflict and interact with each other is one that this thesis engages at length by analyzing the way Lilith’s Brood reconfigures three foundational concepts that are found in humanist philosophy – rationality, autonomy, and authenticity. According to posthumanism these virtues on which the humanist subject is founded delineate a narrow and exclusionary concept of the human. In Lilith’s Brood however they are reconfigured in order to extend to non-human creatures as well. At the same time this reconfiguration of subjectivity also more accurately describes the human condition when it is exposed in the light of posthumanism and stripped of its humanist pretentions. Each chapter takes one of the novels in the trilogy and demonstrates how it deconstructs one of these foundational concept: autonomy, authenticity and rationality. At the same time the themes of slavery and subjection run as a red thread throughout the work, at times corroborating Lilith’s Brood’s posthumanist message, at times problematizing it. In keeping these themes foregrounded the trilogy gives full expression to the struggle and danger that accompanies change, bravely acknowledging troublesome conclusions such as the inevitable inequality that haunts all power relations and the necessity of sacrifice.","['Octavia Butler', 'Posthumanism', 'Neo-slave Narrative', ""Lilith's Brood"", 'Xenogenesis Trilogy', 'American Literature', 'Science Fiction', 'Rationality', 'Autonomy', 'Authenticity', 'Subjectivity']"

Uit secundaire literatuur en bronnen bleek dat felle kleuren zijn toegepast binnen het interieur op zowel hout als textiel. Tevens kwamen diverse kleurentheorieën aan bod die het denken over kleur in de jaren tien en twintig van de vorige eeuw beïnvloedde. Daarnaast zijn diverse onderzoeken besproken waarin onderzoek werd gedaan naar de degradatie van de kleurstoffen. Verder is met behulp van een database, met daarin vele nog bestaande ontwerpen, een overzicht verkregen van het kleurgebruik van een aantal ontwerpers en architecten die behoren tot de Amsterdamse School.

Causatives in translation: An analysis of causative constructions in Targum Onqelos’ and Targum Neofiti’s translations of Genesis,"Lundberg, Johan Martin Viktor","['Gzella, Holger']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Classics and Ancient Civilizations (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"This thesis examines the causative stem (C-stem) in two Aramaic translations of Genesis, Targum Neofiti (TgN) and Targum Onqelos (TgO). More specifically, it is focused on how this morphological causative is employed to translate different Hebrew verbs and stem forms as well as the situation aspect and transitivity of individual verbs. The survey and synthesis show (1) that the vast majority of C-stem verbs in these corpora have an intransitive basic stem (G-stem) and (2) that the C-stem adds an external agent to G-stem constructions, thereby increasing their valency. (3) It illustrates how the addition of an external agent changes the role of the causee (original subject). For example, the subject of an intransitive G-stem construction becomes the direct object of a causative construction: ‘He went out’ becomes ‘They brought him out’. Likewise, the subject of a transitive construction (e.g. ‘He drank wine’) becomes a second direct object, making certain C-stem constructions bitransitive. (4) It outlines how the addition of an external agent affects the situation aspect of three different verb types, stative verbs, process verbs, and action verbs. (5) Lastly, it shows that the ancient translators attempted to imitate the Hebrew text whenever possible by using the same verb and stem.","['Causatives', 'Situation aspect', 'Transitivity', 'Valency', 'Aramaic', 'Tagrum Onqelos', 'Targum Neofiti']"

Beweging in gewijde ruimte: de ecclesiology en de herinrichting van drie Engelse kerken 1840 – 1890,"Rijnberk, Heino van","['Roding, J.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Arts and Culture (MA),Master thesis,nl,"The English countryside is dotted with old parish churches, often there since Medieval times and seemingly untouched. But appearances are deceptive and most of them, if not all, did change considerably, and probably at least twice. The first major transformation happened in the 16th and early 17th century when after the Reformation churches were adapted from catholic places of worship into buildings fitting a new protestant liturgy. More surprisingly a second drastic transformation happened in the mid 19-hundreds, then vice-versa, altering churches backwards into more catholic settings for still protestant worship. This thesis examines the last, which not only generated huge changes in internal arrangements, layouts and furnishings, often beyond recognition, but also left us the churches we are familiar with and indeed established the blueprint for all churches in the Anglican and Episcopal community worldwide. In general churches were adapted according to a new concept created by an obviously successful and powerful movement, aiming for revitalisation of the Church of England: the Ecclesiological Society. Although the result of some compromising and adoption of ideas of others, their ecclesiological concept was strict and detailed, aiming for an ideal setting for Anglican worship based on 14th century forms, but which in fact was totally new and neither Medieval nor Anglican. A concept that required, and indeed generated, not only a radical internal rearrangement and refurnishing, altering churches from pulpit focusing auditoriums into sacramental spaces orientated to the altar, but also a full restyling into the only style befitted for truly Christian, English churches: the Middle Pointed Style. Many writers see the mid 19-hundreds as a period of revolution in which churches en-masse were transformed according to the ecclesiological principles: rigidly and rigorously. Broadly speaking this may be true. Still, three different cases of church remodelling, although providing only a tiny impression, show differently. St. Andrew’s Church in Castle Combe, Bath Abbey and St. Eadburgha’s in Broadway all got their ecclesiological arrangements, but neither of them to the full. And more noticeable, neither of them was restyled into the preferred Middle Pointed Style. The ecclesiological transformations may generally have been rapid and rigid, but certainly some churches followed their own patterns and paces, determined by facts such as the churchmanship and position of the incumbent or the significance and role of the church in the community.","['ecclesiology', 'parish church', 'England', '19th century']"

"""The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war?"" Security Sector Reform and its contribution to post-conflict state building in Somalia and Sudan","Toonen, Wessel","['Schoenmaker, B. (Ben)']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Somalia and (South) Sudan belong to the most troubled countries in the world. All three of them are classified within the bottom 20% of the UNDP’s Human Development Index. Similarly, they have consistently been ranked in the top-5 of the Fragile States Index. Unsurprisingly, the contemporary history of Somalia and Sudan is characterized by chronic insecurity because of recurring civil wars between ethnic, tribal or clan-based groups and their governments. Therefore, the vast majority of international involvement in the Horn of Africa during the last twenty years has been directed at these countries. However, despite this ample attention, the deployed international military forces have thus far been unable to re-establish secure environments and rebuild state structures. Focusing on five distinct military interventions from 1990 to roughly 2010, this inquiry aims to measure the qualitative and quantitative contributions of Security Sector/System Reform (SSR) to the restoration of the state’s monopoly on the legitimate use of force. To this end, it addresses e.g. the progress made within Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) programs. This inquiry then attempts to assess the legitimacy of the post-conflict state reconstruction effort by looking at e.g. the empowerment of civil society representatives and the progress made within community confidence-building measures. In doing so, this inquiry adopts Paul D. Miller’s concept of ‘armed state building’ as a theoretical framework. It therewith argues that – despite a growing number of criticisms – liberal institution-building has since the end of the Cold War remained the prevailing paradigm of state reconstruction efforts. Based on a reading of relevant literature, this inquiry contends that group identities in Somalia and Sudan have become interwoven with relative deprivation between them. The result have been enduring crises of citizenship and legitimacy in the state which continue to feed narratives that help to mobilize groups for violence. This inquiry finds that SSR has managed to increase the capacities of security and justice institutions, albeit in a vacuum. Analyses indicate how the (re)-established state institutions overall have been rather a-contextual, a-historic and frequently paralleled more capable, indigenous mechanisms. Simultaneously, the problems within the state’s legitimacy domain illustrate the complex environments, wherein international military forces e.g. were hampered by their cooperation with problematic local partners. This points to limitations within the military spheres of influence that affect soldiers’ ability to address the ‘root causes’ of conflict. This, in turn, leads to questions of how SSR should otherwise be treated within their activities, and how these armed state building efforts could best be complemented.","['Security Sector Reform (SSR)', 'State building', 'Peacebuilding', 'Somalia', 'Post-conflict', 'UN', '(South) Sudan', 'DDR', 'Intervention', 'African Union (AU)', 'Civil Society', 'Disarmament', 'Civil war']"

The focal point of my research is the artistic practice of artist duo Libia Castro and Ólafur Ólafsson, who occupy a position in the international art world of today. In a highly commercialised socio-political reality where a one-sided and fragmented understanding of knowledge rules, the arena of art often threatens to be disregarded as insignificant and inefficient. By explaining Castro and Ólafsson’s approach towards the socio-political field and the relation that their work takes towards the audience, I will illustrate and emphasise that the artistic arena is a necessary component of a healthy democratic society. This thesis will map some of the unique qualities and achievements of the aesthetic sphere, that result from its singular position towards life and politics. Because art offers us the possibility to treat and consider the world around us in a non-verbal and in a different way than purely intellectual, it contains the potential to create agonisms that help us to perceive the world around us differently, giving free play to new meaning and alternatives towards reality to arise.","['contemporary art', 'socio-political engagement', 'globalised art world', 'agonisms', 'democracy']"

Zij hebben zelfs het moderne nieuwsmedialandschap deels gevormd; ze brengen alle vormen van online nieuws samen op één locatie op het World Wide Web én ze hebben een deel van het nieuwsselectieproces verplaatst van nieuwsproducent naar nieuwsconsument. Omdat bijna alle nieuwssites gebruik maken van sociale netwerksites als Facebook en Twitter, zou men verwachten dat de diversiteit van zowel het nieuwsaanbod als de nieuwsconsumptie op deze sociale netwerksites hoog is. Eerdere onderzoeken naar de diversiteit van online nieuwsconsumptie van klassieke nieuwsmedia schetsen een pessimistisch beeld van het hedendaagse online nieuwslandschap (Scott, 2005; Fenton, 2010). Aan de andere kant bevinden alternatieve nieuwsmedia zich wel degelijk online (Redden & Witschge, 2010). Facebook en Twitter vormen een verzameling van al deze soorten nieuwssites en de vraag is dan vervolgens of de nieuwsconsument ook daadwerkelijk de weg naar dit diverse online nieuwsaanbod weet te vinden. Binnen deze masterscriptie is onderzocht hoe het zit met de diversiteit van het nieuws like- en volggedrag op Facebook en Twitter aan de hand van vier verschillende categorieën online nieuwssites: klassiek, online-only, sociale media-only en individuele journalisten. Op Twitter wordt er significant meer nieuws geconsumeerd dan op Facebook. Ook is de verdeling van de gevolgde accounts op Twitter diverser dan op Facebook. Daarnaast blijkt dat, hoewel de respondenten met het internet zijn opgegroeid, zij nog steeds voor een groot deel terugvallen op klassieke nieuwsmedia. Tot slot blijken factoren als leeftijd en geslacht op Facebook wel een significante invloed te hebben op de intensiteit van de nieuwsconsumptie. Daarentegen is deze invloed op Twitter minimaal. Dit onderzoek schetst dan ook de staat van de diversiteit van het nieuws like- en volggedrag op Facebook en Twitter en maakt een begin aan het overbruggen van de lacune in onderzoek naar online nieuwsconsumptie.","['Sociale nieuwsconsumptie', 'diversiteit', 'Facebook', 'Twitter', 'Online nieuws']"

Violations of prescriptive rules and speaker education: Young “Randstad” females’ perception of usage problems in spoken Dutch,"Otto, Inge","['Tieken-Boon van Ostade, Ingrid']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"Dutch grammar prescriptions decree that in subject position, the subject pronoun 'zij' and not the oblique 'hun' should be used. Consequently, the following sentence can only exemplify proper written and spoken Dutch if 'zij' is selected: *Hun/Zij hebben dat gedaan! (""Them/They did that!""). Scholars have revealed that university students disapprove of *hun in a spoken Dutch story (Janssen 2004), and that the more highly educated a group of speakers is, the lower that group’s self-reported use of *hun is likely to be (Bennis & Hinskens 2014). Yet, it remains unclear whether and, if so, how different educational groups perceive 'hun hebben' as well as other 'taalergernissen' (“language annoyances”, or “usage problems”) in spoken Dutch. My sociolinguistic study into 45 young Dutch females’ perception and evaluation of five usage problems in spoken Dutch confirms that speakers’ education is a relevant social variable that future studies about related topics should consider. The speakers with a WO degree (“university degree”) more often commented on the non-standard features in a radio listening task than speakers with HBO (“higher vocational education”) or MBO (“intermediate vocational education”) degrees did. Additionally, the university graduates also were less tolerant of, and more strongly distanced themselves from, spoken sentences that included such non-standard features as compared to the HBO and MBO graduates.","['sociolinguistics', 'Dutch', 'standard language', 'prescriptive rules', 'education', 'attitudes', 'awareness', 'perception', 'spoken language']"
Onderzoek naar nieuwsframes in een 'fractured paradigm',"Valk, Tobias van der","['Koetsenruijter, Willem']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,nl,"In deze masterthesis is het methodologisch model voor de analyse van frames in beeld door Dimitrova & Rodriguez (2011) onderworpen aan een methodologische evaluatie. Het centrale doel was daarbij om een bijdrage te leveren aan de uitwerking van het gefragmenteerde vakgebied van visuele framing, met een focus op nieuwsframes. Het model bleek, na een empirische evaluatie door middel van een beknopte framinganalyse, een waardevolle aanvulling te zijn op de huidige manieren van onderzoek naar beeldframes in het nieuws. Het model van Dimitrova & Rodriguez stelt een framinganalyse voor op basis van vier interpretatieve niveaus. In het eerste niveau worden beelden bekeken als aanduidende, of denotatieve systemen. In het tweede niveau als stilistische en semiotische systemen. In niveau 3 wordt er interpretatie aan de lezing toegevoegd door de beelden te analyseren als connotatieve systemen. Op het laatste niveau worden beelden bekeken als ideologische representaties van de werkelijkheid. Op alle niveaus reiken de onderzoekers werkbare en relevante hulpmiddelen aan die de betrouwbaarheid en de transparantie van de analyse verhogen. Hoewel het model van Dimitrova & Rodriguez positief is beoordeeld in dit onderzoek zijn meerdere punten besproken op basis waarvan het model kan worden verbeterd en uitgebreid. Ten eerste wordt aanbevolen om tekst meer te integreren in de interpretatieve lezing van beeldframes in het nieuws. Studies van Viorela Dan en Øyvind Ihlen (2011) en Martinec en Salway (2005) bieden hier houvast voor. Ook wordt aanbevolen om het principe van de Critical Discourse Analysis (Van Dijk, 1993) te koppelen aan het model om de rol van de onderzoeker duidelijker af te bakenen. Dit komt de betrouwbaarheid van de analyse ten goede. Daarnaast is een laatste aanbeveling om journalistieke principes als nieuwswaardigheid, gatekeeping en beroepscodes - zoals verwoord door Van Gorp (2006) - mee te nemen in de analyse om het model verder te complementeren.","['Nieuwsframes', 'Beeld', 'Framing', 'visuele framing', 'semiotiek', 'Model', 'Visuele analyse']"

De gap-theory, die de kloof aanduidt tussen het beoogde vreemdelingenbeleid en de gevolgen daarvan in de praktijk staat hierin centraal. De gastarbeiders die in de jaren zestig en zeventig van de vorige eeuw tijdelijk in Nederland zouden verblijven lieten later hun gezinnen overkomen. Deze ontwikkeling is een voorbeeld van de onbedoelde effecten van beleidsvorming uit die periode. De migranten uit deze groep doen geregeld hun beklag bij het EHRM op grond van overheidsinmenging in de uitoefening van hun gezins- of privéleven. Lidstaten hebben een positieve verplichting om iedere verblijfsaanvraag in het kader van gezinshereniging te toetsen aan artikel 8 EVRM. De fair balance test is daartoe een toetsinstrument dat handvatten biedt voor het evenwichtig afwegen van de integrale belangen in een zaak, waarmee een redelijk evenwicht zal worden bereikt dat recht doet aan het garanderen van het respect voor uitoefening van privé- en gezinsleven door overheden. De toets wordt onderbouwd door de bepalingen van artikel 8 EVRM en krijgt vorm door jurisprudentie van het EHRM. De toename van schendingen is te wijten aan de diffuse interpretatie van bepalingen en een te rigide toepassing van jurisprudentie door lidstaten.","['EHRM', 'vreemdelingenbeleid', 'Fair balance test', 'jurisprudentie', 'gap-theory', 'gezins- en priveleven', 'artikel 8 EVRM', 'gezinshereniging']"

Andalusian Fiqh Concerning non-Muslims: the Discrepancy Between Written Formality and Daily Practice (900-1250).,"Dahman, Rafik","['Sicking, Louis']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis questions the generally presented thought that the religious rulings concerning non-Muslims was Islamic law. By differentiating punctually and thoroughly adequate between the religious rulings of the scholars, the policies of the rulers, and daily reality of the people, it enables one to understand these three phenomenons as entities, but within their inter-complemantary context. As a result, it made it possible through literary evidence to distinguish between the written formality as laid down in the fiqh-literature, and daily reality as lived by all people. Between these two a discrepancy is often to be observed, which means that the question whether The Islamic law of Andalusia was tolerant cannot homogeneously be answered. Alternatively, to answer the question whether Islamic law of Andalusia concerning non-Muslims was tolerant, one is to decide which touchstone he or she is using. Furthermore, this thesis reserves likewise a focus on the eschatological motivations behind the seemingly mundane character of the rulings concerning non-Muslims, a focus which is still too poorly integrated in academic works.","['fiqh', 'andalusia', 'Islamic law', 'non-Muslims', 'dhimmis', 'Muslim tolerance']"

Situated at the heart of an art fair, Öğüt’s artistic installation focused on art world’s intern. The thesis’ three chapters consecutively address the subject of the intern in relation to the ‘precariat’ and context of the precarious condition; the installation as a space of ‘unconcealment’ making visible the ‘natural order of things’ as structured and structuring structure that works to keep things as they are; and how events that took place within the installation as ‘knowledge exchange space’ appear affirmative of values that work to maintain the precarious condition. As such, it aims to shed light on the complex, critical role of art in times of dissolving boundaries between art and capitalism - considering artists and cultural workers as part of capitalist production, and all subjected to the global precarious condition.","['critique', 'internships', 'precariat', 'installation', 'Intern VIP Lounge']"

Mismanaging expectations.

These plans were made between 1942 and 1945, when Japan occupied the Netherlands East Indies. After the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, Dutch preparations turned out to be insufficient, because of the different expectations the Dutch government had about the possibilities of the colonial soldiers than what they were capable of in reality. These colonial soldiers, both Dutch, Indo-Dutch and Indonesian, had been captured and used as forced labourers by the Japanese during the war years. They were unable to fight against Indonesian nationalists and therefore the Dutch government was forced to also call other armed forces from the Netherlands to Asia. Several plans that were made during the Second World War were the establishment of the Mariniersbrigade (Marine Corps), recruitment of war volunteers and from 1946, a call for Dutch conscript soldiers was also made. Especially the period between 15 August 1945 and March 1946, when the British occupational forces allowed Dutch forces to re-enter the colony for the first time, is rarely investigated in historiography. This thesis fills in that gap, both in time and in topic.","['Netherlands Indies', 'Dutch East Indies', 'Indonesia', 'Second World War', 'KNIL', 'Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger', 'Prisoners of war', 'POW', '1942-1946', 'Indonesian Indepence War']"

The Eastern European Jewish immigrants in Antin’s (fictionalized) autobiography The Promised Land (1912) and Cahan’s novella Yekl; A Tale of the New York Ghetto (1896) and his novel The Rise of David Levinsky (1917) offer insights into the impact of America’s assimilationist ideology on identity construction, showing how both ethnic and national identities are imagined, constructed, and performed. The protagonists explore the social injustices Jewish immigrants suffered in the United States and the complex nature of Americanization by sometimes bluntly criticizing the pressure to conform, but elsewhere demonstrating that they have assimilated to a certain degree.

Re-shaping the 'salaryman' image: The waning of Japan’s hegemonic male role model,"Meijden, Kevin van der","['Lucassen, L.A.C.J.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"Dutch newspaper nrc.next reported on April 13th 2015 that large Japanese companies are trying to get their employees to work shorter hours. These employees, often referred to as ‘salaryman’, are constantly fatigued. Long hours at work, after work drinking, and long commutes with little sleep in between workdays causes them to make more mistakes and portray diminished productivity. It will not lead to firing by the company due to the understood loyalty between employer and employee that has existed for decades. These salarymen can neither assist with housework nor with the care for children because of the grueling work hours. This issue had never been perceived as a serious problem, as their wives accepted the late night drinking sessions in return for a stable lifestyle for decades. Now that women have extended their independence through gainful employment, starting and supporting a family has become increasingly harder for both sexes. Despite these changes salarymen are still expected to make the same hours, sometimes driving them to karoshi – “death by overtime.” The ‘salaryman’ is viewed as the ideal representation of the typical Japanese man by people both inside and outside Japan. This current image of the ‘salaryman’ is a far cry from the ‘salaryman’ image that arose in the 1980s with which the ‘salaryman’ is most often associated. The ‘salaryman’ was an ideal that not only Japanese men pursued and Japanese women wanted as their partners: he was seen in the West as the leading example for a loyal employee who complied willingly to and worked harmoniously in his company, ensuring a job until retirement as part of a tacit social contract. Dubbed as a ‘corporate warrior’, the ‘salaryman’’s diligent work ensured him a slow but steady rise through the ranks on the basis of age, and whose dark blue suit and leather briefcase are standard issue. All this was necessary to provide for his housewife and children, who went to the top schools and universities to follow in their father’s footsteps. The worn out employee and ‘corporate warrior’ are both strong images on opposite sides of the ideal employee-spectrum. Yet both images are signified by the same term: the ‘salaryman’. The thesis will focus on the development of the ‘salaryman’ image from the 1980s until now, and the different functions of this image. This period is of special interest because Japanese business management and businessmen were viewed as examples for Western business in the 1980s and 1990s. Japan owed its leading role to its consistent economic growth from the mid-1950s onward, being the number two economy in the world, only outperformed by the United States in terms of GDP per capita. When the US’ economic performance dipped in the 1980s, Japan’s economy remained relatively stable. This prompted both researchers and journalists to find an explanation for Japan’s economic performance, which they found in Japan’s business sector and its salarymen. This thesis argues that the term ‘salaryman’ is outdated in reference to new white-collar recruits in large Japanese companies. The decline in regular employment, the changing focus of seniority-based wages to merit-based wages and the waning of company union participation all indicate significant changes in ‘salaryman’ realities since the 1990's. As the ‘salaryman’ benefits have changed, so too have new recruits’ views on and expectations of their company and their jobs. To reflect these changes, a new term that better suits new recruits is suggested.","['salaryman', 'Japan', 'masculinity', 'role model', 'business culture', 'popular media']"

Het ministerie voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking financiert hiervoor het project Reintegration of Emigrant Manpower and the Promotion of Local Opportunities for Development (REMPLOD) van 1974 tot 1976. Met REMPLOD worden de mogelijkheden ondrzocht om terugkeermigratie te koppelen aan ontwikkelingssamenwerking in Turkije, Marokko en Tunesië. Ten eerste wordt onderzocht of de remigratie van gastarbeiders kan worden ingezet om de sociaaleconomische ontwikkeling van de regio te versterken. Gastarbeiders kunnen ondernemingen in het land van herkomst starten met hun spaargelden en beroepservaring uit Europa. Ten tweede wordt er onderzocht of emigratie kan worden voorkomen door werkgelegenheid te creëren. Het REMPLOD-project maakt in meerdere opzichte zijn verwachtingen niet waar. Er komen geen toepasbare beleidsvoorstellen voor het ministerie, de onderzoekers zijn teleurgesteld over navolging van het project en bovenal worden de gastarbeiders de dupe van het beleid. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat er in het gevoerde beleid sprake is van zwart-wit denken, de focus ligt op korte termijnbeleid en dat er gedacht wordt in eenvoudige oplossingen.

"Digital academia: the decline of the monograph, the rise of digital in academic publishing and the consequences for academic culture","Dikker Hupkes, Simon","['Weel, Adriaan van der']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis, I have looked at the influence of the internet on academic publishing and, as a consequence, academic culture and practice. I have tried to present a plausible narrative on how academic work on a daily basis has changed and what consequences there are for the role of books. The efficient digital distribution of journal articles through the digital library have made the article relevant in two new ways: (1) it is now the single most important means of scholarly output, at the cost of books; and (2) it is almost always accessed digitally, often not through the journal title, but directly through a full bibliographical reference search request or as one of the results of a search query on topic, key word or other sort of search entry. The instant availability of almost all peer-reviewed journal articles ever published is a great contribution to the world of science, for obvious reasons. It comes with certain costs to it as well, however. Finding and accessing articles with such ease makes the book a relatively more difficult-to-access item. Especially for a new generation of students, the book seems less relevant. They are presented with articles more than books, and come from a background in which books are less prominent. For scholars, an article is easier to write than a book, but it counts as more when their citation indices are put together. A vicious circle comes into being. As an academic’s publication record becomes more important in order to keep his job, he will choose to write more articles. University libraries focus on presenting the articles efficiently in a digital manner and make the library into a computer workspace instead of a place for searching and reading books. The digital availability of articles leads to less diversity in sources and the older the titles the less they are cited. Publishing companies are faced with lower demand for books and are struggling to make ends meet financially. Every step of this circle in itself doesn’t lead to a catastrophe, but it is the feedback loop that strengthens itself and the aggregate outcome that causes us to be worried about the future of books in academia.","['monograph', 'digital', 'academic paper', 'research process', 'university library', 'book', 'academic culture', 'paper book', 'e-book', 'double-F reading']"

Code-Switching within the Noun Phrase: Resolving Papiamento-Dutch Conflicts,"Jong, Amy de","['Parafita Couto, M. Carmen']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis focuses on theoretical accounts of code-switching with regard to Papiamento-Dutch bilinguals. It examines two contrasting theories, the Matrix Language Framework model (Myers-Scotton, 2002) and the Minimalist Program (Cantone and MacSwan, 2009), and compares them by examining which accounts for what happens at conflict sites in occurrences of Papiamento-Dutch code-switching, looking specifically at switching in noun-adjective word-order conflict sites. An event-related potential study was carried out at Leiden University with Papiamento-Dutch bilinguals. Its aim was to provide an objective measure of the neurocognitive processes underlying code-switching in bilinguals (Parafita Couto, Pablos, Boutonnet, de Jong, Perquin, de Haan and Schiller, under review). The two theories were tested using code-switched sentences which comprised six conditions: two control sentences that were not code-switched, two code-switched conditions where the predictions of the theories differed, and two code-switched conditions where the predictions of the theories matched. It was predicted that the results would support the Myers-Scotton MLF model, as that was the case with a similar project carried out with Welsh-English bilinguals ((Parafita Couto, Boutonnet, Hoshino, Davies, Deuchar and Thierry, 2013). The results of the Papiamento-Dutch experiment showed a slight trend in support of the Minimalist Program. These results differed from those of the project regarding Welsh-English bilinguals which found significant results in support of the Matrix Language Framework model (Parafita Couto, Boutonnet, Hoshino, Davies, Deuchar and Thierry, 2013). The disparity between the conclusions in these two experiments could be due to the difference in the types of bilinguals which participated. Further research will benefit from considering the sociolinguistic features of the bilingual group which participated in the Papiamento-Dutch study discussed in this thesis.","['Papiamento', 'Dutch', 'ERP', 'Code-Switching', 'Bilingualism', 'Matrix Language Framework Model', 'Minimalist Program', 'MacSwan', 'Myers-Scotton']"
Just Tweet It! Language Choices on Social Media by Luxury Goods Companies,"Paasschen, Jorg van","[""O'Neill, Gareth""]",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Engelse taal en cultuur (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"The aim of this paper was to find out how Adidas and Nike behave on Twitter regarding both product advertising, communication with their community, and retention of customers through events, celebrity interaction and motivational content. Primary focus is on the language contained in tweets published in January 2015 gathered from 12 company Twitter accounts. These Twitter accounts were chosen based on their monthly activity and include the main brand Twitter. We processed the dat into an all-encompassing database of our own design. The database is split up in three sections: tweet information, tweet content category and language features allowing for an easy overview. It contains information on what the type of the tweet is, what the content is classified as, who is included in the tweet, what is linked in the tweet , what its hashtags are as well as the language features that it contains. From this we analysed eight different content and language features: hashtags, Twitter account types, tweet categories, formality, genre, emphasis, phrasing and patterns. This lead to insights in the advertising strategies that these companies employ as well as their attitude towards their followers (their customers). We came across the following results: strenuous collaboration with celebrities to advertise products, use of descriptive language for product advertising, short, quote-like positive messages for inspirational messages, and personal responses for certain (community-based) twitter accounts. There is much use of a similar formula when constructing messages across all of the accounts affiliated to the same company. They furthermore reinforce themselves through the repetitive use of hashtags and phrases, meant to make tweets easily recognizable. Both companies show adaptation to new media: using Twitter as a base with customers choosing to follow them and then redirecting them to their website, using links to YouTube, and including pictures or videos directly in the tweets. We expect that further investigation (with a larger database, either due to increasing the included accounts or increasing the time of documentation) will give an even greater overview of the strategies employed by Adidas and Nike. There is potential for further expansion to include various other new media sites. An analysis of YouTube clips, focusing on word choice may also prove very insightful.","['Twitter', 'Language Choices', 'Social Media', 'Luxury Goods', 'Advertising', 'Hashtags']"

The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to determine what type of identities Lithuanians ascribe to speakers with foreign accents and 2) to establish the motivations behind choosing Lithuanian versus foreign languages in daily life. The research that was carried out in Lithuania consisted of two parts. The first part of the research used attitudinal study and the second part used a questionnaire distributed around Lithuania. These tools were used to assess Lithuanian opinions of six speakers with various accents, and to analyse the rationale for choosing either the mother tongue or a foreign language in different situations. The results showed that the attitudes towards foreign speakers of Lithuanian differ between the capital city and the smaller town chosen for this study, and that the main reason for choosing Lithuanian over foreign languages in daily settings is more often based on the emphasis of national identity. The findings also suggest that while for the respondents in the smaller town chosen for this study, a standard Lithuanian speaker was an ultimate example of a successful person, the respondents in the capital city saw an American speaker of Lithuanian as the most prosperous individual.","['Sociolinguistics', 'Identity', 'Accent', 'Attitudes', 'Lithuanian language']"

The Impact of Hong Kong on Margaret Thatcher's Racist Vietnamese Refugee Policy,"Popovic, Pavle Luka","['Glynn, I.A.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (MA),Master thesis,en,"This dissertation explains why the British government, in 1979, resettled Sino-Vietnamese refugees regardless of Margaret Thatcher’s initial inhospitableness towards them. Based on original research conducted in the United Kingdom’s National Archives, the dissertation’s findings are used to engage with academic debate on who and what directs refugee policy change. Thatcher’s hostility towards the Sino-Vietnamese refugees is uncovered to be due to personal racism and a fear of restrictive public opinion. Her views were formed by decades of animosity towards black and minority ethnic immigration in Britain by politicians and parts of the public. Meanwhile, Britain’s decision to relocate the refugees is discovered to be a consequence of territoriality. Hong Kong was, at the time, a British colony and Britain’s eventual involvement in the Indochinese crisis was to aid Hong Kong’s own refugee crisis. After the analysis, case studies of other refugee groups are used to make comparisons with the Sino-Vietnamese. These studies prove that legislation can influence refugee policy whilst international pressure and politics are proven to only guarantee success to nation-states that have strong international powers.","['Thatcher', 'Racism', 'Policy', 'Vietnamese', 'Refugee', 'Asylum', 'Seeker']"
Prosodisch oefenmateriaal voor Lorre,"Meijs, Jennifer","['Caspers, Johanneke']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Linguistics (MA),Master thesis,nl,"Throughout the years a lot of research has been done on the acquisition of pronunciation in a second language (L2). But on the other hand, relatively little research has been done regarding the acquisition of pronunciation of Dutch as a second language (Neri, Cucchiarini & Strik, 2006). In addition there is also relatively little knowledge on how pronunciation can be trained by means of education or pronunciation training. Research by Anderson-Hsieh, Johnson and Koehler (1992) showed that especially the prosodic features of a language (e.g. aspects such as melody, loudness and tempo) determine whether a L2-speaker sounds “foreign”. The (international) literature suggests that there has been minimal attention on the acquisition of the pronunciation of a L2 in language classes. In some cases, it is assumed that language teachers have too little knowledge to train pronunciation systematically. Leiden University has been working on a solution to this problem by the development of modern technology, namely the computer program Lorre. This is a computer program, developed within Leiden University, which helps L2-learners train their pronunciation and also supplies with visual feedback. It is desired to expand this program with new language training material. My research explores the possibilities concerning extensions of the computer program Lorre and will focus on the prosodic level of pronunciation. In this thesis I investigated what kind of exercises can be implemented in Lorre to train prosodic features of Dutch as a second language. My research hypothesis is that many aspects of pronunciation can cause problems for L2 learners of Dutch and that it is possible to develop exercises to train all aspects of prosody. My goal was to examine the (international) literature to determine what prosodic problems occur when learning Dutch as a second language. Subsequently I developed practical exercises suitable to implement in Lorre.","['Prosodie', 'Prosodisch oefenmateriaal', 'klemtoonoefenmateriaal', 'Lorre']"

However, the same cannot be said of their French counterparts: oui? non? n’est-ce pas? and hein?. In order to find the interpretative differences between those four tags, we decided to examine the matrix sentences they could combine with. We argued that the incompatibilities of these tags with certain matrix sentences were caused by their intrinsic differences. With that in mind, we used various tests to determine those differences. We found that the polarity distribution within the tag question played an important part in their interpretation. That is, tag questions with reversed polarity (positive matrix, negative tag or vice-versa) clearly conveyed a meaning of doubt on the speaker’s part, whereas those with constant polarity hardly showed any uncertainty at all. We claimed that oui?, a tag that only occurs in constant polarity questions, expresses the dominance of the speaker over the hearer, by means of orders, rhetorical questions and questions that are strongly biased towards a positive answer. Furthermore, we hypothesized that hein? expresses neither doubt nor dominance, which distinguishes it from the other tags we discussed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Au fil des années, les tags interrogatifs en anglais (isn’t it ? wouldn’t they ? right ?) ont reçu beaucoup d’attention dans la littérature scientifique. Cependant, cela n’est pas vrai pour les tags interrogatifs en français : oui ?, non ?, n’est-ce pas ?, et hein ?. Afin de mieux cerner les différences interprétatives entre ces tags, nous avons examiné les matrices avec lesquelles ils se combinaient. Nous avons avancé que les différences intrinsèques entre les tags provoquent leurs différences de compatibilité. Aussi avons-nous employé différents tests dans l’objectif de mieux comprendre ces différences. Nous avons trouvé que la distribution de polarité dans la question-reprise joue un rôle important dans son interprétation. C’est-à-dire, les questions-reprise de polarité inversée (une matrice positive, un tag négatif ou vice-versa) indiquent un certain degré de doute de la part du locuteur, tandis que celles de polarité constante n’expriment aucun sentiment de doute. Nous avons proposé que oui ?, qui ne figure que dans les contextes de polarité constante, exprime la domination du locuteur par rapport à son interlocuteur. Cette domination se manifeste par des injonctions, des questions rhétoriques et des questions présuppositionnelles. Finalement, nous avons formulé l’hypothèse que hein ? n’exprime ni le doute ni la domination, ce qui le distingue des autres tags que nous avons discutés.","['tag question', 'French', 'question-reprise', 'oui?', 'non?', ""n'est-ce pas?"", 'hein?', 'polarity', 'discourse']"
The Performing Identity of the Canary Islands: Amazigh Heritage Influences in the Artistic Production,"García, Davinia","['Merolla, Daniela']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The presence of indigenous heritage elements in all the various domains is a hardly avoidable fact in the Canary Islands. The ideological discourses from moderated nationalism to pro-independence perspectives, justify the attention towards “the noble indigenous past”. These political discourses help preserve traditional customs and celebrations in a process referred to as “folklorization”. This is mainly accomplished by turning the indigenous past into museums and ethnographic parks. Similarly,the Canarian moderate nationalism has become the main political force in the archipelago in the recent history of the Spanish democracy. While being for over 20 years in power, the nationalistic party Coalición Canaria has been able to build an identity discourse based on what Estévez called the indigenous patrimonization. The government has been offering funds to support the scientific research, the patrimony management and the encyclopaedic volumes on “Canarian themes” with didactic purposes, all of which have elicited an emotional legitimacy of the above-mentioned concepts. The patrimony management could also be considered as an important political and economical tool used to the re-creation, regulation and conservation of certain patrimonial elements of a culture that often occurs to the detriment of others. The experts’ view serves mostly as a filter through which material items of cultural patrimony are interpreted and regarded as valuable, while others are not. From the perspective of globalization, the protection of the historical patrimony can be interpreted as a resistance against the homogenization of social behaviors and consumption. However, tourists rather than the locals are the biggest consumers of this historical cultural patrimony. Thus, one could argue that it could have been created with the intention to satisfy the tourists’ demands (Estévez, 2004:16). On the one hand, a large part of the scientific community takes a stance against the indigenous heritage commercialization and its consumption by tourists and locals, based on the idea that such processes could undermine the intrinsic value of the indigenous heritage. On the other hand, the artists and their audiences continue to appreciate the value that is to be found in the indigenous imagination, as expressed in social situations when the audiences enjoy music and pottery inspired by the primal cultures of the first inhabitants of the Canaries. The concept of “folklorization” is tightly related to the general social interest of giving to the past a decisive role in the population’s destiny. This tendency provides the Canarian citizens a sense of feeling members of the same community/family and helps sculpt personality. In regard to the past generations, one can only use their remains to draw assumptions about the way they lived, but it is impossible to know exactly how they were and felt. In that sense, the museums assist in re-constructing the history according to scientific, political and ideological assumptions depending on the given historical period (Estévez, 2004:13). A consensual concern seems to exist in regard to preserving the traditions and conserving the cultural patrimony of the Canaries. However, the patrimony is selected through today’s lens. Hence, its preservation is linked to the current demands and uses of such cultural patrimony. In many cases, Estévez argues, the measures applied to classify what could be defined as patrimony, correspond to cost related and opportunistic criteria rather than scientific ones. Indeed there are many instances in the Canary Islands where the archaeology and patrimony management were interrelated with political purposes. In the present, a museum is meant to play a social function based on grounds of cultural democratization. Therefore, while visiting a museum, one expects a reflective and interactive exchange of contrasted scientific information provided to the public to draw their personal conclusions. However, when the explanations provided are too simple, obsolete or ideologically manipulated, the visitors are left with a feeling of confusion. This leads us to the argumentation that the proliferation of archaeological and ethnographical sites across the archipelago has not always been based on historical and archaeological motives, aiming to acquire a better understanding of the indigenous heritage of the Canaries. On the contrary, in most cases such proliferation has been based on economic profits, with tourists and also locals consuming their own patrimony at the cost of falsifying the history.","['The Canary Islands', 'guanche', 'Canarian identity', 'Canarian indigenous heritage', 'Amazigh heritage', 'Traditional pottery in the Canary Islands', 'Taburiente', 'Canarian nationalism', 'Imagined Community', 'Canarian pro-independence movement']"

De identiteit van de vrijkorpsen week op essentiële onderdelen af om van een gehele of gedeeltelijke voortzetting van identiteit te spreken die langs schakels in de tijd is voortgezet. De vrijkorpsen kunnen hierdoor niet aangemerkt worden als de voorhoede, voorlopers of herauten van het nazisme. Ondanks dit alles zijn de vrijkorpsen wel wegbereiders geweest voor de nazi’s en uiteindelijk het Derde Rijk. De vrijkorpsen hadden niet alleen een nieuwe dimensie toegevoegd aan het politieke geweld in Duitsland na 1918, waarmee de basis gelegd werd voor de latere brutalisering van de politieke cultuur in de Weimarrepubliek. Tevens hebben vrijkorpsen en vooral Baltikumer de politieke orde van de Weimarrepubliek stelselmatig ondergraven. De vrijkorpsen werden oorspronkelijk opgericht om in de woorden van Schleicher “voor de republiek te vechten”. Maar tijdens hun relatief korte bestaan hadden vrijkorpsen in de ‘Baltikum’ gemuit tegen de eigen regering en haar in een lastig parket gebracht met wat Noske correct betitelde als “luchtkastelen”. Vrijkorpsen, waaronder Baltikumer, waren ook betrokken geweest bij de reactionaire Kapp-Lüttwitz-putsch. Deze putsch was juist gericht tegen de republiek die de vrijkorpsen geacht werden te beschermen. De organisaties die uit de vrijwilligerseenheden voortkwamen bleven na de formele opheffing van de vrijkorpsen in juni 1920 de Weimarrepubliek met putschplannen en vooral politieke moorden bestrijden. Tot en met 1922 vonden er maar liefst rond de 350 moorden plaats die voor een groot deel werden gepleegd door de OC onder leiding van Hermann Ehrhardt. Ehrhardt was daarnaast betrokken geweest bij de oprichting van een voorloper van de SA en Roßbach stichtte Ortsgruppen van de NSDAP. Na de Hitler-putsch verdwenen de vrijkorpsen uit beeld, mede als gevolg van ‘de legale weg’ van Hitler. De romans en bijbehorende mythen over de vrijkorpsen holden de republiek later nog verder uit met uiteindelijk fatale consequenties door de komst van het Derde Rijk.","['Vrijkorpsen', 'nazi-Duitsland', 'NSDAP', 'Weimarrepubliek', 'Freikorps', 'Continuïteit', 'Baltikumer', 'Hitler']"
"""Une Chambre démocratique?"" Debates about the legitimacy of the Senate in the French Third Republic (1870-1914) In a comparative perspective with Belgium and The Netherlands","Stam, Wietse","['Velde, H. te']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,History (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"The French Senate is nowadays often presented by its critics as an institution that is conflicting with the principles of democracy. This raises questions about how this area of tension between democracy and the second chamber has emerged and evolved throughout the history of the French political system. Bicameralism seems contradictory to the French political culture because the republican doctrine strongly believed in a single assembly. This research focuses on the first half of the French Third Republic (1870-1914) and investigates to what extend the Senate was considered to be compatible with democracy. How was it possible that a Senate -an institution that seemed to have lost its place in the French political landscape and was associated with aristocracy and conservative liberalism- obtained a place in the institutional framework of this republic which was so democratic for its time? In general, historians have shown little interest in upper houses. However, this thesis argues that in order to get a complete picture of the reasons behind the evolution of democratic institutions it is not enough to merely study political theory or constitutional law; one should also look at the reality of political practice. In order to understand how important historical events and national context in France were in shaping the debate about the relation between the Senate and democracy, the French case is put in an international comparative perspective with the discussions that took place around the same period in Belgium and The Netherlands. This research demonstrates that the French Senate of the Third Republic was not constructed against democracy, or simply as the representation of conservative forces. It rather was a very inventive chamber that served the interest of the Republican Party, promoted democracy and played an important role in the political education of the French countryside and its integration into the French nation. Secondly, it is argued that discussions about the legitimacy of the French upper house were to a very large extend determined by historical circumstances -such as the Boulanger crisis and the Dreyfus affair-, political opportunism, pragmatism, and specificities in the national political culture.","['French Third Republic (1870-1914)', 'Senate', 'French politics', 'Democracy', 'Legitimacy', 'Comparative history', 'Belgium', 'The Netherlands', 'Parliament']"
"""It’s all in a name?” Modern Tribal Identity and Nation Building","Al Habsi, Hasina","['Ennis, C.A.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this study the research question: ‘What kind of implications has the new political openness in Oman towards the individual freedom of its citizens with regard to the choice of a marriage partner? Are answers through interviews with Omani citizens and a literary study? The effect of tribal structures and the idea of a ‘good tribe’ and a ‘good tribe’s name’ in Oman with regard to the choice of a marriage partner is the topic of this endeavor. This research focuses is the ‘modern, free’ marriage choice and what that means for young urban Omani. Especially the impact of thoughts about the tribal structure in Oman regarding the choice of a marriage partner leads the argument of this research. Semi-structured field interviews in Oman were conducted in order to provide insights into the minds of young, urban, educated and (mostly) economically well off individuals and couples. In Oman the choice of getting married is manifested by law. In theory, young couples can get married to whomever they want. However, in reality the marriage market is still divided in parts of society and people from different tribes don’t mix easily, due to the wishes to get married or to get their children married to someone that is part of a ‘good’ tribe. During the semi-structured field interviews the researcher got a glimpse of what people think about marriage in contemporary Oman. The results of the literary study and the fieldwork show how individuals and couples say on the one hand that everything has changed and on the other hand how important a good tribal name is. The results of the semi-structured field interviews show that the interviewees are clearly influenced by their families in their marriage choice, but some would exchange the good name for good fortune and choose someone who is affluent, instead of good tribe’s name. The ambivalence of modernity was noticeable during the interviews. On the one hand the interviewees indicated that they have the desire to marry whomever they want and on the other hand these interviewees indicated that they notice that the strong social matrix of tribal structures, which commend ‘a good tribal name’ exists and can be a leading force in marriage choice. The most important finding of this research is the awareness among Omanis that the free choice is present ‘on paper’ and people know, they could marry freely, but the reality is different and the idea of a tribe and the belonging to one, is more important in an era of social transition than the researcher anticipated beforehand. The citizens try to be ‘good Omanis’ in a modern nation with a strong cultural heritage, which they cherish. The social order is something that is reflected in the interviews. The answers of the interviewees clearly show the social and cultural hierarchy in Omani society, when they talk about future in-laws or relatives. It can be concluded that more research is needed about the impact of modern tribal structures and the thought of a ‘good name’ within these structures. Furthermore, the impact of the tribal culture on young couples who like to get married exogamic or even without the consent of their parents or other elderly advisers should be investigated. Also, further research could explore the concept op ‘romantic love in times of social media’, a topic that has emerged out of the conversations with the interviewees, that often took place after the recording of the actual interview stopped. Further quantitative and qualitative research is recommended to look into the ways a society is changing rapidly and with this, the thoughts about marriage and identity.",
Branding Emotion: The Auteur Cinema Of Michel Gondry Between Short and Feature Film,"Griemert, Asbirg","['Hesselberth, Pepita']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Media Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis investigates the auteur cinema of Michel Gondry and describes how its special “tone” is connected to the branding of emotion. The broad work of cross-media auteur Michel Gondry contains short and feature films. In order to stress the role of short films within Gondry’s oeuvre and to highlight the connecting motifs five short films and two feature films were analyzed from the point of view of an auteur theory in transition. In the chapter one of the thesis, Gondry’s work is discussed, respectively, against the backdrop of the classic auteur theory of the 1950s (Truffaut, Sarris), the discourses on the “death of the auteur” of the 1960s and ‘70s (Bazin, Foucault), and, finally, the revival of auteur theory from the 1980s and ‘90s onwards, with Andrew and Corrigan, who claim that the auteur is not dead, but has become a marketing tool. In the second chapter, I have then fleshed out the different motifs that establish Gondry as an auteur (in different senses of the word), stipulating the continuity between his short and feature length films. In the third and final chapter, I draw on the work of MacDowell and Shaviro to elaborate on how the “tone” or “sensibility” of Gondry’s movies set him up as the new “homo oeconomicus” (Shaviro), for whom emotions are resources to invest. It becomes clear how Gondry creates himself as seemingly romantic auteur and in so doing brands “his emotions” to gain return.","['Michel Gondry', 'Auteur Theory', 'Quirky cinema', 'Motif', 'Marketing']"

Playing with the big boys?,"Dalen, G.C. van","['Gerrits, A.M.W.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis explored the lobbying dynamics of under resourced interest groups. An interest group is considered fully under resourced when it lacks sufficient financial and other organisational resources and policy-relevant information, has limited access to policy makers and does not represent stakeholders of political or economic importance. To assess how being under resourced affects the choice and effectiveness of lobby strategies, a literature review was combined with a case study. Little has been written about under resourced lobbying in particular. The current literature does, however, provide insights about the effect of resource dependencies on lobbying dynamics. Resource dependency, niche and influence theory explain how resources are essential for lobbyists to stay in business and to gain influence and thus affect their behaviour. The case study of the lobbying process of the European Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) association UEAPME made it evident that being under resourced affects the behaviour and chances to get influence of interest groups. Because studying the role of under resourced interest groups provides insights about the democratic legitimacy of the political system of the EU, the author recommends doing further research on the topic.","['Lobbying', 'EU', 'Small and medium enterprises', 'resource dependency', 'niche theory']"

Zelfdoding onder jongeren in Japan: de relatie tussen risicofactoren en preventiemaatregelen,"Mostert, Aline","['Herber, E.D.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Japanstudies (BA),Bachelor thesis,nl,"Zelfdoding onder jongeren tussen de 15 en 29 jaar in Japan is een sociaal probleem dat recentelijk meer aandacht krijgt van nationale en internationale instanties. Om effectieve zelfdodingspreventiemaatregelen te kunnen creëren is het van belang dat deze aansluiten bij de risicofactoren die de persoon aanzet tot zelfdoding. In deze scriptie is de relatie tussen de risicofactoren voor zelfdoding onder jongeren in deze leeftijdsgroep en de door de overheid bedachte preventiemaatregelen onderzocht. Eerst is de stand van zaken omtrent zelfdoding onder deze groep omschreven. Daarna zijn de verschillende risicofactoren uitgelicht. Vervolgens zijn deze vergeleken met een uiteenzetting van de preventiemaatregelen. Ten slotte is er antwoord gegeven op de onderzoeksvraag en zijn aanbevelingen gedaan voor volgend onderzoek. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat voor deze groep meerdere risicofactoren van toepassing zijn en dat het merendeel behandeld word door de overheid. Hierbij is echter gebleken dat meerdere factoren die ontbreken, namelijk academische druk, zelfmutilatie, soa’s, drugsgebruik en informatie via kranten niet behandeld zijn in de preventiemaatregelen.","['zelfdoding', 'zelfmoord', 'jongeren', 'jeugd', 'risicofactoren', 'preventiemaatregelen', 'sociologie']"

The Muslim Brotherhood and the Institution of Ambiguity,"Witteveen, René","['Berger, Maurits']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"This thesis describes the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood’s ideological ambiguities embedded within the group’s political discourse and its ideological development since Hosni Mubarak’s presidency, on the topic of the nature of the state. Whilst originally rejecting liberal democratic values and a secular state altogether, the Brothers have since the 1980’s gradually adopted those values within their Islamist framework, and started participating in Egyptian politics. However, this approach led to significant ideological ambiguities on a number of central issues, such as the source of political authority (people or God?) and the role of shari’a (Islamic law) in society. By thorough analysis of the Brotherhood’s post-Mubarak political discourse on these issues, as well as taking into account government-Brotherhood relations, the Brotherhood’s internal dealings, and nationwide events, the writer contends that the Brotherhood’s ideological ambiguities remained firmly in place into the post-Mubarak era, hampering its ability to be a successful political actor in a post-Mubarak Egypt.","['Muslim Brotherhood', 'Islamism', 'Islamist political discourse', 'Arab Spring', 'Mubarak', 'Discourse Analysis', 'Frame Analysis']"
The Bolsa Família and how it has been making a difference in the lives of women in Brazil (2003-2014),"Verhees, Sóphia","['Wiesebron, Marianne']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Studies (BA),Bachelor thesis,en,"During the mid-1990s, several Latin American countries became acquainted with conditional cash transfer programs (CCT’s). These government-financed programs provide cash grants to impoverished families, on the condition that they fulfil health- and education-related conditionalities (Lomelí, 2008: 476). The Brazilian government has been operating its Bolsa Família Program (BFP) since 2003. It is the CCT program with the highest amount of grantees worldwide (De Brauw et al,. 2013: 488). Cash grants are handed out to female grantees of the BFP (De Brauw et al., 2013: 487). The research of this thesis will focus on the question in how far the BFP has an impact on female empowerment. The first chapter will be centred on an academic debate of the concepts of empowerment and specifically female empowerment. Moreover, CCT programmes in general will be defined, as well as their pros, cons and their link to female empowerment. The second chapter will place the BFP within the wider, historical perspective of social assistance and earlier CCT programs in Brazil. Firstly, a concise history of the first social assistance initiatives and the first federal initiative will be provided. Then, the focus will lie on how the federal constitution of 1988 has broken with the old views on social assistance, and how it made social protection a right to the most vulnerable citizens of the state, such as the elderly and the disabled. Third, the social assistance schemes initiated by the Cardoso administration will be discussed. Finally, a brief summary of the social assistance schemes under the Lula government, including the BFP, will be provided. The third chapter will consist of a case study about the effect of the implementation of the BFP on female empowerment. The case study will discuss whether the BFP has contributed to an increased level of self-esteem of female beneficiaries, a positive effect on the social life of female beneficiaries, a positive effect on intra-household relations, an increased level of citizenship of female beneficiaries, a change of the traditional gender roles, and a positive effect on the decrease of the gender gap.","['brazilian government policy', ""conditional cash transfer programs (CCT's)"", 'female empowerment']"
"Indonesian popular music and identity expressions: Issues of class, Islam and gender","Sekewael, Roos","['Henley, David']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (60 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"In this thesis I will research how young Indonesians express their identities or how they create new identities in the period from the 1990s until today and I will examine this through forms of Indonesian popular music. Popular music is an important site of cultural struggle and can reveal much about class, gender and other social divisions. That is why I want to zoom in on these social divisions by dividing them in class, religion and gender, to see how each of them relates to popular music and identity formation. I choose to focus on class, religion and gender because these have undergone drastic and interesting transformations during the period I want to examine, allowing people to reconsider their place or someone else’s in the social ladder, as a religious person or as a woman or man in society. Popular music and the way people consume it can reveal a lot about people’s thoughts and conceptions on class, religion and gender in contemporary Indonesia. The period from the 1990s until the present knew for example a remarkable growth of the Indonesian middle class who adopted a consumerist lifestyle and wanted to set themselves apart from the lower class, using popular music among other things. Concerning religion, I will focus on the developments of Islam in Indonesia, the religion of roughly 90% of the country's population. The fall of Suharto has been a significant turning-point for religious expression, because for much of the New Order, Islam was marginalized especially in the political sphere and Islamic organizations were restricted. After 1998, Indonesian Muslims could express themselves more freely, leading to an amplified process of Islamization which includes the creation of new Islamic political parties, the rise of radical Islam and the expression of religious identities in public that could not be expressed before, particularly extremist ones. Moreover, in the 21st century Muslim pop culture has flourished immensely and popular music has helped in the process of articulating religious identity. Finally, issues of gender, including for example femininity, masculinity and the role of women in the family have become a more prominent subject of discussions and debates in the past two decades. Women's rights groups and opinions about feminism have more political support than before, but so has (conservative) Islam. This leads to diverse opinions about popular female artists who are regarded as a role model to some and an actor of immorality to others. Popular music is a strong medium to spur debates about gender and to introduce new images of how young men and women can, or should, dress and behave. Consequently, this makes young Indonesians rethink and possibly reshape their gender identities.","['Indonesia', 'pop music', 'contemporary Indonesia', 'dangdut', 'nasyid', 'gender', 'Islam', 'identity']"
"It’s the Economy, Stupid! The De-Politicised Discourse of Economic Crisis","Staunton, Bethany","['Black, Lindsay']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,International Relations (MA),Master thesis,en,"When questioned about the European Union’s (EU) austerity policy in Europe’s ongoing debt crisis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel responded that the term ‘austerity’ ""makes it sound like something truly evil. […] I call it balancing the budget”. This quote highlights the paradox that is the central thematic concern of this thesis: how economic issues and policies are represented as objectively-determined technical concerns, abstracted from and unrelated to political and ideological disputes. This thesis aims to relate the critical study of political discourse in economic crisis to a critique of the dominant social perception of economics as a scientific study: ‘scientific’ in the positivist sense as being founded upon empirical analysis, exclusive of ideational or normative dimensions. Influenced by the Gramscian concept of ‘cultural hegemony’ and related critical theories of discourse, I argue that the hegemonic scientific representation of economics - in political, media and academic discourses - constitutes an important subject for critical analysis because of its correlation with the de-politicisation of economics.","['Discourse', 'Economic crisis', 'Critical theory', 'Cultural hegemony', 'Greek debt crisis', ""'Troika'"", 'Economics discipline', 'Critical epistemology']"

Betrayed By Nuclear Power: Transforming the Community and Collective Memory of Fukushima’s Evacuees,"Sint Nicolaas, Nick","['Ezawa, Aya']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Asian Studies (120 EC) (MA),Master thesis,en,"At the time of writing almost five years have passed since Japan's triple disaster on March 11th 2011, when an earthquake triggered a tsunami which in turn triggered a nuclear crisis. With the initial shock having passed, how are people looking back at it? How have the tragic events that transpired settled into history, into national consciousness, into victims’ personal memories? Although on the grander national and global scales 3.11 is all but forgotten and being digested in the background, for most of the victims this disaster is still affecting daily life in numerous ways. The question this thesis focuses on is: What exactly has been disrupted through this disaster on a social level; how do communities and individuals that have been abruptly uprooted by a nuclear disaster cope; how do they reconstruct their collective and individual memories and identities; and how do they reframe nuclear energy, something that initially brought them prosperity but eventually led to them losing their homes indefinitely. This thesis analyzes the case of a specific uprooted nuclear host community, using documentary films as source material. The following discussion shows that a firmly rooted and once proud community has all but fallen apart, and their entire shared narrative, central to their collective identity, is shattered. Individual cases prove that there are many different ways in which memory is bound to either a place, people, or objects. Where the highest importance is placed is an individual issue that depends on the person and the context, and how flexible they deem their own identity. As a result some evacuees move on and some remain with the core community, hoping to return to their hometown someday, even though it seems unlikely to be possible within their lifetime. Further links between individuals and collective memory are discussed.","['Japan', 'Disaster', 'Fukushima', 'Recovery', 'Nuclear Power', 'Community', 'Collective Memory', 'Evacuees', 'Tsunami', 'Earthquake']"
Article 475: Forced Marriage Forces Change - A Narrative,"Dahl, Michelle","['Nalbantian, T.']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,Middle Eastern Studies (MA),Master thesis,en,"The pursuit to acquire women’s rights in Morocco has been a decades long quest. Activists and advocates for broader civil rights have been very visible in the news, in different movements and wide spread protests. These efforts have taken place long before the death of a sixteen year-old girl, Amina Filali, who committed suicide after being forced to marry her rapist in March 2012. The desire for reform happened before the change in 2004 in the moudawana, the family legal code. Additional pressures for reform were exerted after this change in 2004. This activism has continued to take place between the implementation of the moudawana in 2004 and the death of Amina Filali, However, the suicide of Amina Filali was a singular and pivotal moment that brought the various activists groups together serving as an unrelenting catalyst for change. Amina Filali’s suicide united the protest voices as never before and with heightened scrutiny Article 475 of the Moroccan Penal Code was repealed. Amina Filali became the ‘poster child’ for the repeal of Article 475 after her suicide. It was circulated that Amina consumed rat poison in order to commit suicide. After her suicide, a narrative developed and became the widespread assumption that she had committed suicide because she had been forced to marry the man that raped her. Amina Filali was an individual with her own story, but in that moment in time her story was utilized by the coalition of women’s rights advocates. The story of Amina was proclaimed at protests and visible in the news, both within Morocco and internationally. Her tragedy was used to help push the groups’ certain agenda. The agenda was to repeal Article 475. The narrative of Amina’s death was a remarkable tool in gaining attention and unity for various voices including NGOs, human rights activists and political parties. The timeline between her death and the actual repeal demonstrates that she served as the instrument of change.","['Morocco', 'Gender', 'Legal Code', 'Article 475']"

"""Home is always home"". (Former) Street Youth in Blantyre, Malawi, and the Fluidity of Constructing Home","Hendriks, Tanja","['Wels, Harry', 'Dijk, Rijk van']",2016,Faculty of Humanities,African Studies (research) (MA),Research master thesis,en,"For many Malawians the concept of home is strongly associated with the rural areas and one’s (supposedly rural) place of birth. This ‘grand narrative about home’, though often reiterated, doesn’t necessarily depict lived reality. Malawi’s history of movement and labor migration coupled with contemporary rapid urbanization makes that the amount of people whose lives do not fit this grand narrative, is increasing fast. In the current context of extreme poverty, destitution and devastation – the latter due to the flash floods of January 2015 – slum areas in Blantyre city are growing and so is the number of street children and youth. Some of them are taken in by organizations such as the Samaritan Trust; a street children shelter. This program aims at taking street youth home by ‘reintegrating’ them in their (rural) communities. When asked, the majority of (former) street youth adhere to the grand narrative and state their home to be in a rural village. Yet at the same time, this home is a place they intentionally left and do not wish to (currently) return to. Hence they are generally depicted as ‘homeless’. I wondered: how do (former) street youth in Blantyre, Malawi, engage with ‘the grand narrative about home’ in trying to imagine their ‘becoming at home’ in the city? My thesis departs from the idea that (the search for) home is an integral part of the human condition. During eight months of ethnographic fieldwork in Blantyre, Malawi, I used qualitative methods – mainly interviews and participant observation – to come to an understanding of the meaning of home for (former) street youth. Some of them, the street girls, currently reside at Samaritan Trust and the former street youth are boys who formerly resided there. Their home-making practices in relation to a marginalized socio-economic position in an overall challenging economic context point towards more fluid and diverse constructions of home that exist alongside the grand narrative without rendering it obsolete. Under pressure, (former) street youth paradoxically attempt to solidify home – even though home remains fluid in practice. These attempts assist in coping with life in liquid modernity while they are at the same time fraught with contradictions, especially when these solidifications are themselves solidified in policies. These policies subsequently hamper (former) street youth’s becoming at home in town by following the grand narrative and thus confining their homes to rural areas. I conclude that home can best be seen as a fluid field of tensions (re)created in the everyday, thus leaving space for both (former) street youth’s roots and routes. An alternative way in which (former) street youth try to become at home in the city is by searching for a romantic partner to co-construct this (future) home with.","['Home', 'Malawi', 'Street children', 'Youth', 'Liquid Modernity', 'Being at home in the world', 'Love', 'Urbanization']"

The negotiations were held in 2004 and 2005 between the U.S. and the Andean countries. This resarch focuses on Peru and an attempt is made to assess whether and to what extent the Peruvian government succeeded in balancing the demands of the U.S. government with those of Peruvian civil society and the Peruvian government’s desire to enter into a trade agreement with the U.S.. From examining Peruvian government reports on the agriculture, labour matters and textiles tables it was found that the government at times found its Andean partners to be delaying the negotiations and rather continued bilaterally. Furthermore, evidence was found that the Peruvian government, at least on paper, attempted to represent the interests of the large majority of the Peruvians. To what extent it has succeeded in doing so has been difficult to assess given that the present research is largely based on official government documents. Further research, employing non-governmental Peruvian sources and (official) U.S. documentation on the negotiations, is needed to come to a fuller understanding of the starting positions of both governments and how much each party had given in to the demands of the other.","['Peru', 'U.S.', 'Dependency theory', 'Free Trade Agreements', 'PTPA', 'negotiations']"

A Standard Model has been developed to unite and operationalize its major principles. However, this is still largely a theoretical model. As of yet, not much empirical testing “in the wild” has been carried out with it. This thesis particularly goes into one aspect of the Standard Model: the concept of counterintuitivity. This concept states that in order for a religious idea to be remembered and transmitted it should not be too common, but not too strange either. By applying the concept of counterintuitivity to the ancient author Artemidorus of Daldis, the aim of this thesis is twofold. On the one hand, it will establish whether this concept from the Standard Model in its current (mostly theoretical) form is indeed applicable to data outside empirically controlled environments. On the other hand, it will help us to get a clearer view on Artemidorus’ method for interpreting dreams.","['Cognitive science of religion', 'Artemidorus of Daldis', 'Oneirokritika', 'Counterintuitivity']"

Relying on a qualitative case study of three corporations in South Africa, the results show that the conception of CSR amongst South African UNGC participants differs from the ten principles. The author argues that to facilitate responsible business on a global scale, the UNGC should not seek to impose its ‘universal’ standards but rather utilize its broad network to come to multiple CSR standards which are attentive to local contexts.
